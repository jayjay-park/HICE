She used it on things she thought were best for you.Its not like she blew your money on drugs and alcohol something for herself or some other stupid thing.  It was your money and she spent it on things for you.  Maybe she thought at  with your own money coming in from jobs and state allowance that you should be paying for your own activities.  Maybe she doesnt want you to have a PC.  Maybe she thought you knew  hell maybe she even told you and you werent listening or misunderstood.  Who knows.

101409,0,t3_1v9a51,I dont think this can truly be called an infatuation thats getting butterflies in your stomach.  This sounds like it has become an obsession and an unhealthy on at that since it is preventing you from living the kind of life you want to have ie. moving on and meeting someone new.  This isnt about if youre going to find a girl like her again because truth is you dont know her.  You may feel like you do but given that you havent spent time talking to her in the context of an actual relationship or friendship means that you dont know this girl.  You only know the version of her that lives in her head which is partially made up of her  the things you know about her and your own imagination which has filled in the gaps.  And as you said because youve never really talked to her the gaps are many.  So she is mostly a creature of your own creation. So if its not about this actual girl what is it about?  I think thats going to be an important question for you to figure out the answer to.  You have to be getting something out of this obsession or your brain wouldnt be doing it.  Is it a sense of security like if you have this idea of her you dont have to risk it with real girls in the real world who could hurt you? Maybe not.  Maybe it has to do with boredom.  Maybe the obsession of a form of entertainment.  Maybe she represents something to you  youth innocence or something else.  Only you know what you are getting out of this obsession but if you can figure that out you can figure out healthier ways of meeting that need than this. What is clear is that what started out an innocent high school crush is now interfering with your life and so if you cant figure it out on your own there is no shame in asking for help so you can move on. ,Advice,cepz5rp,3,t5_2qjdm

279017,0,t1_cf9noba,Theres a couple things going on here. One is that its an unfortunate stereotype of guys that lets them off the hook for wedding planning. But even if he doesnt care about flowers he still needs to be caring about you. So the first thing is that you two need to get on the same page about what you want what you value whats important in terms of your cultural traditions and whats important in terms of establishing yourselves as a couple and validating your commitment. From there you can work from a position of equality and strength and practice saying No that doesnt work for me in the mirror a few times before using it on your relatives. To some extent it sounds like the overall problem is the judgmental and controlling nature of your relatives not the wedding specifically. You may have given off the signal of I dont care and now they are planning your wedding to the standards that will give them the best memories. Is that what you want? Although its possible that their relatives did the exact same thing to them when they were engaged and now its their turn to control things. Its not uncommon. Bottom line you two need to decide what you want and then stick by it and make it happen. You cannot change their reactions to your choices or nonchoices and there is nothing at all you can do to affect them. Nothing except stand up for yourself. Its not a question of you being satans spawn or an antibridezilla or whatever just that you are making the decision to care more about what they say and think and feel than about what you and your future husband want. All I know is I have an old wedding dress I hated to wear but bought because everybody liked it and a box of wedding photos I hate to look at because the photographer was doing a favor and everything looks awful and flowers that looked horrible because I wanted one thing but got overruled and basically hated everything about my wedding except for you know the whole marriage part.

392822,0,t3_1ykgcx,It seems like youre very much against drug use. So Im not gonna necessarily agree with the other commenter and say smoke weed because for whatever reason you dont like it you dont like the culture... whatever. Drugs are not all bad. They give and they take. The feelings they provide arent false just because theyre chemically induced. But they have a host of problems and plenty of people ruin their lives with them. Some are much worse than others. Some are relatively benign. But regardless...if youre vividly against them then thats how it is.Heres my question. What are you doing dating a  year old college student if youre worried about these things? On top of that youre trying to kinda control her life which isnt a sound choice in preserving an equal relationship. Your girlfriend is an adult. She can do what she wantsand she has to live with the consequences.

That probably isnt what you were looking for but the larger point is that you arent just raising a daughter you are raising your daughter.  I cant tell you what the best type of dad would be for her because I am not her.  All I can tell you is what kind of parenting would have worked best for me. So know your kid.  Be the kind of man you would like to see her with if she is straight.  Be kind and patient always.  Treat the women around you the way you would like to see your daughter treated.  Its not so much examples of what to donot do but really its about becoming a full person yourself.  You are going to exemplify what it means to be an adult in the world.  She will watch your interactions.  She will note how you get when you are angry or frustrated. She will notice how you act in social situations uncomfortable situations and when times are great.  You do not have to be perfect.  In fact you wont be.  But let those imperfect moments show your daughter how an adult handles mistakes and bounces back. To me a perfect father would be one who was powerful but in control of his power.  Mythologicaly the animus is the male energy the doer the old wise one who rows us across the River in his boat.  The best example of fathering Ive ever witnessed hands down was a friend named Al.  Al and a bunch of families were over for a BBQ.  Kids running around everywhere adults chatting and joking over beer and ribs.  I was sitting next to an empty chair and Al when a little one ran up and tried to get into the empty seat.  She was very tiny and struggling to get in the chair.  I leaned forward to pick her up and sit her down but Al saw me and said No mate.  Just hold the chair. Just hold the chair.  Let her struggle to get up there but make sure the legs wont fall out from under her.  That to me is PARENTING.   ,Advice,cfmtu8w,6,t5_2qjdm

I find this helps me configure my goals save money and just enjoy being alone for a bit. When Im in this mode I often throw out the Im so flat out this week! I dont feel this is dishonest as there is no need to say I just dont want to have your company this week. If your friend is consistently disappointing you by offering to support you in things and bailing all the time that is not okay and its probably a good idea to talk maybe face to face would be better. My total honest opinion just based on the info provided by the texts is that you are being needy and throwing out accusations that are more likely to push your friend away than draw her in. A better way to approach this especially if this is not a recurring problem of her blowing you off all the time is an honest text about what ypu would like to do saying something like   I miss hanging out with you. Feeling a bit lonesome and would love a catch up in the next few days if you can. Coffee on Saturday afternoon? Or lets go... do that thing your friend likes to do.

I think it is incredible that you had the courage to explain how you are feeling with complete honesty. With regards to your friends I highly suggest not putting a ton of stock into obtaining new friends because high school is just a completely different animal. I only had about  friends in high school but they were my very best friends. They were always there for me and I would never trade my relationships with them for many friendships with the popular crowd. In regards to your mom I would definitely consider talking to her about how you feel. I know you think that you are putting a burden on her by talking to her about your problems but I can guarantee you that you taking your life when you could have talked with her would be the worst thing that she could ever experience. I find it so sad that kids who choose to end their lives feel like they have nobody to talk to because those close to you would much rather talk things out with you on Earth rather than trying to reconcile with themselves why you left when you are gone. Get rid of those thoughts because life is too precious to be taken away in a single situation where you feel trapped. I could go into a million different stories where people close to me went through some tough times growing up and they ended up turning out extremely well despite their struggles. I can easily see you looking back at this stage of your life when you are older and thinking man Im glad I listened to these peoples advice and talked things over with my mom life is so much sweeter on the other side of the darkness.

732636,0,t3_22jw64,Be very cautious about dropping everything youve done so far for the entertainment industry.  For starters the  areas you mentioned are  very different roles in a production each requiring years of training and practice before real success.  Have you done any of these in the past?  For all I know you went to an elite performing arts high school and did each of these and excelled but if not you should do as much research as you can before you change your plans.  I dont know anything about breaking into the entertainment industry either but it cant be easy or everyone would do it.There are a number of things that are going on here so you should take time to carefully weigh your feelings.  First you should realize that most of what you will do in the real world bears little resemblance to school work.  You dont mention either your major or what you dislike about it but Id say theres a sizable chance that it wouldnt be nearly as bad as you think.  Ask some of your professors and call around to local businesses that deal with your area.  Most places would have at least one person who will give you some time in their day to ask questions about what its really like.Depending on the marketability of your degree and how broad the application it lends itself to you might end up in a completely different field than you planned but having the right degree will open doors for you.  If you majored in philosophy like I did and were planning on law school afterward philosophy being particularly good prep for law school then this doesnt apply.  But if you are only a year away from graduating with a marketable degree give serious thought to sticking it out and then getting creative with job opportunities rather than just give up now.  Are there other degrees that you are close to earning?  Did you minor in anything?  It wouldnt be great to start entirely over with a new degree after  years but you probably have a lot of your general education credits now so getting a degree in a different area while you are still positioned to make that transition easily could work.You might also be a bit burnt out and need a break.  It might be possible to take a semester or two off.  If you have money you could travel or if not just get a couple of part time jobs and work awhile.  Theres no requirement that you have to get your degree in the shortest time span theoretically possible.  Some time just working might help you get the clarity you need on what you want from life.  Im hearing my moms voice giving me advice about this kind of stuff so Ill pass along her two cents too Work is always work.  It can be easier some times and harder other times but it is always work.  No one is going to pay you to enjoy yourself.  The real meaning of life is to be happy.  Everyone knows that on some level but theres a lot of disagreement on how to really be happy.  I dont have the answer for that question.  If this field whatever it is will make you miserable then you should get away from it.  But dont make these kind of life decisions rashly.  Think about your options talk to your parents or older relatives and visit the counseling center at your school.  Give it time and thought and the answer will come to you.

I fostertemp home many animals also and have saved a lot of special needs animals its very important to pick someone with financial ability to full care for the animal. if you cant find anyone you can go to a vet usually and they can connect you to rescues and fosteradoption programs for special needs pets. animal control funding goes to paying for the care of these pets in these programs so there may be a fee and paperwork but its all for the pets benefit for the best care.,Advice,cgny0a6,1,t5_2qjdm

And consider the stress you would be under if you had a few bad months maybe you couldnt find a gig and people stopped getting lessons its too insecure.

Unless the bar specifically has a cocktail menu in which case choose something where you know you like the nonalcoholic ingredients dont order anything more complicated than liquor  mixer. If youre not used to drinking liquor remember that its stronger than beer and that you wont necessarily be able to taste just how strong a mixed drink is especially in really sugary drinks so be extra careful to pace yourself.Unless youre somewhere that specializes in wine and you have a chance to do winetasting or something its probably not worth it to drink wine.

912670,0,t1_ch80eio,Glad you can still seem some humor in the situation.  I think that perhaps you andor your wife have some misconceptions about the purpose of therapy.  Therapy is not where you go to be told how to fix your behavior or what you are doing wrong.  Therapy is where you go to figure out why you are upset about something.  The person that is getting upset is your wife and she is the one that needs to find the source of those problems. The source of those problems might be you or more specifically something that you are doing.  But she needs help identifying specifically what those causes are instead of using vague descriptions like you should be more romantic.Its great that you want to help and its great that you want to be a team mate.  Keep doing that.  But the issue is with how the very existence of your sex life is impacting your wife not how it is affecting you.  Youre only being impacted by the lack of a sex life as a secondary result of your wifes more predominant issue which is preventing her from participating in that sex life.The best thing you can do at this point is to be willing and eager to do anything possible to help.  Make this clear to your wife that you understand that this has been hard on her and you want to make things right again not just for the sake of your own sex life but for the sake of her happiness completely independent of your own.  Then find a therapist and explain the situation to himher.  And see what that therapist thinks would be most helpful.But again one last time... find a sex positive therapist.  There are therapists out there that will consider this a nonissue and determine well I guess you guys are done having sex forever.  You might need to shop around a bit in order to find one willing to treat this as the serious and solvable problem that it is.

Manly man and maybe dont like very much your kind of relationship with your mom . By seeing you going for your cousin similar to your mom he may think that his jealousy was right.That way he sees you as a perv and like the harm in that house so he reacts that way.Your sister maybe is being influnced by your father as she was more related to him cause your mom had only eyes for you while infants.So she reacts that way too.What I would have done?I would have felt suffocated by a mother like that so would have gone as far as possible from her. college or work is a good oportunity to build a life away from your home.Then while living alone you have all the responsabilities so you prioritize your relationships.I would have taken close contacts with my sister and her family and if I wouldnt have resisted the temptation would have banged secretly some times that cousinassuring she wont be telling to anyone.

To show her that I was willing to do anything it took for her she had a lot of trust issues from her past as many people do. My main goal at the point and idk why was me trying to make her realize how much I loved her. I knew she already knew that but I never took a different stand. I never tried to kiss her or asked her on dates it was always just poor me. And I look back and realize no matter how much she hurt me no matter how many flaws she had I could only see the good in her. Always. It seems my current girlfriends flaws stand out to me. More than her attributes. Shes a good person and I know that thats why Im stuck. I know the easiest and possibly the smartest idea would be to just forget the other girl but I cant ignore love. idk.    ,Advice,chvuxmx,0,t5_2qjdm

If youre in the same area as your family then you potentially would be better off in a different area that is not going to present so many triggersreminders of your pastopportunities to run into them. So talk to your psych about moving somewhere but I think from what youve written it would be best for you to SETTLE somewhere else. Maybe you can keep your psych appointments via Skype. I would also recommend talking to them about your appointment schedule  maybe you could see them more regularly? You pointed out yourself that running away is not the solution here  part of me knows I NEED to stay to continue therapy. But the other part of me is resorting to that whole run away to reinvent myself idea when the logical side of me knows that my internal struggles will not be far behind.My therapist says I have a tendency to run away from my problems ran away to the Army so Im aware of this habit. I completely understand that urge to get away and reinvent that youre feeling I do. Especially now that youre talking this stuff out and confronting all of those overwhelming feelings thatre so uncomfortable you just want to believe that if you were somewhere else you could really start fresh and put it all behind you. You already know that it doesnt work like that. Talk it all out with your psychologist. There are surely support groups in your area that can help you  I would personally recommend seeing if there are GROW meetings near you and Id imagine there must be PTSD support groups for former military? It might even be helpful for you to consider spending some time in a facility where you can get all the support possible. And if you have OCD I would see your general doctor or a psychiatrist to discuss medication options. Just please dont abandon your therapy. And I dont think its doing you any good to still be in contact with your family. I would also consult with somewhere that specialises in child abuse and consider reporting your stepfather to the authorities. Im sure you must have your reasons for not doing so already but it could help a lot to talk those out with someone with a lot of experience helping others whove been through similar situations.,Advice,cj2g7s9,2,t5_2qjdm

Initially you will want a small amount to cover incidentals such as blown tire minor car repair stuffetc.. Eventually and ideally you grow that till you have a minimum of six months bring home pay.  This covers you in the event that heaven forbid you loose your job.Next of course you budget for your all your bills. In my case I get paid on the st and the th.  Instead of focusing on paying the bills right about the due date I found it easier to determine which bills fell into which pay period and in some cases pay some earlier to try and balance the available totals i.e. instead of having  in bills due in first two weeks and  due the last two weeks I arranged the bills to make it a more even divide By paying all the bills on payday that are due in that time frame I was able to have a clearer picture of how much money was really left over.  Also due to automatically setting the  to go to savings I didnt see it therefore dont count for it being there as spendable money.  Now for those who have credit card debt this is another tactic I use with the remaining balance after bills are paid and money is allotted for savings gas food etc..  I take the remaining money and decide how much extra I could afford to put towards a bill.  I pay the minimum balance on all but one particular card that card I apply the extra bill money to.  I repeat this until the card is paid off. I then take that entire amount that I had been applying to that card and apply it additionally to the next card on top of its minimum payment.  Repeat the process as needed till you have paid off all your credit cards andor loans.  The trick here is to not say well that card is paid off so that frees up X amount of money that was going to that bill but rather to snowball that amount onto the next debt.  You will be surprised how fast you pay something off. As for your old spending habit set up a budget for it as well.  You give yourself a slush fund allowance.  you can either buy little whatever items each check or you can save that fund up and make a larger purchase. Either way you have saved for it and that is the ONLY money that you can apply to that item since the rest of your check is budgeted already.  Like others have said its all about repitition till it becomes normal to you. I do this with cell phones and everything.  My spouse wanted the latest cell phone recently and though we were due an upgrade I made him save up for it with his allowance. Sure we could have simply upgraded but we would have lost the upgrade eligibile discount Verizon offers to those who havent upgraded. which would have cost us more in the long run.,Advice,cj3du4v,3,t5_2qjdm

1725478,0,t3_2e7234,My advice would be to take them to a restaurant for dinner.Tell them its to thank them for all theyve done and insist youre paying for the meal.This allows you to establish yourself as an adult and also ensures they wont make a scene as other diners are nearby. It would also make a good time to mention youre happy to have them visit but due to your busy schedule now youre starting out on your career theyre gonna have to start calling ahead.Next time they show up unannounced tell them you wish theyd called because you already had plans and in fact youre just heading out. Then do just that.You want them to accept you as an adult. The best way to do that is to act like an adult  be calm unflappable and tell them how its going to be.If they invite you to dinner and it doesnt work with your schedule going forward suggest an alternative date and stick to it. The trick is not to see less of your parents the trick is to change the way they perceive you by changing the only variable you can influence  your reaction to them.It is very common for adults to revert to their childlike roles when theyre with their parents especially in their childhood home.

1834638,0,t3_2fj7uh,She sounds like shes a person with unrealistic expectations of love. Love isnt that right at the beginning feeling. Thats just the beginning stages. Its the opiate that gets us addicted to someone. Eventually as was stated you fall into routines you take each other for granted and you lose some of the fire of what made it seem so special at first.Real love comes when you get past those things and find ways around those obstacles together. Its being there for each other and finding ways to navigate those pitfalls as a team. Its shared experience and being comfortable enough with that other person to talk about these issues knowing that they wont judge you or push you or try to fix you but just listen and be there for you. It takes a LOT of hard work and compromise and it takes both of you being willing to change. Heres the rub  Shes not ready for that. She likes the easy part and she wants it to stay easy. Theres nothing you can really do about that. Shell never have a real lasting relationship until she understands these things and that could be years away. And this is going to be the hardest part Youre going to have to accept that none of that is your fault and just walk away. Find someone new. It doesnt have to be your soul mate if such a thing exists just someone whos company you enjoy who is as into you as you are to her. Im not trying to oversimplify this it will be difficult and youre going to be tempted to run to her the next time she has some kind of meltdown or crisis and she calls you to help her pick up the pieces and mark my words that will definitely happen but stay your course and move on with your life.I cant guarantee that anything Ive said is correct except for this last thing and its important. Not just because Im  sure its true but because it applies to your situationThere is no one right person for you there are many. Dont worry so much about letting someone go who may be the Ms. Right that it prevents you finding someone who definitely is Ms. Right.,Advice,cka9p1t,1,t5_2qjdm

1841299,0,t3_2fo29i,I agree with what ujordanofgoodnature says. Also if you have a friend who wants to go to the gym too then you can go together so that you both have a spotter for things like weights. To be honest weights are dangerous sometimes. If youre doing it wrong or dont have a spotter when you move up in weight you can injure yourself or drop the weights on yourself. Ive almost dropped the bench press on myself a couple times and having a spotter has stopped that from happening. Also look into some classestraining sessions at a gym so that you can learn exactly how to do things and if you take continual classestraining sessions then youd be supervised but it wouldnt be like adult supervision so much as coaching. If its not continual classes or training sessions then at least your parents would know that you know how to do stuff without getting hurt. Also look into rock climbing its similar to weight lifting in my opinion because it builds muscle without being an incredibly aerobic or dynamic activity. Plus for me it helped me learn to push my boundaries of comfort because Im scared of heights. Plus most rock climbing gyms have weights sections too. Id advise starting out with just bouldering because its lower to the ground so you dont need ropes or harnesses or another person though a spotter is good and its a very fun sport to do socially. ,Advice,ckb2n4g,2,t5_2qjdm

You should point out that youd really like to give her oral if thats something that shes interested in and add that it would be a little easier for you if her hair were a bit shorter. Make it clear that youre fine with her doing whatever she wants to do. A really good way to ease into the conversation would be to start by asking her what shed prefer your grooming habits to be for example maybe shed want you to stop shaving your pubes. Then you have a good reason to voice your opinions about her habits. Just be very clear that this has nothing to do with aesthetic and also make it clear that you dont think this is something shes obligated to do.

2051533,0,t3_2ibdje,I really doubt that theyd be able to pin you as a suspect. If they do itd be because of a hair on her sheets. If you exclusively took underwear from her laundry hamper and not her bed I think youll be okay. The police if they do bother investigating rapes are very difficult to prove particularly in this situation where it typically devolves into hesaid shesaid and theres essentially no proof either way are going to be more interested in the bed sheets and what she was wearing at the time as well as any physical evidence on her body like bruises and fluids.Ive never heard of someone lifting fingerprints off fabric although I guess its possible. But again unless you went near her while she was sleeping I really doubt youre in any trouble. Theyll be looking for dead skin hair discarded clothing NEAR where Girl B was sleeping and wont go through her laundry since its not relevant to the case.I would also avoid coming clean with regards to your panty sniffing to the police because you should never as a rule ever ever ever volunteer information to the police. You might think youre being a good samaritan but plenty of people have gone to jail because of circumstantial evidence. In your case if you say something like Oh officer I went into her room this morning but it was totally to sniff her underwear hes going to assume youve just admitted to the crime. Its his job to assume worst case scenario so dont think hes gonna go aw this guy is just being helpful. If you want more information on why you should never talk to the police watch this Plus in this current social environment even the suggestion that you were involved in a rape is enough to crucify you so stand well clear and keep out of the way.And lastly let this be a wake up call for your fetish. I dont have any problem with it and dont think its pathetic at all and you mister should never ever ever degrade yourself by shaming yourself for it  I know youre scared and trying to put on a face for help by being pitiful but what you did was at its core nothing to be ashamed of but you should exercise more caution. Obviously you could never have seen this coming although girls being raped while drunk seems to be a growing problem in this country  or if not growing at least not diminishing but you might want to sit down and think long and hard about new ways to protect yourself if you ever find yourself in this position again. I would also admonish you regarding the violation of privacy your fetish inherently implies. If you have your own girlfriend and she knows thats one thing and consent can be easily acquired. But in this case you do not have the consent of the girls involved and you mus thave it before progressing any further. You need to be mindful of these girls privacy and autonomy when you seek to satisfy your urges. Just because they dont know doesnt mean that its okay much like taking someones money without them knowing isnt okay even if they dont notice the theft.

Moreover you can test for grades amp they need some quantifiable measure to go on even if they know its not the best one.

I personally think family members have an obligation to make themselves available to help and keep those lines open but they dont have an obligation to solve everyones problems.  You cant be that person because no one can. When I was talking about healthier food choices I simply meant when your home eat fresh fruits and veg and healthy meats in front of other people there but particularly the kids.  Offer only some of the time the kids what youre cooking not because its healthy just because its nice to share food.  If they turn their noses up at it oh well. Just let them see you cooking eating and enjoying healthier options.  You probably wont see any changes for the next year or two but you just might after that. Another nutrition peice is see if the boys are into sports and want to play them at school.  Their coaches can be a good push to get them to eat well so theyll be able to train better.  Sports in my opinion can be really motivating for children to preform better in school and take better care of themselves.  Thats a possible option. Take care. ,Advice,cleo3gr,1,t5_2qjdm

Most people dont get a job as a lawyer out of law school. Definitely look in to this if youre considering going in to it because a lot of people feel scammed by this process. Third realize that youre actually in a really good place! Youre not one of those people who are just dying to be a Librarian or an Art Historian whose dreams can only be fulfilled by desperately hanging on to any crappy little job within your overly competitive field. Youre flexible and that means that even though it feels desperate now youre actually in a really good place. Most people dont get jobs that involve their majors. Just having a college degree in anything and being able to write decently qualifies you for a lot of jobs out there. You could go back to the place you were working before and look for advancement or you could apply to a range of other jobs. Think outside the box and dont limit yourself to your college majors. Present yourself as a bright young gogetter who is really interested in whatever field your job of interest happens to be in. Look at this as an opportunity to reinvent yourself and pursue things that you may actually really enjoy outside of your degree work. Ive worked in a lot of different disciplines and I can tell you this The listed qualificationspreferences dont matter as much as they may seem to so let people tell you no as opposed to not applying. Every job is a valuable experience. Often people start you in tempPT positions to test you out but the possibility for advancement is real. Prioritize either getting the experience you want out of a job as a means to get to something different or getting solid benefits and a decent wage. Everything else can be negotiated.

Real life stuff came up and I found that I was alone a lot more than usual. There were a few ways I went about fixing this. The first one is what the other poster said which is to just keep playing till you meet people. If you do well in your games consistently I guarantee people will start adding you wanting to play. Talking to people in game and being friendly can also go a long way. The other thing is I just got involved with various communities. I started college a few months ago and I immediately joined the League of Legends club. I met quite a few people through there. I understand that this isnt always an option but if youre a student look for people that also play at your school try to get involved in a club etc. Tournaments could also help find new teammates. If none of that works head over to the League of Legends or DOTA subreddits and just ask for people to play with. There are a lot of friendly people willing to queue up with you. Hope this helps.

Coconut oil is amazing for this. Cut out the candy and soda for a while and keep your teeth extra clean by brushing and flossing really well. Coconut oil kills the bacteria that causes cavities.  Get some at a health food store and use it at least twice a day to swish your mouth.  Its called oil pulling. Put a big spoonful into your mouth and swish it around for as long as you can. Then spit it out into the trash can.  The more times a daythat you do this the better. It should be done before you go to bed and after meals. You can also mix it with baking soda and brush with it.

I am not sure what her problem is but she does have a problem and I think whoever you talk to is in a better position to solve that problem. Hopefully if she realizes what she is doing is wrong she will start paying you back. However since she has debts any money she makes is better served by paying those off. Good luck!,Advice,cnabw6w,2,t5_2qjdm

My attitude has caused my SO to become depressed as well. My insane depression has come from me being unable to get a job but has started affecting all aspects of my life. Most of all I have horrible stomach problems. My stomach always hurts and when I try to eat it just hurts more. I end up starving myself because the pain of hunger hurts less than the pain of eating. Ive gone to doctors and nothing they prescribe helps. You seem to have some deep rooted issues. Made all the worse from not being able to talk about them.I know something that has a  chance of helping you. Ghost  has already suggested it but Id like to expand on just how helpful cannabis is to someone who has problems like the ones youve stated. Let me start off by saying that cannabis is the ONLY THING thats helped with my stomach problems. Id forgotten how much I loved food hating every meal before it. I would wake up every hour on the hour but now it helps me sleep. I dont have seizures but studies show it helps with that too. It eases stress helps with pain migraines aches and doesnt interfere with any medication. Cannabis can be easy or hard to get depending on where you are but if what you have described is true it will provide a MASSIVE amount of good for you. Do not ignore this suggestion please.I really feel for you I have gone through similar things. If you wantneed to talk to someone PLEASE PM me. I will not judge you for being lazy will not call you insane. I want to help you I may be able to provide insight from having had gone through it too and if not that a friendly ear to listen or eyes to read as it may be.Stay strong!

Being a waiter andor bartender can help out greatly because they are heavy on tips.As for student loans it depends on where you get them. Always apply for scholarships and grants where you can to start. But for student loans you probably filled our a FASFA form through the government to get financial aid. This can get you the loans you need and if you make under a certain amount of money which clearly you do you will automatically qualify for the Pell Grant. The Pell Grant usually gets you upwards of  for a school year paid half each semester and also doesnt have to be paid back but there it a catch. Your parents cannot claim you on their taxes otherwise you will probably be denied the grant because they make too much income. Make sure Federal loans are subsidized so you dont incur interest while in school.Also check with your registrarstreasurers office regarding tuition costs. Usually you can save money if you are classified as an instate as well as incounty resident if you arent already. doing this alone brought my persemester tuition down from roughly K to just over K.TLDR Always apply for jobs around campus.

Then consider opening up to them. Really telling them what your going through. Its scary to do that at first but if its somebody you know that you can trust.

I know youre probably like DUH right now. The bias is unfortunately on their side. Abusive people often make their victims seem like the guilty ones regardless of what their gender is or isnt. Its wrong its vile and its the reason why so many men get the living crap beaten out of them every day by abusive female partners rather than call the cops get arrested and then get charged as though they were the assailants. Theyre manipulative and stoop to the most abysmal lows when theres no reason to do so. Give them a slight reason to do even if theyve so clearly provoked it and BAM! Theres trouble.

You may be losing less weight while your body is starving because it has become so accustomed to the tiny amount of food you take that your bodys metabolism has slowed down accordingly. It is unhealthy to keep shrinking your metabolic rate in the name of weight there are far more health dangers past owning a few extra pounds.

3187126,0,t3_2wmrnt,I have some thoughts. Some might seem a bit harsh but I mean well. And this will be a wall of text.To break down everything youre concerned about no job no friends no license future debt weight. Ill try to collect my thoughts into a few general sections. Im going to try to put them in a specific order. Self Confidence The next few sections I think might help you work on some things but overall all of these problems probably stem from how you currently feel about yourself. You mention you dont have any friends but you have your family. Instead of trying to look for another group of support through strangers hoping to become friends talk to your parents. No one can do it alone. Your parents will love you unconditionally of course. I guess basically what Im trying to get at is look at what you currently have and go from there. Ive gotten off point a little bit but I tend to do that.If youre not happy with yourself you cant expect others to be either. No one likes to hear someone throw a pity party for themselves. And as much as the world sucks there are a couple of things Id try to take care of before you really go seeking anything with other people. Work on getting your license. Im not sure where youre from or what the laws are in regarding getting it but it shouldnt be too difficult. You might have to take a driving test with an instructor. If you took any kind of driving course that will help. Dont be afraid to fail. I failed my first driving test because I drove more like I would by myself and not more responsibly.Think about it. Youre down on yourself AND other people have to walk? Not a solid sell right there. Superficial sounding yes but that is just kind of how it goes sometimes. Debtfuture You seem to have a lot going on. Put your worries on future debt on the back burner for now. The reason youre going to graduate school is to add that to the resume to get the big job when youre finished. This is not an immediate problem so try not to treat it as one. Social Life What kinds of things are interesting to you? Do you like playing Magic The Gathering? Do you like painting or art? I know you mentioned youd tried the school clubs and stuff like that but maybe some of those groups just didnt interest you.Ill give you some background on me. I wont get super specific but just to give you some insight. Ive worked in the service industry for  years and am currently managing a retail store dealing with specific niche products. The reason Im mentioning this is because I want to show you who I am. A little more than just a stranger on Reddit. The most important thing to note is that I am pretty shy and on occasion socially awkward. Ive served tables been a bartender and am a manager in a place that strives for great customer service yet you put me in a normal social situation where I feel like I dont have anything in common with anyone I will stand alone and not say a damn thing. If Im in a situation where I can relate I open up more. I think this might be something to consider. Think about how you become friends with most people in the first place common interest. Find what youre passionate for man. The rest might come easy for you.And a lot of people find someone who goes out alone but doesnt drink kind of odd. I dont fault you at all for it though. Like I said I was a bartender. Ive maybe gone out  times in the last  months. Im not a big drinker anymore. I had my fun and got tired of feeling like shit the next day. Besides most people youd probably meet when youre out would just be temporary friends.In regards to dating and having a girlfriend youre not alone in the world man. Dating is some confusing stuff. I dont even want to get into specifics but just try not to make a big deal of it. Weight I dont want to get super detailed with this but Ill just try to break it down into what I would recommend for losing weight. Your best friend is going to be cardio. Running biking swimming just being active. Dont try to do sit ups or any of that crap. What sit ups and crunches and stuff do will make your stomach muscles bigger therefore making your body itself bigger and itll just be discouraging. I lost weight by using the treadmill or just walkingjogging around a couple of blocks. I measured out how far a mile would be around the blocks I liked to go around so I could keep track of how much I was doing. They have phone apps that help with that stuff too. Weights can help for weight loss but I dont know the specifics so I wont recommend that. If youre worried about other people at the gym thats pretty common and Im the same way. My schedule used to be a lot more open than it is now but you know what I did? I joined a  hour gym. I know its not ideal but being a night person made going to work out at am pretty easy for me and I had the place to myself. I was able to learn the machines watch whatever I wanted on the TVs and not worry about anyone else. When there were people there no one really seemed to pay me any attention and even if they did Im trying to improve myself. Dont be super concerned about caloric intake look more into trans and saturated fats to try to stay away from. Sodium isnt a big deal either since youll just sweat it out. I would buy food that was better for me at the store. Chicken breasts fruits protein stuff like that. Id watch what I ate  days a week and then one day was my cheat day. I could eat regular stuff that I wanted but just cut down on portions. I wont lie the first couple of weeks sucked ass but eventually my stomach started shrinking and I was eating less anyway. Stay away from any soda diet or regular theyre both bad. Drink a lot of water each day. I sometimes used those Crystal Light powders to have some flavor. You might get yourself a water bottle or jug and figure out how many you need to drink to get  cups worth a day. Also drinking a glass before eating will help you feel fuller quicker. Theres also a technique that I learned where if you want the simulation of eating regular things without doing it you will eat a bit of it for example french fries you eat a few french fries then drink a bunch of water then end with a few more and it tricks your stomach.You should notice a pretty big drop in weight shortly after starting. This is going to be mostly water weight. The weight loss will slow down after that but dont get discouraged.In regards to supplements I took them. My thoughts? Its a load of shit. Most of them are just caffeine pills but if you really want to give some a shot go down to your local nutrition place and tell them youre looking for some supplements and ask if they have samples to try. Its fairly pointless because you probably wont see any results with one dose but its something to consider.Always eat AFTER working out. I made that mistake. Not pleasant.As I said the first  weeks will suck but once you get used to it its a lot easier. Youll feel better. If you stick with it try to keep small obtainable goals. You cant say okay I want to weigh X weight in  months because if you arent there its discouraging. Its better to think in different terms than just weight loss. Say I want to walkrunjogwhatever an extra mile than last week this week or something like that. Overview Thats a lot of stuff to try to handle man. Not gonna bullshit you on that. The best way to handle it is one step at a time. Break things down. Try to focus on just one thing right now. Like getting your license. Go down with your mom or dad YOUR support system and just see what you need to do to get it done. If you need practice driving Im sure theyll help you out.Im not sure if any of this was helpful or not but I just spent like an hour and a half writing this so if anything know that a random guy on Reddit wants to help you.

In any case I would meet again with your academic advisor and see if you can work something out with your teachers to help alleviate some of the pressure. Your teachers want you to succeed there are going to be some that might be able or willing to help you out but you wont know until you ask.Otherwise you are going to have to keep on going with the  classes and that means managing your time. You dont want to be dreading school so early in your academic career...you still have  years of Uni ahead of you so pace yourself and enjoy being a teenager. Take it one week at a time manage your schedule and keep handing in your assignments  a  is better than a . Go and talk to your teachers and ask to see if you can hand in those assignments late or make up extra credit. Dont give up and keep on pushing through. If you stop going to school stop handing in assignments and stop studying you are only going to dig yourself into a deep shitty hole. You do not want this. Talk to your teachers talk to your counsellors academic and personal to help get you through this time. Talk to your parents as well you need support.Next year take fewer courses.,Advice,cp2qkx3,1,t5_2qjdm

I lie to everyone I meet because Im too embarrassed to share my background with them and Im certain that they dont want to hear it so why even bother telling the truth? It is just exhausting and makes me more emotionally unstable. Not a great way to start relationships but it is how we have to cope. Thats exactly me. I can tear up at the drop of a hat. Just by the way someone says something and judges me without knowing what Ive had to go through. I saw one of my friends this year who is currently at a university and she just blurted out Yeah well youve got to finish highschool first and gave me a look as if she thought she was better than me and that I was stupid. It just killed me inside. Yes that is the truth I do need to finish but she had no right to judge me that way. I almost broke down right there but thankfully I left the room fast enough. She never apologized she didnt even realize what she did. Im never going to look at her the same way again. Some people will never understand us and thats where lying is easier it shouldnt be the answer but it is the only one I have between myself and a mental breakdown.I agree being positive and polite does take you a long way. Ill definitely take that advice. Yes if people give me shit about it I will fuck them hah ha but not literally though! You give great advice and Im taking it to heart thank you. Feel free to PM me too if you ever need to talk about anything. Ill try to visit this throwaway every once in a while.It is completely alright to rant.

I also would have pulled the individual aside that plagiarized and had a heart to heart talk with them to see if they did it because they were lazy or because they didnt know it was wrong some countries dont view plagiarism as a necessarily bad thing or if they were under a lot of pressure from other outsidepersonal issues and didnt want to turn in nothing.  I also encourage my students even in lectures of  or more pupils to keep lines of communication open.  Shit happens.

That only works if theres no oral component after the written part andor if you actually did well enough on the test but the profTA messed up the grading happened to me twice. My mechanics professor told us during my freshman year If you think you deserved to get more on a test come and see me. Theres like a gajilion tests we have to grade so errors may occur. And if no one comes to complain we assume everyone is happy with their grade. That said the TAs from that departments did dismiss my complaints one time saying youre better off redoing it anyway since youll get a better grade and there are some profs which wont budge in which case pushing the issue is not a good strategy. Your best bet is to redo the exams and pass without confronting the prof if you still have time to redo them.gt During one exam a prof refused me the the right to go to the washroom because I needed take a shit and therefore had to use a stall. I complained to the faculty and have not received a reply back.I thought this was standard practice. People arent allowed to leave the exam room at all during our exams. They specifically say this at the beginning of the exam. I mean for classes like Dynamics there is usually a couple of lecture halls worth of students taking the exam and theres no way they could control what you do or who you talk with if you leave the exam room.gt When you have that kind of track record I dont think its justified to blame the students.Our facultys engineering design exams often have abysmal pass rate which is the profs fault but its also something you cant do jack against. If the prof wants to give a damn near impossible exam he will and you cant really do anything about it. Studying harder is the only option in that case.gt giving absolutely no part marks hence the huge failure rateThis also annoyed me when I first started college since in my highschool if you made a mistake which carried over to the next part of the assignment they still gave you  of the marks if you got the method right. However as my engineering design prof told me when I asked about that If we built the whatever it was according to the calculations you did here it would break and cause damage. As an engineer no one will care if you know the right method if you cant produce the right answer using it. And the fact that you fail to get the right answer using the right method tells me that you havent practiced it enough or that you dont know how to do math properly. In either case thats not something that is allowed in someone who passes this course. In retrospect he was right well except for the fact that the component whatever it was would have held since my answer was a much thicker component than the required one.gt I had an  average in highschool but that has just plummeted. I had good grades in highschool with little effort and while I still have decent grades in college though not great they required more effort. It requires a different mindset especially large exams usually thermo hydro and design at least at my uni. You have to realize that preparing such an exam can be a month long thing and that you can fail on a small detail.My advice would be to try and stick to engineering as later years are much more rewarding. I hated my first two years they were all dreary theoretical courses which thought me no practical knowledge whatsoever. However by year three they started linking those theoretical foundations so that I quickly learned how to apply that to actual problems. While I still think my faculty is way too theoretical in its course material they are now giving me the basic knowledge I can then shape into readily marketable skills with experience.,Advice,cqvb5ri,2,t5_2qjdm

3902354,0,t3_354ogf,Hey I just wanted to comment on the confusion you brought up regarding whether or not your relationships with your guy friends were based on romance. I think that it is important to note that no matter what sexuality you identify with there is nothing wrong with loving a friend. I lived in a small town in high school and I remember being considered kind of strange for telling my fellow guy friends or teammates that I loved them. Love is a really powerful emotion and it is often the emotion that bonds us to another person. It doesnt have to be sexually charged in anyway. I enjoy hanging out with my friends and there are times where we are just talking and I realize in a sort of euphoric moment that I love these guys so much and appreciate them as people and I appreciate our relationship. I know this wasnt the main point of your post but I felt that you should know that the idea of loving another person does not have to be romantically or sexually based. ,Advice,cr13plr,1,t5_2qjdm

4014301,0,t1_crdhf9x,There are likely jobs you can get you just might not like them as they are going to be pretty labor intensive.You could try being a preloader at UPS. Warning the pay is meh and UPS i think is downsizing. Best time to try that is during winter for the holidays though after winter is over they might cut you loose even if they say its not seasonal.there is farm work again this is not an easy or good job but its a living.Possibly a better option might be trying for an apprenticeship if you havent yet. such as an electricians apprenticeship Or construction work. You get the idea.Im not a doctor so I cant say I really understand Aspergers syndrome. An apprenticeship might be harder with that disadvantage but if you havent tried that rout yet Id recommend that as the best course of action giving you the best possible future out of what Ive listed so far. Most of the time its not about social skills with any of these kinds of jobs but about being strong and willing to work your ass off.If you are looking for a minimum wage job even though the company does suck you could try being a stocker at a walmart. They are an equal opportunity employer and something like stocking shelves does not require much interaction with customers. Other large corporations might also hire you for such a position as I believe many of them are equal opportunity employers.Again all these jobs are really difficult jobs. You likely will hate the majority of these options. But a job means food and shelter and security. I wouldnt be so fast to just throw in the towel.Edit I also forgot something that provides a great possibility for a future and that would be the military.

My knowledge is mostly limited to neuroscience so while I think it applies to other fields I cant be positive.People with a bachelors can be research assistants lab managers lab coordinators and technicians. If you work in the private sector you can get some pretty decent cash. However to really advance you need a masters or a PhD. Plus youre going to need a good amount of lab experience while in undergrad. If you want to make cashnot enter academia get the masters and work in the private sector for different research companies. The jobs are competitive but they exist and dont require a PhD. In fact getting one is discouraged companies dont want to pay for a PhD. Academia is cool in a lot of ways and I want to be involved in it but not base my whole career off of it.

It will help you feel less tired during the week. Make sure you are getting enough hours each night for yourself some people only need hrs others need hrs most need about hrs. You say you get about hrs but you should try logging your sleep schedule...it might be more variable than you think. Try an make sure you get at least hrs especially if you are waking up tired.Other Tips Avoid food stimulants before bed late afternooneverning coffee tea energy drinks pop... Avoid environmental stimulants hr before bed TV internet computer video games bright lights exercising...stick to reading a book or winding down with a nice bath. Whatever floats your boat  just avoid those bright screens that keep your brain buzzing. Get into the same bedtime routine every day of the week. One hour before bed turn off the tv the internet and just relax in bed. Maybe make yourself an herbal tea. Listen to the radio or an audio book. Its exactly like being a kid again but there is a reason why we teach our kids or did these routines each night ourselves as kids  because it works! Make sure your bedroom is completely dark and slightly cool. Lights and a hot room keep you from falling asleep. Make sure your phone is off and you just have your alarm set for the AM so that nothing disturbs you before and during sleep Try adding exercise into your daily routine but avoid doing it right before bed. A quick min jog in the morning or a walk or jog during your lunch hour at work or after work...these little things add up and help. You might also try parking a few extra blocks from work so that you have to walk a little farther...it could be that your hr commute puts your body back into sleep mode. Try making your morning routine more active by walking more e.g. taking the stairs quick AM jog parking farther away.  Try water in the AM before you chug your coffee. Dont become dependant on it to wake you up. Hydrate yourself on your way to work with water after your walk and once you get into the office then think about having your AM coffee.,Advice,crznacr,2,t5_2qjdm

Im thinking there might be some animosity there. If you want to find out why she feels the way she does you will need to talk to her. Give her an opportunity to tell you why she feels the way she does and what you did to make her feel that way. You will need to listen to this without justifying your position. This isnt about you telling her why you feel shes wrong its about giving her a voice.She comes from a historically and presently marginalized culture. One that recently has been in the eye of the media as being targeted by police. I have heard black people say that they feel hunted that it is completely legal for them to be killed by people in authority. That people still believe that they are genetically inferior to whites I believe that was one of your jokes. Constant reminders of being less than tend to anger people.Racial stereotype jokes are always risky. Make a joke about black people liking watermelon of chicken and it might be a little rude but its not talking about a negative trait watermelon and chicken are generally tasty. Make a joke about them being thugs being a slave or being arrested and you are joking about symptoms of their oppression. Two different things.If you are going to write her off just do it. You dont need the approval of an online community to do so. If you are looking for justification for your emotions you have it. They are your emotions and they are real. You feel you were being treated unfairly by this woman because what you were doing was no different in your mind than everyone else. She feels differently. You can either try to figure out why she felt that way and learn from it or you can write her off and not care if you are perceived as a racist.,Advice,cs89tbu,1,t5_2qjdm

I know that seems kind of harsh but if you are committed to breaking up you need to rip off the bandaid.Feel free to give her a reason but you really want to limit that stuff  all it does is gives her things to argue about. This shouldnt be an argument. And then once you break up go total nocontact for some substantial amount of time. I would recommend at least six months. Again feel free to tell her youd be open to being friends again but for now you just need to be apart.I cant recommend that highly enough and its hardest thing in the world when you still care about the person. But staying in touch regularly is the WORST way to get over someone and the most likely way to find yourself sucked back in.Again the bandaid metaphor is good. Breaking up with someone sucks no matter what. So dont peel off the bandaid a tiny bit at a time and drag out the pain. Theres no way you can make this not painful for her. Theres no way you can convince her its for the best or to not be mad at you. Good luck man.,Advice,csbfsh8,2,t5_2qjdm

It might cause family drama if the couple getting married or other family members are overly sensitive and think youre somehow ruining their big day by bringing up an upsetting topic.  If your inlaws say something about it simply smile and tell them that you and your husband do hope to have children one day and leave it at that.  Id advise doing that indefinitely if I thought it would actually get the inlaws to stop badgering you.After the wedding if you want to tell them about the miscarriage choose a time when you and your husband are alone with them and tell them that you didnt mention it at the time because it was a very difficult time for you but that you had been pregnant last autumn and lost the baby.  If they start asking too many questions just say that youd rather not talk about it and hopefully theyll respect that.The other option is to have your husband take them aside at some point and ask them not to mention having children around you as much because you had a miscarriage last autumn and all the talk of pregnancy is upsetting for you.If they start asking questions like when are you going to try again? just tell them that youre following your doctors advice.

4508446,0,t1_csyvvo8,Im so sorry that happened to you. Its not the same thing but when some sexual abuse that I went through came to the surface and I confided in a friend she told the whole school. It was incest so I went through years being made fun of for being some sort of incestuous backwoods hick. THOSE PEOPLE ARE ASSHOLES. The gall it takes for not just your attacker but the people around you to use that trauma as a joke or a weapon is disgusting. They are not worth your anguish they are vile people who lack any conscience or decency and I am sorry you have to be surrounded by them. Please look into some books maybe you can bring those into therapy with you to talk about if they resonate. CBT is really good for reworking depressive thoughts and DBT is good for learning how to deal with them and process the difficult things that have happened to you. Those skills prevented me from further spiraling downward...if your therapist can start working with you on those things I think they might help. You are not alone. These people who you are unfortunately around right now will not be in your life forever. I also firmly believe that family is what you make them. When family disowns you or turns their back you can make a new one. Sometimes the family we were born to dont deserve or understand us. Dont let them make you feel worthless. I really hope that you are able to get away from wherever you are soon once you graduate if you have not already you can go somewhere to an environment that will actually feel encouraging and not hold you back. Seriously its soooo trite to have this coming out of my mouth right now but my heart really does go out to you right now. Youre not alone and you can overcome this. You posted here! You asked for help! That alone is massive and says a lot about you. Keep going and holding on to that. Im new to reddit and dont really understand how things work too well but message me if you need to talk to someone. You can do this. Mention CBTDBT to your therapist and be firm about it. You may be making progress but maybe not in the areas that you need help in right now. Make that known and be proactive for yourself. Seriously you deserve better than the cards youve been dealt and it will probably be a really painful process but you will get through this. There is a future for you out there and it will get easier and I hope you are able to find a support system that is understanding. Not wanting to be friends with you because they think you are a faggot...that bewilders me. How calloused. You dont need those people as friends anyway and trust me most people in the world are not like that. Good people are out there who wont use your pain as ammunition theyll understand it and just want to be there for you. Those people are a blip in the grand scheme of things and theyll fade into obscurity once youre able to get out of there. Youre worth way more than their cruelty. ,Advice,csyxta8,2,t5_2qjdm

4591866,0,t3_3dvvds,If you can learn a few simple phrases like Hello  Hola or Thank you  Gracias you will be fine. Most Europeans speak English to some degree and its highly likely that the staff where the wedding will take place will speak English. Either way a few words can go a long way it shows you are trying. Dont worry if you sound like an idiot they dont care.In order to feel more comfortable about the vacation buy a guide book for that region or for Spain. Start reading up on the city you will be visiting things to do etc. Dont be afraid to head to the front desk of the hotel and see if there are any tourist packages that you can take advantage of e.g. a drop offpick up service to the local museum or castle or relic or whatever. While it can be frightening it is worth it to explore the city or area a bit...you cant travel all that way and just see the inside of the wedding venue. So see if anything in the guide book peaks your interest and ask the front desk about it...they are usually very good at helping tourists find their way around in a safe and reliable way. Its ok not to know anyone at the party just make small chitchat with the people at your table. Where are you coming from? How do you know the bridegroom? Have you ever been to Spain before? What do you do for a living? These are pretty simple questions that can help break the ice. You dont have to become friends but you dont have to be a statue either. I know its easier said than done but you can do it. Its just for one evening and the rest of the time you can hang out in your comfort zone. Finally it might be worth mentioning to the grooms parents that you are a bit shy and dont know anyone else at the party they might be able to introduce you to some people your own age.Will you be flying with other people in the wedding? If yes then you will probably all go to the same location once you land. If no then contact the hotel and see if they will pick you up directly from the airport via a shuttle. This will make the trip a little easier you wont have to worry about what to do or where to go when you land. A few other tips. Get some local currency before you leave. Go you your local bank and take out some Euros thats what Spain uses. That way when you land you wont be scrambling to find an ATM that works...and its cheaper than going through those airport currency exchange booths. Its unlikely that everyone will accept American currency despite its versatility.. In your carryon pack a few essentials in case your luggage gets lost. Toothbrush small toothpaste change of underwear deodorant contact solutionlenses if you need those extra tshirt...these things are life savers if you luggage is delayed. Visit your local drugstore and go to the travel section they will have appropriately sized items that can make it through security. . Make sure your credit card company and your debit card company know you are traveling  for how long and when. If you start using your card in a foreign country they are going to think its stolen.

4608208,0,t3_3e4g1v,I know it sounds pretty shitty and they probably overreacted to the whole staying up until  business but honestly this is probably really good for you. So few people learn how to manage their money they go through their entire lives deeply in debt and constantly stressed about how theyre going to pay bills. Having the ability to create and stick to a budget is such a wonderful boon even if you cant see it now this is probably the greatest gift your parents could give you. They clearly care about you a lot they want you to save money so that you dont have to live that way so that you can create opportunities for yourself without being stressed out by debt. Plus its not like theyre taking the money from you putting it in a savings account so that youll have it later and to teach you how to delay pleasure.If you want them to see you as a responsible person then you need to show them that you know how to manage your money in the best way. If youd like help in that regard let me know and I can shoot some ideas your way. In the end the best solution for them is for you to show that you are responsible with your money and the best solution for you is to do the same so that they will trust you and give you back your card.

If he refuses to pay the payments they will definitely come after you since you signed the lease or finance agreement too. But you dont have to pay the payments either. They will ding your credit and eventually repo the car. You really have three options to avoid getting your credit dinged. . Ask your ex to meet for cup of coffee in a public place. And just ask him to work the refinance with you. This option although potentially emotionally painful will be by far the cheaper option. . You have to lawyer up. Start by having your attorney send him a strongly worded letter pushing for the refinance in option . If he wont take it then you will have to take him to court.. You can pay off the car. You signed for it so technically you bought it. If you have the  you could always do this.Or Option  just let the bankfinancing agency just repo the car and take the credit ding. It will be on your record for seven years. So unless you plan on getting a mortgage in that time you really dont have anything to worry about. You dont need a credit score.

4823002,0,t1_cu26izm,Trust me I have had this conversation with my lawyer several times over the years I simply have not had a need to call him in a while because things are mostly chill between my ex and I. I trust and respect the man. He said look you are saying all the right things and logically everything makes sense but the court simply does not work that way. It gets even crazier when you consider there are two child support schedules.Support Schedule A is what most dads get. Under this schedule the child support is laid out exactly as I have mention in my original post. Cut and dry not much wiggle room at all.Support Schedule B is much rarer. In order to get schedule B where Im from you have to have at least  timecustody of your child. If that is the case they then factor your support much as  they do in schedule A but you get an allowance for the time you spend with your kid and what often happens is that child support for one side or the other pays a significantly reduced amount Im talking under  a month. Right now you had better have  percent not  to get this even though the law is written and the worksheet allows for any percentage.As it stands I have  out of every  days with my child every other weekend and every Thursday so roughly   days of the year. This does not include any holidaysvacationssummer etc. While there is a bit of a give and take when it comes to holidaysvacations I typically come out better than my ex simply based on the allotment of days. I can easily get close to   days of the year where my daughter is with me once you factor in the school holidays etc. This means that  days prevent me from paying next to nothing in child support and paying  every month....edittypos,Advice,cu2h985,1,t5_2qjdm
4825336,0,t1_cu2inj3,I am aware of what Mary believes she is doing for Grace but it does not excuse involving her in disagreements with my sister and using her as a tool to make her feel inferior which in reality she may be but that is not the point. She is not a puppet Mary should not be telling her what to say or speaking badly about her mother and trying to turn her against us. I left out quite a few details for the sake of not writing an entire novel. Mary is a devout Jehovahs witness and barely lets Grace outside or lets her have any friends over. Mary has bipolar disorder. Marys son Graces father is in and out of jail and a drug addict. Why should the paternal grandmother have custody of Grace when Grace has been with my side of the family her entire life? I lived with Grace for the first three years of her life my family has taken care of them and helped whenever we could. Mary has done nothing other than what she is doing now and the only reason she is there is because my sister had no one else in state to turn to. Mary has alienated most of her own family because they are not Jehovahs Witnesses so its basically just her and Grace in a trailer in the middle of the country. Grace had to change schools already to be with Mary and has been to a total of  schools in her life. This child has had no consistency and has very little experience in a normal household. My mom raised four children loves her family no matter what theyve done and is responsible with no mental illness. She was there at Christmas Thanksgiving etc. and is someone who has been there for Grace and Nicole and my sister one of the few consistencies. Grace may believe that she wants to stay with Mary but she is a child. She does not know what we know. It is not in her best interest to stay there and it is not in her best interest to stay with my sister not until she gets the help she needs.Grace lived with my sister for her entire life before this minus maybe  months total it has been a month this time around that she hasnt lived with her but she sees her every week... I dont think she is afraid of her or feels uncomfortable around her. I think that she knows that whenever Mary and my sister are together they argue and that creates tension for her. Or maybe it really is that Mary is trying to turn Grace against her mother. I agree that Mary probably means well and thinks she is doing the right thing. But she is doing a crappy job at it. Youre right though she is at the age where she knows what is going on. Which is why she needs out of this situation because I truly fear for her future. ,Advice,cu2ru1o,1,t5_2qjdm

So you need to make it always work for you.  Sucky teacher?  Sucky book? sucky schedule?  Those things will always be in play.  So keep your eye on the prize.Step one keep in touch with this John guy.  You can motivate each other when the learning and workload gets tough.Step two.  Join a club look on Reddit attend talks mingle with other folks who share your passion and interest.Step three.  Be an information and knowledge sponge.  Absorb as much info on your topic as you can.  Use step two for that.Step four.  Diversity your education.  Learn the humanities public speaking computers design.  All of these things will make you a better scientist then just being good at math or physics.Step five when the adults in step two understand you are serious they will take you under their wing.  Ask them what to do and what to avoid.  Ask more than one and follow the common advice given.  You learn from mistakes so make your own mistakes not mistakes everyone else already has.Step six.

It happens.But if you know for sure that she did just do it after seeing yours aka that she really just straight out stole your art then Id recommend you dont talk with her about anything related to your own art anymore.Just say youve got the artequivalent of a writers bock. That you exhausted yourself too much with how much art you were producing before so you decided to take a small break from all that. That youll of course start doing art again eventually but that you just need a break for now to refresh your ideas or whatever.You dont have to actually do that. Just dont show her any of the art you do from now on  and leave her completely in the assumption that youre not producing any pieces of art at all currently.Which means When she or her husband seeing as he could definitely tell her! visits dont have any new pieces of art out dont even have them out and say you made them a longer time ago because she might decide to steal that art piece as well.Dont talk about your art dont talk about any ideas you have dont talk about anything relating to your own art. Talk about others or hers but not your own or at least not about anything she hasnt seen as of yet.You also probably should inform your husband of at least some of this if you should decide to really do the above. Because he might end up mentioning something you recently made and the whole facade will be broken. So depending on how much and what he normally talks to his best friends wife about itll be relevant for him to know that hes not supposed to mention anything related to your art around her anymore.If youre sure that she stole that piece of art from you in the sense of clearly copying it then seriously Do not just move on and not care about it because she might see that as her A getting away with it and B being able to make easy money with it. Which means shed do it again.Then again never underestimate how similar two completely unrelated pieces can be.

After my best friend and I split for college we would chat online every few months. Eventually though I felt I was the one trying to maintain the friendship because I loved her like a sister. She ended up getting rid of her phone and got a new one never bothered to give me her number when we did chat. Our conversations always ended with me saying something trying to continue but she wouldnt respond until we started another conversation later. The biggest blow hit me this summer when she didnt bother wishing me a happy birthday. A few weeks later I learned she was in our hometown for a few days but she didnt reach out. I reached out to her and never received a response and I am so hurt by it. I began to think maybe she never really wanted to be so close with me but since we were around each other often she just let me think it was okay. Also I noticed she changed while away in college.Maybe your friends changed more than you thought or maybe you changed. I have another friend some people and I have grown away from because she changed so much it was difficult to be around her and she exhausted us as friends. Im not saying youre like that but try to think about if something happened that changed how they perceived you. Has anything in your life caused you to change? Or has anything in their lives caused them to change but grow together as friends while leaving you out?Either way I will let you know I am still so hurt and really want to reconnect with my friend. But I have accepted that stressing out over her wasnt doing me any good and why should I put so much effort into a friendship that wouldnt exist unless I did all the work? I do hope that one day my friend will message me and well talk again. I mean weve both changed so much so we could change again to reach that point.

5250203,0,t3_3mvl66,Congrats on the job! From what I can see it looks like youve got a great attitude. Im sure youll do fine and have a blast.I used to be a bar manager for a nightclub. Whenever we had new staff for busy nights Id do my best to patient. Nobody will expect you to hit the ground running and know everything immediately. What did help was them turning up a little early to their shift. Just half an hour. That way it was quiet and either I or another staff member could take some time to show them around and take them through the basics. Do not be afraid to ask questions! Id much rather take a few seconds to answer a question than have you make a mistake that could have been avoided. That said mistakes will happen. There was nothing the newbies did that I hadnt already done myself when I was learning the ropes save for a few exceptions. When you do make a mistake let someone know immediately. The sooner someone knows the sooner they can fix it and show you how to do it properly. Let customers know youre new and learning if youre under the pump. Most people will be very forgiving. Take your time and always double check  their order and their address phone number and credit card details. Buy good comfortable shoes. I recommend Doc Martens or Palladiums as work shoes. Vans are good too. Avoid converse. They have no support and theyre slippery as hell on wet surfaces. Also get good thick socks. When I first started I took a copy of the menu and the cocktail cheat sheet home and stuck them on my mirror. Id read over them while I was getting ready for my shift. And remember  if youve got time to lean youve got time to clean. Theres always something to do. Dont pull out your phone and muck around when its quiet. Have the toilets been checked recently? Do they have toilet paper? Is there any kitchen prep that needs to be done? Dishes to be washed dried and put away? Tables that need to be wiped down and topped up with napkins?,Advice,cviu71i,1,t5_2qjdm

Accidents do happen which is only slightly better than if you did these things purposefully but harm resulted from your actions anyway.   Your friend and supervisors reputations with the boss were damaged when you clued your boss in on the gossip.  Whether or not they were formally chastised doesnt mean your actions didnt affect them.   Im sorry youre hurt about your friend withdrawing her friendship.  It doesnt matter if you agree with the viability of your friends reason to end the friendship as its entirely her decision to make.   All you can do is live and learn.

5326323,0,t3_3nwqyx,Maybe you were unhappy because you were jobless and stared at walls and played with kids all day. Your kept lifestyle was more likely what made everything dead and unhappy. Not earning a dime of your own keep can make anybody feel unhappy. Dropping out of college and getting pregnant may be a source of resentment for you. Foregoing your goals for a cloistered stayathome role. I dont know but I do know youve made a gigantic mistake in all of this and I dont see you admitting any fault or taking any responsibility for how this has played out whatsoever. Most women do not get to be spoiled by not one but two men. Keep that in mind. Youre far too lucky. Honestly if I was this second guy I would think twice. If she could bail on her first marriage because of unhappiness she could bail on us when things go into a dry season.As far as implicitly mocking the guys religious faith goes you married him knowing he was a devout Christian. I think that you do this as a way to stave off or cope with the feeling of guilt from having an adulterous affair. Thats something you have to be honest with yourself about if there is to be any progress in all of this. Your entire post reads like somebody who is running from responsibility and refusing to accept culpability for anything. You are the spoiled darling kept angel after all.And lets get another thing straight. Since you dont earn a dime of your own its your fiancee and his money that would be going to your first husband and the kids. Your first husband would be splitting the bills with your fiancee not you. That is how your first husband sees this. Another man helping him pay especially the man his exwife committed adultery with for his kids needs is an affront to his dignity. When the honeymoon phase is over and this fiancee sees how you really are things will change.

It sounds like she has done this crap to others so invite them out for a drink after work to come up with a game plan. It sounds like you know exactly what shes doing so its about getting her to hang herself so to speak. Are any of them are good friends with any of the bigger clients that they can persuaded to join in? You will want to make sure whatever you do it catches the eye of whoever is in charge of the manager. In my head I can see a client coming in for an appointment but of course the appointment has been changed. He raises a stink about it and the person who made the appointment has evidence it wasnt her but this other girl.

Being so small Ive already met the majority of staff for my major and a handful from similar ones I considered switching into. They all seemed to be of the same my way or the highway mentality when it came to challenging students in the way Ive been hoping for.I also did a small amount of work with the writing department and got to know some of the more influential teachers there. They got interested in what I was writing and tried getting me to switch over to a writing degree. One of them used to be a hotshot editor with different papers in town so Ive got her vouch if I ever wanted in on that field as well.But the way I see it Im more likely to make good connections in my field with this framing job. Artists and galleries typically frame a ton of work and theyd be going through the shop I work at to get it done one of the  largest in town from what Ive found.If it ever came to it I could catch a flight back to my home state as well. The studio I worked at gave me a huge network to draw commissions from. Moving out here lost most of that network but the gallerycommission concentration here is way higher and cost of living is a fraction of the price.I do have my old teachers phone number still as well. I dont think hed mind me texting him out of the blue one day asking if he knows and good figure drawing classes in town. Maybe I could sneak in a mentorship from him or a friend of his if I get into his circles.I think the time constraint you mentioned is the biggest one. Not just debt and stress but  years of it. I dont think Id gain more than Id lose in that situation. Hopefully my old mentors back home are okay with me rocking the dropoutartist routine. Much better than the starving artist one if you ask me.,Advice,cw9qso6,1,t5_2qjdm

IN your case I probably would have ask to talk to the manager JUST to pay the bill.. he will get the hint.  It does in this case see your server was not just having a bad day  she just should not be a server.But here is by general MO ....While you are still there talk to the manager  esp AFTER paying the bill so they know you are not trying to get a free meal.  State specific examples of what was wrong and what was right as well as how often you visit themwhy you want them to do better   then some of the missteps that really are not a big deal  in the shit happens category  and be honest!   Usually I get comped a free visit or  dollar GC to encourage my returnIF you feel the Server was particularly poor inattentive or rude  leave a poor tip and write on the receipt  disappointing service  etc.If you feel the whole establishment is broken then write to their corporate AND leave a legitimate YELP or TripAdvisor review.As examplesStarbucks had a problem wit their lids leaking  they thought it was fixed but there were still batches of bad lids around  and the cups dribbled on my white works shirt  I only complained after the third time this happened and made point of it I got a personal phone call from a specific person all follow ups were through her offering to pay for the cleaning of the shirts  not needed and then  free drink gift cards just honest feedback. x in State College complained that the Hotels conditions were hurting their brand  two different major brands  I stay  nights a year  both nights comped  one was  one was pointsWrote a particularity scathing review of a Red Lobster  the restaraunt manager and the corporate contacted me  and sent a  gift card  it was so bad that was  years ago and I have not used the card!.Outback  Sons graduation dinner  I know not awesome but that is what he wanted  Waitress from his same HS spilled Drinks on me TWICE  but that was NOT the complaint as that fell into the Shit Happens category   of the  meals were poorly prepared my wifes dinner was ridiculously late  etc  the RESTAURANT was serving bad food  in this case I let my family walk out after paying  it was not a service problem  but I dinged her a little on the tip  in my view it is her responsibility  as the final QC to make sure the food served is correct  etc   I then approached the manager and discussed the issues.  I was specific and literally joked about the Shit Happens issues  we did get a free meal on a future visit  his personal business card and a note on the back signed by him...  To be clear  I am NOT looking for handouts I am not asking for them  if you have a badpoor experience be honest and specific  to someone that understands you are taking the time and making the effort to give them honest feedback not to mention you came to the Establishment expecting X and the fell woefully short.... you will help to improve the establishment and probably get rewarded.,Advice,cwbga8x,1,t5_2qjdm

None of the Americans know when to use their indoor voice. All the Germans are softspoken.  The French are the most outgoing.

All the cabdrivers are farsighted.  The ladyboys Ive met  not in shows but in real life  are extremely unconvincing but certainly more graceful than me.

American restaurants actually do a pretty good facsimile of pad thai.  I have not seen a single glass of what American Thai restaurants serve as Thai iced tea.

If you can slowly interact more and more with the kitty family it will give you a chance to see if they are strays or feral in which case they can be brought inside and brought to local animal shelter.

Then imagine how your life will be different once you get over the obsession. Imagine how the happiness you feel once you let go of these feelings is going to be pleasant and entirely unexpected because you will learn that this person did not make you happy...in fact she was probably someone you counted on to express difficult emotions like anger fear and resentment. If you want write down your rewrite. Then when you think about her let those details take over. Tell yourself that you can control your thoughts and that thinking of her just makes you unhappy.  That is the first big step you can take. So that you can measure your progress Id suggest coming up with a set of rules that when followed will allow you to see that you are changing your behavior for the better. One of them has to be no contact. You can use the writing exercise I suggested to work out any urges to contact her. Other rules should represent obstacles that will prevent you from dwelling on her. Write these rules down. After thirty days review them. That way you can say OK getting better. or Really struggling with this rule need to do something to make it easier to do what the rule is designed for.    If this bit of pop psychology doesnt work no guarantees...I am not a mental health professional then you should consider seeing a counselor or therapist. As someone once explained to me They earned their degrees for a reason. Also some people do take Prozac to deal with obsessive thoughts so you might ask about that if you seek this kind of help.

Also unless you are horribly disfigured just having an unappealing face is easy to counter by having a nice body. Its gym timea good diet. And build some confidence in yourself. You dont need women for self worth. Do your own thing that is attractive to women from my experience. Plus this is not the age to go after women focus on studies andor a career. You have the rest of your life ahead of you to find someone special.

I am not sure if your in residence or in an apartment but talk to your universitys housing office to see what they recommend. They should have some openings from other students that have dropped out. The second issue is with your course. Is this a case you didnt like the course or just the way it was taught? Changing universities may not fix whatever the issue is.

I was stupid enough to go back out with him a few months after the first break up bc he tried so hard to prove how much he loved me. I caved. The only change was that he was much more careful with covering up his lies and sneaky actions. I always fought with myself because we did have some good times and I always genuinely thought he was a nice guy who did try hard but had a problem he could not overcome. I did also think about how hard I worked to give myself a good life and to stay away from those things my whole life. Then I got all crazy about it because I thought how the whole time we dated he just used me to have someone around. I thought how could he really care about me when he was never really himself. How would he really feel about me if he wasnt popping pills? I left him after . years after one last sneaky thing he did. I wish I had been smarter. Of course I cant speak for everyone.

Those are fair questions. Then if she is willing to hear you out you can explain your views.   If the conversation becomes touchy and you value the friendship then just steer clear of the topic in the future. If she expresses disgust and it bothers you...let her know and ask her to keep her opinions on thee matters to herself. If that doesnt work then end the friendship. But if you really want to do some good in the world then be a good friend to someone who doesnt affirm and validate your most deeply held beliefs. That is the only way you can influence someone who thinks what you believe is wrong after all. Tolerance is a virtue so strive for it.,Advice,czf09fp,1,t5_2qjdm

I will say though the way they went about this isnt going to win over many fans. Your case might be an isolated incident but if not then people will stop buying from them and they will go out of business pretty quickly.At this point all you can do is name and shame them. Tell your friends and family about your experience.If I had to guess what happened behind the scenes something was holding up the second product. Most likely they were waiting for the second product to arrive but it was held up which is probably why they ignored your emails as they didnt even know when it arrived.

And it will be a shame not to get to snorkel in the lake but if E Coli is a concern then so be it.Yes keep a copy of the passport. Do this everywhere you travel of course. And of course people keep dogs as pets! Geez. But to be fair there are quite a few dogs that roam the streets freely some are street dogs some have owners who let them fuck around and those dogs definitely you should keep the fuck away from.Not interfering with personal matters is solid advice anywhere you go. While I wont contest that the dynamics between men and women arent the same as the U.S. is true well this is true of almost anywhere else. I wont deny there is a lot of rampant sexism in Latin America which is a goddamned shame but if I see someone beating a woman then fuck it I might catch a beating too but I wont just sit and watch quietly.Bug spray is a capital idea. And an enthusiastic yes! to not looking flashy. The more you look like an impoverished hippie the lower your chances of getting mugged. Which to be absolutely fair are not super high to begin with as most criminals stay away from tourists and instead prey on the locals. The reason for this is imo that the police wont care about a local getting screwed but if a tourist is targeted then they will get heat on their ass. But this is always good advice when traveling and for life dont flaunt your wealth. Its a stupid idea to begin with.I gave the list of items a glance and it looks fine. I dont see a hat on there. Bring one the sun can beat down relentlessly. Id skip the dictionary and just use my phone for translations. I wouldnt worry about it getting stolen most people there have cellphones at this point.

6448697,0,t3_4409ih,Here is what I think is going on based on what you wrote other people find you attractive and it either makes them nervous or excited. If my guess is correct then the awkwardness you perceive could be a selfconscious attempt not to treat you differently because of your appearance. Think about how you behave around someone who you find attractive. Do the words natural and calm come to mind or do you find yourself secondguessing every single thing you say and do hoping that your interest isnt obvious.   So here is some bad news I dont know what you can do about this. The best advice I can give you is to be aware of it and accept it. If it helps you at all I am barely five feet tall and I had a bitch of a time getting women to have the opposite reaction when I talked to them. Im married now because I just got to the point where I accepted the fact that there was something about my appearance that I could not control that was going to get a reaction out of people that was opposite the one I wanted. Just remember that we are all human and the reactions you are getting are not consciously meant to upset you. You might have more luck makig male friends online and keeping those friendships online. As a famous New Yorker cartoon once illustrated On the Internet nobody knows you are a dog. which I mean your appearance isnt an issue at all if you want to find a human connection with someone who never sees nor cares what you look like.

This is a completely feasible option. To do this youd need to research which parts of the U.S. allow for free campingsquatting and become very familiar with the rules and regulations. Youd also need to learn how to live off the land. This is no easy task but Im pretty sure theres a subreddit for it and books on the market. You can become a Buddhist monk. Many of the reasons you cite abovethe fleeting nature of life the desire to be free and the shortsightedness of corporate Americaare the exact reasons people become monks. Ive studied Buddhism vastly in the past year and there are many good dharma talks online. My favorites are Tsem Rinpoche his book Peace changed my life Ajahn Brahm Thich Nhat Hanh and Thubten Chodron. Even if you dont want to be Buddhist and dont care about Buddhism one bit the things they discuss are the exact things you talk about above. Live as an everyday American but do so on your own means. The reason so many Americans are depressed for example  of America suffers from a mental affliction in any given year is because they believe they have no options in life. They believe they have to get a job get married have kids buy a house buy a car and live in debt until they die. You dont have to be like that. You dont have to buy a house or buy a car or get married or have kids. If you want you can live in a studio apartment pay  per month rent work at a grocery store  hours per week and spend the rest of the time doing what you want.In my spare time I make motivationalwisdom videos.

I got myself a job when I was fifteen and that essentially saved me from the situation I was in which is awfully close to yours.

6572182,0,t3_45nru9,Id send a sympathy card with a heartfelt message perhaps your favorite memory of the uncle or what you think she meant to the uncle. Often when people die from addiction it can complicate the grieving process for those left behind..like suicide or other stigmatized ways to die because people may not acknowledge it or choose not to talk about it for fear of upsetting family members..which in reality makes things worse given the true nature of an undeniable situation and just perpetuates the cycle of stigma because nobody wants to talk about it or if they do they get told their reality isnt true thats not something we talk about etc. I remember my professor in a bereavement class in graduate school saying the worst thing we can do is use euphemisms for death when someone dies i.e. so sorry for your loss this is canned and actually means nothing  its an empty phrase and while it makes us feel better about ourselves because we said something it really does nothing to console the individual or even begin to acknowledge what theyre going through. Instead we should say something that reflects the reality of that situation  I am so sorry to hear about Johns overdose  use their name at the very least..Also if youre in the same city offering to drop off a meal or do some laundry for them vs let me know if you need anything a grieving person cant be expected to reach out to someone ELSE at a time like this they need people who take action without being asked.It sounds like you were really close with this friend at one point and still share a special bond so I would be candid with her and most likely you will be one of the few who are and she will never forget it.I hope that was helpful to some degree.A former addictions therapist  ,Advice,czz49id,2,t5_2qjdm

However I can say that recently I have been able to see more clearly. The foggy haze of this motivational daze has left me. I think I can help. Its something that I realized. Because youre struggling to become motivated you may be an artist. If youre an artist to keep yourself happy you require inspiration. I suggest you begin to fill your time with things that make you think. I suggest you listen to audio books and musics. I suggest you do research into your culture or heritage. If you fill your life with the things you enjoy you will begin to feel inspired to make things like them. You will be inspired to continue moving forward because you come to realize that you can do what you set out to. As grinding as it is to continue working with no apparent success you have to remember that you are moving forward. Every single step you are moving forward. And the things that bother you now will simply slow you down. A friend of mine said that smiling makes you happy. If youre sad... Try to force yourself to smile. Watch something funny... that you know youll laugh to. Or something heartwarming that makes you go... daww and smile uncontrollably like a goof.

I think she took a couple weeks off during that but it was supposedly due to emergency medical problems with her son.  So I gave the benefit of the doubt.  But I should have axed her on performance.  Thing is she was quite good at picking up stuff mentally but not good at actually physically carrying out the tasks.  I thought I could improve this with her and I did and she can now do at least those tasks relatively routinely when shes here....  But the attendance problems have just continued unabated.  I originally hired her on this unemployment program because I was actually extra sympathetic toward it because my SO was also on something similar and its what helped him get his first job in this country.  I think it wasnt her first time in the program.  How can I trust it again?  Anyway its pretty rare that we ever see someone from it because they basically have to network their way into a position.  Now I think Im a fan of internal hiring which is how most hiring happens to be done here...and its not like someone you know whose contract is expiring is any less needy.  ,Advice,d0c0p0l,1,t5_2qjdm

One difference  I have  guys whore stabbing me in the back but fronting to the boss theyre team players.  The boss wants zero confrontation and will let thing slide. They now know the boss is overruling me and they know they can pretty much do as they like.  The only major difference I have with your situation is that this has been going on for more than a year now. I have gone through various stages of anger annoyance passivity and pretty much every other emotion. I think I am now out the other side.  Instead of being annoyed I just laugh at the situation even when its annoying. I point out to the boss what their actions are going to cost in money terms and then add it up per week. Still nothing happens.  I couldnt even get the boss to agree that I can tell one of the guys to stop blowing smoke at customers even though hes been told not to smoke in front of the business. We are in the UK the laws on smoking at work are pretty thorough. Yet to stop confrontation  nothing can be said.  WORSE is the guy is doing it right in front of the cctv... while he should be working elsewhere... I pointed out who much of a fuck you it was... and was told to just tell him not to do it.  This kind of thing is why I know just dont give a shit.  I will at any and EVERY opportunity seek to fuck them up. If like me you cant leave right now because it pays well or theres nothing else to go to then learn to accept a shitty situation but make it work for you too. Let those who are fucking things up hang themselves.  If you boss asks for something and they delay or hinder you let your boss know things fucked up was late cost the business money because of their inaction or undermining.

7012674,0,t3_4boibk,alright supernasty here comes some advice that you may choose to do with as you wish! first ill start with my opinion on opportunity vs passion and safety. There is a pretty famous gentlemen by the name of mike rowe he is the producerhost of the show dirty jobs on the discovery channel. If you dont know the show Mike Rowe seeks out dirty jobs or jobs that are considering lower on the economic scale but are absolutely essential to our countrys back bone of structure. From these several years of compiling experience hes found many of these people have become extremely successful from opportunity. not from dream jobs or turning your hobby into your job but looking for opportunity! These people took opportunity and overcame any anxietysdiscomforts that came with it and then found passion in the area they worked in. I would say that this is an opportunity of course its not your dream job or something you see yourself loving but has the key ingredient of potential. and personally i think potential is all you need time will eventually take care of any discomforts and anxietys you have as you settle in to the new job. below is random possibly motivating jargon xD now ive read your post over and over again and weighd out the positives and negatives and honestly it seems like your sitting on the greener side of the fence if you were to take this new job. especially when you add in the fact that you have no college degree andddd life is short!!! do you really want to stay at the same position of  an hour for the rest of your life? or do you wanna have the chance to show you deserve to advance up the tree of corporate life. History has show that stagnation being still no advancement ends tragically. But those who are constantly taking leaps and bounds over the river of the unknown find success. Being stagnant in your life provides as much possible failure as does taking the leap the difference is that taking the leap alwaysssss has a better outcome if you succeed. Im extremley interested in scientific studys especially those that fail. when i see a rocket test fail i dont think i guess those scientist suck I THINK i bet those scientist learned a lot from that failure and the next rocket will perform even better!. actually i stole that from neil degrasse tyson xD an award winning scientist with a PhD in astrology. basically life is short. do everything with it that you can. dont be stagnant and take the leap. failing only means your learning! each time you do something wrong in this new job youll know what to do right the next time! i hope all the luck in the world for you and i know no matter what happens itll work out as long as you keep moving forward! ,Advice,d1b8fvo,2,t5_2qjdm

Theyre running a business.You may think you can stop your mental illness from affecting your work again. Frankly I dont see how you can honestly make that promise and I think thats immature but setting that aside then thats great. Stop it from interfering in work again but you need to accept that it wont be at this job. You made mistakes in calling out or you were subjected to a really crappy string of events that was out of your control. Either way it ended your employment and you have to accept that and move on.Part of growing up means realizing and accepting that life isnt always fair. Unfair things happen to you and you can waste your time fighting them and talking about how unfair they are or you can move on and improve your own life. Maybe right now you need to ask yourself why you are arguing against people so vehemently that you deserved a warning and should be rehired.

7337720,0,t3_4fuvyw,You can change your major whenever you like but first heres a cautionary taleI know a girl who changed her major no less than  times.  She is entering her eighth year of undergrad.  Whereas the average student loan debt here is about  she will be closer to  in debt when she graduates with a B average.  Probably in more debt actually.  She is a good person and it is terrible to see her in this position.  How did she end up here?Every time the going got tough she got dreamy.  She imagined how her life would turn out if she succeeded in a different program and she switched to that program.  Without any realworld experience in the new field she couldnt make a practical realistic decision about its difficulty level and her capability which was why she was able to dream about her success doing it so easily!If you are set on finance then my suggestion would be to take a year off next year.  At the very least do some job shadowing.  Talk to some upperlevel finance students about the difficulty of their courses.  I would bet you anything that youll find it no easier in finance than you do in computer engineering.Another alternative would be to address your dissatisfaction with your program an entirely different way.  If you drag out your program a little by switching to part time you might take longer to finish but get better grades.  You could also work part time and offset your student loan debt considerably by graduation plus pad your resume.  Additionally you could decide after a year that you do want to switch programs after all and at that point youve invested less in nonapplicable courses.  But I think you should be set on a switch for at least a year before going for it.Are you involved in any student clubs?  I think campus involvement and community outreachtype programs are key to enjoying your university program.  If youre able to teach people things that you learn during your program youll see its value much more quickly.So yeah what Id suggest is either  take a year off to figure yourself out or  slow down your degree a little to build up nondegree aspects of your resume.,Advice,d2c8y9u,1,t5_2qjdm

But right now she seems like she is in fun mode and fooling with that is a bad idea if youre not in fun mode either. To be honest dating her in general might not end well.

7430647,0,t3_4h0sb7,Heres something I wish I knew a long time ago... The way someone treats you is usually a means of excorcising their own inner turmoil. It very much sounds like something in Omars private life is causing him distress. Its no excuse for him to be shitty to other people but it helps to know why. I can promise you that calling him out on it publicly was the wrong move no potential for resolution. Ask to speak to him in private apologise for embarrassing him but mention that his behaviour has been really difficult to be around  noticeable and ask him if anything has happened thats stressed him out. Hell either tell you to fuck off in which case you cut him loose... Or hell appreciate someone giving a shit and choose to confide in you. Do it in private or youll just embarrass him again leading to another pointless attempt to display dominance. ,Advice,d2mtfq0,2,t5_2qjdm

7460791,0,t1_d2pc5nd,My dad has hit me in the past and actually used to do it pretty frequently  any time he got mad because he didnt feel like I was listening to him. When I was about eleven years old he slapped me so hard that my nose bled and my mom told him he shouldnt hit me anymore but he said he would discipline his kids in any way he wanted.I have three siblings and they all think my dad can be rather excessive at times. He doesnt butt heads as much with my older sister because they arent usually home at the same time. As for my younger brothers he seems to be more patient with them than he is with me but he has hit them before and they are scared of him when he gets angry. I sort of feel like my parents dont like me as much as they like my siblings because all the other kids in my family spend a lot more time with my parents. Ive been dealing with depression issues for about three years now and my parents make no effort to understand what Im going through or sympathize with me in any way. My mom offered to get me a therapist but the way that she offered made it seem like it was because I was a problematic kid who needed to be put back in line so I didnt want to go. The way she acted made me feel ashamed of being depressed because she made me feel like it was something I chose rather than something I feel stuck with. So Im happiest in my house when Im by myself when no one else in my family can criticize me or make me feel bad about myself.,Advice,d2q8ulq,1,t5_2qjdm

And the other thing that makes this weird is that what happened between the two of us was several years ago and its never been an issue until recently leading me to believe it has to be some other reason. Shes also treated two of my other friends we all used to work together the same way leading me to believe its something petty involving her previous employment. Which I had nothing to do with because I got fired for smoking weed in the parking lot several months before she changed jobs.

If I finally decide I cant be comfortable with her past I will have to end it. Your boyfriend likely thought he wasnt good enough for you to be dirty with. Because obviously you are capable of that kind of behavior and have made the choice to do those things in the past. So from his perspective doubts are reasonable... The squirting thing was definitely UNreasonable.

Were you not actually doing P.E? Are they doing this to your friend too? You might want to see a psychiatrist or a counselor outside of school one that can maybe write you a note excusing you from P.E. It sounds like youre young do you mind me asking what grade? If youre in middle school or younger a written note usually is good enough to excuse you from P.E. If your parents are willing to get involved have them fight the coach. Dont try and argue with him yourself. Have them tell him would you rather my child get in the physical activity where they are comfortable or not participate at all?

Its fine either way but if youre looking for advice you probably want to be more specific as to what youre having trouble with your diseaseillness what youre trying to find help with. I totally understand your frustration with GoFundMe but I can guarantee those are people who have popular social media accounts. I see more GoFundMe pages meeting their goals when it comes to events of extreme or sudden need so dont get too hung up on it. You might just need to advertise yourself a bit more  There are some subreddits that help with monetary needs but I cant recall the name of them at the moment. I would try those as well!Since you mentioned the gender and the single restrooms I assume that youre trans. Since you are in North Carolina I would recommend that you explicitly mention that in your GoFundMe. I know that may sound really awful but if you need the money its probably good to play the gender card. A lot of the success that you see on GoFundMe with people in similar situations to you is that they are very open and forward about their problems. You have need for help you have a good reason for help and youre allowed to share your sob story to get it. I dont know how much that helps you but thats the best advice I have based on what you posted.

7753974,0,t3_4lia2v,Depending on your job what you are doing can be different every few hours. Also if you love what you do it really helps.In an office job you can have a ton of different projects that are very different from each other. The work you are doing is very different. So your  hours is really broken up into smaller blocks of activities. I actually loved one of my jobs so much that I worked like  hour days. It was awesome.The same thing also happens in other jobs.Some jobs you do the exact same task for  hours take lunch then do it again for  more hours. Some people like those jobs and find doing the same thing over and over to be relaxing. Some people actually live their lives hating their jobs. They find happiness outside of it.

So if you learned to trust that you would do it eventually you could go from trusting family to best friends to friends and so on by slowly leaving that box of comfort you built around yourselfId say try trust exercises if you want to try things on your family like leaving money out seeing if they take it asking them to keep secrets trying to give them something to return to you. Plenty things you can try together. Maybe you just had a bad experience and thats why you dont trust people. Then just try to think of a way to overcome that experience now what caused it.Maybe youre just scared to trust people there are trust exercises like trusting people to catch you and such.

Its located in an area thats very profitable. Also this is my first place that I am buying by myself. I plan to proposing to my long term girlfriend within  years or so and Id like to think wed move to a largersingular home when we combine salaries and are eligible to look for more expensive places. As of right now i have only been approved for around k so for the area its not much. However the property we are looking at is only around k. The place itself is nice but the condo building itself is pretty old like I mention. Its well kept and I have spoken to the managers of the building at they have around  mil in savings in the case of a problem so its not like they are broke you know? My main concern is jumping into something and then having buyers remorse though I feel better knowing that  this wont be forever Ill move to a larger place.  I wont be strapped for cash.  Its in a good area. ,Advice,d47ku4f,1,t5_2qjdm

Thats something you will need to work out on your own and something that people tend to learn as the start to put that effort in.   Now even though youre fucking up high school dont give up on the idea of university.  Dont get me wrong thoughDO NOT GO TO UNIVERSITY UNLESS IT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.If you feel overwhelmed by your lack of prospects dont be.  I dont know what country youre from but the grading doesnt sound American so my advice might not work.  Heres what you do.  Go to a  year school.  Fucking destroy the  year school damn near perfect grades.  Learn how to become that person that doesnt fail at anything youll still fail at some stuff.  Become that person.  Maintain mostly As and you will look better than a very promising high school senior when university admissions is looking at your application.Before you proceed understand that whatever you choose will have a profound effect on your future.  For most working your way into university will bring about the most obvious route to success.Furthermore... medical school does not look at your high school transcript.  Thats why I am telling you..  if you enter a  year school DO NOT FUCK AROUND.  Figure it out OP.  But for the love of god do not enroll until you are ready.  Many people dont become ready to try until theyve been kicked around long enough by shit work that they just realize they cant go on for the next  years doing it. ,Advice,d48itas,2,t5_2qjdm

Its awesome that you are aware of your mental health and actively doing something to improve it.Okay. There is a reason why doctors will not diagnose a  year old and are reluctant to diagnose even an older teen. I dont need to tell you that everything changes between  its obviously the physical change but the hormonal change and the mental change can be brutal. It also means sometimes you feel like you dont know who you are or you dont recognize yourself as youve said. It is entirely possible you have DPD Im not a medical professional btw. Depersonalization can also be a symptom of depression which is how I learned about it. But at  and with everything happening with your mind its virtually impossible to diagnose because it could change again just as quickly. Next point if you do see a doctor and the doctor is concerned what sort of help are you expecting? A doctor would be really reluctant to medicate you I know that for antidepressants sideeffects can be more intense for teens. Probable action would be counselling. I do think counselling might be good for you even if just as a way to get some strategies to figure out how to react when this happens. Would your mom be willing to put you in counselling? You have a right to be concerned no matter your age. But your age does play into this and you may find that your doctor brushes it off as just turning into a teenager. If this happens dont be discouraged. Continue looking up strategies to support mental wellness on the internet and talk to your mom about counselling.,Advice,d4b52ua,1,t5_2qjdm

He will take this advice no where as any adult would expect . of kids to do.OP I suggest you simply explore different parts of life and what it has to offer. I was a relatively narrow minded kid when I was young and had my own viewpoint about everything which prevented me from fully exploring my own character. I was a quiet introverted kid where for the most part my life revolved around academics sports and video games as they were the only things I excelled in. I was itching to get out of my comfort zone and find new experiences which added a new exciting flavour to life. Being  now I eventually did change my ways but my only regret would be not doing it sooner. You just have to be willing to change your situation for the better which I can see youre serious about since you made this post. However it takes a new level of effort to realise there is change to be had and to ACTUALLY go through with it.

Dont have your phone out when people are talking to you make sure to greet other people and engage them in conversation when appropriate.But those are good advice for any internship. For yours dont be afraid to ask co works for help. Dont be afraid to ask for clarification on thinks from your boss but be sure to write things down so you only have to ask once. Doing that sends a strong message about your drive to get things done. Theyre taking you as an intern not because you have amazing skills but because they think youre someone they can invest into in order to create skills and with the hope youll pay them back in usefulness. They dont expect you to be super top dog developer they expect you to have a strong drive to learn and a good work ethic.Also dont brag about doing stupid shit like how drunk you got last weekend. Act interested when people talk to you even if you arent.I was in your shoes a few years ago in the US so I know it can be intimidating.

If she smiles and seems responsive enough then come up with a line hopefully not too corny... to ask for her number. However if you can visit again throughout your remaining week Id make sure to see her at least a total of  times before doing this. Test the waters with more organic questions before jumping in.

I would want to make sure that the contract you are writing is legal and enforceable because you can write whatever you want but if it wont hold up its not worth the paper its written on. Also call a few Real Estate lawyers to ask if there is such an ability. I understand the frustration but as well know that most landlords dont let you sublet without approval. That is in essence what is happening and if your future tenants wanted to make issue they could try. Good luck and sorry I couldnt help more. Oh one other thing here you can have boarders not tenants in respect to their rights. See if there is a distinction there. Also I believe landlords there can jack rent if on month to month so that may be a way to get them to opt out of living there if they break the rules. ,Advice,d53d4vt,1,t5_2qjdm

Sometimes I followed it up in the morning with the AM version of the same brand but thats up to you. You only need a swipe or two of the stuff at night because it can make you itchy if you use too much!Currently I use Certain Dri when Im going through a period of extra sweatiness it seems to come and go periodically for me for some reason? and my every day deodorant is Arrid XX and sometimes Arm amp Hammer Ive tried literally every brand of female deodorants and they dont work for me so I use mens unscented or the least scented stuff I can find.You could also check out rSkincareAddiction to see if they might have any suggestions.

8250553,0,t3_4sf7hi,Give yourself some time in your new position as drum major and see if your feelings towards it change. If fall rolls around and you still feel uncomfortable and dont enjoy being drum major ask your band director if you can have a conversation with them. Express that it was a bit more overwhelming for you than you had anticipated and that you are not interested in remaining drum major next season. They may encourage you to continue if they thought you did a nice job but you are not obligated to keep the position in following years if it is too mentally taxing. Your mental health and stress levels are much more important than the possibility of feelings of disappointment your director could have if they lose you as drum major.Since you are currently the drum major it would be quite unfair to the rest of the band leave your position during this current season assuming you are in the middle of rehearsing and are midway through learning a performance. However if you feel like this truly is not the position for you being honest to your band director is a good approach. Leaving the position inherently leaves an open space for another student that feels sure that the position would be an enjoyable one for them. Best of luck!

If it makes her feel loved and connected to you to see that text at the end of each day then why is it not important to you to try and make her feel loved and connected?Now that being said if you a making a genuine effort the you can ask her to recognize that you are trying and sometimes you might miss something. She needs relax how her response a little because it is not fair to you.Also when it comes to feeling slighted or conflict resolution you both need to go in with good will and assume the best of the other person.

8545271,0,t3_4wt73t,Heya. Just typing up some advice. Ill edit it in now. Posting already so you dont slit your wrists already First things first Calm down.Ok fair enough thats easier said than done. Let me try to walk you through it.It seems you have a problem. Something went wrong with your application to the good college. This might have been an error on their part on yours or both. The bad outcome is that you cannot start good college next month. Thats a bad thing. Its not life or death. Since humanity came into existence many people enjoyed life without going to college. Delaying it one year shouldnt destroy yours. So calm down about the consequences.Part two of calming downLike I said you have a problem. This problem might be solved. I can think of a few ways already though theyre not certainties. I want you to think of the best state of mind you can be to solve your problem. Would it be best to hide under your bed and cry? Would it be best to angrily run outside and shout at people? Would it be best to slit your wrists? Those things are not going to improve your situation in any way. In your case the best state of mind to solve your problem is to be calm to seek advice You already did this! Hurray! and look for solutions. Solutions If its night time try to sleep first it helps clear the mind. If you cannot because of the stress understandably write down a few solutions and action that you will do tomorrow. If its still daytime write your possible solutions down first anyway and then act on them. Here are some suggestions Contact the good college and explain your situation. Make sure they didnt make a mistake and got the right documents. Contact the community college maybe a mistake was made and they left out the five credits or sent the wrong documents. If it doesnt work out ask the good college if they can make an exception for you seeing your situation. If they dont make an exception explain your situation to the landlord and ask if you can have your deposit and rent back.ConcludingLife sucks sometimes. It just did for you. These moments in life happen to everyone. Theyre like a test. A challenge to overcome. Your reaction to these challenges is what can make you a succesful person. Do you cry slit your wrists or suck a million dicks? Or do you look for opportunities and solutions? Maybe you could get a really cool internship next year instead. Or do volunteer work. Companies dont only look at your college degree they also look for life experience. You now have the chance to get some.Im not saying its easy but its not meant to be always easy.

It will take you  hours of straight walking to get home with no stops interruptions or slow downs.Definitely see if a family or friend can pick you up. If that doesnt work call an uber.

8602661,0,t1_d6fw2ui,Thanks for the adviceI feel like I have a lot to work on and improve. I have been stuck with these thoughts now for over  years. Feeling like you are worth less as a human being because you havent had sex that many times is in itself ridiculous and it still annoys me that I know that and is still trapped in this emotional hell hole. It is probably a good idea to improve myself through a hobby or with new friends like with the folkschool. This year is going to be focused on improving myself.But in regards to the escort thing for her it will be about the money but for me it will be about experiencing even if it is fake a feeling of intimacy that I have been craving since I was thirteen years old. Giving me at least one positive experience and maybe removing some of the internal pressure I feel towards having sex. The reason why I feel so importantly about sex is because I dont have it. Maybe knowing that I planned on hiring an escort would lower the intensity of these thoughts and make room for another focus. My question that still bothers me is how can I attempt at growing as a person when sex is at the forefront is all my focus. Having a release for these urges would help me to focus on more important things. At least that is my logic. Thanks again for your advice I truly appreciate it    ,Advice,d6gxdcd,1,t5_2qjdm

8668905,0,t3_4ynzp2,After graduation most ppl enter a new social sphere be it collegeunijob and all those new people and new input really become time consuming thus old relationships always are kind of neglected. No need to panic its actually a good thing imho because it works like a strainer ppl you are important to and vice versa actual friends will stay in touch while friends will become irrelevant to some extent. There will be some disappointments for sure but a process like this will show you who your true friends are.I never had many friends in High School because I dont care about the amount of friends rather about the quality of a relationship and about what kind of human beings my friends are. Weve been a group of friends of maybe  people and we sure had times when we didnt have much contact at all because everyone was so entangled in their new social spheres that it was very difficult to stay in touch. Yet we managed to meet at least once a year and now after everyone pretty much settled all over the country starting families we try to see each other whenever possible because we want to have each other as part of our lives. We all have been friends for about  years now we try to go on vacations together or just small tripshikes we skype or chat etc.There have been many more ppl I called friends back in High School some of which I havent seen for years now. Any relationship needs to be of mutual interest in order to function properly. If one has higherdifferent expectations it will not survive from my experiences.With all this in mind try to meet new people at cc you can relate with you can have fun with who interest you etc. Meanwhile try to keep in touch with others who are important to you but if you feel they are not interested just let them go. If you meet again one day and things are still awesome its cool. If not who cares. ,Advice,d6p8eu5,3,t5_2qjdm

That gives you two  months to figure out a situation for your mom and for you to learn how to start taking care of yourself as well.Your mom may need to consider temp agencies for work. Theyre not great but theyre better than being unemployed. I didnt see specifics for your moms job field but it could be that being unemployed and not finding work really shook her. My dads company downsized and let all employees over  go because they were more expensive higher salaries. He couldnt find another job for  months and the one he did find was substantially less prestigious than the position he had before. The search and the settling for a lesser position really put him into a depression.  years later Im not sure hes fully recovered.  Both your mom and my dad still need to work because theyre not old enough to retire but it can help if family understands its tough.I hope you get under a doctors care and start working on your health.

8751367,0,t3_4zwt3a, First of all know that you are always loved you are always priceless you are always worth all the justice in the world and that what has happened to you does not define you.  Whatever you do this does not change please remember this. Because Im not sure what country you live in it will be a bit difficult for me to give specific advice or to brainstorm ideas of how to get extra help. But what I can do is give you some things that may make the situation better and that I will do. If and only if it is safe for you to do please consider reporting your assault to all applicable law enforcement as long as rape is a crime where you are.  In some countries this is not safe for a victim to do and in some rape isnt even a realistically enforceable crime but Im hoping yours isnt one of them. I know this is a scary thing to consider but if you can it may ensure you are your attackers last victim. Reading between the lines I think I can infer that the attacker is probably at least a few years older than you and so may have done this before and may continue to do so if not stopped at some point.  If others have been assaulted by him in a similar manner this will encourage them to report it and even if he is never convicted this will add credibility to your case and theirs. Logistically if you have any physical or electronic evidence of the crime this will immensely help you dont destroy or alter a single thing. Contact a lawyer if applicable to know what to do with it. Also if your university has a law enforcement placeofficer contrary to what seems logical dont go to them first. Often these have been proven to represent the university over the students.With your parents Id like to know what is detaining you from telling them what happened. If they care for you then they may already be able to tell that something bad has happened and they should want to help you to make it better.  They should support you in your healing however it goes and again I infer know why your academic life and life in general has suddenly changed. Sadly if they dont know this they may fill in the blanks in a way that may blame you for your assault and your sudden turn for the worse causing a rift between you and them. At the very least they should cut off all contact with your attacker and his family so that you are always safe in their home and in their lives. And even if you quit your university and enroll at its biggest rival it is pretty messed up of any of your family to cut you off just for that.As far as your academics go this is a bit more up to you in the end. This is a lot but it was what you asked about so Ill use  paragraphs here  I recommend you do some research on your particular university if you havent already to help you make more of in informed decision. If they dont have a measurable record of helping students who have been victims of crime sadly they may not be willing to help you. But if they have helped such students they will probably help you. And chances are if your family is apparently? willing to cut you off just for not being a student there they are both big and old enough to have had other students in a similar situation.  Also look up the particular roles of the administration of your university. There might be someone who is better suited to be an advocate for you and that is the person you should be meeting with. In universities in my country the job title of such a person is dean of academicsstudents and it is their job to make sure the school is doing its best to make sure as many of the students as possible are succeeding including and especially those who may need a little extra grace due to being severely assaulted. If you go to a really good university this person may have the power to reenroll you as a student again and assign you to a new academic adviser even if that means firing the old one.  Some more details They may be hesitant to offer services of this nature since it is costly to the university so it is reasonable to expect some kind of investigation to be sure that you are telling the truth. This is where going to law enforcement will help if you can do so. By being able to prove that you have gone to the police you have not invented this situation just to make university easier. But when you meet with them be sure to be very wise about what you say. Make sure to keep it about you and what happened to you and how that academic dismissal is only making it worse. While Im pretty sure the man who attacked you does not have more moneyinfluence than your entire university this isnt about him. In all of this keep in mind all the things the person who assaulted you has done to make sure you do nothing about that crime. It means that as much as he can threaten you that he is really scared of what happens if you do something about it. In effect he may now be more scared of you than you have ever been of him. It is up to you to do what you will about this and even if it is nothing more than reading this post and living on that may suffice. The statement I opened with I will close with. Know that you are always loved you are always priceless you are always worth all the justice in the world and that what has happened to you does not define you.

I would definitely want to get the message through to the kids mom but you need to talk about it tactfully so she doesnt get all defensive. Maybe go about talking specifically about the behavior not the child. Ie Some of the behavior that Ive observed has made me uncomfortable. Most kids typically enjoy animals and play with them but Ive seen her on multiple occasions trying to hurt the cat and deliberately put the cat in danger...  Being punitive does not seem to phase her and when she does get punished her reaction is sometimes peculiar and she finds the situation funny.  Dont make her mom feel like shes backed into a corner just try to be very calm and understanding. Make her feel like youre playing on her team. If you want to consider getting her evaluated Id be happy to help you find someone for her to see.

I grew up poor too so I understand its not so easy to just pull yourself up by the bootstraps when you have no resources. But lets break this down. You need a mentor of sorts. Someone who can help you do things like learn to drive get a job get out of that cycle of your moms house etc. Is there anyone you know like that? An uncle a relative etc? Girlfriends parents? Former teachers friends parents? Not someone who can solve all your problems but someone who can just help you get those one or two lucky breaks you desperately need.If not have you considered joining a church or something like that? Now Im an atheist but I  think sometimes the community of churches can be helpful. It would be an easy place to get a mentor.  Once you get yourself established... you need to figure out what to do next. Can you get a job where you live and maybe get your own place? If so are there trade schools or colleges around where you can train? If not can you leave? Any bigger city will have jobs even if they arent great. And even though it sucks youre going to have to work yourself up unless you can find a lucky break. You dont want to work in the oil field anyway even if it comes back I know the industry and the kind of people who work in the field. The tricky part is you need to really find a place you can afford get a job that pays enough and also work on your skills so you can get a better job. Education whether vocational technical university medical etc is going to be your best bet.Now for the personal side. Youre not a baby. You want out and have very reasonable reasons why. Dont give up dont doubt yourself. Like I said I dont know you but I grew up with poor people and I now work with many successful people. You seem closer to the latter than the former based on my reading of your attitude. But heres the thing you have to make a plan you have to strategize you have to improve yourself and most importantly you have to keep fighting. Dont let others drag you down. I know how some poor people do. Theyd rather drag you down than see you shine. They will constantly try to make you feel weak and small if you dont conform to their standard.,Advice,d7ad19i,3,t5_2qjdm

8852588,0,t3_51h6xu,Im a  year old dude whos pretty much in the same boat as you. Never kissed anyone Ive had  girlfriends but they were both online and one of them Im still not  sure was who she says she was. Im like this too though the smallest little interaction makes me feel over the top with joy and I cant get them out of my head. I can still remember the first time it happened when I was  and some girl let me cut before her in line for some water slide. I was over the top with joy and couldnt stop thinking about her for weeks. That was just the beginning of it though this has gone on for years with me and at the very least I can still picture whoever gave me that little bit of attention that swept me off my feet. Hell some girl was just being nice to me at ChickFilA on Friday and I cant stop thinking about her.I have a theory on why there are people like myself and you and let me know if any of these sound like youAs you mentioned youve never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl. Right now youre probably feeling that bit of existential dread that everyone around you is in a relationship and you long for that. Just something as simple as knowing that someone cares for you more than they do everyone else is a very strong desire in many humans. As each day passes you long for a relationship more and more. Right now youre probably clinging to that desire of wanting something more and grasping at straws for a relationship. Its only natural to want a mate its a primitive thing. You dont want to be alone which is also a natural feeling. My advice for you is to not go down this path that Im already stuck on. Dont sell yourself short dude. Its clich but there are plenty of people out there for you. You just gotta be willing to take a leap of faith and not be afraid of rejection like I am. I know its hypocritical for me to say that but take it from a dude who feels alone every day. At the end of the day if they dont like you then they just werent the one. But there are still plenty of people out there far better than that person. Sorry if my ramblings make no sense. Sometimes I just type what Im feeling and look back and realize it could be an incoherent mess to someone who doesnt think like me.I wish nothing but the best for you my dude.

I can understand not wanting to rock the boat but if you stay it will just make you miserable and cause more conflict.           I recommend going out and trying to find yourself a place to rent either in university accommodation or a shared house with other students. Covertly move all your things out bit by bit without your Dad realising or just do it while theyre out. Sit the parents down and just say it straight its happening deal with it.               With super strict conservative parents with you out of sight they start to miss you more and let more things go. For it to work though they need to realise they cant force you around anymore and the more dependent on them you are the easier it is as they know youll likely to back down take away his car lock him out the house etc.            I wont pretend like it will go down well if you get cut off you might have to look for a loan andor job to help you out. Maybe appeal to your mother and she can convince your dad to back down. If they still are trying to control you cut them out of your life until they are willing to support your decision even if that means you suffer for it. At the end of the day youre  youre an adult at university. Your Dad needs to realise that this shit isnt going to fly you arent some  year old who can be screamed at and beaten.

Im a bit unclear on the situation as a whole but I can try to offer some objective nonjudgemental advice here.Basically it sounds like you got a great guy on your hands. But hes got a heap of baggage. Its perfectly understandable to have your trepidations about it. Itd be more unfair to the children if you stayed and couldnt bring yourself to care about them and could only see your missed opportunities in them. Ultimately it all comes down to if you can bring yourself to help raise kids that are not your own. If you feel you cant theres no shame in leaving. Thats a lot to deal with. It might be painful but nowhere near as painful as it would be a couple years down the road when it blows up in your face. I say at least meet the kids and frame the question more like whether or not youd be willing to give up biological children for someone elses kids but rather if youd be willing to give it up for THOSE kids.Sorry I dont have personal experience to draw on. I have known people who have entered a situation like that but I dont know how they felt about a biological family beforehand.

Killing a farm animal is very aggressive.Its up to your parents to make sure their dog is well trained and looked after. That means making sure its on a leash and and in their control. The dog wasnt under control in this situation and killed a goat. What happens the next time the dog isnt under control? Is it going to snap at a person? Go after a child? Honestly there isnt anything you can do but take this as a learning situation.

8924683,0,t3_52imo5,As someone who played video games I get the point.Video games are have purpose in two way.Their purpose is to be fun while you play them. They also have a purpose within them which is to win or complete them with a good score. However life isnt a simple that. Actually it is good thing that your are not motivated in the place which you are currently in because what is it that should motivate you? In my opinion it is better to not be motivated at all than to be motivated by the wrong reasons.It seems that you are searching for a purpose and a mission just like in video games given how you are considering joining the military but are you aware of what the military actually does? If we we are going to be strictly honest the people in the military go to kill period. And every one else just helps them kill. Even the medics in the military are merely attempting to remedy the effects of two or more people attempting to kill each other. The military will give not give you a meaningful purpose they will instead command you to obey and either murder or help murder someone else. Being a medic in the military may be a good and noble goal or objective but the reality is that it essentially that the job of the medic is to heal and in a military setting that often means looking at dismembered and butchered bodies. So if you feel that is what you want to do then you are a very good and noble person.I personally feel that video games are providing you with not only entertainment but with a temporary purpose or objective which is what you have yet to find.Secondly do not confuse your grades with an assessment of your intelligence. I get how looking at a C on a paper may appear to be more credible than your parents commentary on how smart you are but there is more to it than that. If you are not interested or motivated by the material in school then you are not going to do as well as you actually can.Simple.Actually it seems that your intelligence is not a C. It rather seems that your motivation is C. There are plenty of individuals with A grade intelligence who get Cs or even Fs because they do not try and they do not try because they do not feel that they have a motive to do so they lack motivation because they do not see the point to an A.Honestly your world isnt going to shit. You have a one thousand dollar computer and you live in the suburbs your world is far better than most on the other High School Juniors in America.Imagine a world class gamer who has a rich and fulfilling life with all the luxuries and happiness in the world. Suddenly he steps on a thorn which is then lodged in his toe a thorn which for some reason he doesnt remove for months. After a weeks or even after a few days its going to be such a pain that it is going to cause him to become frustrated and even angry every time he steps on it. That anger and frustration will make it seem like his world is going to shit because the hurt it causes will be his point of focus. However once he manages to remove it he will no longer be hurt and he will be able to see every wonderful thing around him once again. Your lack of purpose is your thorn.Once you are able to remove the thorn find your purpose you will be able to be happy while still being in school and while living your parents house.Find your purpose and the whole world will appear to change. You do not need to change the whole world it seems you only have to find your purpose or that point in life for you.Only you can find your point or purpose in life.,Advice,d7km6si,2,t5_2qjdm

9017207,0,t3_53rhvz,Ive had spells in life where making friends was really hard too. Im kinda in one now because of a lot of reasons. But many years ago I realized it was way better to not have any close friends than to have close friends whose influence would only be negative. The drug dealer dude is probably one of those folks. You should consider that he may not actually want to be friends with you but get close to you so he can see what he can steal from you or want you to be his accomplice in stealing things. Not the kind of company you want to keep.Consider hanging out in a different more constructive place you maybe havent yet. Finances and getting to those places on the regular might be hard at the moment but if you can find something like a library community center community college campus or church youth group nearby that would be a start. Even just different clubssocial groups at school are an option. All of those places are generally freereally cheap to just go hang out at and have regulars you can get to know. Or apply for part time work if you can retail places are going to be looking for people really soon for the Christmas rush. Even if those arent a great option because you live like  miles from everything getting onto some new more positive subreddits might be a good change of scenery. It sounds like you are almost an adult and one perk of many of that is that you can be friends with people of different ages without it being that weird.  Most of my current local IRL friends are actually older than my parents likewise Im younger than most of their kids and it really isnt that awkward anymore. Another perk about adult friendship is that the things that people look for in friends gets a lot less complicated. So you can have successful friendships with people who are different and its not a big deal since everyone is generally happy to have friends. I hope all this helps. ,Advice,d7vq7k9,1,t5_2qjdm

She was unfair in thinking I wouldnt be dedicated to her or our children if we had them together. She disagreed all because I was trying to sound tough and decisive when she asked me about kids that night in the pub.  That part really hurts how I thought we could have had a future. And how I wanted to take back what I had said and some how prove what my heart really desired. And fuck how come I wouldnt care for my own children?I told her I couldnt handle texting or talking to her anymore. She was in agreement.I said we might be able to talk again in  months or a year.  We could check up on each other.  She said she hopes its sooner. I said if she wants to visit Winnipeg or try again she knows how to find me.Im very sad.  Trying to be strong. Lastnight I raved and cried in my car and it took me a while to calm down. I had a good friend come over and we smoked cigars drank rum and we talked and had a few laughs.  Today I hung out with my father and let him know what was going on with me.  Told him I was on meds and really depressed. Uncertain about my direction.  My dad said she wasnt the one.  But that I was close.Im fantasizing about her one day realizing that I would have been wonderful.

The problem is feelings easily override logic and this is how people get stuck in abusive relationships etc. So while you shouldnt ignore it dont place it highest on the list. Feelings are often fleeting what seemed such a good idea a moment ago seems stupid once done and logic takes back over.But what we have here is logic and feelings at an impasse. It makes sense to leave but it feels right to stay.

9086398,0,t3_54qaik,Its more the owners that do it than the dogs themselves. They build an image round the dog and it effects the owners.Take for example the Stoffordshire Bull Terriers or Staffies. Lovely dogs a bit dumb looking but great family pets. However in the last  years theyve been taken in by god owners who are looking for a tough dog. They are shit dumb owners who dont train their dogs get angry when they misbehave even though its because the owner didnt train it right and that anger gets transferred to the poor dog who barks a lot and growls. Its a trend and as such people see that staffy and it gives off an image of the owner essentially stopping good owners from getting it. Of course some dogs are more likely to being vicious than others but at the end of the day the dogs have been living with humans for s of years and are bred to live alongside us as companions. An old best friend had a staffie and it was a sweet dog. Ive know German Alsatians that are great. My dog Lhasa apso once chased  of them round a park and it was hilarious to see it. Breeding is also a terrible thing for dogs. Cross breeds tend to naturally more healthy dogs as they mix the stronger genes from the two to make a better dog. The Brittish bulldog actually has all sorts of health issues and a stupidly short lifespan due to years of breeding. Besides does everyone think dogs just kept to themselves before humans came along? No dogs were free to fck each other all day long and make lots of mixed puppies.,Advice,d841egi,1,t5_2qjdm

9138065,0,t3_55ga5e,Id like to start off by saying that as a Christian I am very sorry that people have literally been giving you Hell over this and though I am far from being terribly knowledgeable Ive yet to find something backing up their statements. Secondly Id say that the most likely reason is social. Its drilled into most peoples brains either actively or passively that the way life goes is you get a license at  you go to college at  you get a degree you get a job find a partner get married buy a house and have . kids. So to step outside of that will get you as many reactions as telling people that you dont believe in cars and would rather walk am hour to work every day. Now even if it would take you an hour of traffic to drive there add money and nuisance and messes with the ecosystem people are gonna flip out. Just because its outside the norm and people dont psychologically and socially like things that are decidedly notnormal.

I dont know your experience or skills so this is more a general suggestion but I would say try to get work in the legal field whether it is a private law firm or for a government agency. I know this is easier said than done but these entry level jobs typically pay k on average with family benefits. They tend to be typical  and are mostly desk jobs with very few requirements  qualifications and I feel like some of your experience working for the restaurant may transfer over such as expenses customer service managing people etc.... Look and see if your city hall or district attorneys office is hiring anybody. Im  and Im making k working as a corporate paralegal for a law firm.

If you dont get anywhere with the manager of the complex go down to city hall and there should be a department of real estate and theyll have someone who deals with tenantlandlord issues. They may be able to help you out but since you live on a privately owned complex it may be out of their hands. Next step would be to call the actual company if there is one the contractor belonged to and complain there. If all else fails call your local news stations newspapers etc. and let them know.

Have the bills sent to the PO Box so she doesnt see them.  Keep your finances separate.  I dont know if shed actually steal your money but it sounds like you cant be too careful.  But mainly focus on education.  If you can get scholarships then that is the biggest thing that will help you out.  And if you cant then just save up as much money as you can and try to get yourself into school.  Remember just having a college degree isnt an instant ticket to a good job.

Depending on the laws of your country it can qualify as rape or sexual assault but either way its a crime. You raped her. Theres no denying it.I dont care what your other brain thought. She doesnt care. The criminal law doesnt care. Its pretty easy to tell if someone wants to have sex or is asleep. And if youre not sure you ask. You dont just shove your hand down their pants. Your feelings for her are not an excuse. Your hormones are not an excuse. There are no excuses. You raped her.gt Shes my bestfriend and I dont want to loose her.  Is there anything I can do to fix it?No good news here you already lost her. Theres no fixing it. You fucked up and the only thing you can do now is not to fuck it up further. My advice would be  if you have any way to contact her  to leave her a note. Dont expect a reply dont start a conversation just a message. Tell her youre sorry and aware of what youve done. Say you are willing to do anything to fix it and to face the consequences. Dont make excuses. And  this is important  say youre not going to contact her again unless she contacts you first. You owe it to her.Dont think of yourself now. I know youre guilty and lost and afraid but at this point it really doesnt matter. Think of her. She has just experienced one of the most traumatic things that can happen to a person. And it was done by someone she trusted. Shes probably still in shock and when it wears off shell be more lost and hurt and terrified than you have ever been. Her life will be in pieces. And its your fault. Im typing all this because Ive been in her place. The situation was hauntingly similar I was staying at my best friends place for a few days we lived far away from each other and one evening we said goodnight and went to sleep in separate rooms. When I was already asleep he came to my room to bring me a glass of water or something and I woke up with his fingers inside me. For a few days I was in shock and I didnt fully realise what happened. I would trust this guy with my life  just like your friend probably used to trust you  and it was almost impossible to process what he had done to me. But for those few days I was also sore  I mean in physical pain no one wants to have anything put in their vagina when theyre not aroused its dry and not ready and it fucking hurts  and the pain reminded me every waking second that it did actually happen. I wanted to kill myself.Its been two years and I still sometimes wake up at night terrified. Im in a long term relationship with the most caring loving boyfriend and sometimes we cant have sex because in the middle of it I start crying and shaking and I cant stop. Rape fucks you up. For a long time and possibly for the rest of your life.I hope this poor girl gets therapy. i hope she gets help.

9436735,0,t3_59xqp1,The way grading scales are set up in the US it is very difficult to raise your grade after its low. Usually the lower grades impact you more than making a higher grade. A . GPA is not terrible but its not great. But the good thing is there is definitely room for improvement.If you still feel like you are still transitioning to being familiar with schools here I recommend to you to look in to attending a community college. They usually have smaller class sizes and the professors are more personable to you. Also they usually require a lower GPAACTSAT score to attend. I went to a community college and they only required a  ACT score which is around a . GPA. If you cant get that score usually they offer an untimed test for placement and then allow you to take remedial courses once youre accepted.There is definitely hope for you. Some community colleges partner with larger universities so you can get a Bachelors degree without ever leaving the community college. You can always transfer to a university after you get your Associates which is what I did. Just make sure the community college is highly accredited so your classes have more of a chance of transferring. The best thing about a community college is they are way cheaper than universities for the same courses. I got my general education courses out of the way at my community college for under  a semester. This semester at my current university priced by the credit hours and not by course it is over . This is really good if you dont know exactly what major you want to go for just say your major is general education so you have that out of the way at the very least before moving on to a university as every school is going to require those classes for any major.Just because your grades are low doesnt mean you will be doomed to work a minimum wage job for the rest of your life.

State that such a tremendous change would naturally have been widely announced so until you hear from the executive level that the protocolprocess has been replaced with a new method companywide you are continuing on as youve been trained.   If that doesnt stop it consider going over her head about the ridiculousness of the entire situation.  State that you cannot be productive with a boss that is directing you in the exact opposite manner than the manner in which the company has trained you.  ,Advice,d9ga82b,1,t5_2qjdm

9494878,0,t3_5atv0b,Its important to recognize that rejection may happen but try not to dwell on it too much. Really youre in an ideal situation many young men put asking women or even just interacting with them for years and years which only makes the situation worse. By starting now you save yourself a lot of trouble later. I know this probably wasnt what you had in mind when you asked but Id like to mention it because if you read through radvice and rrelationships or what have you they are littered with people in their mid twenties in the same position as you are  just starting to venture onto the dating game only they have less time to figure it out.Honestly rejection is the easy part. Acceptance is the hard part because if she says yes then you have to plan all this shit out. If she says no you say Aw okay. Thanks for your time! Smile and walk away. The end. Its unnecessary to say anything more. Respect her choice thank her for her time and go about your business. Maybe have something planned in twenty minutes that you really need to get to so if it goes south you can walk away purposefully and not linger. Dont linger. Dont cajole. Dont beg. Dont ask Why not? Its none of your business and if you ask youre basically asking her to defend her choice which is stupid and shitty. If she tries to apologize smile and tell her she doesnt have to apologize.Anyway I would strongly advise against suggesting a movie. While it is the traditional fare it is also a terrible way to get to know someone. Youre both focused on something other than each other and you cant even really discuss it while it happens. Dinner is also dicey because you might realize five minutes in that this really is a waste of time but by then youre committed to wait the rest of the evening.I really recommend going to coffee with her. Its a public setting so both of you will feel safe this isnt terribly important now but when and if you start meeting strangers on the internet in real life having a safe place do do so is good it can go for however long it takes you to finish your drink or for hours and youre there focused on each other more than whats on a screen or whatever event you might have otherwise chosen.In my experience first dates are always awkward. This is to be expected youre two people with no common background whatsoever taking time out of your lives to see if there is some middle ground. You and she will flail a bit until you hit upon a common interest. As awful as it can be dont worry about long awkward pauses. In fact most of the time they happen I just make a flippant comment about it and usually whoever Im on a date with laughs and agrees and the conversation resumes. Dont be afraid. Embrace whatever happens. At the very least youll learn to roll with the punches and how to recover from something.As for conversation this can be the most difficult thing to figure out. Again youre starting with basically nothing and trying to make something. That is always going to be challenging. The trick Ive found that works the best is to get the other person to talk about themselves. This isnt to stroke their ego but to learn about them and ask them questions about their history and what theyve experienced. Some of the best stories Ive heard come from this tactic. Get her to talk about what she did in the past year and select topics she brings up and expand on them.Oh you went to Mexico? Whyd you go there? Who did you go with? Its important to ask openended questions. If you say something like Did you have fun? Shes going to say Yes. And then thats that. Instead ask her what she did why she did it would she do it again what were the most and least memorable experiences etc. Sometimes talking about bad experiences can be bonding  remember to be supportive and sympathetic Wow that really sucks but that makes a great story!In the end remember that youre still learning and if its a horrible fuck up well next time will be better.

When youre in a place forced to interact with people like the military you will make friends or at least friend no matter what. You dont have to try because youre suffering together so as long as youre not talking about jacking off over dead bodies or something similarly weird youll be fine. I think you should relax work out a bit to make the transition better and then just take it a day at a time. I dont know how different Air Force boot camp is but I heard its relatively cake compared to other ones. just try not to get too depressed and once you reach training after boot camp youll basically enjoy the benefits of a party college basically.I think if you really need a distraction until your time to go start off with tinder and just spam Yes on everyone to eventually have conversations with people in your area. Again I just want to say that your life is in limbo sort of so what you do concerning new friendships might not matter much. If you make a connection its going to be hard to keep it as you move across the country. If all else fails join a hobby group around with something easy like pottery or art or DnD or even volunteering looking for new players that sticks you in a room you cant leave from and have to interact with people. I hope this helps. Dont sweat not having time to talk to people when you stand watch you will have to talk to make sure you arent bored to tears. Even the antisocial eventually talk because there is literally nothing else to do. See if you like anyone and eventually youll have a friendship with people with enough time to see your good side and like you.

Gaming is enjoyable but doesnt build your life in a way that gives you longterm happiness and can distract you from your actual problems. Take that time and start doing other things that make you happy. Do you have any other interests or hobbies other than gaming? Even ones that you havent done in a while? Getting fit and just being slightly active is major in terms of its overall effect on your health and mental health. Regularly exercising can help boost your selfesteem help you sleep better and make you happier. Start off by going for walks or runs. If you can do them outdoors even better. You dont need to count calories. And you dont even need a real gym. The outdoors and a treadmill are a great way to start. And if you want to add in some things like crunches pushups plank squats etc even better! In terms of what youre eating start off by making sure that youre getting nutritious food  veggies fruit dairy etc. Then you can start reducing the amount of junk food youre eating.

Also you didnt ruin your parents life they are just fine. They are uppermiddle class and they have a son who wants to take care of them and doesnt want to send them to a retiring home. They are doing pretty good in comparison to the rest of the world and even of this country. They may have just never learned how to balance work and parenting.gtI dont see it that way. I dont want to send them to retiring home aka concentration camps. I owe them everything.That is very nice and kind of you!  And I feel that you are very admirable for doing so. However they are responsible for their health right now. You all seem to agree that your little brother should control his attitude. But that should go double for your parents. They should learn to not worry or become frustrated because they have the option to think clearly and deal with things effectively in a more peaceful state of mind. Just like your brother may have the option to have a better attitude by being more respectful your parents have the option to have a better attitude by being more healthy in their emotions. You do not control your parents emotions therefore you are not responsible for their health because they choose how to live their own lives. They have a son who seem to genuinely care about them they did pretty great in my opinion.gtYou misunderstood me. I said I dont want him to be sedated by medicament such as Ritalin. I would never do such a thing.I apologize it was my mistake.gtI try to. I bring him to movies cool activities...But I am full time student  jobs and training time is lackingAnd that will have an effect and it will be a good effect because you seem to be a good big brother. It is important for him to have fun but it is also important for him to have some legit advice and wisdom which you definitely have. A full time student with two jobs is person who is very responsible and has a great amount of life experience. Therefore you only need to figure out what has worked out for you what has helped you keep it all together and make it even better.Then try share those type of gold nuggets to your little brother by telling him your experiences how you learned and how you made it better. All little brothers look up to their big brothers so he will be listening attentively if you talk to him as a friend. He doesnt want to be lectured about what he should do he is already getting. But he may want to know made his big brother so cool besides video games and movies what keeps him working  jobs while going to school. Little brothers just love the tall tells of success and general coolness regarding their big brothers. You dont have to force him to listen to your own experiences and lessons because he wants that. He doesnt want lectures and punishments but I assure you he definitely admires his big brother.Anyways it seems likeYou are a very caring son and big brother who works and goes to college. It is admirable. You are a very very admirable person.,Advice,da0ypst,2,t5_2qjdm

To reach out to another is to risk involvement    To expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self.   To place your ideas and dreams before a crowd is to risk their loss.    To love is to risk not being loved in return    To live is to risk dying    To hope is to risk despair    To try is to risk failure.   But risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.    The person who risks nothing does nothing has nothing is nothing.  He may avoid suffering and sorrow    But he cannot learn feel change grow or live.   Chained by his servitude he is a slave who has forfeited all freedom.   Only a person who risks is free.

9842637,0,t3_5g6yj1,Criminal record.  You indicate that your plea agreement resulted in a type of conviction that could be expunged.  You need to visit with a lawyer to find out more about the expungement how to get it done and when it can be done and what the ramifications are after that.  I am not a lawyer but I think that after a conviction is expunged that you can legally and properly answer an employment question asking if youve been convicted of a crime as no.  Ask your lawyer about that.Also ask your lawyer about how the conviction after expungement will impact background checks.  You should also determine how it might impact licensing for occupations you are considering by inquiring directly or hiring your lawyer to do this for you.   Your basic question will be something along the lines of  I was arrested years ago for shoplifting when I was a teenager but there are no convictions on my record and have a clean record other than that incident.  Will this prevent the board from approving a license for me?.  Of course this assumes that by the time you complete qualifications and are ready for licensing that you have had the felony conviction expunged.You should use this information along with your own desires in choosing a career.  For example it makes no sense becoming a licensed electrician if the board which issues electrician licenses would never issue a license to someone with an arrest record even if that arrest never resulted in a conviction.  I dont think this would be the case just using this as an example.  As far as a career  You should check out vocational job certificate type offerings at your local community college or other community colleges around you.  A job certificate program qualifies you for entry into a job without the work and classes needed for an associate degree.  This might include things like bookeeping medical assistant medical record billing medical equipment technician computer programing network administration mechanics design HVAC etc.  There are also trades such as electrician carpentry plumbing etc which usually have training through trade unions but I understand that these generally are not that popular among females.The key is to find a career that you are interested in and believe you can do the work to qualify for and then get the education to qualify for that job.  Some jobs require a full degree and some just training specific to that job and some jobs dont require any advance training.You might also find that there are some jobs where you can start now at a basic entry level position and work up through the company by taking advantage of a companys tuition reimbursement program if they have one.  Just as an example you might start out as a receptionist or a filing clerk in the accounting department and take accounting or bookkeeping courses to qualify for a higher level job in that department.,Advice,daqiol2,1,t5_2qjdm

Basically its harder to prove that anything even occurred. All I did in the end was help my friend who was assaulted the best way i could and that was just being there for her anytime she needed someone to rely on. You can report to police now because doing something late is better than doing nothing at all. Or you can wait until Natalie gets hurt and then report immediately. Stop this dude or dont get involved at all.,Advice,dbr1h6y,1,t5_2qjdm
10123436,0,t3_5kw8aj,I have been in this situation myself and dont worry you will find what you are meant to do. I spent  years at university doing a degree that I hatedpublic relations then I changed to another degree media which I am  years into and nearly finished but I dont know if it is a field that I want to spend the rest of my life in. This year I took a chance and started a second degree studying environmental science and I love it! Its completely different to what I am used to studying but Im really enjoying it.My advice is just take some time to really think what you are passionate about whether it be arts sciences even travel and then apply that to your study. In saying that just finish something. Whether it be a degree or a certificate just finish it. If you dont want to work in retail for the rest of your life youve just got to bite the bullet and do it.Overall if i was you I would take maybe a month or  off even longer if you need just to figure out what you want to do and what you are really passionate about. Then you can apply that to what you study.If worst comes to worst and you still have no idea Just finish the degree you are studying for now just suck it up for a couple of years and smash it. Because if you arent willing to work retail for the rest of your life whats a couple of years of hating studying compared to a lifetime of hating work. ,Advice,dbr39eg,1,t5_2qjdm

Its flattering that whatever Im doing is what he wants to do Im sincerely flattered by that But at the same time I think he could go about this in a less childish way.  Its so bad my mother in law has noticed and said that I should say something  to him. This was immediately after he told me he wanted a guitar. I think youre right. I need to pull him aside privately and speak with him in a very nonjudgmental way. I really dont hate this kid. He is completely  fine person. Its just like I said in my op I just dont gravitate towards his personality type. No harm no foul. He put some bullshit status on fb talking about if you wanna be successful you have to take the stairs. Well he has no education no skills and only has his salary job that has no job description thanks to his dad. I have worked for everything I have. Military then collage and now working on masters first person in my entire family to go to college we are hillbillies. So this struck a nerve with me. So I said something.

10142128,0,t3_5l7fnz,This is quite an interesting situation. As parents they are probably most concerned with your privacy and physical wellbeing. The stereotype about college guys is they party and indiscriminately hook up with random women so from the outside your parents probably assume your roommates are a bunch of bros who wont care about you when push comes to shove. Even though your parents met two of them your parents are still going to err on the side of assuming that those guys are bros like everyone else.The best way to convince your parents to stop worrying is by showing them success. Do they come to visit often? Do you talk on the phone or facetime with them often? If so I recommend purposefully without telling them your intentions having them over or talking to them at times of the dayweek when if your roommates were terrible the environment should be a trainwreck. For example have them stop by on a SaturdaySunday morning and welcome them into a clean quiet place...or callfacetime with them on a Friday night at pm when the place is lowkey. Itll give them visual proof that youre in a safe controlled environment. Again dont point out that youre purposefully doing these things just do them and let them see for themselves. Parents rely on visual firsthand proof to formulate their opinions. You could tell them all day everythings great! but until you show them they wont believe you.Now if you just said to yourself Have them over on a Saturday morning? Talk to them on a Friday night? Are you insane? My place will be hopping at those times! then it might be best for you to reconsider living with those three guys.As a  yearold guy who went to one of the toprated party colleges in America I can tell you from personal experience that most college guys arent as emotionally and mentally mature as college girls. Theyre not going to understand or care that youll want the place to be somewhat clean. And unless youre rooming with the nerdy crowd you will wake up on some weekends and find passed out randos in the living room. If that makes you nervous then again I recommend reconsidering your decision to live with those guys.,Advice,dbtiuz2,5,t5_2qjdm
10144657,0,t3_5l5k1e,I have almost completed my bachelors degree with a perfect GPA in physics and applied mathematics but the usefulness of my advice will depend on your majoruniversitystatecountry disclaimer Im not in the US.  Obviously you should attend all classes regardless of when theyre on yes even am classes on a Monday or if you think its a waste of time or if you already know it all. Always take the approach that unless youre getting  theres something you dont understand or arent doing as well as you could be. Professors also occasionally give out extra credit attendance credit or hints for exams and when you need an extension on an assignment you want the professor to know who you are and like you as a student.  University is not like highschool where there are many rules and governing bodies to fight for your rights and for fairness. University is very hierarchical and you only get ahead if the right people like you. Makes friends with your professors and tutors and they will give you opportunities that they do not afford to anyone else. Annoy your professors with complaints about grades or ask them to bump your grade and they may actually hide opportunities from you. Dont think of yourself as a customer think of yourself as an apprentice. Dont piss off your mentor and dont expect anything because it is your right or because you deserve it. Remember that you mean nothing to the university when they have thousands of people wishing and waiting to take your place.  Make sure you have somewhere to write down all of your upcoming assignmentstestslabsetc. I use a whiteboard sitting above my deskcomputer where I can see it every morning and night. My entire life is contained on that whiteboard. I write down everything that needs remembering and do not remove anything until it has been handed in or fully completed. Never trust your memory because it will eventually let you down.  Start all assignments immediately when you get them if not early. You never know what questions youre going to have extra trouble with and starting quickly will leave you with a safety net in case something happens that week. I had a  hour gap in my classes one day with no work to do so I asked the professor if I could have that weeks assignment a few hours early. He said yes. A year later he agreed to give me the second major in mathematics without having to complete all required units because he said he knew I was a hard working student refer to point . Try to relate the things youre learning to other ideas. Memorising facts and equations about Fourier transforms for example will not help you to learn or apply that information. Its much easier if you can see how the equations come about and how they relate to other equations or ideas. Look for patterns and similarities. If you can link Fourier transforms to your mathematical knowledge of series then you can utilize all of that extra series information to solve more difficult and left of field questions.  Work to understand all new information as it is presented to you. Dont settle for surviving the semester only to have to actually learn or worse memorize it all just before the exam. Exam study should be nothing more than revision for you and you should be able to do a few practice exams and perform at your peak. If you find yourself having to learn things during your revision period then youve done it all wrong. If you dont understand something in week  then ask for help with it in week . Youll see endless posts on rcollege from people who had issues early on and are looking for ways to negate the damage at the end of the semester. Theres nothing to do by that point so dont let your problems snowball out of control.  Remember that college is your job now and treat it as such. Doing your assignments must always come before relaxation. I can guarantee that you will find the time to relax and hang out with friends if you do your work first but you may not find time to do your work if you prioritise slacking off. You are not in university to party get the university experience or make friends. Those things will probably happen but they are not your goal or your plan. You are in university to study to get a degree. Its a tough thing to be told but you need to accept it given the amount of time and money youre sacrificing.  And finally youll hear a common mantra a lot over the next few years Cs get degrees or sometimes Ps get degrees. Ignore these people. Passing your classes will get you a degree but you will not get the same degree as someone who aces their classes. Any job that actually needs a degree qualification will want to see your GPA and they will be merciless with it. Especially for grad school and transfer applications if your GPA is below their arbitrary cutoff they will not even read your application. Your GPA can never be reset and although some universities offer grade forgiveness for failed units others dont and none will allow you to replace that shitbutstilltechnicallypassing grade. Never accept mediocrity in anything as there are enough mediocre people in the world already. Goodluck OP.,Advice,dbtup8e,2,t5_2qjdm

Dont you think that having a better idea of the causes of a problem should make it easier to find effective solutions? Couldnt you arm yourself with that knowledge and make a more effective difference?Its not even very clear to me what things would be useless to do if the race amp IQ thing was true  or rather its the kind of things that would still be relatively useless anyway compared to trying to reduce problems caused by drugs amp crime.gt It would mean that people would forever have a reason to have racist lowexpectations for us. Thats something that really breaks my heart. Its almost unbearable. Im sure theres something Im missing here seeing as Ive lived such a sheltered ignorant life for so long.

Just a couple tips based on what I would do. Option  Explain to the people one on one that they need to go. Be calm nice but firm. Dont make it about the drugs. Maybe make it about needing the house to yourself or that they were making it hard on your relationship and it was just time. If they push you you can say you have family with drug issues and can not be around it. Not judging but you gotta go. Option  Have a conversation with your wife and get on the same page. Make the reason they need to go be that you are worried about her safety and cant let there be any chance anything ever happened to her. Tell her a story about someone you knew who had some bad experience in dealing with people on drugs. She probably does not like confrontation so tell her you will be the one to them.Big tip. When getting them to leave. Start with it being a favor they could due for you.  You did them a favor letting them stay now they can return the favor by giving you guys some space. If that doesnt work they are cocksuckers and you will have to be more stern. If they understand there is no situation where they dont go while remaining calm you are less likely to have a situation that escalates.  Hope this make sense.,Advice,dc6yti4,3,t5_2qjdm

I think it may help.  When I was in highschool I was a standout in a sport I wont say which one but the point is when I was  I was sent to a prep school on the opposite side of the world. Within  months I woke up every single day hating everything about my life. I was homesick I had so many problems I could not even think straight.  I was behind on homework laundry dishes. I had no food in my room no clean clothes anything. Because of how I grew up I never learned to do basic things like that. I had a language barrier where I couldnt speak fluent English. I had no true friends. I had just come from a night in the hospital because I had gotten my ass beaten by a guy  inches taller and a hundred pounds heavier than me. My braces were twisted teeth gone from being kicked in face bloodied up badly. I felt like everyone I knew including my teammates and coaches were against me. My teachers seemed like they picked on me extra hard. Nobody gave me anything. I remember sitting up one night at am crying because I didnt want to go another day in this hell. It was at this time I discovered the greatest lesson I could ever learn. To be resilient in the face of adversity. Very few things in life will ever test your mental fortitude to this extent and this will give you true character and values that nobody can ever take away from you.  I understand your situation may not be as extreme as mine may have been. However the same principles are in play. Your personal growth is one of the most important aspects of your life dont throw it away for comfort. Youll probably regret it down the line. The more comfortable you get being uncomfortable the more you grow. Good luck. ,Advice,dc8j74g,1,t5_2qjdm

You used the word jobs more than one other job. If this is a continued problem youre having in many jobs then it may not be the person who is at fault but you. You need to look at what youre doing that is putting so many of your coworkers backs up that they start to monitor your work or make it awkward for you to be at work.   it may be that youre paranoid or playing the victim or you are truly horrendous to work with or awful at your job. I currently work with someone who while being at the job for many years less than me was hired by me and reports to me continually does things that are arsebackwards says amongst coworkers he wants me out of the job that I cant do the job and he has no respect for me and that he can do the job better than I can. sound familiar?Yet he is the one reporting feeling harassed in the workplace due to me asking as is my role as site manager to do the most trivial of tasks or to do his job correctly as asked for dozens of times before. Your bosses probably havent taken your concerns seriously because youre reporting against someone with a proven track record in that company and who is in a position above you because they deserve to be by doing things the correct way. From the sounds of it to me it may be time you moved on in your career and maybe learned that people who work for the same company as you arent all threatened by you being younger than them they may be exasperated by immaturity of someone who thinks they know everything better.

10325469,0,t3_5ns9fw,I would suggest changing your username to something less pernicious to yourself. Every little thing matters and that includes you so things like your username and every other thought thats self destructive needs to change. Focus on doing good things for good people and sometimes even doing good things for people who definitely dont deserve it. You need to realize you are important and the more you convince yourself that you arent the more youll spiral downward. Your exgirlfriends love for you is proof that the only one who really thinks that youre nothing special is you and that needs to change.  Your perspective on life isnt going to change if you think it will just come when the time is right. You need to consciously make a decision to give allow yourself to feel sad or angry or jealous and be honest that youre feeling that way while also realizing that it isnt bad. Sure your past was dark but none of that has to affect your future unless you allow it to. Misanthropy comes from choosing to not try an understand why someone did something negative. People have their reasons and sometimes its because they had a dark past and are letting it affect their present Sound familiar?. Sometimes people are jerks because they dont think anyone is more important than their own personal gain which is obviously wrong but the thing is you need to forgive these people even when they dont ask for forgiveness because forgiveness is a choice. Not a reaction. You dont need something to happen before you forgive someone. Forgiveness is mostly for the one who is forgiving because it allows you to move forward with little to no baggage whatsoever.  Faith in humanity is something that you choose to have. You cant look at a fireman saving people from a burning building and instantly think that hes doing it for the money. No you need to give respect to people for what they do and trust that its out of the kindness of their heart. If later on they give you a reason to think otherwise then now you know now that its just that one individual that you have to look out for. You need to be very critical with how why you think negatively of someone rather than just being critical with humanity in general. And we all know generalization is almost never a good thing when it comes to humans,Advice,dceg6jk,1,t5_2qjdm

I found this better than just trying to spread my work out but if you reckon youve got the willpower to break your procrastination habits power to you.. gt  shes always around her female friends group of If the girls she hangs with are fun to be around try getting your friends and her friends to do something together if your friend groups get along. This way you wont be an outsider or anything. We kind of did this with a group of girls that a lot of us sort of liked we just kept inviting them out to do stuff and we became really good friends and more in some instances. If youre making the plans to hang out more she might clue onto that you like her. This is good. If shes clued on to the fact youre interested without you having to come right out and say it and shes showing interest in you I reckon youve got a good shot with her.gt  if I step into the group and talk to her Ill get badmouthed as soon as I leave?This is why you try what I explained above. Hanging outside of school will quickly translate to hanging inside of school. They wont see you as an outsider. However even if you just went and talked to her if theyre decent enough they wouldnt badmouth you. They might give her some shit or ask her ooh whats that about but if theyre nice enough they wont say anything actually mean about you.gt She shows some interest in me I think  eye contact whenever its just the two of us we have nice conversations but shes kind of shy sometimes what to do?Just get to know her be friendly and eventually ask if she wants to do something some time.

10393290,0,t3_5othr3,Im so sorry this happened. My best advice would be to not be afraid to talk to someone. Whether it is your parents a teacher or a friend. Sometimes its easier to talk to someone who you dont know on a personal level  in which case I would suggest seeing a therapist. In any case theres nothing wrong with seeking support especially after a traumatic event. Even if it doesnt happen to you directly these events can trigger anxiety and thats perfectly understandable! Just dont try to deal with this all on your own. Chances are a lot of people are probably feeling the same way although it may manifest differently in different people. As for the people making jokes  sometimes this is another type of coping mechanism. Although I agree it is inappropriate behavior it isnt uncommon for these types of tragedies to cause young people to try and use humor to alleviate some of the anxiety not fully realizing that these jokes can be very hurtful. If I had to guess and Im not in anyway a psychologist I would say these students are feeling just as traumatized as you are but lack the ability to express it in an appropriate fashion. Its similar to the instance of some people laughing during funerals its not that they think the situation is funny its that they struggle to cope in tense or somber atmospheres and it manifests as laughter. It can also stem from the fear of feeling vulnerable around your peers. I say this because while someone may be making jokes they may be feeling just as scared and sad as you are and are scared to seek out support. It may be hard to ignore and of course it would make anyone angry including me but I think its important for you and your classmates to come together and support each other during this time. Give them the benefit of the doubt because it may end up being the case that those people making jokes may be the people who need your friendship most during this time. ,Advice,dcm593v,1,t5_2qjdm

10518668,0,t3_5qm5bz,Do you feel insecure about the way you look? About your ability to find partners? Its a pretty common thing to resent attractive people either because you are envious of their looks or because you resent not being able to find attractive partners. However its still an issue because its going to make you unhappy and likely cause you to treat other people badly. Youre probably experiencing confirmation bias when it comes to this opinion. So basically every time you meet a pretty woman whos obnoxious it reaffirms your belief that all pretty women are obnoxious but a pretty woman whos polite and kind doesnt weaken your belief.Im not going to tell you that looks have nothing to do with a persons personality because people are treated differently based on their looks and obviously the way were treated by others shapes who we are. But I think its important to remember that no one chooses what they look like. We get to choose our clothes and our makeup and our hairstyle but your born with a face and thats the one youve got. So while for some people being treated as super hot will make them conceited for plenty of people it wont. Just like being bullied might make some people aggressive and other people skittish and still other people might not be hugely affected at all being hot is just one aspect of a persons experience.In general give people the benefit of the doubt. Assume theyll be friendly until they prove otherwise. Youll be happier for it.,Advice,dd0ekwa,1,t5_2qjdm

A decent answer is that around preschool you began to recognize pretty decided that your friend was THE exemplar and that in order to be pretty people must necessarily look the way she did. Since you did not look the way she did you were not pretty. Its kid logic and its fascinating. This is an example of the very very beginnings of logic and reason in the undeveloped human brain. And thats all it is. It has little or nothing to do with who you are today but its fascinating as an example of how a young human brain works as its growing and how it tries to learn.When I was very young I believed that my life might be a dream and that I could at any moment suddenly awake surrounded by people I didnt know claiming to be relatives... Again this is an undeveloped brain trying to make sense of its world.

10584949,0,t3_5rhd5t,Hi I was in a similar sort of situation not too long ago and I think I understand where you are coming from. Around  years ago when I was in th grade I questioned the point of all this work and whether it was worth wasting my life away. I didnt know what I wanted to do either and I was overall just rather down with my situation. However this is where I learned that having fun is extremely important. I restarted playing sports and just exercising was able to help keep my spirits up. Instead of lying in bed I would tell myself that when I finished my homework I would play one game of LoL. I started hanging out more with my friends and overall just learned how to relax. Now I am graduating in a couple months and while the college apps were stressful I got through them and have already been accepted into a few colleges. From my experience I can say that th grade was the hardest for me academically but now I look back on all the fun times I had when thinking about it rather than the studying I did. My advice would be to go and relieve stress by having fun doing whatever you enjoy. Keep your grades up too but I can say for almost certain that you wont regret keeping extra effort in.PS I read a book called Excellent Sheep The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life and it really helped me out.,Advice,dd7r894,3,t5_2qjdm

I really must agree with you confidence plays a very important role thing is once you lose confidence regaining it isnt easy. Each time I failed one of my tests I would just lose confidence consistently. The two subjects which give me the most trouble are math and physics. Apart from my phone there really isnt anything distracting me and Im working on keeping my phone away from me while studying but Im probably the biggest scatter brain the world would have ever witnessed every single thing manages to distract me and every thing seems so boring. I practice from SL Arora for physics and do Rd for math but Im extremely slow because I dont find it interesting at all. Sure there are some topics which I like like say differentiation. Class starts and I go hey this topic is fun! and then they go and fucking put the concepts from the rest of the chapters in there especially ones that annoy me most namely trig. It just seems like no amount of practice can help achieve mastery in any topic in math theres always that one question that catches you off guard in the exam and you dont know how to even begin the question. Such so called trick questions have always been there but now they are far more prevalent. I need a good load of practice in a number of topics in math and a few in physics as well. At times I wonder which ass tard decided it would be fine to let the th syllabus consist almost exclusively countless numericals and derivations that make no sense which we all just mindlessly mug up. And in th everything is just so easy least they couldve done is prepared us for whats ahead. Ive spoken to my friends and a few of them are very helpful and want me to get high scores just as much as I do but in the end it comes down to me and how I study. There are some fundamental concepts in math which I still have doubts in and as we go further into the portions it only leads to more confusion.So  I guess first thing I should do is clear these doubts. Im yet to find a study pattern that works for me. I just hope it happens soon. You seem like someone whos recently finished schooling am I right to assume that? ,Advice,dd8atqt,1,t5_2qjdm

It might feel a little uncomfortable at first but think of it like this its like youre practicing for an exam and theres nothing wrong with that. Just practice practice practice until you start to feel comfortable and casual with what your face does. Focus on lips eyebrows eyes head is it tilted downwardupwardto the side? and stance.

If it was me id probably of just said yea i wish it where bigger but hey it is what i was born with so sue me or something like that lol. Im not sure how old you are but im sure some of my friends have tiny penises and some of them have huge ones but nobody really cares. You dont exactly pick your friends on their penis length and in the long run girls dont really care either. Im not sure exactly what your friends said to you but them laughing is a normal thing they probably dont mean it in a way of haha you have a small penis we dont like small penis people but more like haha thats embarrassing so im going to make fun of you. I mean honestly most people make fun of embarrassing things it happens that is just life you cant run away everytime it happens laugh about it and move on. If you really cant handle it then tell them that it really bothers you if they are your friends then they will stop.

However what I have done is a LOT of research and a whole lot of reading when trying to decide med school vs. nursing school vs. medicine in general. I work in a teaching hospital and try to ask questions anytime I get. From my understanding when you apply for medical school aside from your MCAT scores and GPA theyre going to also look at how well you did in your sciencescience based classes e.g. o chem AampP physics etc.. One bad semester? Not ideal by any means however its life. Things happen. You seem to care A LOT about your education and seem to have just had a lot of bad luck.Dont count yourself out. Talk to your advisor. Is retaking the classes for a grade replacement an option? If it is GREAT! I know it doesnt conform to the typical fouryeargraduationplan but itll be worth it to not have those grades pulling down your GPA. If it isnt things will be a bit tougher. Youre going to have to double down and prove in your next classes that you can recover from a bad experience in your life. Upward trends in grades are good. Something to take from this experience is that we are all human and that even though it may seem like a total failure of a semester dont give up on your dreams of being a doctor because of one bad semester. ,Advice,dduglm7,2,t5_2qjdm

10829119,0,t3_5utbk3,I agree with all the other people on here about this!  You likely will break down and its perfectly okay to!  Youll feel the same amount of pain no matter what and itll likely feel like your heart is being hit with a sledgehammer.  There is nothing we can really do to lessen or stave off grief but there are at least some things we can keep in mind that can ground us a little bit during the experience.  For one embracing fully that we are in pain and accepting that there isnt really any way to prevent it is helpful in most cases.  It wont make you to feel better but it will at least give you a sense of bearings.  Secondly it helps to understand that grief is a bit like a bad trip or sorts you basically just have to ride it out one wave at a time until the storm ends and you are able to begin the recovery process.  Thirdly its important to give yourself credit and treat yourself with compassion.  This is important in general but especially during times like these.  Dont be too hard on yourself this is a big deal.  Anyone with a heart is going to be devastated to lose an animal companion.  For many pets are legitimately family.  Finally its important to remember that every instance of grief is unique.  You might feelthinkrespond in ways that surprise you.  Things that you were worried would depress you might end up being comforting things that you thought would eventually cheer you up might make you miserable for a time.  Ride the current wherever it wants to go be with people one minute alone the next put on a comedy and laugh if you want or just cry all the way through etc.  There is no right or wrong way to feel.  Have people around if you need them or be alone and just have them on standby.  Just try your best to listen to what your heart and body are telling you.  You wont feel better but you also wont feel any worse if you just let each moment dictate your needs organically.I hope that long reply wasnt too overwhelming!

10877847,0,t1_de0kagz,I think something that may help you to consider is that from my experience many people feel like you do.Other people may not word it as you did as in a pawn in this game of life but a girl once told me that she felt as though she was something like I want to get out of this hamster wheel and I think she was referring to a low paying and repetitive job. But I too have at times feel like life is not necessarily painful I have been through emotional sadness and hurt before but at times frustrating and annoying. But from my personal experience that is just because I have a lot of emotional baggageissues. Its not lifes fault really but it really isnt my fault really. I think that all people have happy moments and sometimes have to resolve issues before they can feel happy constantly again.  So I think it is important to understand that life isnt really a chess game but that we human beings have to resolve emotional issues before feeling constantly happy. Its just human nature. I really dont think that any person with unresolved emotional issues can constantly enjoy life I personally think that other people seem to enjoy life much more easily than me. So I dont know if that is something to which you can relate.Then I think that other people are not not interested in you per se. By that I mean that I dont think they are personally uninterested in you. I think those people to whom you are referring to may just be accustomed or used to uninteresting people. I personally worked retail before and I personally sometimes felt that the same how are you? question was annoying because it was often times insincere. Sometimes when I would try to be friendly and say good and you? the person would sort of ignore me as if they were just getting the politeness out of the way. Other people would repeatedly ask If it doesnt have a price is it free and then smile and possibly even feel offended if I didnt laugh at that joke which I had already heard and which to me was annoying because they were halfplaying and halfserious.So as I think I wrote previously I will take your word for if you say that you are smart and funny but most people are not necessarily so. And I think that most people used to most people being insincere and dull or boring after a certain age. I have met plenty of adults who were nice interesting and friendly but most people do seem to grow more serious and at times dull as they age. When I worked retail I definitely felt that there was a difference in emotional attitude between sort of young people and older people. And I think that is nothing new really I think that people have throughout history been aware of the difference between children and adults in emotional attitude and that many adults do seem to grow more serious without necessarily being mature.So I meant to write that not to discourage you in any way but to maybe help you understand that other people might just be used to people being serious or dull. And that if you were to just let out your personality to express yourself in a funny and intelligent way it might be a surprise to them in a good way but it would be a sort of surprise nevertheless.So a way to get out of the motions and to get into life might be to just stop waiting for people to be interested in you first and to instead express yourself with intelligence humor and with a certain degree of empathy. Real humor does require empathy anyways as in understanding peoples feelings to know what they feel is funny and humorous.,Advice,de1z0ww,1,t5_2qjdm

10926662,0,t3_5w3bgs,Um I am not sure how to help you through this but I will do my best.To begin I think that you must first admit something and that is realizing what happened changed your worldview. That is the first and foremost thing. And it is important.And I say that because that happened. And it is unfortunate. But it happened. Some people feel rather immune and untouchable to the things that they read about in the newspaper. About the rape homicide and various rather cruel acts of human beings. But something that you may need to accept is that other human beings do in fact commit cruel acts. And the reason that is important is because you are already feeling the effects. That anxiety and guilt is a form of trauma because it is a traumatic experience to find out that a persons parents were raped. Let alone both of them. So you are indeed likely traumatized by simply hearing about that experience. Therefore I seriously suggest that you go to therapy and receive professional help. No one on here in this thread can claim that the realization that a persons parents were raped is not a traumatic experience. Therefore I suggest that you go to therapy and take the day off from work. And to be honest I dont like to fling stones but the other person who commented on this thread is being highly insensitive. As of now meaning in regards to you it does not matter if that event happened years or even decades ago. You just found out about it. You are trying to process it now. And therefore you need time to process it now.  And I think that taking a day of from work may help you relax and relief a lot of the pressure and therefore substantially decrease the anxiety and stress of this event. Going to work may only increase it. Therefore I suggest that you take the day off work. And lie if you need to. Im serious. No one can blame you for not going to work for this. People take days off for common colds you can take a day off after being told about the rape of unfortunately both of your parents. Seriously take a day off work. Its fine. No one can judge you for it.Now I recommend that you go to a therapist because this is the type of thing that therapists go to school for years to help with. They literally work to help with this type of thing. So dont be afraid of seeking help with this. A professional therapist may give you far better advice than anyone on here on Reddit can.However for the time being I personally suggest and this is just my personal advice it is not professional advice that you allow yourself to feel angry at those people that did that your parents. That you allow yourself to blame them. Do you not what people do when they blame someone else? They condemning them. They are convicting them as guilty like in a court. Now why are you feeling guilty if you did nothing wrong? Because you are convicting yourself. You are condemning yourself. You are finding yourself guilty and therefore you feel guilty. You feel guilty. And that is not right. It is those other people who are guilty not you. You should be blaming them if you need to feel guilty because they are guilty and not you. If your parents made things easy for you then it is because they wanted you to be happy. If you want to love them more because of it then love more. You are free to do so. It is okay to love them more if you want to. But it is not okay to blame the innocent. And you are innocent. You did nothing wrong. So dont blame yourself. Dont feel guilty. And if you want try to love your parents even more. Try to do some chores around the house try to maybe write them a card telling them how much you love them and how much you appreciate that easy life that they gave you. But dont blame yourself. Take some time off work maybe a day or two go to a therapist and remember that you did nothing wrong. You are innocent. And if you want love your parents eve more than you did before.,Advice,de70bpx,1,t5_2qjdm

10947617,0,t3_5wd45f,As a fellow musician I really think you should stick with it. I stopped my instrument lessons I think my junior year of high school currently in rd year of college. I stopped because I didnt like my teacher and I dont regret that but for some reason I never continued. I still played in a few orchestras but had no drive to practice and just cruised by on natural ability. Now that Im in college and havent sat down with a teacher in  years I wish I hadnt given up then. I play in a few local orchestras and have gotten through auditions with the same two pieces I learned by myself in high school. Ive auditioned for the same group with these pieces twice and finally realized that I cant keep doing this and need to try something new. I didnt even know where to start and had to ask my friend what was out there for me to play. Ive had the music for months and havent tried to play it yet. Maybe if I had continued lessons I would have more drive to learn and would know how to approach new pieces. Im rambling now and maybe have strayed from the question but my answer still stands. Music is an amazing thing. Coming from playing hours a day in high school to a few a week in college was a big shock and it took me a couple years to realize how much I missed it and find more ensembles I could play in. I had to learn the hard way how much I need music in my life and Ive only been playing my instrument half as long as you! You have one more semester. I believe you can do it and I hope you do.,Advice,de963pz,2,t5_2qjdm

11043545,0,t3_5xm9xq,Make sure you have read the job description carefully and know exactly why you have the experienceskills to fulfil that role. If you can convince yourself you can convince them.Do your research on the business it sounds like you have already so thats a really good start.Arrive early but not too early.  minutes early max. Any earlier and you could inconvenience them and catch them when theyre not ready for you. If you end up getting there earlier than that hang around nearby.Be friendly with whoever is on reception if they have one. You never know what comments they might make to the hiring manager about you.Take a copy of your CV application and the job advertdescription. They will probably have one but its useful for you to refer to and if they happen to be disorganised enough not to have brought your CV in with them you will look good by offering them your copy.Its OK to be nervous. I have interviewed hundreds of people and its very normal and completely fine. Personally Id rather you were nervous than acted like you didnt care.Google interview questions for the role youre going for. Youd be surprised how often hiring managers particularly inexperienced ones do the same thing!Have sensible questions to ask. Do not ask about benefits salary sick leave or anything like that. If they make you a job offer thats the time to ask those kinds of questions. Personally I also dont like questions about promotion opportunities at this stage either unless you are applying for a trainee role or one which is geared towards fast progression. Otherwise it suggests youre already thinking about moving on.Dress well. Youd be surprised how many people turn up wearing jeans. Just nope. Even if you are wearing office wear make sure youre well groomed and hide as much as possible anything that might be controversial ostentatious make up tattoos facial hair piercings etc. It shouldnt be but unconscious bias is definitely a thing. The only caveat to this would be if youre going for the sort of role where the staff dress casually. Look and see what employees there typically wear and use your judgment.Accept the water they offer you. You might not be thirsty now but your throat may get dry from all the taking. As has already been said do not bad mouth previous employers. That is a massive red flag.Overall try to enjoy it!

Take note that there are multiple recorded cases of people needing to go to the hospital after eating ghost peppers or Carolina reapers. One man vomited so hard he tore his esophagus and ended up being in the hospital  days. I love spicy but treat peppers with caution. What I like about the reapers and ghost is the way the heat hits you. It kind of travels quietly to your stomach and lights a fire in your belly. I grew Carolina Reapers last summer. We sliced them and put in a quart jar of vinegar. Just one tablespoon of the liquid is the perfect amount of heat for an entire crock pot of chili and adds a nice smooth pepper flavor.   Eat the peppers if you want to but you should be aware that  part pepper vinegar per  parts chili is very weak on the pepper... and it burned my lips.,Advice,dep12me,1,t5_2qjdm

But the post isnt about you its about a third party adult that has engaged a minor and in the course of that friendship has learned of another situation that involves that minor and another person considerably older that she also refers to as dating.  Its regrettable you cannot  appreciate what Dating an online stranger of any age but especially someone more than a decade older represents and what the mature response to that is.My advice in this situation not yours is correct none of these people should be engaging with each other.  The OP should let the minor know of her concerns and if she is aware of some illegal behavior report it to the authorities but there is nothing wholesome about adults engaging with minors who clearly experience a level of emotional intensity with online strangers to the point they actually think theyre Dating them.,Advice,dfcns1h,1,t5_2qjdm

I wore a juda when I was young and cut it after  with my parents blessing because of the lack of understanding from Americans. I know wearing the articles of the Sikh faith can be a burden physically mentally and socially. I know how important your parents opinion of you are in our culture and the last thing you ever want to do is to bring the slightest hint of shame upon them. The guilt trips are unbearable at times lol. Your parents will love you regardless of your decision. Dont concern yourself with the opinions of your aunts and uncles gossip is hands down the worst part of our culture. If you are going to cut your hair keep in mind the rest of your family will talk about it negatively and there is nothing you can do to stop it. They likely will be very underhanded with their comments and will lack the courage to be overt and open about it. They will do it so they can make their own children look like angels. It is part of our culture. If you are going to do it make sure you back up your actions with putting  in your studies and work. Let anything bad they say about you be fruitless due to how successful you are and how good of a person you can be. Wearing a paag doesnt make you a good Sikh. Being charitable honest hard working sticking up for the weak and down trotted and brave makes you a good Sikh.You will always be like a god in your little brothers eyes and just know he will try to emulate everything you do. Whatever choices you make just know he will try to emulate them. Like it or not hes looks up to you. You have an obligation to be a good role model for him you did not choose it it was bestowed upon you. That is a responsibility you must own up to. Keep that in mind in whatever you do.

11415780,0,t3_62w6ux,Hi So generally speaking Im not a fan of tattoos  I think Im a member of the group that worries you so I thought Id share my thoughts and maybe help set your heart at ease?The reason I tend to not like tattoos and Im sorry to everyone who disagrees Im just sharing a personal opinion is that many of them seem trivial and disregard the permanency like you mentioned. The hodgepodge black and white scribbles on the arms and feet of some people are no more appealing than the meaningless doodles on the margins of a persons notebook in school. I dont hate people with tattoos nor do I think less of them  I just generally think most of the ink I see is meaningless drivel done by people desperately seeking relevance. So yeah maybe thats harsh but thats my GENERAL attitude. Ive shared my general feelings with others and theres a fair number of people a minority for sure and yes  generally older who just shake our heads and feel this way about all of it. But even for us there are clear exceptions and you and your artwork are ALL of those exceptions. The first exception is when the ink is beautiful. I know from a distance that this sort of multicolor work youve gotten is very expensive  and I know thats one reason people tend to have more black ink than anything else ... but multicolor doesnt guarantee beauty ... only art does that  and your work is beautiful ... it has that lovely ethereal depth that the best tattoos have ... where it seems like the symbols and actors in the picture are floating in a universe of color and meaning that is no longer twodimensional but has become deeper than even three dimensional. Even to people like me these are captivating. The second exception is sincerity. Like I mentioned any time I see someone with a tattoo of something trivial I just get confused ... yes most people have some meaning in their work a date or a reference to a memory or such ... but even those get trite after a time and I wonder if it doesnt hit them later. But your tattoos show profound sincerity  deep meaning and even if they were gathered and added over time this sleeve you have looks me in the eye and tells me about your heart. You mean it. This is sincere and through it I can see clearly that YOU are sincere. The last exception for people like me who dont like tattoos is statement. Anybody who has a tattoo that is clearly stating something original about themselves and their meaning in life is communicating and communication is to be honored and respected. Of course your tattoo SHOUTS its statements regarding beauty and femininity nature and life. Did you hear me? Your statements reach even the likes of me  you didnt tell me what your ink is saying the tattoo did. THAT is how powerful and clear your statement is. So yes  if your tattoos were just a pile of ugly trivial noise Id suggest saving up to remove them  but you are ALL the exceptions that help people like me see why WELL EVOLVED tattoos make sense in the modern world. Your art is a sincere beautiful statement that tells the world about you your soul and your life. It is lovely and by proxy we see from what is on your outside the nature of what is on the inside which is also lovely. I guess thats my point I never realized it before  a tattoo or set of tattoos that reflect your soul are as much a part of you as anything else  youve merely revealed the invisible. Frankly most people I see dont pull that off  but you have completely. You ARE this ink and it IS you  and it offers you up to those around you in a beautiful meaningful courageous and lovely way.

But you need to have those rough spots so you can learn how to smooth things out. Even when youre not conscious of the learning it IS happening.Lets see... what about a regularly scheduled small group that meets for some specific shared interest? It can be anything a book club hiking group bird watching group obviously I have no idea what youre into but you see where Im going here. If you can sign up for some local group thats pretty small up to maybe  people then the first time will be the worst time. After that youre seeing pretty much the same people AND youve all got something to either do together or talk about together so you dont have to come up with random topics takes the pressure off a little. Once youre relatively comfy then you can push yourself to engage a little in the conversations. Oh! And I almost forgot you know a really good group to become involved in at least in the US? Toastmasters! Theres usually one in your area. Toastmasters is a group of people who want to get better at public speaking. Its usually a smallish group and everyones there for the same reason. They all want to feel more comfy speaking to groups. So you all practice together and help and support one another. Its hard yes. But thats the point. You mess it up together and you succeed together and you all get to be involved in each others learning and improving. And again youre meeting the same group of people and you all have the same goal and get to actually talk about your struggles together. It can be really transformative as you can imagine.

The wild part of me would tell you to go with your  dreams chase them all the way get better if its what you really want to do. And with singing Id suggest going out for some acting lessons as well as when it comes to jobs with singing as the main part musicals present themselves decently and it would add a lot to your reputation to be able to sing and act. However the realist in me says that investing money may not be the right thing to do as long as you have a back up youre fine but making it in show business is hard youd really have to practice and practice with more lessons. I would work save up for the lessons and make sure they wont wreck you financially. I know you may wanna take that leap of faith to spend it all on your dream career but with the show biz thats improbable irrational and not smart.So compromise invest in singing lessons when you have the money try to work on your acting and DO NOT take thatsleap of faithI wish you the best of luck my friend,Advice,dgrg8oz,2,t5_2qjdm

11781104,0,t3_683fas,Youre a really good person for wanting to help in this way wanting to help Susan grow up well and be a good person.  Thats not an easy task to take on and its not a flipping the switch problem  its a long steady process over time.First thing  Susans a child thats been neglected and emotionally abused.  Even though it was a long time ago babies absolutely understand whether theyre fed and loved.  Many scientific studies have shown that early physical contact regularity of feeding affection all the stimuli that tell a baby youre safe and loved  the world is alright  all those things are very very important to a childs development.  Susan didnt have that and its left scars.You need to change your whole approach towards creating an environment where she can heal.  It seems like youre coming at this from a commandandconquer model but that just doesnt work with human beings.  Neglected children often feel cut off and isolated  theyre actually desperate for love and security but theyve been taught they wont get that or not to trust it.  So they become aggressive and defensive as a coping mechanism  an attempt to protect themselves.  What she needs is consistent steady loving and supporting presence in her life.  I dont mean you have to be Pollyanna about it and let her get away with everything  I mean dont fly off the handle when she pushes back against a task.  Make the environment that can help her heal and choose appropriate behavior but dont be angry when it doesnt happen right away or if she backslides.Heres what you need to do and what could be helpful  you need to learn and get resources and get help for your family and for Susan.  Asking for help here is great  always good to crowdsource.  But you need to read books and talk to professionals that know parenting and parenting of neglected children.  Heres a good starting point  That document points to lots of resources on these issues.  Read those resources so you can understand who Susan is and what shes reacting against whats going on inside.  Try to be the sort of person those resources ask for  steady confident loving reassuring understanding setting reachable targets and slowly pushing them back rather than demanding the moon right away not domineering not ramping up emotional energy by yelling  punishing  being too aggressive.  And find the people in your town who know neglect and can help coach Susan and coach your family.  What is the state child welfare agency  what resources do they have?  Is there a child therapist in your area that Susan can talk to  not with family not as part of a concerted effort to change her right away but alone so she can talk about whats going on inside her and start to figure things out?Ultimately being successful here is a big change  a change in model of approach.  I think kids should have good discipline but when a model youre using isnt working youve got to try something else.  Find out what will work here  go ask for help from professionals and people who have parented neglected children before you there are millions certainly some in your town even and read read read because youll stumble across things that will make the world and Susan much clearer.Last thing  Susan is just a willful  year old girl.  She is probably much more normal than you think and these sorts of problems arent unusual.  She also knows shes not truly part of your family and that shes not valued there  thats a hard thing to know.  She has nowhere in life and shes a helpless little girl  thats a really really shitty place to be.  Recognize that shes got issues to deal with but also recognize that plenty of kids have trouble controlling their behavior.  She may grow up just fine no matter how difficult she is now or how hard you try or dont try.  Its not the end of the world if she is difficult or selfish  everyone is and most  year olds are.  I agree you need to help change that behavior but its not like kicking a field goal in and out its more like running a marathon or a century.  And you have to have the right tools  not just punishment and regular discipline  to make it work.Good luck.  I really hope things work out for your family and for Susan.  Too many broken people in this world but sounds like Susan has a good chance with you all rooting for her.  ,Advice,dgvfcf4,1,t5_2qjdm

11806159,0,t1_dgy254x,Feel free to post the essay as a reply. Ill read it as much as I can and reply when Im done reading. It might take me a bit with my kids and life Have you gone to her therapist with her? If not you should consider it. Also considering having a few sessions alone to figure out the best course of action. I dont feel all that comfortable giving advice when someone has threaten suicide. Im not an expert by any stretch. However lets assume that she is using it as a manipulation tactic. I could assume that she isnt actually working to make you happy. If she was wouldnt she actually go? And further more youre in debt a lot and living at your parents. Which means that working isnt much of a choice for either of you. She shouldnt just want to work to make you happy she should want to get out of debt make a life for your kids. Excuses to not work for something she seems to love to do for free? That one would bother me to no end. Threaten to kill her self in front of a  year old. Ugh I dont even know what to say about that all. I would disagree with the person that said laziness cant be changed. Yes depression is a real issue. Depression and personality disorders run in my family like brown hair. There is only two members of my family that doesnt have one or both. Both us of being daughters of a manic depressive mother andor antisocial. Was it environment or hereditarily? I dont know. But I do know that Im not either. And my environment wasnt a good one. So I sometimes have a hard time with the statements of depression being an excuse for everything. Im not saying its not always but I also believe wholeheartedly that we make choices. Sure there are days that all I want to do is relax sit on reddit and not be bothered. It seems like doing the damn dishes takes an act from god himself. But I get up and do it and then do the next thing and the next. Its small choices we make every single day that keeps us going. When someone like your wife is maybe feeling everything is just too overwhelming than maybe all she does is start small just the dishes than sit then laundry then sit you get the idea. I believe Inertia fits well in this. We tend to stay doing nothing the more we do nothing. We tend to do more the more we do. What I do seem to think is she has a good husband that seems to understand and take it all. Willing to get a second job. Do whatever it takes and admit youve made mistakes. She seems lucky to have you. ,Advice,dgy9ouk,3,t5_2qjdm
