2145914,0,t1_clcl8cr,I think theres a root guide on aftvnews.com and this utility  makes it easy to do most of the work.Once you root it as according to the guide DO NOT REBOOT AT ANY TIME youll want to use the shell function in the utility which will give you a command prompt that you likely have no idea what to do with.Assuming youve gained root by following the guide correctly youll want to type su which should change the prompt to say rootandroid followed by cd cache and then ls. After typing ls you should get a list with entries like lostfound and recovery and likely an update file named something like buellerxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.bin. You will want to remove this file by typing rm buellerxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.bin or just rm bueller.bin. You will then want to disable the update service as listed in the guides on aftvnews.

Id guess if you can get the controller to pair to another android device without incident it should work but the thing appears finicky.As for sideloading apps Ive got a question for you.  I just came to the startling realization that you can even pull off this stunt without rooting or otherwise hacking the thing.

Im going to do some more testing then give MythTV another try and see which one I prefer. Right now I prefer TVheadend but I havent started doing commercial skipping or transcoding yet so I may end up back on MythTV.I also need to decide whether Kodi is right for me live TV  media or whether I should ditch the live TV record and transcode everything and then just watch it all through Plex ...Im also waiting on my new Raspberry Pi  to see whether I prefer it or the FireTV.The default launcher for FireTV is just so bad it isnt funny.
