7303198,0,t1_d28a1zv,Sorry I really cant speak to the business school... I didnt really have many friends involved in it.Some of the lack of jobs from past internships and such Id attribute to the kind of Bucknellbubble lack of thought of things outside of the school. There was definitely a contingent of people that didnt want to move on and become an adult and so sort of ignored the reality of needing to figure out their next steps.But there were also loads of people that got internships that turned into jobs. Thats one of those its really up to the individual and not the school sort of things in my book.,bucknell,d28bowe,1,t5_2s60y
8411900,0,t3_4mm0ax,Bucknell isnt a diverse place but in my opinion it does a pretty strong job of creating a welcoming and supportive environment for minority students.When I was a student they had a week long preorientation thing for all international students which I really appreciated being so far from home... not only did it give me a chance to acclimate to the town it also gave me a chance to get to know other intl students in the same situation. It also helped with other logistical concerns too  eg not having a car or knowing how to drive not being able to have my parents come pick my things up at the end of term etc. There are also tons of student groups for black students and they are very friendly and have lots of social events.I cant speak to your question about how youd be treated for the color of your skin but I dont think youd have any problems. Id be genuinely shocked if anyone cared about interracial couples.Its been several years since I was a student but there was one incident I can remember in which a frat member dressed up in blackface at a party and was immediately reprimanded for it. That being said... Ive worked in higher ed since then and even at places that are extremely diverse and inclusive youll always find at least one ignorant person. Im not excusing it Im just making the point that in my view one person shouldnt mar an otherwise welcoming place.Hope this helps!,bucknell,d5t158v,2,t5_2s60y
