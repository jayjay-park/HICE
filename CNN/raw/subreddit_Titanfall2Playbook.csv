Once they turn around start reload phase behind them. Unload next leadwall mag. Next arcwave should be ready or close to ready. If its not ready pull out sword block dash around a bit. Once its recharged unload next arc wave. Then dash and phase tf out of there if you havent already got the elimination or execution.Wait for EVERYTHING to recharge. Same again. If youre playing LTS pick up batteries when youre not being attacked on in enemy fire lines.,Titanfall2Playbook,dash8ls,3,t5_3hoeq

That said he seems like a well respected member of the community so it seemed like a good jumping off point for discussion.Thats a good point for the Hemlock that it will be much stronger for those playing a bit more passively or who arent as adept in their movement to get in and out of close range fights fluidly. Frothy does mention that its very strong but I think his rankings reflect that in his view the faster cqc style would tend to be more effective once someone is capable of it. Thanks for the input! As a Destiny player Im probably gonna give the Hemlock a go.,Titanfall2Playbook,dawlrqi,1,t5_3hoeq
