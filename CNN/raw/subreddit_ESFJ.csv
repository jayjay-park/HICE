DIm amazed of how beautiful what ypu are saying is.gt i tried to imagine it the best I couldI dont doubt it will be like you are saying.Thats precise enough.It could be very useful to me. I can do this but I use to skip the checks and stick very firmly to what Ive planned whatever can happen.Ironically my lack of flexibility is a great source of movement and life in my life ,ESFJ,cf2kgpv,1,t5_2tpru
5068849,0,t3_3keyuc,Im married to an ESFJ and from what Ive seen she doesnt gossip about people unless theyve hurt her in some way in the past. Yes she talks about people a lot but she generally has more positive things to say about people than negative.,ESFJ,cuwzke6,4,t5_2tpru

9772058,0,t3_5cccj7,I scored pretty evenly among all  love languages except gifts. Good thing my ENTP boyfriend also scores a zero on gifts. I score highest on acts of service but realized that its how I express love rather than receive because I never expect him to do things for me so when he does I am very pleasantly surprised and appreciative of him. Instead the best way that he expresses love is through quality time. Now this isnt something Im used to because I didnt really receive love that way from my parents. Due to my upbringing receiving love through words of affirmation is what I need to feel loved probably because I always wanted my parents to praise me instead of focusing on my flaws all the time. Because he scores so highly on quality time its made me value it more as a love language than I did before and because thats how he naturally shows love it means a lot to me. ,ESFJ,dahmf67,2,t5_2tpru
