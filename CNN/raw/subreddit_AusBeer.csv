48471,0,t3_1unu9k,Little Brewing Co Death Between the Tanks DIPAI was really impressed with this first really hoppy effort from LBC. Big rich very hoppy DIPA. I enjoyed quite a lot of this one.Riverside  DIPAOh man. Riverside are easily one of my all time favourite breweries and Ive been looking forward to this beer for quite a while now. Ive gotta say it did not disappoint at all.Birra Del BorgoCantillon DuchessicSomething special I cracked open on NYE. Nice subtle sourness complex flavours all throughout.Young Henrys Vanilla WitbierReally sweet lots of vanilla. Tasted almost like pancake batter. You know what? I quite enjoyed it. Couldnt have more than one though I think.,AusBeer,cejy5pg,4,t5_2t0if

2209064,0,t3_2keur5,Itll still be available on tap it seems.Im actually pleased theyve done this. It happens. If the bottle product isnt up to scratch they shouldnt release it.,AusBeer,clkmjop,3,t5_2t0if

3622792,0,t1_cq57ujj,I only know because I work at Lion and theres a million posters around the office for the campaign so I asked marketing about it. Funny how the same department came up with such drastically different ads though,AusBeer,cq583xb,1,t5_2t0if
4094524,0,t1_crm1kqf,So the defining Australian Pale Ale I think most beer nerds would agree is Stone amp Wood Pacific Ale. Since BJCP dropped the style definition in the  guidelines it was replaced with Australian Sparkling Ale of which Coopers is the only commercial example we are now free to reinvent it. An Australian Pale is light moderately sweet low in bitterness compared to its American cousin with a pronounced fruity or floral hop aroma. Little Creatures Pale would be another solid example but its difficult to get fresh out east.,AusBeer,crn01vh,2,t5_2t0if
5324444,0,t3_3nwv5i,Love their Christmas Ale and Scotch Ale. Have a bottle of the  Christmas Ale still kept away. Very nice vibe at the brewery especially with the hand pump. ,AusBeer,cvs9cp2,2,t5_2t0if
5367108,0,t3_3oin3w,Boatrocker for sure as the barrel program is something that is extremely exciting.  Kaiju especially with the new brewery opening up will give them a chance to ramp up production. Also feel it will give them a chance to expand their range somewhat.  Brewcult especially if Hendo manages to get the brewery in Point Cook up and running. Feel that the rebranding has been one of the best things to happen this year.  Wolf of the Willows as it will be interesting to see how the brewpub will operate and the chance to get their beers out to the public in a wider fashion.  Exit with the fact that they should have increased capacity to brew as theyre going to start brewing out at Kaijus facility.   ,AusBeer,cvxpiuu,2,t5_2t0if

5459465,0,t1_cw9hnqq,Yeah I guess so but I mean surely they have thick skin and actions speak louder than words. If they just continued to do what they do and never sell out isnt that doing the same thing just without running the risk of eating their words if they ever decide to sell?,AusBeer,cw9hyhk,1,t5_2t0if
5915078,0,t1_cxuu3er,Hey mateThanks for taking the time to give e some pointers. You are totally correct about the focus...I should have spent more time setting up and checking it before handing the startstop button to my  year old. She was never going to pick that up on a small screen while she was filming and i didnt until i got to the point of editing...too little too late!Definitely will seek out a better microphone the sound was not great.But hey its a start and I have plenty to learn!!!CheersChris,AusBeer,cxuzyov,2,t5_2t0if
6218024,0,t3_40p92r,I think a Red Ale would probably be the best match. Maybe Modus Operandi Former Tenant.,AusBeer,cywf7zp,1,t5_2t0if
6466498,0,t3_444klm,Im a big fan of their kolsch. Great session beer and widely available. They actually serve it on tap at the German Club in Brisbane so it must be pretty authentic!,AusBeer,czo6jbb,1,t5_2t0if

7490500,0,t1_d2t1bm7,Totally agree with this. Even if you did put in an heroic effort therell be some point when the beers just start blending together.,AusBeer,d2tmnwn,1,t5_2t0if
8239612,0,t1_d57gz9u,Oh anything really just going by the brand recognition. I know I can get it in Australia but not for  a bottle haha.,AusBeer,d57iag8,1,t5_2t0if
8495613,0,t3_4w1izj,The Oatmeal stout is fantastic and a bit of a favourite in our beer drinking circle. The new Creme Brulee is amazing had some the other week on tap at the Kings Head and was blown away not a session beer though.The rest of the range is very solid too no complaints but probably no other standouts IMO.The brewery itself is probably the best way to experience it. Tasting paddles of course and the food was highend restaurant quality last time I visited. Even have refillable growlers at the cellar door not sure where my last one went.Agree that the brandingwebsiteetc is pretty shabby.,AusBeer,d63i3qg,2,t5_2t0if

9272346,0,t1_d8r7gwn,True and I find most pale ales a little underwhelming except Shenanigans Winston. Thats like a pale ale sipper. Not really typical of the style though.,AusBeer,d8rc4km,1,t5_2t0if
9553052,0,t1_d9qbz3k,I cant see anything that distinguishes their Pale from anyone elses. Why should I pick this over Morningtons or Bridge Roads? Or more locally Rocks or Young Henrys?The company has no story. Just an aspirational thing about converting people from fizzy yellow lager. Why brew those two beers? Who is Sauce? Why are they called Sauce?,AusBeer,d9qm08o,2,t5_2t0if
