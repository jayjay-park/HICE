837271,0,t3_23gumy,Disregarding your last comment your post is reasonable.The claims that plopzer have made are all valid and they are things that should be worked on. People should not take them personally they are not a sign that Rebirth is a bad server. In fact Rebirth is a fantastic private server. It is based on Mangos which itself has these bugs  in fact Rebirth has actually fixed a number of bugs that Mangos has.It is good to draw attention to things like this. However your statement... i thought this server was supposed to be reputable for its scripts but i was obviously mistakenIs unnecessary. This server is reputable for its scripts and I urge you to try out any other Vanilla server  they all have issues like this along with issues much greater.I personally agree  it is a deterrent to gameplay but I still love Rebirth ,rebirthwow,cgzg84s,2,t5_2yej9

9330900,0,t1_d8wvrl8,The Mob tuning on rebirth is terrible too though. Kronos has it much closer to blizzlike than rebirth.,rebirthwow,d8yrd07,0,t5_2yej9
9341520,0,t1_d8zlive,With respect I think all staff and players are under no illusion that this would make an impact.  The problem is we have many loyal players that have been with us a very long time that have invested hundreds of days played in their characters I am not sure they would be convinced to wipe all that history in the chance that the population grows on the new launch and stays large for any length of time.  There will always be new servers releasing and one thing we have done that others have not is wipe our database to attract new people.Another side of this coin is we are yet to finish releasing all vanilla content and indeed fixing some of the content we already have.  I think this option may be more attractive to players when naxx has been released and cleared.A sister realm running along side the current one is a more likely avenue to follow and its been talked about in the past.  But the vanilla market is already pretty saturated with other projects like crestfall on the horizon.  Appreciate your input all the same I am just one member of the team so if my reply comes across as negative dont take that as meaning the options you suggested are not considered.,rebirthwow,d903sjb,3,t5_2yej9
9403761,0,t1_d97pvcz,Its not about how you said or whether it was factual or not. Forget about that. Simple fact of the matter is the hivemind holds Nost as sacred and because youre a representative anything negative you say about it is going to badly backfire. In fact any criticism of other realms only brings up Rebirths shortcomings.gtI dont care who agrees or who cares that is MY opinion.You really should. You represent an entire server. You might be truthful helpful and even right but thats not how you do PR. gtI have been attacked by players on my own realm for my posts here in the last hrs. I have been accused of not helping by criticising other realms. My answer is simple we as players want the same thing I will do what I can to achieve the end goal. If it upsets players on rebirthnostkronosEly I will speak my mind. I have played vanilla since beta and I will do nothing other than try to get that back.Thats honestly admirable but you gave up the privilege of being seen as impartial when you volunteered for this job and put that tag next to your name. Anything you say will have a huge shade over it. If thats truly what you care about then I would encourage you to doing it under a different alias or quitting because being known as GM of Rebirth cripples your voice on those matters as well as affecting Rebirths image. I think your experience and insight is an asset that could help change the messy private server community if put to a proper medium.I know people have been piling onto you and I hope you dont feel under attack from me at least. A lot of people are frustrated by Rebirths population problems.,rebirthwow,d97zrup,7,t5_2yej9

9576692,0,t1_d9rf1n9,If anything the population staying the same for a  month period from a exp event is far better than the downward trend of people gradually leaving that occurs without it. ,rebirthwow,d9tituj,1,t5_2yej9

10126506,0,t1_dbr6rhg,I wouldnt say that one of the GMs is a bit of a busybody.  On a quiet day on the server I was slow falling off of Teldrassil after jumping off on my epic mount and he .kill d me teleported me to GM Island and accused me of speed hacking.  He did offer to port me back to Teldrassil but after that I was basically done with screwing around for fun on the server that day and logged.,rebirthwow,dbrhn9o,1,t5_2yej9
