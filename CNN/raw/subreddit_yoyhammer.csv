2382089,0,t1_cm5t5lf,Yep the kit like the FW kit comes with the standard knight stuff paladin and errant as well as the magaera stuff the armor plates weapons everything. The set only comes with  arms so the point where the end of the arms meets the weapon system would be where youd need to magnetize. The stubber mount you can switch with the plasma gun without magnetizing and youd have to figure out a way to swap heads though thats really just cosmetic. Of course the leg and groin plates as well as the top canopy and pauldrons are different too but its simply a matter of swapping those around.The track set is indeed from the lord of skulls set,yoyhammer,cm64ud1,2,t5_2zait

2526521,0,t3_2ollsw,Much you want to know about you can find in the comments in the sticky post in particular there are a couple notable recasters around Miranda Irene who youre somewhat familiar with zhanchuilowpricewarhammer who has been the standard for a while he supplies yoymart which was what this subreddit was named afterCoolCastOrNotTheBitsKingdom generally understood to be the best quality. their resin is distinctively yellow and of higher quality than the others who seem to use a variety of types of resins im no expert but their stuff has different colors and brittlenesses.the quality of these recasters seem to be sorta spotty you can take a look at the stuff that I and others have posted here. It seems that Miranda Irene and Zhanchui arent so good with vehicles because of their large thin pieces but I have heard reports on the contrary too and my own purchase from Miranda Irene was very satisfactory. Im interested though what problems have you faced with your stormbird? do you think you can take some pics and such? obviously I cant know the extent of its defects right now but you could try bending it straight in hot water.For now its safe to stick around these three sources.. if you want to buy something id suggest searching it on here first to see if others have got them before.,yoyhammer,cmocpyf,1,t5_2zait

Going to order Firestorm Redoubt and the bunker one soon too. Expect the normal hot water treatment and gap filling with the fortress.

7007039,0,t1_d1aka1e,Part So yeah there are many different types of armour that come in different sets. These sets allow you to assemble five Space Marine without weapons or extra equipment. They are entirely mixandmatchable so feel free to go crazy with em. You need a minimum of four sets to get you going with your basic troops. You also need to get two Command Upgrade Sets and two sets of boltguns You can also get a set of power weapons to equip your squad leaders with a variety of deadly close combat weapons and pistols.Now since you like tanks Id suggest putting the two Veteran Tactical Squads into transports known as Rhinos. The Deimos pattern Rhino is native to the HH setting.After that well the choice is yours. Id definitely recommend taking a Whirlwind Scorpius for some lovely artillery. It kills Space Marines well denies their armour save and can be used as a normal Whirlwind in k which isnt as good. Taking Vindicators is a good idea too as you can use them in both systems. Just remember that despite their powerful main gun they are quite shortranged and vulnerable to sideandrear attacks so make sure you dont send them ahead unsupported. Theres also the Sicaran Battle Tank which everyone loves and takes. However Id suggest taking no more than one if you want a dualsystem army as you cannot take more than one in a k army its a rare relic by that time. You can also field a variant tank which is known as the Sicaran Venator This beast kills tanks and titans in an instant very deadly but not so useful if you have a horde of infantry against you. The Spartan Assault Tank is a Land Raider. Large transport capacity very risilient and very expensive both ingame and cashwise. Its brother the Typhon Heavy Siege Tank is a Vindicator on steroids and is the bane of most armies. Even more expensive but no transport capability. Both can also be used in k but again only one per army though honestly one is all you need.Of course there are many other options but these are the main ones youll find. I hope that helps! ,yoyhammer,d1alcvp,8,t5_2zait

9030355,0,t1_d7ww47w,gtWar colours reminds me of painting with cheap student acrylics  I just cant really understand this at all. Theyre thin paints but the pigment density is actually much higher than brands like gw. The reason art shop acrylics are hard to paint with is because of the low pixel density  not because theyre thin. As for the work thing its like I said its more work if youre expecting the paint to hammer nails  or make pancakes  or do a one coat basecoat which I should add is not something that works particularly well with a brush to begin with. For one coating things you can either glob on some thick paint or you can airbrush  and these actually airbrush really well theyre just not good for globbing on... The opacity rating rates the opacity of the paint out of three not five and its comparative to the other paints  this is useful to know when youre blending certain things. I dont really know why you assumed it corresponded with GWs base layer thing but thats more to do with paint density and thickness  not opacity. I think youre being far too harsh on the paints because your complaints arent based in how the paints technically perform... Theyre based on how youre using them and Id say you werent using them in a way that would tell you if any paint was good or bad... Basecoating just tells you if a paint is thick.When reviewing new tools I think its important to adapt to what youre reviewing. So try out all the techniques and see where it performs and where it lacks dont simply mark your tool on how similar it is to your old one. ,yoyhammer,d7xb0z0,0,t5_2zait

I have ordered from Z and CCON several times and whilst much cheaper they are a little overworked so have worse communication and a lower quality.

11306534,0,t1_dfd316p,And this kind of mentality is why recasters can if they want to get away with sending inferior quality casts to buyers. The only reason why such large mold slip would occur is if the caster isnt taking enough care but most likely that the mold has been over used. Z always has and always will OVERUSE his molds as all he cares about is maximising profit at the expense of quality.These type of mold slips should not be excusable even for a recast. Plenty of recasters have higher quality products than this.Z products are mostly only good for terrain unless you are lucky to have received one of the first  casts from a new mold beyond that you start getting issues.,yoyhammer,dfdku9n,3,t5_2zait
