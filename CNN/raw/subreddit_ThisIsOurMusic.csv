170012,0,t1_cexm388,The practicing youre doing sounds excellent. Just getting callouses is a good thing  that means youre playing a lot and playing a lot is one of the most important things you can do  especially when youre enjoying it as you note. I hope youre recording those licks for later reference!Ive always been more of a writer than a technical player. I like my style and my solos quite a bit but my technique is more intuitive than studied and my chops are limited so I cant offer much guidance. My primary learning process has always been learning songs by ear along with intensive listening to recordings I like. I challenge myself by trying to write songs different from songs Ive already written.But most importantly hang in there know youre not alone and dont be afraid to ask for help. Its really hard to fight depression all by yourself I speak from personal experience. You dont need to carry that burden alone. Therapy especially in conjunction with medication can really make a difference.,ThisIsOurMusic,cexsprq,1,t5_2rqpa

483429,0,t3_1zn73j,So at first your samples are pretty damn nice Vegeance FTW but there are some musical things to be aware of.The first has to do with timing your break between buildup and drop is a a bit to late...Ill do an excurse in to theory yeah lame but  I am sure it will help you.lttheorygtYou should try to work in ... bars parts meaning youve got eg. bars intro  bars something else  bars buildup and then  bars drop still with me?Good and thats where your break comes in to play now youve got  bars of buildup  bar break and then the drop. The problem is that now everything is one bar of our grid. Thats why you normaly put your break in your buildup block meaning your normal buildup PLUS your break should be  bars. How do you do that? Simplejust make  bars buildup and half a bar break. That helps the rythmic feel of your track potential djs and ofcourse your workflow since you haven t got to work offgrid.lttheorygtI cant say much about your bass sounddesign because I haventheard wobble basses in ages but IMO they are a bit to soft. Try adding some distortion on their mids.Anyways I have huge respect for you since I never managed to do remixes while your one is quite well done.Also most of your sounds sound very good Please dont tell me all of them where fukn nexus.

794481,0,t3_238drs,I like the singer and the band shows promise..but..The recording has problemsSounds like mono or very little stereoMost of the sound is concentrated in the same frequency band in the middle..bass and highs are weakGuitar in particular sounds kinda harsh and too loudYou need to work on a wider more balanced sound,ThisIsOurMusic,cgul3uo,1,t5_2rqpa
798313,0,t3_238drs,For a live recording this is really tight you guys have a good thing going with your band chemistry you guys are really in synch. I do think that the vocalist needs a little more breath support. Try holding your hand a foot in front of your face and hold a note increase your air without increasing your volume and try to feel your breath on your hand. I also think the end is lacking goodies what I mean is there isnt variation or extra parts at the end so the it feels slightly anticlimactic this can be fixed by adding an extra rhythm part a harder drum feel with more fills or going higher up on the vocals or all of these things. From a production standpoint you guys just need better equipment. See if there is a college in your area with an audio engineering program. My band gets all of our stuff recorded for free in a really nice studio by students because the nature of the program requires them to record bands. Its mutually beneficial you get to spend time in a professional quality studio and they get college credit. I really like your sound and honestly dont think you have too much to improve on. Keep rockin. ,ThisIsOurMusic,cgv0rvd,2,t5_2rqpa

Very chill as you described. My suggestion would be for the recording process as it seems like youre getting some clipping going on there.  Turn down the levels on your mics when recording and then turn up the volume in the mix.  It will sound cleaner!  Thanks for posting!,ThisIsOurMusic,cig5mbh,1,t5_2rqpa

In this time I had a falling out with my family. I found God and subsequently lost God. I chainsmoked american spirits like it was my job and went from odd job to odd job convinced that any day flying lotus would call me and all my problems would be solved. Many bad decisions were made I was reckless and utterly lonely. All I had were my ableton tracks.

7089994,0,t1_d1jyok8,Song form is something even very talented musicians dont really learn unless they start songwriting. But once you get a hang of it its super simple. About the dull sounds its actually not a hard question to answer but it is way too much info for me to be able to write it down here. For me a big breakthrough was watching Marc dotys synth videos. Learning the history of sound design too like the Roland equipment that came out in the early to mid eighties. No two synths are the same. ,ThisIsOurMusic,d1k0phj,1,t5_2rqpa

7331914,0,t3_4fsobc,Ive been working on tension buildup and release and trying to make it sound big on the limited gear that I have! Its supposed to have a calmer verse just before this and lyrics aswell. So its a work in progress! ,ThisIsOurMusic,d2bl6z3,1,t5_2rqpa
7570855,0,t3_4izyfa,Good job! You need to add some progression start introducing some more elements as the track plays through. Some bass and a little hi hat pattern when the vocals appear would really spice it up. The most important tip is to keep with it! While youre learning you will discover something new every time you work on a track so keep sponging it all up check out some tutorials keep the creative juices flowing and have fun!,ThisIsOurMusic,d32rpec,2,t5_2rqpa
7774701,0,t3_4lqlv4,I think the drum sounds maybe need some mixing and a little more variation. The bass could use a little something too.

7796088,0,t1_d3s7q5o,How long have you been recording and what program do you use? And where are you based out of as an artist? Gotta say I love what Ive heard so far and Im bookmarking you and going to try and give your discography a listen during work hours tomorrow. You sound self recorded but like you have a great artistic vision and need some help in the production phase much like me as an artist. Ill have to give your material more listening time in the next few days but Ill say this much it is music that inspires me. Reminds me of a less energized modest mouse and the vocals on Go Warn the others really remind me of fleet foxes. I use pro tools am Dallas based and have been recording for about  years now on my own so Im just getting to a point where my mixes are semi competent. But I really dig your stuff I think our music could overlap in some ways and I wouldnt be surprised if we share similar musical influences. Here is my stuff but dont worry about listening to it as much as I would love to get a comment back from you with more of your history as an artist.

My only critique is that the guitar chord strumming gets a bit repetitive by the end maybe some guitar plucks or additional space in that part could mix it up a bit more.

10653694,0,t3_5sgekn,No hate but whats the point of posting something with the title of shitty indie rock song? Have some confidence in yourself man. Half of being a musician is writing the music and the other half is being confident in yourself that what you just wrote was the best thing youve ever heard. If you think its trash yourself keep working on it until you can no longer stand listening to it. Otherwise I dont really want to click on something that the artist called shitty.  Just my two cents. ,ThisIsOurMusic,ddeuhjv,6,t5_2rqpa

10684421,0,t3_5stv39,Nice tune thats recorded well and has a lot of flavor. The lyrics were cracking me up especially with the singalong subtitles. Such a specific topic for a song... literally just about driving one street in a small town. Nothing particularly remarkable about the street either. How did you come up with this concept for an album?,ThisIsOurMusic,ddi0mmp,1,t5_2rqpa
10692186,0,t3_5sxw5a,I like the intro.  The main beat lacks punch.  Cool rhythms with the percussion.  The snare should CRACK more at the moment it just kind of taps.  FUCKIN CRAAAACKKKKK.  The kick lacks impact too.  Otherwise the sounds are fairly commercial and ordinary.  But if it had the impact I wouldnt mind so much.  Nice trickery with all the details in there.  I dont like the commercial sound so much but it could sound heaps better with a more aggressive kick and snare.,ThisIsOurMusic,dditj9p,1,t5_2rqpa

10896937,0,t3_5vjtus,Getting noticed takes a lot of hard work and also a fair bit of money too. You can get lucky with getting some things for free for example the drummer in your band is an excellent producer so you dont need to worry about going to a studio and spending  a day or maybe your friend is into filming and makes you a video for free. To get recognition my band gig a lot and try to play shows in new cities we have a local press manager who gets us interviews and reviews also in the UK we have something called BBC Introducing which aims to help get new bands get more attention. You send your tracks to your local BBC Introducing station through an online uploader and they listen to it and see whether its worth a slot on the local radio show. From there you can get onto national radio like BBC radio  which obviously gets a lot of listeners but can also can you onto festival slots as they normally get their own Introducing stage. This free service has had the likes of AltJ Catfish and the Bottlemen Slaves Jake Bugg and many more whove gone on to do very well. As for record labels they can still help you out but you can still certainly get majorly screwed over by them if you sign a bad contract. Chance the Rapper recently declined a  million record deal just to stay independent.,ThisIsOurMusic,de3xwx2,2,t5_2rqpa
