Let them read the stories and see what failssucceeds and let us do the same. Its a constant battle of growth and development for both parties.

5693926,0,t3_3t3ank,Im not a legal expert and I cant speak for others but I wouldnt  punish him. I would probably tell the kid he is no longer welcome but I would respect the parenting and the apology. Only situation I can think of where cops would be called is if LP filed a report for the theft already which is highly unlikely unless they tried to make a stop and he ran given that it is just a video game. I would take the kid back if it were my kid. Teaches him to accept punishment for his actions. It is very unlikely he will face any from the store however. Plus with the parent throwing it out they are just disposing of stolen merchandise. That is money that Walmart has lost and isnt getting back. Money that is taken out of employee pay.,lossprevention,cx2vxp8,4,t5_2t4oa

9067951,0,t3_54gey3,Wow....that escalated quickly...Breaking my Reddit lurker only cherry to comment.Reset your perspective.  Hand out near the entrances and follow the th customer.  This will not result in you catching that customer but will take your mind off the game.  Once your head is out of the way your subconscious will take over and you will see the same cues you saw before.  LP is really a hard game I your ego gets messed up you just cannot catch.Another technique is to shop...like for real not filling a cart to blend.Post back when you catch one!,lossprevention,d81tkc3,2,t5_2t4oa

10159000,0,t3_5lcvot,Honestly you would have been caught already if LP was paying attention. Case building on an external theft is dangerous because they are losing merchandise and there is no guarantee you will keep coming back or you will keep stealing. I had a guy that was always taking food stuff. Since grocery was new to the company it wasnt really something we made stops on unless it was ORC. What I would do is watch him and get him to dump the food. One day he came in and took a watch which I did take him on. Could not charge him with the food he took over the months because I did not have any physical evidence.,lossprevention,dbvkuzm,2,t5_2t4oa
10793711,0,t1_ddl9h9s,This approach would be considered wrong at most US retailers for many reasons. One your behind the person identifying yourself only verbally may not be sufficient.  What if they are deaf or hard of hearing or didnt know you were talking to them. Every place I worked at wanted I identified myself verbally and with Id badgecard in the report to establish that you properly identified yourself visually in case you were not heard. Or in case you were not seen youd be heard. Covers both possibilities. Second by grabbing Thier arms your introducing physical force into a situation that may not have needed it. This encourages violence. Grabbing someone that maybe doesnt need to be grabbed might subject you to a battery charge yourself as your only allowed to use the minimal force required to stop someone. And if they havent used any force on you you may not be seen as justified using force on them. I saw a news article about a Walmart LP arrested for an unprovoked rear tackle on a shoplifter without identifying himself,lossprevention,ddtamg8,2,t5_2t4oa

11438782,0,t3_633rkg,I got out of the TPS uniform about  months ago when I switched companies. Being a TPS was my first loss prevention job and it was great. It ultimately depends on management and shrink numbers  but your primary duties will be to stand at the doors to create a visual presence checking receipts tracking counts of high theft items and researching variances on these items identifying theft subjects writing reports and helping with apprehensions. I worked in a high risk store and helped with at least one apprehension a day and made  recoveries a day mainly because I had a manager that trusted me enough to ask for merchandise back directly despite the fact its against directives. I changed companies for a number of reasons but if you have questions please dont hesitate to pm me. ,lossprevention,dfskpr7,2,t5_2t4oa
