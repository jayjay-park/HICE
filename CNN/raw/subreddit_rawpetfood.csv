70419,0,t1_cemfl6i,Do they refuse to eat the organs by themselves? I believe that the veggies arent needed but some do believe so and eh to each their own. Doesnt really do any harm...My dog is on meds too and all I do to get him to eat it is grab a treat with the pill and he will eat it. He is so easy to trick lol.,rawpetfood,cemg2hg,2,t5_2sl8a
72847,0,t1_cem0bme,Raw food ratios recipes ect is going to vary a lot from person to person. Ive read Olsons and theres some stuff in there I dont like and I dont agree with. Find a book or person you feel comfortable with and you feel is knowledgeable and go with their advice if it makes sense to you. ,rawpetfood,cemq0ye,1,t5_2sl8a

1238188,0,t1_ci8vl0r,Not really  Finding quality resources on the internet can be tricky  those are just some of my favorites I have found in my own searches. I wrote the article on raw feeding but it contains a ton more resources and I tried to keep it SUPER generic. There are a variety of different variations to the diet and methodology that people follow  it is meant to be a starting point not an end all be all guide.The Raw Feeding community has a lot of great knowledge and resources. It is something I found semiaccidently but I really recommend joining that even if you make a fake facebook account to do so so you can get your questions answered and they typically reply really fast.,rawpetfood,ci8wuxj,1,t5_2sl8a
2152246,0,t1_cld8i3l,Well you said this better than I ever could have. I hope it was noticed. My vet has seen too many dogs with all sorts of issues because they were not feed a balanced raw diet. It would be nice if it were as easy as just giving them some chicken quarters. ,rawpetfood,cldedsg,2,t5_2sl8a
2155133,0,t1_cldq5yy,We dont know if whatever tiny amount of greens that a feline would be consuming in the wild is beneficial to the cat at all in that small quantity. It could be completely neutral. Im not trying to replicate kill  accurately. I dont use the feathers stomach or intestines at all. They are discarded before I make the food. Cats in the wild probably consume just as much dirt as they do greens but Im not going to add dirt to the diet.,rawpetfood,cldrljq,8,t5_2sl8a
2155896,0,t1_cldrm4o,I just looked and my food actually contains tripe so hes getting it already. The nutritional info says each pattys contents not nutritional daily value is . fibre.Ill look into taurine and fish oil,rawpetfood,cldv3kf,1,t5_2sl8a

3545920,0,t3_30vuni,Although it goes against the raw nature of the diet I usually cook these with veg and rice for extra fibre and cards they dont get other days,rawpetfood,cpwghey,1,t5_2sl8a
4208268,0,t3_3917in,Chicken necks are great to get started. You can cut them up by each vertebrae easily if they are too big. Eventually you wont need to cut them. Maybe just Im half to fit in the bowl. ,rawpetfood,crzxiki,3,t5_2sl8a

4964717,0,t1_cukby0t,If you shop sales or have good resources its much cheaper than people think. There is a turkey farm about an hour from my house. They sell direct to the public. I run into other friends there all the time who also feed raw. Its nice to know the direct source. ,rawpetfood,cukcamv,2,t5_2sl8a
5246612,0,t3_3j0rxj,Good article.  Thanks for posting.I do think the author is unnecessarily worried about salmonella etc. when feeding raw.  Unlike humans dogs digestive system can easily handle bacteria laden food.,rawpetfood,cviem63,2,t5_2sl8a

6144622,0,t1_cyo2hox,I tend to agree I use a different local supplier that uses human grade animals. The price is higher however as they are competing with people when want to buy the meat for consumption from the farmers. ,rawpetfood,cyo2ums,2,t5_2sl8a

7397312,0,t1_d16427r,I have ground up organ meats in my dogs food for a while. He is used to the taste now and loves it. Its the first thing he eats. I tried cooking it a little to no avail. Green tripe cannot be substituted for liver as they contain very different nutritional values going off of what Tossa said. Tripe is good for natural probiotics helps digestion and gives more fiber the veggie part of the BARF model where as liver contains a lot of nutrients. Its like the powerhouse of the digestion tract in that it absorbs through filtration a lot of what the animal eats. The livers main job is to filter the blood coming from the digestive tract before passing it to the rest of the body. The liver also detoxifies chemicals and metabolizes drugs. As it does so the liver secretes bile that ends up back in the intestines. The liver also makes proteins important for blood clotting and other functions. hope that helps!,rawpetfood,d2j0xs4,1,t5_2sl8a

8515623,0,t1_d65zsi7,Orijen is awesome Im probably gonna get that when Im out of the Fromm. They were both on prescription diets for a long time.  After doing some research and changing them to the diet they are on now all of their problems have been resolved.  My fat cat Julie isnt ravenous anymore and is almost at a health weight.  The other one had struvite crystals and the vet said that she needed to stay on the cd food for life when I started telling them that I wanted to change to Weruva.Unfortunately a lot of vets are basically bought by Hills and Science Diet.  Same with doctors a lot of them are paid by prescription companies so they give meds to people who dont need them.,rawpetfood,d660fti,1,t5_2sl8a

11430146,0,t1_dfq3k0z,We pay under .c for all of our food that is fresh and within date from a local farmers market. A dollar a pound is high and I wouldnt feed my animal sick animal. Sounds like a disaster. ,rawpetfood,dfrlff9,1,t5_2sl8a
11657662,0,t3_66cm72,I dont think its marketing teams at all its just fear of something controversial. People assume that because vets are pet doctors that what they say is absolute gospel my vet sells this food so obviously its good! My vet says bones can kill dogs and they can get salmonella so raw food is bad!,rawpetfood,dghescg,9,t5_2sl8a
