As I understand Verizon has recently put a tower up in the area so those customers can get service. I do believe that service should be coming soon for ATTTMobile customers but I havent been given a timeframe. It is up to the cell phone companies. Let me know if you need help finding an apartment.,irvine,cppc9g5,3,t5_2r02m

9724072,0,t1_dab4xm2,If you want to be pretty close to work and save a few bucks irvine is expensive no matter what  Heritage point.  The units are in severe need up upgrading but they are cheap for irvine.  Also its most certainly a birth tourism complex lol.  Aliso Viejo is also an option I love it there.   I lived at city lights for a bit loved it.  Get a roomie and the San Franciscan...preferably overlook the main pool on the rd or fourth floor....heaven. ,irvine,dabpdm3,1,t5_2r02m
