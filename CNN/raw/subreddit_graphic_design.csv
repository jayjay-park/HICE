Its so bad that people assume I have a degree and are surprised when I tell them i dont.

1572065,0,t1_cjd3ld4,You want the funny part? I am the designer at the sign shop it is all getting done at. I sent off the email with the artwork in it yesterday but have yet to hear back from the client. I have actually suggested to them of having smaller signs put around the pool as opposed too all in one. I have told him it would look better and be more readable on a white background with dark green text if they want to keep the dark green. But they were insistent on leaving the dark green background with white text as the rest of the signage they have is like that.It is going in a private pool. So I already know that no one is going to read it. But I have looked up the department of public health here in Massachusetts and that never really helped me. I have looked up ADA compliance lettering and was told to ignore it because not all pool signs are ADA compliant. Either way I now just have to sit back and wait till they get back to me. I have indicated the size of the sign the letter height and the everything about it hoping they catch on to the fact that it isnt a good looking sign. I am glad you are getting exciting about pol signage. Ill let you take my place hehe.,graphic_design,cjdbypx,1,t5_2qmtk

1592722,0,t1_cjfx7xs,Okay let me try. Say Im a hospital or clinic. People have health issues and need my services. I offer nearly any service they can need or can point them in the proper direction otherwise. People need to know where Im located and they need to know that it is a trustworthy place thats safe and professional. Brand recognition. This needs to be conveyed in very short ads which arent easy to make and broadcast. Going through everything you offer when you offer nearly everything isnt an option. So why single out weed? The best it can do is hurt brand recognition because not everyone wants their healthcare commercials to be about weed in hopes that itll bring a couple people in who might have otherwise went anyways. Its an inappropriate way to advertise a healthcare place. Say Im Zoloft. Im a very specific medicine that is consistently made across the board and there isnt much of a social stigma around me. Im offered very many places and can be branded specifically at a national level because Im not a single establishment. All the necessary information can be branded into a single commercial. Simply see your doctor it you need more information. You can even go to one of those hospitals or clinics if you want. Ive done advertising and film for quite a while and understand how marketing works. Youre comparing ads for a local establishment to national brands. It doesnt work like that. Zoloft is HUGE and relies on marketing for recognition. It also has the funds. Hospitals not so much. Apples and oranges. ,graphic_design,cjfxlmg,1,t5_2qmtk

1838108,0,t3_2flm2n,I have had two bad experiences with two bad Cricut machines. I first tried the mini and couldnt get a clean cut on even a  heart or  tall letters. I finally got a new blade housing sent to me from them and it still wouldnt com rout perfectly and it was the simplest heart shape ever. So I traded it in and upgraded for a little more money to the Expressions  the same machine youre seeing on sale and the cuts were slightly better not perfect still but usable unlike the mini. Then before I started a project I had to upgrade the software or the machine or both and I just could not get it to work. I was frustrated to tears so I checked online and read that you cannot in any way upgrade using a mac which I have and so do the people I live with. The only option you have is to upgrade the machine with someone elses PC then reconnect your mac to the upgraded machine that is until the next time they decide to change their software and then you have to do it all over again. If you have a pc this isnt an issue but as a mac user I didnt feel like finding someone with a pc hauling the machine to their house or vice versa then repeating every time theres an update. It also didnt do anything perfectly so I looked for other options.I know you said you dont have the budget for a  machine but if you can stretch your money to like  go for a Silhouette Cameo. And if you cant afford that go for the cheaper Silhouette Portrait. I live and die by my Silhouette. You dont have to buy a single font or shape ever you can make everything you can imagine yourself or just buy a single design for as little as  or every . when theres a sale and they have a free shape every month. You can download any font you can imagine for free online and then use it on the Silhouette. You can take any shape online and then trace it on the Silhouette for free or manipulate any shape yourself so easily. Ive never had to buy a single fontshape ever and Ive made probably  completely original card designs made a big paper flower wreath I cant even remember how many amazing things Ive made with it all with crisp sharp cuts. Many places have it on sale from its retail price of  for like  with a couple tools or gift card to their store.

And then you need to find a screen printing or embroidery shop who are willing to make just two jerseys for you which will be expensive because the setup cost is the same whether youre getting  or  made.most of it will be straight forward name and number on the back and number on the sleeve. Team name and logo on the front. Find a bold blocky font on dafont or some free font site for your words and letters. Really the tough part for you will be the logo design. SCreen printing or emboidery will want a nice clean vector based design. You can make it in photo shop but if you bring them a pixel based design they might charge you a digitization fee which means youll be paying them to convert it to a vector. If youre not comfortable working with vectors then use pixels but keep the following tips in mind. if your logo has more than one color keep each color on its own layerdo not use shading gradients blending feathered edges. Your design must consist of solid colors.good luck,graphic_design,ckbzfms,2,t5_2qmtk

As such if you were to use one of these WYSIWYG editors then the code that is behind the design would not allow proper function. Think about it as industrial design.

If this is a live ad for a real buisness you shouldnt have your own information on there. By all means add it to your portfolio but alongside the advert website is a huge no no. Company details should be somewhat like thisgt Pression.co.ukgt gt infopression.co.ukgt gt Call us at   gt gt Units  Kingsmart Courtgtgt Intercity Waygtgt Stanninglygtgt Leedsgtgt LS LYId also switch the grey and pinks with the text. You probably want the name in pink. The Rs also touch the next letter a lot. The kerning is a little too inconsistant for my liking. Too late now but when creating an advert try to avoid negative themes unless youre contrasting that with a solution. You dont really want the destruction of a laptop accociated with a buisness. Youve been overly agressive with the sharpen brush on some places especially the cup. There are visible brush marks on the lower left part of your laptop. If I was to execute this piece Id remove all colour from everything but the paint. You can see a blue tinge on the laptop shadow and a yellow tinge on the highlighter. Not to do with the design but a custom email gives a good impression. Perhaps get a domain. If you really dont want to do that then just create a basic dedicated email.

You can have some talented designers that have been constrained by their companys poor branding or who dont have enough control over the design process product owners with too much input etc to be able to really get a great portfolio but I think they should really be much more limited in scope than they usually are. I had a friend who was jobhunting and ended up in interviews with  different places at the same time. They all gave him very involved takehome tasks. One was the complete redesign of any existing app he chose toptobottom showing any functionality design and userflow changes with rationalizations. One was the design and coding of a page site. I think the other was wireframing and design of a site without the coding. He only had a few days for them during the same week. On top of the freelance clients he had at the time he ended up having to write off one of the positions since there was just no way for him to have time to finish them all in the few days he had. Maybe it was a good way for him to whittle down which of the jobs he was least interested in but he really needed a job and if one of the other two hadnt hired him he could have been throwing away a muchneeded chance at employment. Also he was pretty stressed with all his other commitments and felt what he turned in wasnt his best work and wouldnt have been even if he had dropped two of the positions and only focused on his first choice. It worked out for him in the end and maybe seeing what you do under pressure is part of what they look for but I feel like there are very few jobs that are going to have you consistently churning out complete projects with only spare time in a few days. And if there are they almost definitely arent going to be worth it.,graphic_design,cn749uh,1,t5_2qmtk
2674067,0,t3_2qm6co,Ive got a Pen amp Touch at home and an Intuos Pro at work. Contrary to what people have said on here Ive found a pretty substantial difference between them to the point where Ill bring the Intuos home to use it instead. A lot of my colleagues share the same opinion. The stylus on the Intuos is more ergonomic with replaceable nibs included and the actual surface provides a much better interface both in terms of friction and sensitivity. The build quality is far superior and it just feels like a professional piece of kit that will last a while the PampT got worn down pretty quickly and the friction changed pretty dramatically. However I havent used the newest PampT model so things might have changed since then. Re hotkeys and size  completely depends what its going to be used for. If its digital painting then its a question of taste I know a lot of people whove found the larger ones to be too large but never vice versa.

Ive seen a lot of examples from designers that I wasnt at all impressed with but they were charging  or less quite often. Of course I dont mind paying for quality. If  is the going rate for quality design thats no problem. Im just a little cautious about who I should trust and what quality product they are going to give me. Id just really hate to throw  down and not see anything good or worse not see anything at all. Not exactly sure how that site works. ,graphic_design,cnzyiyo,2,t5_2qmtk
2924626,0,t1_co0ikbc,Illustrator is much better for this. If youre getting it printed at a sign shop then you will have to use a vector drawing program to make a separate colour for the dieline. A dieline is the outline of anything that has an unusual shape. A cereal box has a dieline. The label on a jar or bottle has a dieline. A business card that isnt a rectangle has a dieline. An envelope has a dieline. You are going to need Illustrator or InDesign for this and you are going to need to practice with a long steel ruler and a knife. ,graphic_design,co0jf92,2,t5_2qmtk

2974218,0,t3_2u85w5,gt I took it into my own hands  everything I know about design I have taught myself and learned through experience in two design internships and a job as the graphic designer at the art gallery at my college for  years of my undergrad.High fuckin five. Everyone I know in the field who is kicking ass has this attitude. They dont know something? They figure it out. Make this a habit and youll go far.gt The area I live in does not provide many options in terms of design jobs that I am qualified for  I also couldnt move at this time in my life to a city with more opportunity for a designer such as myself  I have signed for a lease until SeptemberEither sublet or move in September. But get the hell out of there. Unless you happen to find a great opportunity between now and then youll want to be in a place that gives you the most options. Thats gonna be a major hub. Or find a job that lets you work from anywhere. This is tougher especially for younger designers but doable.gt Whenever I have to do PowerPoints they make me feel so cheapened. Why am I doing PowerPoints as a graphic designer?Youre a junior designer you are cheap. Who else should be working on these? They suck. But its the stage youre at now. Drink whisky and get through it. gt I have been working here about  months so it is too early to move on to another job without looking like I am just hopping around.Seven months is a bit early to leave but once you clear a year I dont see a reason not to start looking. Nobody is expected to stay at the same place for  years anymore. Some do but its not a mandatory thing.gt I really think I need to get more experience with HTMLCSS before even considering a new job and work on designing more outside of work to build my skills and my portfolio  more concept designs where I can show my creativity.As a print turned web guy I fully endorse this. I dont know anyone working in web who isnt booked as much as they want to be. Im in Chicago and the demand for web designers is off the charts. Knowing HTMLCSS will make you a better web designer. Dont forget about UX while youre at it.It sounds like youre experiencing that frustrating time where youve been used to being this brighteyed idealist student and now have to be the low rung in a design department doing menial work. Its a ladder we all have to climb. Learn everything you can. Be a spongeeven for the boring work. Clients arent an excuse for us to be creative theyre a business with a problem. Solve their problems. They need PowerPoints so make them the best damned PowerPoints to solve the way they use them. Someday you wont need to create them anymore.From your post it sounds like youre going to be fine.

3063723,0,t3_2v6lqk,Im a  year old graphic designer. I went to the High School of Art and Design in NYC from  to  studied art in college from  to  and began my career doing basically everything in this book. Layouts were done by hand first with chalk and pastels and later with solvent markers like the famous Magic Marker line and mechanicals or technical art boards were constructed by hand. Type in galleys was glued down with hot wax and Rubylith or Amberlith masks covered or or revealed areas that would receive halftone fields or illustrations. About this time the Rapidograph pen replaced the ruling pen Letraset selfadhesive halftones replaced traditional BenDay sheets and you could buy display type for headlines as rubdown transfer type. Headlines also could be set by hand using the Phototypositor machine which projected type images onto strips of photostat paper. Knowing how to properly space or kern the letters was critical to achieving a professional result.Line art was enlarged or reduced using the photostat camera which produced pure black and white images. If you wanted a gradation you paid someone to airbrush one for you. You bought your type to be pasted into the mechanical from typesetting houses and used proportion wheels to calculate how long a strip of paper would be when the type was set. I was a pioneer I used a calculator when those became affordable.Photography meant studio time and x or larger cameras or huge onlocation setups. If you wanted an eyecatching fantasy image for an ad it had to be drawn or painted. I was really good with felttip markers and steel nib ink pens. Clip art was literally thatwe bought catalogs full printed on glossy stock and ready to be cut out with a razor and pasted down into mechanicals. Stock photography was selected from catalogs ordered by phone and delivered as x or x transparencies.The direct mail ad agency I worked for was cutting edgewe got an inhouse typesetting machine the CompuGraphic EditWriter . You input your text and the formatting codes and prayed you got it right on the first try. That rarely happened. Still that was the first shot across the bow to the old way of doing things.Fast forward a few years and you could buy rudimentary computer art from specialty houses. It was super coollooking and basically was a photograph of a CRT screen. But it was a revolution and we used it when we could afford to for our most technicallyadvanced clients with the biggest budgets.Then Apple changed all that. I got a Macintosh IIc and a LaserWriter as payment for a freelance job and I started setting my own type. Soon I was competing against my employers own graphics department bidding on jobs I could do faster or better using my home setup.Suddenly it seemed everyone was doing it and all the type houses went out of business. Designers could create their own gradations and line art and all the technical illustrators retired. My employer got tired of paying me freelance rates and bought a PC and CorelDraw printers didnt buy into the Mac hype and told me to get back to work. Soon I was building complete mechanicals and printing them out myself. The photostat camera got used less and less and eventually was sold.This revolution had its downside. Everyone had  fonts at their disposal and no one knew how to use them properly anymore. The finer points of graphic design have been lost in the flood of new untrained classically entrants to the field. But they brought an exciting breath of fresh air. The Punk style of the s and the Grunge style of distorted and deconstructed type in the s were a response to those disruptions and were part of an explosion of creativity I was happy to be a part of. Now I look back on the old clip art catalogs and font catalogs and Im looking back on a lost world. But those old images and typefaces are coming back in a big way as the retro look gains popularity. PBR Old Spice Chevy and other lifestyle brands that are reviving images and themes from their past are mining these old resources for inspiration and reconnecting with campaigns from their past. Im glad I saw it all happen...its been a hell of a ride and advertising and printing have been at the cutting edge of it all.,graphic_design,cofjvs9,14,t5_2qmtk

3285623,0,t3_2xqbuv,Consistency! Both in your projects and in your portfolio design. It seems youve made an attempt at creating a graphic identity for your portfolio but its not clear and consistent enough. To give an example the QampA title comes out of nowhere and breaks with the overall design. Ditch that and make it consistent with the rest of the portfolio design.Composition its all over the place. Try to come up with a good composition grid and stick to it or just blatantly steal one you like.Drawing and photography Id simple ditch these unless theyre absolutely required by the college youre applying to. As you say yourself drawing is not your strong suit dont say stuff like this in your portfolio by the way. Youre trying to sell yourself! so simply dont put it in. Id say the same about youre photography. Ive seen a lot of portfolios by design students and juniors that contain amateurish photography that says nothing about their design skills and doesnt add anything to the portfolio. And if I may be extra harsh your photography doesnt stand out from the stuff all the other kids put on their tumblrfacebook. Sorry. Once again unless demanded by the college just drop it.Go easy on the photoshop effects please. The festival poster is a prime example Overusage of the bevelemboss option is a great big nono. It automatically turns a diamond into a turd. Effects like those have to be used sparingly and subtly or they make every piece look amateurishly like a kid trying out all tools in photoshop.Give your design and image material a litte room to breathe. You often put too much material on one page or put everything to close together. Read up on the purpose of negative space and act accordingly.Pay a little more attention to detail. When one photo one a page is cut off where all the others arent first page of the meometric project this is an obvious mistake. Also you apparently made a little mistake when filling the background in your festival poster the closed letters have whit in them. Those are just two examples of little mistakes I found. These kind of mistakes are unacceptable even under a tight deadline but in your own personal portfolio theyre unforgivable.Put more thought into picture quality. Maybe this is because of how you exported the pdf but some of your images seem very lowres.Lastly as for the final page composition Im sorry I dont really understand what Im looking at here. Maybe some explanation would be in place.Hope this helps. Good luck!,graphic_design,cp2scs4,2,t5_2qmtk

3457868,0,t1_cpmdkk1,If you havent I think every artist should study composition. Composition is one of those things that can make or break a piece of art. The most wonderful idea rendered with brilliant skills will be doomed to mediocrity if the composition is bad. BTW I am NOT saying that your composition is bad. My point is that mastery over composition should be the goal of every artist. There are many great resources out there. The foundations of composition have been around for a long time and still widely used today. Once you are familiar with the rules every time you look at historically recognized art you will be able to break down the composition and see exactly why the piece is so successful. Of course there are artists that have successfully broken the rules but it is a thin line between good and bad. In the end the only way to really fail as an artist is to stop trying to improve.

3497640,0,t1_cpq5ggw,Hahaha is your petty little ego so fragile that a few up votes makes your day? How incredibly pathetic. Good design is timeless? Holy shit are you in high school? Heres a secret that youll learn when you actually get out in the real world  You dont know if your design is good or timeless. Nothing that is timeless was ever designed with that in mind because history judges that dumbass. Heres the thing You did not discuss Bebas Neue. You never even attempted to do so. You belched meaningless tripe in a sophomoric effort to be an antipopulist cool kid. A reference to Emojis? Are you fucking serious? Guess what? Emojis have been around longer than you my precious little budding teenage artist and they will outlive any crap you manage to dump on humanity. Maybe that means theyre timeless and therefore good design.If you cant tell the fucking difference between Bebas Neue and Helvetica you have a long fucking way to go before your opinion is worth the toilet paper you use to wipe it off your ass.

3760332,0,t3_33hd3g,Good question!  I cant speak for everyone but I would say that in my experience as a yo GD at my first official design job inhouse also my bosses were much more willing to give me a pay raise than I expected.  I also do a bunch of our companys product photography and generally speaking I work my ass off to go above  beyond with the calibre of work I produce and quantity for the decent but not huge salary I started at.  I also commute minshr one way everyday from where I live and the cost of the commute was taking a significant amount of my paycheque every month while trying to save for a down payment my wife also having a commute etc..  I let my manager know Id likely have to begin looking for something closer to home because I just couldnt afford the commute at the salary I was making while stressing how thankful I was for the job but he talked to the owners of the company essentially going to bat for me and I ended up with a  raise for them to help compensate for the cost of my commute a little.  And Ive only been here  months!  Now things to keep in mind My job is a junior position so I wasnt making a ton at my initial salary to begin with I work just as many hours as everyone else I didnt ever complain about how little I was making or how much I was losing in my commute I work pretty closely with the owner of the company and he gets to see a lot of the work I produce firsthand Im the only dedicated graphic designer inhouse although our marketing manager and IT guy also do some GD work when we are bogged down and I had actually known a bunch of the staff including the owners of the company for another  months prior to me starting the job because I did their photography. Good luck OP!TLDR Dont be too nervous to talk salary as long as you arent being too aggressive.

Im sorry but dont stress out about it. You will love InDesign.  Second that whole information superhighway thing called the internet is really becoming a part of everyday life. Your college didnt offer website design yet because it was in its infancy but youre totally going to need to know it so be prepared for more education. Third running your own design studio sounds great on paper but you do not have an MBA and are not suited for that task. Stick to being a designer and let someone better qualified run the business aspects. You dont want to spend half your career filling out invoices and billing clients.

4323174,0,t1_csc9yws,I mean that all sounds good and like you will have success but I personally wouldnt sign a contract for that. But thats based on my own negative personal experience youll be able to find designers that will take whatever you put on the table.Other things to consider What rights do the designers retain? Who owns the copyright? If they keep the copyright are they granting you exclusive rights for the term of the contract? If they keep the copyright howwhen do they get to break the contract? Is the possibility of rights reversion being considered?If youre not able to give an estimated income being a little more lax on these things might help. As an aside society sells their shirts for  each and the designers get a  profit from those sales. Given you can argue that youre handling all the marketing since to really sell anything on society you need to really be a salesperson but food for thought.,graphic_design,cscy8gs,1,t5_2qmtk
4328560,0,t3_3akq0n,I think what youre thinking of is complicated because you want to learn how to design better to get into a design course where they are in charge of teaching you the basics.That being said learning about typography and editorial design were the turning points for me. For typography have a good look at all of the resources you can find online and look up best books on typography on Google. Learning how to use type type not how to make type or how to do lettering was a good step into understanding design. Our teachers had us look at the better designed magazines she was a fan of Esquire particularly but she let us chose our own sources of inspiration and have a look at what was going on What did the grid look like on each page? How was each section different from another fonts grid colour palette graphic elements headers footers quotes what the magazines style was like who it was meant for what kind of articles they had what sort of photography were they using how did they keep the boring parts interesting e.g. the table of contents and what made them look good. If it sounds too complicated its okay and again I wouldnt know this if I hadnt gone to uni for it so I dont think they expect you to know it. More like Syrupjuice said just find a way to show how you solved a problem visually and why you chose that. Hope it helps! PM me if you need anything  ,graphic_design,csdk3pe,2,t5_2qmtk

It really depends on the relationship you can build up with the recruiters. If you have a good portfolio have a decent personality and can communicate well then they will probably do the best they can to get you work. Keep in mind this place is only making money when you do so they are doing the best they can to get their clients into paying positions. If you arent hearing back or nothing is materializing from them putting you in front of jobs then you probably arent what they are looking for. To specifically answer your question no they are not as bad as the internet would lead you to believe. But it all depends on what kind of person you are and how good of a designer you are.

I have hardly worked in Illustrator and was impressed to see some of the powerful features it has for this sort of work. This may be a foolish statement and clearly show my lack of understanding of the industry but I am unsure if he does more than one process within his job title or whether he has to put on many hats and therefore several different workflows for each general task that might be required. Is it fairly common for a designer  to have several different tasks and therefore several different workflows depending on the work he is assigned whether its an album cover the layout of a catalog a website design etc each is approached differently correct?as far as school I think I am staying in the state of Colorado. Would it be wise to try and pick his brain as far as what school specifically I should be heading into? And how to take advantage of the schooling system? I am curious about this because I am getting older and going to school at my age is a big decision for me so I want to do it right and I wonder whether he is my best source for unbiased feedback on this front?Lastly is it fair to ask him what do I need to do in order to eventually be a part of this company whether its  month  year or longer?

4681863,0,t1_ctko0vy,Id disagree entirely. The onus is on the interviewee not the interviewer to show their work in the best light. If I had some kid show up with a flash drive wondering where my laptop is thatd immediately come across as unprofessional unprepared and even lazy. Id go so far as to acknowledge not having a printed portfolio is required but at the very least the interviewee should be providing a way to view their work whether its a tablet or laptop or printed portfolio especially if the position involves print design. Interviews are often done in rooms like board rooms meeting rooms even spare offices and not everyone haswantsneeds a laptop. Im not going to borrow a laptop from a coworker or lug my desktop down the hall to the board room because someone couldnt be bothered to do anything more than throw a PDF onto a flash drive or not even and Im only going to look through their online portfolio in advance so far as to decide whether to give them an interview. I want to hear them describe their own work in person. Its too easy to take credit for someone elses contributions or even steal work. I want them to explain the rationale behind their work why they made decisions they made and further gauge them on how they talk about their work. You cant get that by just viewing an online portfolio and talking about their work with them without their work present is just odd. ,graphic_design,ctkp1el,3,t5_2qmtk

If I can throw together a comparatively or better specd machine for  less and have it be fully upgradeable I dont even need to think for a second to make that decision.I think that kind of realization has been spreading where people may want a Mac but Apple is just making it increasingly a brandloyalty and aestheticbased purchase where theyre counting on that perception that youre supposed to have a Mac because youre a creative professional but people arent falling for it as much anymore. ,graphic_design,cudxb96,0,t5_2qmtk

5073706,0,t3_3kd0ul,What will you be using the tablet for? Illustration? Retouching?At home I currently use the Wacom Intuos. formerly known as the Bamboo Its . I use it for both drawing and retouching photos in photoshop. Overall I think its very responsive and a great tablet for around a hundred bucks. Ive been using it for about a year now and havent really had any issues.At work I use an Intuos Pro Medium which I also use for illustration and the occasional photo retouching. The biggest difference here is all of the programmable buttons and touch ring. I dont have to move my hands back and forth between the tablet and keyboard as much with the Intuos and when Im doing detail work in illustration this tablet feels more precise. These apparently run around  though.Both are great tablets and I personally dont feel my work is negatively affected by using one or the other. In the end its about the person using the tablet. But I do feel that the Intuos is a bit more ergonomically friendly.

5103999,0,t3_3kqmf0,It can depend on the school on your time available your budget your area etc. No matter what research your options first. Dont simply pick one option because it costs less or assume that another is better because it costs more. You want to talk to program reps or even faculty check out the facilities look at the course descriptions and ask questions. Find out what an average studio course is like or an average semester. What the computer labs are like what equipment how accessible it is to students etc. Find out if the program is just glorified YouTube tutorials or whether they actually teach you something you couldnt just learn on your own online.Look at grad work from a graduating class. If you cant easily find this that might be a bad sign but at least ask them. And by class I mean just that. Not the work of a half dozen cherry picked students but ideally from dozens of students andor across the last few years. Many programs have grad shows or some kind of showcase. I mean any good program would want to show off the result of their program. If a program has absolutely nothing to show you thats probably a bad sign. Ultimately remember that as a prospective student you are a customer. Colleges regardless of level are businesses. You as a customer should be getting the best program that your money can buy regardless of your budget. So when shopping around treat it the same you would a car or a house. Test drive a car compare models ask questions. Or with a home get it inspected look at the history the neighborhood etc. Choosing a college program should be treated in similar ways where you want to be an educated consumer making the right purchase. ,graphic_design,cv180b1,0,t5_2qmtk

And these posters get . seconds to kick it.On the plus its a solid design pleasing good colors. I would totally glance at it thinking its a dance music show and I dont mean that to be dismissive. Its visually good but the underlying conceptmarketing piece isnt clear. If I were the client I would say the brand context should be higherpeople should be able to immediately get this is a physical buyable product. It feels more like an event or a happening.,graphic_design,cvhr7m0,3,t5_2qmtk

Youd be surprised where you can cut costs and pocket some of the savings depending on an individual printers equipment and workflow. Ive saved tons of money  and made a solid friend in the print shop owner  when I can gang my job up on another one. Im old enough to have learned print work by interning at a static cameraprepress service provider so I have more practical insight into the printing process than a lot of newcomers. Printing has its own set of idiosyncratic knowledge one should endeavor to learn  its cool as hell itll save you money and keep you from making expensive or timeconsuming mistakes. ,graphic_design,cvx6mgu,3,t5_2qmtk
5371220,0,t1_cvy7b94, Talk to your supervisor about where you sit and that you believe you would be more efficient if you were in closer proximity to the other designer or marketing team that you collaborate with. If youre working remotely in most cases thats a blessing. It sounds more like youre a parttime or on contract basis. Thats kind of how it works. If shes not giving you enough work to be fulltime it sounds like there isnt enough work to be given to necessitate you being fulltime. Parking sucks in a lot of cases. Some businesses dont even reimburse or cover parking. Youre expected to handle that on your own. Could be worse. This is a significantly minor complaint at best. And yes Ive asked her for more work. She says there isnt any but I know thats not true.  Ok...now Im going to be real...how in the fuck do you know that? You probably dont. You probably think theres more work to be handed out and that your supervisor just isnt giving it to you for some reason. Its either one of two things  either there is not enough work to be given out or youve demonstrate that youre only capable of handling so much work. Now before you get offended really take a second to focus your perspective and think why a supervisor wouldnt give you work if there was work to be done?I dont know your life or circumstances but based on what youve posted you believe youre owed more work responsibility and different arrangements by your supervisor. It doesnt sound like youre asking for more. You might not be showing youre capable of more.

5559391,0,t3_3qvz85,Im currently a senior in college who started my studies in a similar way you did. Im also from New York and am very acutely aware of the cost of living. I cant really speak about the actual salaries of designers because Im not in the work force yet but what I ended up doing over the course of my  years was turning my major into a more widespread media studies major. My school essentially allows me to build my own major with the guidance of an advisor which might prove to be a bit problematic if your school doesnt do something similar but its a good option to look at if youre interested in web design film etc. Really just things that are in the same general category of design. I really just came to the realization that I dont have a massive amount of talent in pure graphic design but I am competent. If someone told me they needed stationary or whatever designed I could do a professional job but alas I wont be producing any world changing designs. I did realize though through a job filming and editing for my school that I was about equally as good at film production again nothing world changing but I could handle myself and occasionally make something really nice. So I decided to combine my major with film studies and eventually added web design. Sorry to give my life story but I wanted to give some context. I feel like at least from my point of view having the same fears of not being able to afford the lifestyle I want that me being relatively good at a lot of different types of media production thats just what Ill group all of these things as rather than really really good at design will be a safer option for me and I feel good knowing that I have a more broad skillset. TLDR I used to be a design student as well but changed to a more rounded major that gave me good skills in everything rather than great skills in one thing. This seems safer to me so maybe it will to you as well. ,graphic_design,cwm6z08,2,t5_2qmtk

5576997,0,t1_cwncjq0,What do you mean by brutal? As long as a critique is given in a constructive way and as long as teachers are giving students the proper tools to succeed I dont think that can ever be brutal. Even if a work has a hundred things wrong with it. But to be constructive a critique has to explain why the work fails if not also how to improve it or at least to point the designer in the right direction.The other aspect is the guidance of a teacher. With something like a design its not beneficial for them to just give the student the answer as often there is no one answer anyway but to at least guide the student by helping them to understand why something works or doesnt. Not just telling them what to do or what not to do. Itd be like if I gave you a math problem and you maybe tried it but your process was wrong and so you werent arriving at the right answer and as your teacher I only cared whether you gave me the right answer or not. Some people would probably just resort to guessing others maybe arrive at the right answer by fluke or via the wrong process. And so even if people did provide the correct answer they havent actually learned how to solve the problem only to sneak onto the next level. ,graphic_design,cwodmyw,2,t5_2qmtk

Colors like black work with white text because it is high contrast. The brighter the color the more it bleeds to the white.To correct this you equalize the color by diffusing it using the method he explained. Tear dropper the color change it to  saturation and voila no more head pain. Sometimes this works sometimes it doesnt.

6169705,0,t1_cyquyqb,Oh not at all! Its not offensive but rather a misconception that happens a lot in our field. People just enjoy doing what their perceive as cool. My friends all the time are jealous of my profession because they think that all I do is cool shit and work on awesome things all the time.While generally speaking thats true they start putting it on a pedestal and keep forgetting that this is my livelihood and that it required a lot of hard work to work at the capacity that Im at now. The further issue as I discussed before was the concept of art versus craft. People do understand that its a job and that you need to learn certain things to accomplish it. But what people keep forgetting is that its more art than craft. In other fields once you take all the required classes and get certified in certain things you can go out and get a job. For design though you can be a master in Photoshop but if your portfolio isnt good... youre not going to get hired.This is the main thing that I try to explain to my friends and people like you who are interested in design. The reason why people you look up to are good at it is because not only are they qualified they also have a knack for it. This in part due to passion but also because theyre naturally talented in the design aspects of it. That sadly is something that a class cant teach. And something that cant be learned on the weekend by watching Youtube tutorials. ,graphic_design,cyqxjqb,1,t5_2qmtk

Focus on the proportions and how they interact. Its okay to get it wrong a bunch of times as long as you learn something each time.Beyond that its mostly just drawing what you find interesting. I cant think of any subject in particular that worked better than anything else. If youre not already familiar with the concepts of contour drawing and gesture drawing do a little research on those.

6452678,0,t3_441id3,I worked for over a year as a graphic designer production artist at an apparel company that specialized in screen printingembroidery for retail and wholesale. I can tell you that the process of setting graphics up for screen printing can be tedious and timeconsuming although sometimes therapeutic!. It feels great to see your work come alive postproduction. Cons lacks creativity sometimes. Unless youre involved in the actual designing of the graphic content you can expect your days to be filled with repetitive technicalbased tasks. Definitely a position that requires someone who is good with fine details and following instruction as one small mistake can cost the company a lot of money. I managed to score the position straight out of college and didnt know anything about printing and production but all in all enjoyed my time there and learned a lot about printing technicalities that have proven to be a great skill to have in the industry. Good luck with your decision! ,graphic_design,czmqyj6,3,t5_2qmtk
6457747,0,t3_443f4x,gt I was wondering if its possible to get into graphic design without going to a design school?Absolutely! gt Id say im kinda creative. I mean I just have an eye for detail and has technical skills Id say since i can learn from using a software by immersion.Great attributes to have. Design is incredibly detail oriented and being able to use the tools software etc competently is very helpful.gt though im not sure if i really have original ideas.Design at least when you are a beginner or early in your career is not about having original ideas. You need to be able to research what other people have done in similar situations blend it in with the clients needs and wants and synthesize that information into the finished product. You get ideas and inspiration from other sources and turn them into something applicable to the context of the design brief.gt And if I doim not sure how to execute it.This is simply learning the fundamentals of design theory colour shape positioning grids etc and a moderate competency with the tools Adobe Creative Suite for example. You can learn these things without going to design school.gt Like in drawing I CANT draw. I have something in mind but i cant draw and execute it.You can draw. You may not be able do draw well. It is a skill akin to using PhotoShop or riding a bike. Illustrative designart techniques like painting drawing and sculpting all take practice. You can find your own methods of learning this without going to design school.gt My way for doing those banners back in the day is that i just get stock wallpapers online put some stock graphics in it and a nice looking font. Thats it and the people seem to like it. To be blunt people liked it because it was free they didnt know how to do it themselves and are impressed that you can and their standards would not have been very high.gt Do graphic designers do that? Or do you have to do EVERY single thing by scratch?In some contexts using stock photography and images with a nice looking font is okay. Usually in mockups or conceptual work because it is very low effort and gives enough fidelity to a client so that they can see your ideas for the end product without you having to spend a tonne of your time and their money on it. When producing the finished product you will usually create most effects and images yourself or use high quality freely available stock images where applicable.,graphic_design,czn9vxt,1,t5_2qmtk

Creativity doesnt come from tight schedules. If theyre telling you that youre costing the company money on top of that Id definitely look for something new even if its tough in a small city.

6635390,0,t3_46gi3k,Well i kinda agree that its a bit amateur.. Too much text and objects. Not enough space. These years are all about minimalism so keep it simple.. I would strictly advise against using any form of real life picture as opposed to vector graphics  drawings especially if the pictures arent OC as they will look out of frame. Also maybe put a chicken on there doesnt mean you have to put a chicken on there. They hire you because they have no sense of design so dont kill your magnum opus because of their ideas.. This probably personal but i dont really like the color scheme. The big red sign kinda screams warning even though its a friendly company that wants to repair your phone. . Is it  different formats?

Especially with coding while its all very logical it definitely is not intuitive. And I think people dont realize the difference when trying to explainhelp someone. They get hung up on how it makes sense and is incredibly logical but to me it just doesnt. Where maybe A follows B and produces C except what defines or describes A B or C dont make sense to me.So just like with learning a spoken language all I can do is try to memorize specific sequences or uses but I never actually understand it. I always rely on some kind of guide or help because I could never actually produce a sentence on my own. And really I dont even want to do web designdevelopment.

Take her out to lunch. YOU pay for lunch. Explain to her that this will not work the way that it is going currently. Yes every design has the right to be critiqued but it should only be by someone who is qualified. Because I dont like black is not a critique. That is not constructive. That does not improve a brand. Explain that you encourage critiques that improve the concept from her background marketing or whatever but not just because. Simply state that you have not been hired to be a robot.  She may take it well or she can always pull a power move. AWESOME. That simply gives you the opportunity to present your case to the higher ups in a JOINT MEETING WITH HER where you can explain that you have a degree and have been doing this for X number of years. You are happy to take criticism from her from a MARKETING perspective not a design perspective. EXPLAIN that every change from her delays production and increases costs INSTEAD of getting work done and billing it out. SHE is costing the client money. SHE is costing this company money. YOU want to make the company money. YOU want the employees of the company to DO WHAT THEY DO BEST. Not pick their favorite colors. Put it in terms of money and people tend to listen. Dont bother to put it in terms of your design expertise. No one cares about you.  If that ends well great. You stay. Offer to buy her a drink and smooth things out as much as possible for throwing her under the bus. If it ends poorly you leave the company. Fuck them. You are not in the right job. As it stands now youre not going to make it there much longer anyway so just push the issue and move on with your life. Yes it might be scary. So the fuck what. Anything worth doing is scary at first.MOST IMPORTANTLY IF YOU DO NOTHING NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.  Youre not in jail. Time is to short to sit and fuck around.

The characters are always slightly off the edge of the field because every letter has some space around it. That can be a little annoying but makes sense it works just like oldschool metal typesetting.I never understood why we cant put strokes on the outside for text though same goes for linesopen shapes why cant I just put the stroke on one or the other side of a line?So yeah got no fix for you youve just discovered some slightly annoying things about Illustrator.,graphic_design,d0teme5,1,t5_2qmtk

Maybe you use it to trace a drawing youve sketched and scannedphotographed to use as a placed reference or maybe you just try to replicate the Nike swoosh or the Apple logo or something simple.Theres definitely a lot more advanced you can do with Illustrator but if youre just at that initial stage and playing around just focus on the pen tool and play with that. ,graphic_design,d14h1fy,1,t5_2qmtk

7612540,0,t1_d33ypwh,Im not familiar with UK schools but even in North America my biggest advice to people considering design education is just to research and the program specifically not just the school. It seems to be far too common where people just end up in poor programs and it just propagates the idea that design education is unnecessary.Colleges are really just like any other product or service. If youre buying a car any responsible consumer would look into different makes read reviews look up their reliability cost of maintenance and test drive different models. If you just go to one dealer or buy something just based on aesthetics or brand and dont actually do any research then its pretty much on you if you end up with a lemon or unhappy. So with a design education people should look into the curriculum and syllabuses the qualifications of the faculty grad work facilities find out what an average studio and lecture courses are like. If possible visit the school and talk to studentprogram reps and ask them questions. Its too bad that some people are limited by area finances etc but just picking something because its close or cheap or has lax admissions requirements isnt necessarily a good idea either. ,graphic_design,d37i85z,1,t5_2qmtk

7695703,0,t3_4kod3z,I did some very basic logos for him but he wouldnt biteand now our app design is starting to look like MS Word  masterpieceSo heres where it all went wrong. This client does not value design or you did not convince him of the value of design or he does not see YOU as a valuable designer. When you do work for free your work has no value. You gave him logos without him asking. Why? If you were a mechanic and saw that a car needed new brakes tires and new paint job would you just do it hoping they would like it and want to pay you? Or would you suggest it get a no and move on?Every designer has been in your shoes so dont take it personally and dont think much more about it. Finish the job and move on to better ones. If you suggested a logo redesign and the client cant see that his sucks use that as a warning sign and move on. Some clients simply do not value design and they dont care what it looks like. As the saying goes you can only lead a horse to water.Finally learn from this for next time. Take a clients direction about design but assert your authority as a professional. Just because a client wants to use crappy art for their logo doesnt mean that you should roll over. You let this project creep too long in his hands and it is most likely too late to turn it around. But for next time you need to immediately speak up and refuse to put together shit design. You should have an irrefutable reason why that speaks to the value it has for the clients company. Or how it will fuck up his company if he uses comic sans and shit clip art. Clients care about money. They care about making it and they care about losing it. Rarely do they care about how pretty something is and for sure they dont care about your portfolio. Make them care about what good design does for them in terms of money exposure awareness etc. And never ever give them quick logo concepts. Instead show them EXAMPLES of other logos that are better than his explain why they are better and get PAID to do logos that take time and effort to do effectively.

That would ruin the good aspects of the spices on their own. Right?Also and I have no idea what you mean by designing my app but you couldnt license those fonts affordably. San Fran isnt licensable from Apple. Helvetica is very expensive for App use. Typekit doesnt license fonts for apps... and so on. Google Fonts are free and the only ones who dont have insane licensing TOS for them.

First step is developing branding guidelines so you dont find yourself doing the ol design creep as you start making new materials. Sure you can bend you own rules here and there but being able to reference things is a great start. Once those are developed then tackle the website. Its likely the most outwardfacing part of the company so its a high priority item. The rest of the materials you can update as needed since having everything reprinted can be a large expenditure and getting that approved can be difficult. However if you can get that approved then by all means try to roll everything out at once so your brand is consistently represented.

Ive got a client right now w a k budget on a Wix site because they want to maintain it themselves once all is said and done and they have no interest in learning to code or to have a developer on hand. Im no web developer but creating custom icons banners logos galleries buttons etc adds up... These things they cannot do for .

For example Im a graphic designer but Ive designed a table but as sure as hell know nothing about durability so the production company would handle the details. If its a website we would do the designing and hire a coder for making it. By doing the design inhouse one gets to cut the cost when hiring out as it is only the production aspect.

I totally agree with this and think that designers should use these exchanges with these people that may go or already have gone through a site like Fiver as really valuable teachable moments. I think a lot of these people  when presented with an explanation of what these sites really offer and what clients will generally get from them and who actually does that work for those rates will reconsider going in that direction. There are a great deal of people that just do not understand the economics involved here and therefore wouldnt even speculate about any of the moving parts involved.On the other hand some people DGAF and those kinds of clients arent the best to deal with anyway so good riddance I suppose.,graphic_design,d7qzjyd,1,t5_2qmtk

9096764,0,t3_54tk41,What I did but this was a few years ago was putting all assets on one canvas slice all the assets and then save all slices at once. For each resolution I would just make the whole canvas smaller. There are scripts within photoshop that adds certain prefixes to the assets so for retina iphone it would always put x automatically. It worked perfectly but it was a lot of work to set up. Especially if you want the assets to have sharp edges for each resolution. Because if you have a line which is  pixels wide it becomes blurry if you want to export that asset for a lower resolution. Then with photoshop actions you could automate even more.Nowadays things changed though so Im not sure if this is still a good method. ,graphic_design,d85a98h,1,t5_2qmtk

Not to mention a day of your time so thats probably  hours of your time spent as well.

Thinking back to JJ what part of Manhattan does she live? Does she even live in Manhattan? JJ is more about an individual character to piece. If i had to reimagine this poster Id blow up JJ to fill the poster and then double exposure Kilgrave looking ominous into JJs shadowed areas because hes part of psyche and always just looming in the shadows.

Absolutely talk about the process you took to get to whatever launched. Absolutely showcase it in your portfolio. Talk about why what launched was better but also talk about why your initial thought had strengths too. Its okay to defend your initial thinking even if it wasnt ultimately what the client decided they wanted or needed. Portfolios that only show finished work without showing any process get roundfiled when I hire.

A lot of the local clients in Rochester are colleges so print collateral is often needed whether its event invites or annual reports. Xerox Kodak and Bauch amp Lomb are the other big three Rochester based clients and they often need internal materials to distribute to employees. There are also local advertising agencies that create branding and packaging for local and major brands. One of the best things about Rochester is that many people here refuse to be tied down to local clients and actively work with national clients as well. I think its almost impossible to get out of doing print production here. Alongside that we have a lot of college students coming out of graphic design RIT just breached top  in designs schools in the US! Woo! And youll be surrounded by good techsavvy people whom Im sure you can learn a lot from on the digital side of design. Im glad you like my city!

10171749,0,t3_5l5vvh,You learn by doing so while you could find tutorials that teach you different things I would suggest instead starting at a point of something you want to make then using tutorials that fit that project.For example if you wanted to create a movie poster you could actually use InDesign layout Photoshop imagery and Illustrator vector logos all on the same project. But what tutorials you would use depend on what kind of poster you want to create.Maybe its a s style like Bullitt or s like Star Wars or Alien or some modern poster whatever. The techniques and such that are used could be all over the place.For example doing the effect on a photo might be one tutorial creating the movie logo might be another tutorial and setting up the layout in InDesign or Illustrator might be another tutorial.If you want some starting ideas see below. None of these are direct tutorials but are just objectives. Photoshop. Combine three friends faces into one new fictitious person.. Combine at least  different source photos into a new fantastical landscape.. Colourize and repair an old black and white photo.Illustrator. Reproduce a known logo for example IBM Apple McDonalds or any wellknown logo that you happen to like. You could probably do this for a few logos.. Create a blueprintfloor plan for your home using a set scale. InDesign. Pick a magazine you read and replicate a spread.. Using that spread establish what the grid is that they used.,graphic_design,dbx0v7o,2,t5_2qmtk

10485182,0,t3_5q5ubv,Well it sounds like a misunderstanding andor miscommunication.Usually when I do interviews like this we called it an informational interview. Since we dont have any openings we offer it as an opportunity for the person to show their work gain feedback and ask questions and advice. Usually what is good what can be better would they fit into the agency etc.It sounds like this is what the art director thought the meeting was ie a meeting to give advice and feedback. It sounds like you thought it was an interview based on them liking your work. And in my experience the meeting could have been set up by one person who liked your work enough to say this person has enough talent to warrant a talk but the meeting is set up with any designer that has an opening in their schedule i.e. I did a lot of informational interviews but my bossor an HR person was the one that set it up. I think we told people ahead of time that we were giving them an informational interview.So it sucks that you had a bad experience but it doesnt sound like an oddity to me.TLDR They didnt communicate well you thought one thing they thought the other. Confusion ensues.,graphic_design,dcwlrnf,3,t5_2qmtk

10540555,0,t1_dd2u478,I hope not because you dont have any control as a designer who posts your work. Besides my own posts there are hundreds of those account that just repost designs from others...Though I wonder one small thing. Instagrams photos have pretty bad quality. It looks good on your phone but if you look on desktop you can see compression artifacts easily. I wonder if Forever copied the image or rebuild it from scratch. It looks like the latter option because the text inside the Instagram picture seems really small while the text on the banner is quite big. Did your girlfriend post a hires quality picture somewhere else maybe? On Behance? In any case its stealing so it doesnt really matter. I just wonder about the process they went trough at Forever ...It might be a case where an in house designer just got lazy or needed to make a deadline and copied it from her. Maybe OP can get in touch with the design department somehow and let them now one of their designers copies work if nothing else works. At the very very least and really this should be the bare minimum if nothing else they should mention her as the creator with a link to her portfolio. edit I didnt look well before. I know clearly see that they didnt copy it one on one.The gradients are a bit different. Still the concept is clearly the same of course.,graphic_design,dd2w0qt,17,t5_2qmtk

10751083,0,t3_5ttnig,gt After a year and a half of surveys community meetings and hashing and rehashing proposed designs Muskegon officials are sticking with the citys old logo.gt gt The city has floated eight different proposed logos designed by local marketing firm Revel. But after receiving citizen and employee input officials decided there was too much dissension and that the time was not right for a new logo said Muskegon City Manager Frank Peterson.gt gt Maybe were just not ready for a change Peterson said. As much as I feel like we need a new brand a new face we just kind of feel like nows not the time to do it.gt gt So the city will stick with the existing purple logo that features the tower of the Hackley Administration Building a sailboat and a stringed instrument with the words Muskegon and West Michigans Shoreline City.gt gt Revel artists worked with city officials on more than  rough sketches and developed five logos that were presented to the public during community input sessions. The logos were narrowed to one featuring a colorful abstract M and the words Muskegon and Michigan. But when it was presented to employees they gave it a thumbs down.gt gt So Revel went back to the drawing board using input from staff and citizens to develop three different logos. Those were released early this year. The city put a survey on its website asking for input on which of the three logos citizens preferred and gathered input at a community meeting.gt gt MLive also posted an online survey but there was no clear winner among the roughly  votes cast in that survey. And comments on the MLive post revealed plenty of criticism of the new designs and favor for the old logo.gt gt I dont know Peterson said. People just didnt like them... It ended up being counterproductive.gt gt The city paid Revel  to produce a new logo. Peterson said that in the future the city may revisit the issue but for now its keeping the familiar purple images that have been around for decades.Source,graphic_design,ddow45f,3,t5_2qmtk

10965485,0,t1_de908gx,Its interesting that you mention Envato because thats pretty much how we get most clients to agree to a website mock up. We throw out a bunch of templates that we think work for them with some Photoshop work they pick one and then we start populating it with their content. Its pretty generic and it works in most cases until they ask for something more dynamic. Then the developers are involved otherwise I could do the basic things like replacing the placeholder images and styling fonts  colors myself. Things that were complicated years ago like parallax gimmicks are even included in these templates. If they agree to a WordPress its even easier. Hell some clients are okay with us just styling a Squarespace for them.

Im not a graphic designer Im just a guy. Theres plenty of bad design out there and the concept is certainly not the worst.

Its no surprise how often all of that means they usually try to grab someone still in college and pay them  an hour for a lot of it.

I certainly have never heard of anyone in design discriminating against an applicant because they didnt include their GPA. The degree itself with design exists as an indicator of four years of design training. Whether you benefited from that training will show itself in the portfolio. I mean since its not standard to include GPA someone with a poor GPA just wouldnt include it. And if someone had a great GPA it could be nullified if the portfolio is lacking or if they generally underperform in the interview itself. Someones knowledge of theory would be shown in the interview when the applicant is talking about their work which really is the entire point of bringing a portfolio to an interview. We can view the work online but we need the interview to actually have a conversation about the work and get into their process. ,graphic_design,dgovkqg,2,t5_2qmtk
