1564184,0,t1_cjcamv8,I had written a long reply to this then realized it pretty much boiled down to this youre making mountains out of molehills because EVERY SINGLE GAME IN EXISTENCE has to choose some point short of complete realism at which to pin the mechanics because complete realism is generally rather unfun in a game. Have you seen ANY indication whatsoever that the developers are getting rid of some game mechanic that would reduce the realism? I havent. Theyre still working on several mechanics to increase the realism shellshock drowning possibly gas attacks. Stop worrying about what they might theoretically do even though they havent actually given any kind of indication that they might do that.,VerdunGame,cjccd8p,2,t5_2xqvi

6080137,0,t3_3yrxjd,So I was playing this game a couple months ago. This one NCO kept gassing our own trench and it was making me mad so I yelled at him. He told me he was gassing our own trench during assault phase because everyone on our team was just sitting in trench. Thats right he was using gas to force our noobs to get out of trench and attack. Once I figured it out I realized how genius he was. We became friends and I played several games with himclan over the next few days.  would gas own trench again.,VerdunGame,cygl7jh,5,t5_2xqvi

7692322,0,t3_4kndpa,There are some good ideas but I would like to  quote one of the decs for you.Our problem however is that the pile of another cool thing to add to the game ideas is big. Like about  items big. Thats why we cant just go and add it right now. We judge each feature on things like awesomenessfactor but also gameplay implications and quality of life improvements. Source  Would be a nice thing to improve the atmosphere but imo its not very important This is something i would love to see on bigger maps like vosges flanders or picardie but not on smaller maps like argonne. This would make flanders a even more annoying map than it currently is Barbed wires are critical to the map design I just made a post about it myself after reading this  Colonial troops sounds ike a really interesing idea I would like to see but there are a lot of squads on both sides waiting to be added. Anzacs etc on a hardcore mode yes could you elaborate on that? Im personally not a fan on night maps so ill ignore that question not sure about that Sounds like a pretty good idea I do think we could need some urban maps although urban warfare was not common on the western front iirc especially after  wat,VerdunGame,d3gkg3p,2,t5_2xqvi

8815892,0,t3_50v7d9,The big problem is about the squad exp unlocks. It punishes individual players from switching away from players they have exp with.

11151565,0,t3_5z3tcm,TranslationOk first off the marshmallow men. Referring to the glitch which turns players pure white.Second the servers and their various problems such as creating a squad and joining a match only to be greeted with some bullshit error.Third reloading. Sometimes I go to reload and when I get half way through and have to move probably to get away from enemies or artillery it stops reloading and resets. Fourth switching weapons on the move. When I want to switch I have to stop walking. I dont know if its a bug or what.Fifth floating objects on the battlefield. Never encountered this before. Sixth walkingcrouch speed. Its a little on the slow side. Also random lag in game and on the menu. By the way Im on Xbox One. Finally reloading on the move. Same thing I have to stop. Already mentioned previously on the list.These are some of the bugs and problems I have encountered. I love the game and I hope to see it develop and prosper even more.     ,VerdunGame,dew0nhb,3,t5_2xqvi
