5574401,0,t1_cwo1k7f,Sorry I didnt notice the imgur link. My bad. For CR use Spike May Yuri Ariel and a Rachel friend or the daily K. With a Rachel friend you should be able to break k easily.  Go with  formation leave the back spot blank for the Rachel friend ideally . Tower use Spike Velika May a better healer than what you have and the th spot can go to someone that works for that floor. Velika and May together will help mitigate damage with the passives. I forget what Hellenias passive does but if it helps with team survivability then use her as the tank. For overall improvement Id suggest you get a healer for the  selector. Lucy is good because of block passive even though her heals are worse than all the rest. Personally I think Lucy synergizes well with MayVelika and if you have a tank that increases team defense then youll be pretty good. ,Sevenknightsglobal,cwo20zh,1,t5_39b43
