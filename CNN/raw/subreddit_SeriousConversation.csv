4729612,0,t3_3fp0oa,I feel like theres a negative criminal? implication towards psychopaths here. Im not sure if that was your intent or not but I dont think they should expect any treatments or special care unless they break the laws of society or are coupled with other mental disordersdiseases that make living difficult andor make them a potential threat to those around them. Psychopathy and sociopathy doesnt imply that a person is dangerous. In fact in the top  list of careers psychopaths are drawn to number  are surgeons. This makes sense when you think about it because ideally youd want someone with little emotional attachment to be operating on you so they can focus more on getting the job done. So to answer your questions I personally dont think any changes should be made to any of our current systems.

4768559,0,t3_3g6q1a,I think were born with a belief that everything balances and is fair. As we grow older we believe that there are rules and structure and way of things. We accept these things without question because they are our reality. Eventually our brains develop to the point where we can think abstractly and we realize that good is not good and bad is not bad. We realize nothing is fair and there is very little that follows the rules. We also learn that perspectives on things can vary drastically from person to person and culture to culture. It all feels like we were lied to and it feels like it was so we could be controlled. At this point people start trying to fight against something and sometimes also for something. This can go in a myriad of different directions. Many just let themselves go back to the comfort of ignorance. Some get so enraged that they lose any sense of rationality. But some people take a moment to stop reevaluate the world around them and form new perspectives. Some of those people start to see the big picture and find ways they can influence it. Some of these people actually succeed. Youre at that tipping point it sounds like. I would most prefer that you avoid the path of paranoia and anger and instead pursue the path of careful examination and planning.Whatever it is you choose to do I hope you stop waiting for someone to help you get started.

It is of course the most violent religion in our society today now that those Irish boys have calmed down a bit and Ive never felt comfortable around any die hard religious people but it really is a very small minority who cause any trouble. What I dont think we should do is compromise our otherwise good record on inclusion and tolerance. Compared to other heavily populated European countries whove experienced high immigration I feel weve done very well over the years at making a multicultural society work. Compare for example the Indian and Pakistani communities in Britain to the Turkish community in Germany whilst starting around the same time you wouldnt really find anyone nowadays who wants to send all the Indians back In Germany however you will still find a few people displaying antiturkish sentiment. Really I think its a case of hearts and minds british culture and being a muslim arent necessarily incompatable I think what we need to look at is why young british muslims may become alienated to the point where a life of radicalism or even moving to an active warzone would seem more appealing than living here cue jokes about miserable english towns. ,SeriousConversation,ctzt272,2,t5_345ie

4902532,0,t3_3i0p8a,One of the most dangerous and littleunderstood problems from a policy perspective is boredom. Being bored leads to poor decisions  of First Nations kids in Canada quit school because of boredom and mental distress that borders on and sometimes straightout is torture consider solitary confinement. Boredom is lethal stuff.The question that I would posit isnt too much entertainment but rather is our entertainment entertaining. People want innovation and newness  Lord knows we hear enough criticism of Call of Duty and the like on that basis. We have entire genres and styles devoted to enjoying things ironically. I find that and the fact that in an era of unlimited entertainment at the tips of our fingers we still tend to be bored fascinating.I posit that the boredom we feel stems from a huge number of potential sources. Ottawa where I live is painfully boring without a car. Saugus MA looks like nothing but strip malls and unwalkable stretches of wasteland.

A way to make people who do something wrong suffer for their crimes and maybe give the victims some revengecatharsispeace of mind? Or is it rehabilitation? Is the larger goal to take these people who have done wrong and return them to society as bettered individuals? If jail is punishment the death penalty is the logical conclusion of that.  Id argue that we should just kill anyone who will die in prison anyway.  There will always be a margin for error but that is with anything people are going to lose their life to any system regardless.  If jail is rehab then the death penalty defeats the purpose since you cant rehabilitate a dead person. Personally Id rather die than spend  years in prison.  Id go nuts and there is no point in me living in a box.  In that regard the death penalty is merciful but not everyone is me.

5343875,0,t1_cvuodq7,gtActually women are equally likely to attempt suicide and think about suicide... men just tend to be significantly more successful at their attempts.This was what I was getting at. I am female and I suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts but I know that I will usually have an easier time of talking to someone about how I feel than a male counterpart would because women are usually seen as emotional beings. The fact that man up is a phrase itself is telling of the difference.Should it be like that? No. But men are less likely to get treatment for depression and I honestly think toxic notions of masculinity play a part in that.OP may just be feeling sorry for himself thats true. But he may also have deeper issues and if thats the case then telling him to get over it is not going to help.

Similarly to you I didnt really know myself or have an identity outside of what I was doing in school so I was also a little bit lost. Instead of going straight back in Im taking some time off moving to Korea getting a job and then auditioning for an MM when I save up the money. Some people go directly to grad programs others do not.Honestly in my opinion even if you are of a quality where you think you can make a career out of soloing with orchestras around the country perhaps think of taking a  month sabbatical before your Masters and then return to it. Go to Europe. Go hiking in the Pacific NW. Stepping away from music for a little bit but not quitting will help you with your perspective and possibly with your physical problems. You may even grow as a musician through experiencing other things in life. More importantly I think you would grow as a person. I wouldnt quit though. You would regret it if you just threw it all away.I remember music school. Before my junior recital with Elliott Carter Sonata and Schubert D.

If there is to be an us in the future your expectations for me have to adjust. I cant be perfect. I try to do right by you. I try my best. I wish youd forgive my mistakes rather than making a spectacle of them every time. I feel like I either get frack for forgetting a few things while I try to do many or berated for trying to go all out with one thing and it not meeting your expectations.  I want intimacy as badly as you. I am not a toy with a switch you can turn on when it suits you. There are little moments where I try to rebuild the closeness. Moments that dont suit your mood. I should forgive you because there are moments for you which dont suit me. Im just so angry. That and all my other emotions are buried deep enough to numb the pain I feel every day. I need to talk to someone and you refuse to listen.  I am losing it. I am losing you. Watching you slowly drift away from me and I cant pull you back. I am letting myself die inside to kill the pain. Letting you get away from me. I know it is killing you too. Seeing you hurt hurts me. This is why I pull away when you warm up to me. I want things to be hot not heated. I feel I cant meet your expectations and when we have these moments of reconnecting I get flashes of how you reacted poorly to my attitude in the past. You see my hesitation and think I am disgusted by you. You blame me for thinking that way of you and deny my honesty of saying I think otherwise.  My love has not dwindled or dimmed but I am not the man at the end of faerie tales. I am he who reads from the first chapters. The one left behind as the true love arrives. I see you reaching for your happy ending without me in it. I wanted to be there but I feel like youre already gone from my life. I hurt so damn much. I am losing myself over the loss of you. I just want to reclaim the moments from before we reached the beginning of this end. Write our story differently. Erase the mistakes of yesterday. Enflame the passion that existed from the start.

The anthem began and everyone in the stadium stood and removed their hats but I stayed seated and left mine on. I thought to myself this is a bs ritual and rather than participate with some arbitrary human motion that society has deemed as showing respect I will sit here and be with my thoughts. The anthem ended and a guy a couple seats down motioned to get my attention. What the fuck is your problem? I just risked my life to protect your freedoms. You not gonna show respect? I pretended not to hear or understand him as he seemed to be getting more and more worked up. His girlfriend finally called him off and I sunk into my chair.

It is possible for a society to have more than one conversation at the time.Both the acts and the beliefs that inspire them must be discussed and opposed.

8257656,0,t1_d59qznr,Seems like I didnt get my point across. How do people generally know if someone is PHYSICALLY attractive? How does one know if a person is prettyhandsomegood lookingcute? Im more curious on the criteria. Is there a set of features that deems one attractive or not? Ive been told that physical attractiveness is based on how one perceives another person. It was explained as just knowing that theyre attractive regardless of them being your type and you fancying them.Science suggests there are traits that make a person aestheticallypleasing. However some people when asked to describe a persons attractiveness computer generated attractive faces would find a number of these faces quite plain and not as attractive as science made it out to be.So if objective attractiveness does not exist and not always tied to some form of emotional bond is identifying people as good looking something that always existed in the human mind be it conscious or not? And if it is most probably so then is mine possibly inherently defective?Thanks for replying even after being downvoted to oblivion.,SeriousConversation,d59riey,2,t5_345ie

You can be a grown adult CEO of a multimillion a  year old child or a th grader and enjoy video games like Super Mario Pokemon without an ounce of judgment.

Nicotine travels quickly to the brain when it is inhaled and can cause a feeling of temporary relaxation andor stress relief.
