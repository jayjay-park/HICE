7236668,0,t1_d1zj94g,gtDid you ever go out of your way to possibly run into her too?Oh totally. I would go out of my way to see this person as often as possible and look my best upon arrival. As limerents do.gt Its amazing how similar peoples experiences are.For sure. I was shocked as to how many boxes I checked off when reading the descriptors of limerence. Nervous and insecure around the LO? Check. Inability to speak properly? Check. Reading into the LOs actions and constantly trying to determine whether they reciprocate your feelings? Check. Emotions completely contingent upon the days successfailure in interacting with LO? Check. Replayingrehearsing exchanges with LO? Check.Cheers to our newfound awareness! I hope we can both continue to work through this and become stronger people for it ,limerence,d20r99m,1,t5_2smi6
8179597,0,t3_4khems,Are you me? Im going through the exact same thing. Main differences is Im coming up to the th year of marriage very soon. The other guy shows no interest and hes married with a child on the way. Making me feel like dirt shit both for having an attraction to someone else behind my husbands back as well as being attracted to an attached man. Ive been asking myself if its lust but all sign point to the negative. Like you its his intelligence passion in work chill drive quiet confidence etc thats been making my heart flutter. Ive also been digging deep and uncovered a lot of baggage I didnt want to face.I married too young too soon to someone I figured I should just settle with because hey no one else has shown any interest.  years on because Im older and more selfassured I discover that I want different things. But divorce is not in the cards. Its not acceptable and I have no justifiable reasons to do so. Husband is good to me hes a decent guy. Im here just waiting for this limerent episode to fade out and hopefully get back to being the contented wife I formerly was. It hurts so bad but what can I do.Sorry my comment didnt help. ,limerence,d4zzyy2,1,t5_2smi6
