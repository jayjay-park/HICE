I moved to Stockholm last August.Since I had not found and have not found a job yet to apply for a personnummer I was told at Skatteverket to apply first for a residence permit under Sambo status. Then I could proceed to apply for a personnummer. I applied for the permit in September as of now I have not heard back from the Migrationsverket. If you do manage to get a job since youre into IT it may be easier for you and have a longterm contract then you can skip the Migrationsverket part and just apply for a personnummer at the Skatteverket.Good luck!,TillSverige,czff1yk,2,t5_2rwl7

Some universities have selection criteria other than gradesSAT scores but I cant imagine a previous degree being of any help basically because few could even afford a long programme such as Med after spending six semesters worth of student aid on something else.

7575047,0,t1_d30q5to,HiI am not sure whether my story applies to every company here but nevertheless here it is hope it helps youIt all started in December  Ive sent  CVs  motivational letters to the wellknown companies in Scandinavia. I am a Pole and was living in Poland then. Only  of them was interested in my skill set. The process with the company that finally hired me was th December theyve sent me requirements for a simple game to write No UI just System.in commands. Theyve told me that I should not spend on this more than  hours. The bonus questions not required to move forward into process but appreciated by the company were notthatsimple math tasks. Ive made all of it  JUnit tests and they were very content with my code. End of January Theyve apologized for a lack of communication but they had very busy ChristmasNew Year season and couldnt find the time to gather all the interviewers at once. Theyve proposed the date of the first interview I accepted it. February Long story short I had  interviews over the Skype webcam included with a  different guys  Swedish  from India probably  American. The interviews went terrible I was so stressed out that had a problem to decide whether the catch block is invoked before finally or the reverse. However they have seen the potential in me and invited me to the Stockholm to see the office and teammates no interview there. March I was in Stockholm and talked to many of employees in the office and Ive loved it. The office is nearly the same as seen in videos from Googles office. Table tennis table football pillows chillout rooms free fruits coffee tea well equiped kitchen etc. Had lunch with my manager the company paid for all the trip.After the visit they said that they like me as a person and think that I will fit into their culture and showed me the offer. I rejected it and in the end negotiated  swedish kruna more per month than the initial offer.  End of the April started working here love everything about the company. The perks are really good and I have an opportunity to talk to the people from around the world I have guys and girls from Greece Ukraine America UK Finland and Sweden in the team.Yes I am Java boy with a  years of professional experience. Made OCAJP and OCPJP last year and some JavaScript certificate too I hate JavaScript anyway. The company writes games on different OSs. You dont need to know anything about embedded systems stuff. I am  years old. I dont know a word in Swedish besides Tack and fika. I may have plans to learn it since company pays  for all the learning. I went on my own and as a average redditor I dont have that many friends. I talk on the Skype to the some of my friends from Poland on a weekly basis. I am bit of introvert so it is really hard for me to make a new friends here. But as the time will pass I guess... I will make some. However my neighbors and all the people Ive already met here are really helpful and openminded or even supportive. So if you arent the introvert type you will find some colleagues and girls for sure.Many people these days speak about thousands of Muslims immigrants in the Stockholm however I havent seen anyone in the city that looked odd or dangerous. I dont know what they are talking about. For sure the Stockholm is safer than any place in Poland at least. The company is still looking for a plenty of programmers so if you would like to try you can apply.Sorry for my crappy English.edit forgot to mention that the companies here takes worklife balance very seriously.  days off per year  half days paid per year to take Fridays are basically halfdays etc.,TillSverige,d338v28,1,t5_2rwl7
8082349,0,t1_d4odg9z,gt Just keep in mind how ignorant aggressive and sometimes even violent the US culture tends to be against foreigners especially if theyre brown.gt Even my dad slammed a door in a guys face at a restaurant because as he put it hes a pieceofshit Muslim. Not that his reason had any merit in the first place but... he was Indian. Clearly a Hindu Indian.The first day of Spring my girlfriend and I went to have nice picnic in the city park a larger university city only to be greeted by two dozen NeoNazis handing out pamphlets advocating for the forced DNA testing of anyone whose family came to Sweden before . If they werent pure enough they proposed deportation. Sweden has a history of racist violence against foreigners just like most countries. For example Lasermanen who went around sniping immigrants. And his spiritual successor Peter Mangs There have been over thirty fires of planned refugee housing in Sweden over the last year.  Currently  of Swedes support a party that  years ago was closely connected with the far right groups such as Keep Sweden Swedish. My girlfriend works with two of those supporters who also openly express support for Trump they constantly make racist and homophobic jokes. They even joked about pulling a Breivik after seeing some far right propaganda about immigrants desecrating a flag.I would agree that most people arent openly racist. A recent poll found that  of Swedes are worried about increasing racism. But violent racism definitely exists in Sweden. ,TillSverige,d4oj3y7,7,t5_2rwl7

8646248,0,t3_4vu1ww,Duolingo has free language course app great on having on smartphone so you can practice during free time. Ask your spouse to take time and speak with you since you are not from scandinavia you might be eligble for free language courses.Remember most of the swedes especially the young sub s and city folks talk english to some degree so you should be able to make yourself understood and be able to converse.Watch the tv show named Welcome to Sweden  you situation but for an american the awkwardness from the show is quite on point Anyway as IT guy you could do well in IT with english language alone I myself prefer talking in english over swedish as most of the ITterminology is in english anyway so as sysadm or other non customer oriented roles the language shouldnt be a barrier. Many of the hipper companies even prefer to have foreigners in their teams since it is cool haha half joke half truth many swedish companies also have businesses or customers overseas meaning that english is required anyway. Hook up also with local recruitment firms to meet you for interview and give them your CV most often need to fill out form on their homepage and they will job hunt assignments for you. In Stockholm I can recommend you to Wise IT. But yeah get your profile up and running on monster.se and you should start getting offers if nothing happens for couple of weeks update your resume and update it on monster again to land on top of the applicants pile there update your linkedin with moving to sweden see if any contacts have any contacts in sweden etc.There also lot of american companies with offices in sweden where english is corporate language so try with direct applications to HP Microsoft IBM etc.,TillSverige,d6me4u2,1,t5_2rwl7

9190318,0,t3_566r74,It will be assumed anyway if youre American and specifically pointing out that youre a native speaker would be unnecessary at best obnoxious at worst. I can imagine jobs as an English teacher or translator would be exceptions then you might want to emphasize being a native speaker but otherwise dont.Sweden is quite different from Spain in this regard. In Spain fluency in English is relatively rare and conversational fluency often comes with a larger amount of grammatical errors. In Sweden fluency in English is very common and essentially universal among younger people and people make few mistakes. Im not saying the average Swede could pass for a native English speaker but for most practical purposes Swedes arent significantly worse.,TillSverige,d8gxuvl,10,t5_2rwl7

I have a few friends whos partners took over a year or up to two years.

You guys need to take the British approach of get cutting and start building lol.But on a more serious note.Yeah I did miss that out on my comment but I think its a catch . In the sense he will find it hard to find a English only speaking job so will need to learn Swedish which I am finding personally to be quite hard. But on the other hand if he does find a job might not have a house to go to the job. I over looked housing due to being a student so it was quite easy just forked out a bit more money than most students and got a flat since it was in budget. But learning Swedish cant be fixed with money lol  Side note getting into Sweden before brexit doesnt save you from brexit since no one truely knows how the cards will fall there is still plenty of time for them to screw over expats although this is unlikely due to massive bad faith its possible. I mean Sweden has deported tech professionals  years down the line for paper work the business they work for didnt fill out correctly dodging tax and things. So you might find your self getting deported or having to file a bunch of paper work in  years time due to loosing eu citizen status.
