That is awfully confusing on Adobes part.  Any version of the DNG converter . and later should be able to convert your Tis CRs to DNGs that will be readable by cs via bridgeACR.  Apparently you have to convert whole folders worth of files at a time as per this thread I hope this helps.,FOSSPhotography,d1h0jdu,1,t5_2v3xi
