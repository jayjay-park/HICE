I have no masters and only a year of experience but I really knocked the interview out of the park and impressed them with a portfolio. I also really needed steady income at the time.The morning commute isnt that bad because I need to be at work by . I leave at  and get there right around . The afternoons absolutely blow though. I get off at  and might get home by .Still fun job cool startup etc. Im honestly really hoping to move when my lease is up. I was offered the job two days after I renewed sigh.,LAjobs,cvmf266,1,t5_2sj6i
