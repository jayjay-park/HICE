10563540,0,t1_dd5fp02,Thank you! In terms of format all the content will be saved in .RTF to make it compatible with other apps just in case you want to open something in Word for example and to facilitate a potential import feature in the future. I was thinking if you already have tons of files I could implement an import so you can transfer it over to Winkle easily to save time on copypasting.,winkle,dd5hw2q,2,t5_3i2mu
