983309,0,t1_chg1q51,Because the TV shows are generally a poor adaptation of the books. While Series one was pretty good series  and onwards has been awful. A large problem is that its hard to convert large books into a  episode series. Despite each book being longer than the previous there are still only  episodes in each season. This means that so much of the story is cut out or changed in order to fit the entire book into  episodes. This would be understandable if the show makers didnt insist on including shit which isnt in the books into the show. Why do we need an entire subplot revolving around a prostitute? Another problem with the show involves budget the show is really low budget for a fantasy series. The establishing shots are largely awful CGI and vary few battle scenes are shown. For example when Jaime Lannister is captured by Robb Stark the whole scene is essentially the viewer watching someone else watch the battle from behind a bush! Could you imagine if the whole battle of Minas Tirith was us looking at the battle from Denethors eyes? Another reason I dislike the show is its overuse of nude imagery nude and sex scenes are shoehorned into the show for no particular reason. If I wanted to see graphic sex scenes I could watch porn.Lastly and this is a major reason why I dislike the show is that people dont like GoT because they like  it they like it because others like it. ,iamverysmart,chg26hp,-8,t5_2yuej

1143977,0,t1_chyajvd,Dont patronize me asshole. Nobody is arguing that the bystander effect is a concrete rule and that no one can break it. I have no idea where you got that idea from.What is being said is that its a common phenomenon and explains why people might not immediately jump to help your anecdotal evidence notwithstanding. Instead for some reason you assumed everyone else was holding the situation to strict scientific standards instead of connecting the dots like an average person would do and thinking Ah he must be talking about how people will often wait for others to act as opposed to acting themselves regardless of circumstance and saying Yeah thats a well recorded phenomena you decided to say No this applies to strictly apartment observers because the guy used the term Call the police and you turned into a pedantic asshole over that. Yes we all know what happens when you punch a guy in the gut they are bound to react in certain ways although youd be wrong about always being physical retaliation what youre getting at is still clearNo one is arguing against that only you went on about what the real reason for this was and started extrapolating conclusions out of nothing. You can say Human intuition all you like it might fly for some things but you cant just turn around on someone else and say No you are wrong in the next sentence. Youre trying to punch mist and wondering why no one takes you seriously. Ill repeat the only person who was overly rigorous over explaining the phenomenon was you. This is demonstrable and why no one has any fuckin clue what your problem is. And then you dump all this insecure bullshit onto everyone else as if their virginity has any impact on what they say... You could show a highlight reel of all your blunders on that projection. And then speaking of pseudointellectualism you actually proceed to link your own post and say how great a description it is on pseudointellectualism... I mean what the fuck.

1627428,0,t1_cjjifx6,What he wrote was definitely poorly written. As for whether it makes sense itd be best to see the actual titlesarticlecomments hes replying to rather than a paraphrase from ualexmatador. As a quick example lets say we want to predict how much money someone makes solely based on the performance they had on an IQ test. The IQ and the salary are variables usually just numbers we have measured or want to know in the future Here we measured the IQ and want to know future salary. Explanatory power of a variable is a term often used in prediction. In rough terms explanatory power is the ability for those numbers to be used in an equation to give a good approximation to another variable. The variable then explains some of the variation we see in peoples future salary. There is no clear definition but you can probably justify the terminology to someone in the field if your method beats random guessing or very very usual guessing. Random guessing is just like it sounds  well just choose a realistic salary at random irrespective of the measured IQ. Very typical guesses might be something like always guessing the average salary of everyone.If we use that interpretation hes basically saying that constructing a simple approximation with a simple equation based on a single variable Im sure the thing hes replying to defines what the variable is is insulting because the thing were trying to predict is so wildly complex social difficulty apparently. Itd be like trying to predict the stock market based on a few financial facts about companies Oh wait we already do that with mutual funds! By the way it has historically never worked..,iamverysmart,cjkaw5p,3,t5_2yuej

2165731,0,t3_2jt2v6,Can I just veer off topic and say how interesting it is to see what the Like button is called in different languages. I noticed the German version in your pic and googled to find this map What really interests me is how few languages seem to just have a simple cleancut verb like Like. Expressing fondness of something would seem like a pretty fundamental thing to be able to do with language so why is the way to do it so roundabout for some languages? Maybe this just bothers me because in my native language the Facebook Like button is called Synes godt om which means something like think well of. That actually isnt the ordinary form which is even worse Kan lide. Literally Can suffer as in I can suffer that. Look at us glum Scandinavians who can just barely tolerate these things that other cultures come right out and say they like. Why not just have a god damn onesyllable word so you can say I verb this?Im guessing the reflexive versions in German and Spanish get kinda awkward at times too though Im not one to talk. Gefllt mir and Me gusta... something like Pleases me? And the Spanish one is derived from taste? so taken literally maybe its like Tastes good to me? Nah I think English wins on this one.

Other exams Miller Analogies GMAT GRE and ACT are all generally considered a bit better at that.IQ is also not a terribly great predictor of grades. Work ethic is once an adequate level of talent is there. The SAT is a good exam at predicting college GPA. That is its job.

What is one persons major and probable passion is another persons boring lecture. But to you it is amazing and undefinable. You want others to be amazed with you and the only way you can do it is talking about it. I tried talking about history and philosophy to a lot of my friends in the past and most of the times they just didnt understand or cared. There is a reason my major is history and theirs is something else because it isnt important to them as much as to me. There has also been times where I facepalmed when explaining something so obvious to me to later realize I was just being an elitist idiot trying to flex my swole history dick. Ive stopped doing it as much and just use fun facts to interest people instead of bash them on how they got their info from the History channel or dont read as much as I do.

2670193,0,t1_cn6sop6,gt Pantheism is a reverence for the universe and I certainly share it.Err... Yes and no. You can maybe call Reverence for the universe pantheism but in reality it usually comes with or refers to some form of meaningful metaphysical description of something actually tangible. Some of said things may be not that different form not having them  things the average person has anyways but you know.For instance Hegels pantheism was the idea that what people called God was an actual metaphysical force in the universe which related to the evolution of ideas. And people could sense the process but mistakenly project sentience onto it since it relates to ideas which people consider in terms of mental content. And that this process points ultimately to a specific thing which is analogous to heaven and which peoples ideas on heaven also relate to vaguely being able to sense but misunderstanding.Theres a lot of forms of pantheism and a lot of things qualify. But usually it means that someone thinks that the qualities which define God or a god are such that they actually refer to some existent thing Usually which is active in the universe in some sense and relates to it or is equivalent to it. In some forms the universe itself is even seen as sentient such as original stoicism.The forms which dont really seek to present themselves as in any way different from atheism are usually referred to as naturalistic pantheism.,iamverysmart,cn748u0,4,t5_2yuej

I have to confess right away that I do not entirely fit your qualifications to be allowed to message you I dont know my exact IQ but Im sure it doesnt come close to approaching yours. I hope you will forgive my impudence.I felt I had to message you because truthfully I felt inspired by you. It was so clear from reading that your bio that youre a man of intelligence creativity and  above all  POWER. I know my own limitations both as a woman and a submissive and I often feel myself drawn to those who can guide me and help me grow. I know that you said youre not accepting any new submissives right now and of course I would never dare to ask but I feel that I could learn so much from you just by meeting and talking with you.A bit about me Im  blonde with hazel eyes slim with an hourglass figure. I love to cook especially when its for someone who can appreciate it and I enjoy science fiction although I sometimes get a little lost and my brother has to explain some of the finer points to me. My kinks I hope you dont mind me sharing these with you are to be dominated to be treated as an object or a worthless slave or to be taken roughly while dressed like a dog cat or other furry animal. Im getting hot just writing this actually! blushesYou can see pictures of me on my profile.

If youre using secondary dominant chords which i think you may be referring to youll use some mixolydian scale variants there with tensions and whatnot sometimes like mixolydian b etc. But generally youre only going to be playing mixolydian anything over chords with dominant function of some kind.,iamverysmart,cobsrxt,1,t5_2yuej

Really philosophers and scientists were one in the same They used logic and experimentation to attempt to understand the world around them. Aristotle used logic to figure out the world was round long before anyone proved it. He was also an inventor and had a device which was basically a big wheel with cups on it. He would boil water underneath and the steam would catch in the cups and move the wheel... Sound familiar? A few short steps further and hed have invented the steam engine  years early.Socrates was known for questioning everything. Is that not what a scientist does?

The English language has changed since the th century. Society has changed. You dont churn butter and ride a horse to work and youre not ruled by an English king so of course youre not gonna get it. Youre also not gonna get much of Dickens or Austen.gt uneducated workingclassThe uneducated working classes worked for  hours a day and could barely afford food. They didnt go to plays because they didnt have the money or the time. Shakespeare wrote for the middle and upper classes who were mostly literate. gt artsySex jokes and melodramatic plotlines are artsy I guess?gt when guys like that would have been employed by a single noble or not employed at all.Im not so sure about that. For one Shakespeare served the Chamberlain Players who were owned by Lord Chamberlain of course.

Ill talk about his numbers comparison.People make this argument all of the time as if everyone is supposed to have equal value to you and to think otherwise is mean. Its not that is human nature. The more we know about someone the more we care. And when only one dies its simple for everyone to learn more about them when on the other end you have ten thousand die and cant learn all their nameslives. Ten thousand is a statistic to us. No one faults a person for being more sad when a family member dies that a group of people in a wartorn area that have never been to or even met a person from. Just because someone focuses on the one doesnt mean they dont care about the many its just an easier way to expunge grief through association. Along with these there is a cultural aspect. Its cultural and regular practice for some people to eat dogs its no different than is eating other animals that some likehave as pets. We can accept all of this.

4037355,0,t1_crgebws,gt You are having faith that what they theorize is truth dont get me wrong.The faith Im referring to is faith in the validity of empirical evidence and inferred observations using the scientific method. This is an assumption I make that we can know things to a certain degree through naturalistic observation.gt That is the definition of faith complete trust or confidence in someone or something.If thats the definition of faith you are using then I dont agree that I have faith in this instance. I dont have complete trust or confidence in scientists. I have near complete confidence and trust in the scientific method and the selfregulating nature of science in general because of the peer review dynamic. When I say faith Im using it as a nod since it seems you wanted to imply both of us had faith I was being charitable. To me faith is believing something even though there might be evidence to the contrary. I dont do that with this either. Maybe I shouldnt have used the word at all but I was trying to be charitable using your terms in how I understood you to use them. What I meant was we all have underlying assumptions we have to take on and we work from there for our understanding of the world. The difference is my underlying assumptions have a demonstrable predictive quality and yours are presumed despite the lack of predictive quality.gtI have a historical record of someone being with God you have an historical record of someone generating a theoryThis is the only thing I have an issue you are again using a term so you can equate these two things as equal. A mythological book saying that someone met God is not the same as developing a theory that is a working model based upon inferences gathered from observational data. If you think this is the same why dont you believe in the myth of Gilgamesh? What about Joseph Smith meeting angels and receiving diving inspiration? Because you have been convinced to believe one thing and not convinced to believe the other. Then we have to pursue what is sufficient to convince you. Surely if what someone claimed to have happened  or so years ago is convincing to you as evidence that a God exists then raw data that converges on the same conclusion will easily pass the test. gt Without having tested experienced or otherwise been made sure of other than being told by someone else of it we have faith in those things.Sort of. These two things you are comparing are not the same though. Can you give me a test for gods existence that satisfies the scientific method? Im sure an astrophysicist can teach you how to interpret cosmic background radiation. Thats the difference. One almost anyone can be convinced of if they approach it with a truly open mind and a willingness to learn. With the existence of God how do you test for it? What observations are we using that can be independently verified?gtTo say that either position has complete authority without the presence of the initiating authority is preposterous.Im confused by this last bit. Astrophysicists are actual authorities on astrophysics. The consensus among astrophysicists is that the Big Bang is an actual event that happened and its based upon observations from cosmic background radiation.,iamverysmart,crghm93,1,t5_2yuej

4279578,0,t1_cs7zy5c,To be honest I dont really care about arguing who literally wrote which words and who didnt. The meaning of the amendment seems pretty obvious given the historical context regardless of what Madison thought. Even if he wrote the amendment with the intention of promoting standing armies which I doubt I dont think most of the people who signed it agreed with that. The second and third amendments are clearly meant to prevent the creation of standing armies. The third is meant to prevent the army from becoming an occupying force in our own country and the second is meant to keep a balance of power between individual citizens and the government.Liberals are trying to follow the letter of the second amendment rather than the spirit of it. I think the founders would be very frustrated to see that were still arguing about this even though they included an amendment just to make their beliefs on this issue very clear. If they wanted to express their support for big abusive central government with gigantic standing armies there would be no need for an amendment to support that because thats how every other country in the world worked in .,iamverysmart,cs81032,-1,t5_2yuej

What you list arent defining characteristics of computers just characteristics of one type of computer that we happen to use today.But its feasible that in the future wed be able to develop computers that are based on massive distributed networks of processors that were faulttolerant.

He owned  bibles and would constantly read them to try and find secrets within them even calculating when the world would end. In fact his taboo beliefs actually nearly costed him his Lucasian chair at Cambridge.I also dont think Galileo was atheist either though dont quote me on that I dont know too much about him personally. If atheists want a mascot for their movement they should choose Paul Dirac  the father of quantum electrodynamics. He made similar arguments against religion you hear today such If we are honestand scientists have to bewe must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination.

5159309,0,t1_cv7vobq,Its very possible he was trying to intentionally spook people and play it off as unintentional yes.  He had this device plugged in in his English class unless the thing beeps on on the batteries for some reason.Most of those clocks with V batteries just silently keep the time if the power goes out  they dont stay lit.  The V exists to keep you from having to reset the clock.  However it may be a clock that operates on either V or a cord.Regardless he certainly seems to have no problem passing himself off as someone who actually built something  although I would expect its a bit intimidating to have the President and others all paying attention to you.If he didnt actually modify the clock in any real way then I believe he intentionally designed it to emulate the style of a movie suitcase bomb and wasnt simply using this case for his electronics project.  Hes a kid and think arresting him for it is overkill but neither do I fault teachers for taking a serious stance on potentially disruptive student in this fashion.Like I said it all depends on whether he actually put work into the clock. he did actually assemble some components for the clock in which case his motive may well have been innocent.. he did not actually assemble some components but just screwed a working clock into a box.  In which case hes probably being an honry kid who may have just thought his clock looked cool or he may have meant to be disruptive with it.  Maybe you didnt go to school with disruptive kids  I certainly knew some and was friends with some  some of them loved deliberately disrupting stuff all the time.  Regardless if I were  and decided to screw a clock into a case like that I would have thought it looked like a movie bomb and not brought it to school.  I would probably think its cool that it looked like a movie bomb but I would understand that bringing such a thing on campus would be likely to get me into trouble.Either way I would have known at  that screwing clock parts into a box isnt really doing anything creative.  I used to put together computers for a volunteer organization when I was .  We scrapped donated computers and put them together to send to schools.  Some adults at the time thought I was smart because I knew how to properly plug a video card into a PCI slot and how to hook a harddrive to a motherboard or install an old processor.  I knew I wasnt that smart  the adults were just afraid to touch the circuit boards and I wasnt  that was the only difference.  There were some other things on computers I did feel pretty smart about but putting them together wasnt really one of them.,iamverysmart,cv7w03c,-24,t5_2yuej

5239993,0,t1_cvh0jgg,Well I mean sure you can be a genius whenever.  But the reality is that most bonafide actual scientific geniuses come up with their ideas relatively early in life and spend the rest of their life perfecting them and writing about them.I personally think its because for a true bonafide breakthrough you have to think in a totally different direction than everybody else.  You have to question something that the field takes for granted.  If you get too old you become much more ingrained in the fields existing thought process.  You start glossing over details and taking things for granted instead of questioning why they are like that.Its like when you see a kid who keeps asking why when they see something like a handicap ramp into a treadmillonly gym.  It just becomes accepted by adults to see ramps everywhere you dont question why it exists.  Analyzing that type of stuff just isnt worth the time its been done already and you learned about the ADA.And when you take somebody that has retained that ability to truly question things everybody takes for granted that everybody else thinks has been proven over and over again.  And give them just enough experience and knowledge to do research into it and dig into it more they can make truly groundbreaking discoveries that can create whole new fields of science.The person who is still making meaningful discoveries well into retirement is still valuable but the chances are they are not going to make a groundbreaking new thought that changes how everybody looks at their scientific field  weeks from their retirement.

But if you gain weight mainly in your gut so that you have an apron or a pregnant belly it can be difficult to maneuver around it.

5652412,0,t1_cwjj8v8,First of all incredibly sorry for taking soon to respond I have wanted to but Im gonna be honest you have made some really good points and if the hundredth monkey effect has been debunked then great! Thats the beauty of science it isnt dogmatic and is subject to change. But as far as meaning goes meaning is as you say something that needs to be searched for and found after a journey and not just after or during  a drug trip. And thats  true but that certainly doesnt mean we should completely discount those experiencesThat is what all of religion is based on  humans have an innate need to have meaning in their lives and these substances along with habits such as healthy eating and exercise and meditation can help you find that meaning  but if you are looking for meaning and responsibly partake in these substances they can GREATLY increase motivation and help you stay on the right track Obviously they have the potential to be abused used incorrectly or even harm the psychy of a user if they are not properly prepared for the experience or take them in a a busy place that would confuse them and bring about anxiety But they have all that and more potential to help. They can make you feel like your on the right track and that your winning the battle if you just feel man  but they also can say hey  look yoy have some bad habits but you can fix them  its completely within you to change your life for the better and as a whole people who have had these experiences not all and some even had the opposite effect  but of course that will happen especially because theres a chance even trying this could get you in a lot of trouble right now have a different world view than those who havent. they have temporarily removed their blinders and seen looking at things like society from an outside point of view and noticing the wonderful obserdities of it.Look I agree that finding meaning from nothing  is a slippery slope but these experiences are not nothing they are very real and very power even with the potential to help recovery from drug addictionSource So all Im really trying to say is that there is a lot we dont know and Im sure a lot that can be learned from the study of these substances and they study of the geometric nature of the universe both together and separately. again sorry about the late response I admit I have been putting it off but I knew I had to and better late than never right? Haha and thank you for questioning that is how we learn after all ,iamverysmart,cwxqjfs,1,t5_2yuej

Im nearly to anarchocommunist though so I should probably find a new way to stimulate my daily thoughts.What Im doing with my lifeIm a phd student in a social science. Basically Im either thinking about how Im going to justify my existence through my future contribution to social theory or Im desperately trying to communicate to the undergraduates in the classes I TA for that everything they hold dear is probably bs without actually going rogue enough to end up in the deans office or some bull.Sometimes I read articles about old baseball stadiums on wikipedia when I have a few free minutes.Im really good atAlienating myself from people internally within my brain Im pretty agreeable in casual conversation and I can usually empathize with all but the most crazy right wingers. Im also okay with people who clearly are critical of aspects of their day to day existence having sociological theory discussions that my mother would find bewildering and goofing on anything that resembles something sentimental earnest people and I get along just fine though.Favorite books movies shows music and foodI do like these things but I feel as though my liking some pop cultural ephemera shouldnt really mean anything other than I happened to run across some shit that was good at some point.I also laugh at myself for legitimately having this actual incredibly pretentious opinion but hey whos to say that being a insufferably pretentious person isnt what Jesus is going to want when hes sorting us all out.I dont believe Jesus is coming backThe six things I could never do without.Shit that smart people wrote academic articles blah blah blah.Shit that smart people turned into a youtube video or some bull that doesnt require me to concentrate as much.The fantasy of having an eager sincere dog that I can logistically afford both in time and money terms to have in the next ten years.My clickity clackity mechanical keyboard probably responsible for  percent of my kinesthetic joy on a daily basis.High culture approved beer.High culture tolerated coffeeI spend a lot of time thinking aboutTrying to figure out what I actually do believe in other than the fact that its probably good to be a shithead of course.On a typical Friday night I amAvoiding anything relating to my graduate study as well as avoiding da club.Last Friday night I watched a British baking show on Netflix while drinking high culture approved beer. Sometimes I go to a bar and speak to people who are my friends. Anything that doesnt involve loud shit andor concentration is likely to make me at least think its okay on Friday night.You should message me ifYoure ready to begin a conversation in which I will make sardonic comments until I feel that youre on my level or something like that.Additionally although Ive been painfully trying to not actually say normal things in this bio for the love of christ please at least try to say something beyond hey or whats up? I wont judge you ethically but you have to give me something mildly charming or inventive to activate the sincere systems of my brain.,iamverysmart,cxqtlkx,1,t5_2yuej

5965251,0,t3_3x1wjj,. Ever since I joined reddit I was shocked at the indecorous and doltish comments on meaningless pedantic posts. Since joining this sub I have been ecstatic each day to check riamverysmart and revel in the intelligence of my fellow genii. However I see too many commentsobviously made by shallow idiots making a jest out of scholarly gentlemen. As a moderator I would enforce the rule all must take an I.Q. testthat stands for Incredibly Quintessential because you probably didnt know and get at the very least an A score only humans with the greatest of minds can barely achievefrom personal expeirience  before commenting to ensure a proper aura of enlightenment and intelligent for my fellow MENTA associates. . I would bring skills such as being online for most of the day my timezone is EST and thus being able to check reported content and remove if necessary. I would also be available to answer any questions that users of the sub had for the mods through modmailabout bans rules etc. Also I consider myself to be a pretty friendly guynot satire this time and I could hopefully resolve debates and arguments that could possibly break out and remove offensive comments as need be.

6454045,0,t1_czmj2ap,For the unenlightened . Once you have their money never give it back. You cant cheat an honest customer but it never hurts to try. Never spend more for an acquisition than you have to. Sex and profit are the two things that never last long enough. If you cant break a contract bend it. Never let family stand in the way of opportunity. Always keep you ears open. Keep count of your change. Instinct plus opportunity equals profit. A dead customer cant buy as much as a live one. Latinum isnt the only thing that shines. Anything worth selling is worth selling twice. Anything worth doing is worth doing for money. Anything stolen is pure profit. Acting stupid is often smart. A deal is a deal ... until a better one comes along. A bargain usually isnt. A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all. Dont lie too soon after a promotion. When the customer is sweating turn up the heat. Never place friend ship before profit. Wise men can hear profit in the wind. Never take the last coin but be sure to get the rest. Never ask when you can take. Fear makes a good business partner. The vast majority of the rich in this galaxy did not inherit their wealth they stole it. The most beautiful thing about a tree is what you do with it after you cut it down. Morality is always defined by those in power. When someone says Its not the money theyre lying. Talk is cheap synthehol costs money. Never make fun of a Ferengis mother. Be careful what you sell. It may do exactly what the customer expects. It never hurts to suck up to the boss. War is good for business. Peace is good for business. Too many Ferengi cant laugh at themselves anymore. You can always buy back a lost reputation. Free advertising is cheap. Praise is cheap. Heap it generously on all customers. If you see profit on a journey take it. Money talks but having a lots of it gets more attention. Only negotiate when you are certain to profit. Caressing an ear is often more forceful than pointing a weapon. Never argue with a loaded phaser. Profit has limits. Loss has none. Labor camps are full of people who trusted the wrong person. Never trust a man wearing a better suit than you own. The bigger the smile the sharper the knife. Old age and greed will always overcome youth and talent. Never bluff a Klingon. Never admit a mistake if theres someone else to blame. Only Bugsy could have built Las Vegas. Sell first ask questions later. Never buy anything you cant sell. Always sell at the highest possible profit. Pursue profit women come later. Good customers are almost as rare as Latinum  treasure them. Friendship is seldom cheap. Fee advice is never cheap. Never use Latinum where your words will do. Never buy what can be stolen. The riskier the road the greater the profit. Power without profit is like a ship without an engine. Dont talk shop talk shopping. Dont talk ship talk shipping. Anyone serving in a fleet who is crazy can be relieved if they ask for it. Enough is never enough. Compassion is no substitute for a profit. You could afford your ship without your government  if it werent for your government. Get the money first then let the buyers worry about collecting the merchandise. Gamble and trade have two things in common risk and Latinum. Never let the competition know what youre thinking. Never trust advice from a dying Ferengi listen but dont trust. A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all. Home is where the heart is but the stars are made of Latinum. Every once in a while declare peace. It confuses the hell out of your enemies. Go where no Ferengi has gone before where there is no reputation there is profit. Dont discriminate. The most unlikely species can create the best customers. Benefit from the Vulcan greed for knowledge. If it works sell it. If it works well sell it for more. If it doesnt work quadruple the price and sell it as an antique. Theres nothing more dangerous than an honest businessman. A smart customer is not a good customer. Revenge is profitless. She can touch your ears but never your Latinum. Death takes no bribes. A wife is a luxury a smart accountant a necessity. Trust is the biggest liability of all. When the boss comes to dinner it never hurts to have the wife wear something. Latinum lasts longer than lust. Mine is better than ours. He who drinks fast pays slow. Never confuse wisdom with luck. Hes a fool who makes his doctor his heir. Beware of small expenses a small leak will kill a ship. Important more impotant Latinum. Faith moves mountains  of inventory. If you would keep a secret from an enemy dont tell it to a friend. Profit is the better part of valor. Never trust a wise man. Everything that has no owner needs one. Never do something you can make someone do for you. Nature decays but Latinum lasts forever. Sleep can interfere with opportunity. Money is never made. It is merely won or lost. Wise men dont lie they just bend the truth. There is no honor in poverty. Win or lose theres always Huyperian Beetle Snuff. A woman wearing clothes is like a man without profit. Dignity and an empty sack is worth the sack. Only a fool passes up a business opportunity. Treat people in your debt like family ... exploit them. Never sleep with the bosss wife unless you pay him first. Never sleep with the bosss sister. Small print lead to large risk. Greed is eternal. Theres always a way out. If the profit seems too good to be true it usually is. Never cheat a honest man offering a decent price. Buy sell or get out of the way. Even a blind man can recognize the glow of Latinum. Everything is for sale even friendship. As the customers go so goes the wise profiteer. A friend is only a friend until you sell him something. Then he is a customer. Friendship is temporary profit is forever,iamverysmart,czmw264,19,t5_2yuej

Besides trolls its perhaps the most annoying part about managing servers.Lag spikes generally are caused by packet loss and most games make this information readily available to all the players.I mean if someone is taking a game so seriously that they make a point to complain about lag youd think theyd take the effort to buy an ethernet cable. m for  to eliminate packet loss is so worth it but no they never acknowledge that the problem is with their connection  its always the server at fault.Also stop your damned torrents before playing a game where you need good latency.,iamverysmart,d3p0ig8,7,t5_2yuej

But you probably swing your arms and legs farther and faster when you run than when you walk which essentially makes youyour limbs move a farther distance and run into extra raindrops.Idk its tricky but Im inclined to trust Mythbusters on this one when they say running makes you wetter.

To perfectly balance the rotors we have to attach thousands of dollars of high speed cameras that are connected to a sophisticated computer that will calculate how much weight has to be added to each blade we then have to bolt on small washers to adjust the weight.One of our test flight pilots was an absolute expert. He could sit in the helicopter feel the vibration look at the rotors while they were spinning and based solely off his experience accurately determine to within a couple of ounces how many washers had to be added to which blade.This man made an expensive computer system obsolete but it took him over  years of practice doing nothing but flying Blackhawks to get that good.,iamverysmart,d5olib1,6,t5_2yuej

So essentially this is a succinct summary of how particles interact in the Standard Model.

I was brought into this world by a software engineer and and a prominent actuary both of Norwegian descent. From the moment that the fucking curtains were raised I was set to dominate the STEM fields. And because I had guardians that actually cared about me I flourished. Pretty soon I was placed into a special school of correspondence specifically I.M Gelfands school for gifted children in New England. I not only reached my parents expectations but I passed them with flying colors. I had raw talent. I was fucking better. I was surrounded by th graders many from Hong Kong whom were smarter than half the posters in this fucking thread. And now where am I?In MIT getting my double BS in Electrical Engineering and Physics with a StanfordBinet tested IQ of  at age . Get this through your head you are nothing. I am worth more than your entire goddamn family. Im smarter than you better looking than you taller than you wealthier than you and more employable than you.

And clearly if you score lets say  thats an indication you could be very good in learning things.  But IQ doesnt tell you a damn thing about what somebody will achieve. Its all just potential and if unguided it can lead to more harm than good.     I see a lot of kids for example that dont really know how to consciously learn. Until a certain age they just intuitively understood everything that was thrown at them but at the moment they have to consciously learn things it becomes apparent they never acquired an effective learning strategy.    Thats just one example. Lots of things can go wrong. Sorry if my wording is a bit off Im not a native English speaker.,iamverysmart,d7jtcwm,4,t5_2yuej

Thats huge in my book.I also have reason to hypothesize that the universe is composed entirely of one fractal waveform. Its fun to think about.In the end for me I dont even prefer to label it as some philosophy but as my own truth. Because its not just entertainment and semantics but a way of truly understanding the universe  sans contrived semantics.

9234844,0,t1_d8mg82f,Thats very true. I like the example of the three great Greek playwrites Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides. From each of the three we have the seven plays deemed best. They were preserved because they were good. But by chance we also have eleven additional plays from Euripides that start with the letters epsilon and iota like his plays were kept alphabetized on scrolls in vases. One vase somehow got preserved and the plays inside survived. Those eleven extra plays arent that good. And now Euripides is judged to be the worst of the three. But its likely that the other two had some not so great works that were lost that would have colored our opinion of them.,iamverysmart,d8ml1fb,5,t5_2yuej

9802206,0,t1_dal994t,I have spent a lot of time exploring different social networks and Twitter in my experience is by far the most close minded smug self righteous and self seeking place on the internet.  There are good people and bad people everywhere but Twitter seems to have more of the self conscious and insecure people that will say anything simply to have people fav and retweet them.  But the people are faving and retweeting things that fit their personal brand and promote their own popularity.Facebook is inane and silly but its harder to get away with crap on Facebook because you typically actually know the people in real life and they know you.  And they often wont put up with your crap or just dont care.  Add to this the fact that Facebook doesnt limit messages to  characters and you can actually have longer more well thought out arguments compared to Twitter where every point is lost in the need for a punchy sarcastic quotable statement.,iamverysmart,dalbzwi,12,t5_2yuej

9814975,0,t1_dam81yg,Oh I just learned about cynicism today! The word itself is derived from the greek word that means doglike. They believed that all of society was a mistake and man would find true virtue by acting on whatever thoughts they wanted and returning to a natural state. Diogenes himself used to pee on people lay around naked and run around shining light in peoples eyes saying he was looking for an honest man. When Alexander the Great came to speak with him Diogenes told him to move over because he was standing in his light. When Crates of Thebes tried to teach Zeno the way of cynicism he forced him to carry around a bowl of lentil soup wherever he went. Zeno was ashamed by awkwardly holding the bowl of soup and tried to hide it under his shirt. Crates kicked the bowl and lentil spilled all down Zenos pants. He ran away in shame while Crate yelled after him that he had nothing be ashamed of and to let his humiliation go. Zeno later went on to found the stoicism school of thought which was a lot like cynicism but thought physics and math were really important.,iamverysmart,damwqe4,4,t5_2yuej

Everyone thinks theyre a good person. Thats why Jesus had to come in the first place. He lived a sinless life but received the punishment as if he hadnt. Now we can receive the reward adoption as children of God that He deserved as if we had lived sinless lives. But weve done nothing to earn that. Its a gift. Ephesians gtGod created everything that exist what is visible and invisible so I think is clear we come from God.While it is true that we are created by God and thus are His children in that sense we are not His children in spirit. Nobody is righteous and thus we are entirely separated from God except through Christ.,iamverysmart,dapg8j4,2,t5_2yuej

I think if I didnt masturbate for a whole week I would barely get anything done.I think the myth that nofap makes sex better stems from the absolutely correct fact that some masturbation practices mostly deathgrip or humping things or watching hardcore porn all the time do make your sex life a lot worse by getting you fixated on stimulation you dont normally get from sex.

Cantonese is the prestige dialect and is by far the most widely spoken but there are other Yue dialects like Taishanese which most Cantonese speakers can only partially understand IIRC. Actually as I understand it there was a time when most overseas speakers spoke Taishanese. I think a lot of folks emigrating now are Cantonese speakers but dont quote me on that.gt Yue dialects arent mutually intelligible with other varieties of Chinese which Im sure you know Mandarin speakers cant converse with Cantonese speakers so on and so forth. I cant think of a reason youd call it Yue unless you were discussing linguistics specifically.gt For folks playing along at home a prestige dialect is a language thats elevated in a society so to speak often as a class marker. uquinoarex,iamverysmart,ddze7u6,58,t5_2yuej

I dont have a study right now its just knowledge I have from lectures.First an important disclaimer  whenever someone talks about mass in a universescale context they generally mean massenergy  that is energy including mass energy of matter. This includes me in the earlier comment.IIRC its due to the fact that a prerequisite for energy conservation is time invariance see Noethers Theorem. If the universe changes over time there isnt really a reason for energy conservation and our universe is expanding and I think speeding up. And it turns out that the total massenergy is actually increasing.,iamverysmart,dedtfef,10,t5_2yuej

The thing is yes  Its the same as if I said you were traveling  kph for  minutes and then  kph for  minutes. You would still calculate the average speed right? Im assuming they want you to calculate the speed when they were not resting. Buuut  read this small excerpt from Physics for Dummies I which is probably too stupid for you to read but its kinda my bible for sophomore year high school physics.During a trip from New York to L.A. you may stop at a hotel several nights andwhile you sleep your instantaneous speed is  miles per hour yet even at thatmoment your average speed is still . miles per hour see the previous sectionfor this calculation! Thats because you measure average speed by dividingthe whole distance  miles by the time the trip takes  days.Is the book wrong or just dumbed down or is my interpretation wrong or basically whats up?Edit I cant stress it enough.

11051269,0,t1_dekmn7n,First of all I dont really know what hes trying to accomplish when hes thinking about water in a bath tub. A still body of water has very few intricacies and complexities. If he was referring to the spout and how the water behaves coming out of it and going to the bath tub then yeah NS is useful. Or if the water was draining. Or possibly if he was sitting in it and playing causing the water to splash around but even then what is he trying to use NS to solve for?Im not sure how much you know about fluid mechanics and Im not an expert in the subject by any means but the NavierStokes equations are very complicated equations that work best to describe properties of nonuniform flow or flows with velocities in multiple directions. If theres no flow theres no velocity and without consulting my fluids textbook to confirm this going off of memory all of the terms cancel out except the change in pressure with respect to position and the gravity term. So you basically get dPdzgz. If youre in a bathtub your change in height is about  meter if that. Basically negligible. ,iamverysmart,dekn4qb,3,t5_2yuej

Send me something from Reuters or BBC next time.Anyway I looked over the article. His argument is hilarious. The data he lays out and point he constructs in the first section of the article saying blue states have higher taxes and also spend more is totally removed from his conclusion that the peasants who leech welfare in red states arent Republicans who make red states red. LOL.Hes also talking about welfare only as opposed to the state budget. As in for every dollar state x gets from Washington they give y amount back. And the only states that take more money from Washington than they give are Red states. The top  that pay proportionally the most are all blue.I wasnt talking about welfare. But the article actually shows us that Red states are the biggest users of welfare too! So thanks for the extra talking point. His argument that this is misleading because blue states have higher taxes and spend more on aid isnt really a positive argument for Republicans. Because it just shows that their system isnt sustainable and is dependant on the feds. Meanwhile blue states are self sufficient and actually subsidise these redneck states.Also how am I a phoney?

Ive often pointed out that even if that was true there needs to be some standardised why of evaluating arguments which cannot really be the rshowerthoughts method if it is one and so if what theyve tried to argue for cannot be evaluated by these means then even if it is some Wittgensteinen level wizardry its still not going to be up to scratch.  ,iamverysmart,dfr6kdq,17,t5_2yuej

You sure as shit dont get to decide what reality is.She obviously disagrees with your interpretation of her own thoughts she admits she had been privileged to ignore sexism for a long time realized it was happening even if not necessarily to her and has made it a mission to try and address it.
