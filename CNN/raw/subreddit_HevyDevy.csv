10794278,0,t3_5t1vz9,I met him after the DTChildren of Bodom show in Pittsburgh. He seemed to been genuinely enjoying himself but people like me make it hard. I was trying too hard to be cool and show off my fandom by asking him When is Kryptic Korner going to do a reunion show? He seemed...confused? I dont know but I thanked him for being such a great musical artist took a photo and got some autographs.It really only reminded me why I dont like meeting my teenage heroes. Theyre just people. It takes all the mystique out of the artist.,HevyDevy,ddtcq1k,1,t5_2soum
