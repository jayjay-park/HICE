8603498,0,t3_4xlhtx,It still holds up.I gotta admit back in HS when this first came out I didnt necessarily admit that I was into RBF.  During the third wave revival of the late s it wasnt cool to say you liked RBF because they were too mainstream.  Id list bands like Mephiskapheles Dr Ring Ding Hepcat Ednas Goldfish etc. when naming bands I liked.  But nowadays its RBF that continues to stay in my album rotation. ,Ska,d6h153k,3,t5_2qhe1
