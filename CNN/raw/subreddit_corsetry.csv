1381538,0,t3_29szg2,Are you looking for a steel boned corset that gives you curves or more of a corset like top? If just a top eBay is the cheapest. For a real corset? The cheapest off the racks are Orchard Corset Restyle and Mystic City. But you dont say your hip measurement which is very important for corsets. ,corsetry,cipgke0,2,t5_2saig
1669064,0,t3_2dhi83,Ribbon corsets were historically built for a lighter reduction or a more comfortable feel. But they do still have bones! Generally concentrated in the front back and at the sides rather than evenly spaced around the whole thing. They tend to be rather short like a cincher mostly just around the waist so I dont know how much that would change the level of support youre looking for  if youre used to a longline for instance it might feel less supportive. Could also depend on which corset you get if its a less curvy model it might feel less supportive. I think the fit can vary by maker and also of course whether you want an OTR or a custom.,corsetry,cjpjpit,2,t5_2saig
