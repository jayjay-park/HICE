8412763,0,t1_d5sbe8m,No worries. Thanks for the info. Worst case scenario we dont get our SDCC passes. Weve already got passes to the D expo the week before and a hotel there in Anaheim. If we cant get a hotel or passes for SDCC then well just stay outside the city and drive in some of the days to hang out and do the activities outside the convention center as well as some other things.,SDCC,d5t50un,1,t5_2soaa
10594116,0,t1_dd8eav2,To address both your concerns There are no current mods in the sub inactive or otherwise This sub is really only active during ticketing month. The top post of all time only has  upvotes. So regardless of how active I was on the sub I still wouldnt meet the minimum threshold required due to nature of the subs population. Ive been visiting the sub for the past  years during ticketing month and the month of the show so Im as active as I think could be expected. Plus Ill have a bit more incentive to show up in the off months to clean it up if Im modded.Thanks! Let me know if you have any other questionsconcerns,SDCC,dd8p93r,5,t5_2soaa

11280573,0,t3_5yxnr0,Hey Everyone. Ive got some ideas on what might happen. Marvel could skip SDCC this year in favour for D but Marvel Television would still be there. And some people got some on what they might reveal at the different events.   Marvel TV First look at Inhumans Defenders and Punisher definitely. Maybe a release date for Jessica Jones Season Two. Possibly Iron Fist Season Two announcement.Marvel Studios Thor Ragnarok trailer definitely. Black Panther Infinity War and maybe AntMan and the Wasp first looks. Possibly a first look at Brie Larson as Carol Danvers.Marvel TV First Look at Cloak and Dagger and Runaways. Maybe some plot details about Daredevil Season . Possibly Luke Cage Season Two release date. Marvel Studios The Fantastic Four and Namors Returns to Marvel. Maybe some more upcoming MCU movies beyond . Possibly a first trailer for Black Panther.,SDCC,dfamx7c,1,t5_2soaa
11531746,0,t1_dg1xiu0,I highly suggest not dressing up for your first time at SDCC. Its way more fun just enjoying the experience the first time around. Not that many people cosplay but there is still a good amount. ,SDCC,dg34j17,2,t5_2soaa
