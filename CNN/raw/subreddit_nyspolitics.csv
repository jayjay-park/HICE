1160476,0,t3_27f1mz,A is the adoptee bill of rights. You can read the bill here I am adopted and because of that I can not access my original birth certificate because it was sealed. Adoptees face unequal access under the law and we feel it is discriminatory. Our original birth certificates are sealed for life.This basic lack of information effect us physically and mental. I know some adoptees who are now dead from preventable disease that could have been treated had they had access to their unamended birth certificate. Our former identities are a state secret.We have had a bill in NYS since  and have the votes to pass it in the assembly and the senate but our bill have never made it to the floor for a vote. It always ends up in a special committee where it goes to die.I ask that you think of the civil liberties of the adoptee and help us end this discrimination.You can see a story about it here Public hearing here ,nyspolitics,ci066zj,2,t5_2ujjn

If its not illegal to discriminate based on pay or to fire people for being trans what difference does it make what you think of the evidence that it happens at all? If its illegal and no one can prove that it happens that sucks for people who are harmed but dont have enough evidence. But if its not illegal it doesnt matter what evidence exists. gtIn the case of children youre asking me to restrict a parents right to raise their child how they see fit.So what about prayer healing instead of medicine? Or mandatory vaccinations? FGM? We legislate what kind of medical procedures and therapies can and cannot be used on children all the time for the childs saftey. ,nyspolitics,cjqb5ap,1,t5_2ujjn
