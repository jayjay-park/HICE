403850,0,t1_cfml0fg,I want to theme it like the game portal  hence why I put aperture science in the title. I would have the portal logo on the outside of the building and the palette of blocks I would be using would be quartz cyan clay some blueish glass. The inside would be decorated with testing chamberspuzzles that any server member could try. The building wouldnt be too tall as quite a bit of it might be underground.,NashboroughServer,cfmmiui,1,t5_2xsbt

1114796,0,t1_chuz1te,Yeah those are the problems I forsee as well. I dont believe the airports should be as large as actual airports because we could stretch from Nashborough to Ashton just by placing one. We might have to move some thingsgenerate land in order to make that work. As for the railwayssubways I think theyre awesome and still very useful. I think railways should be used for getting from town to town as well as from Airport to other parts of the city youre in. For instance Autumnport might not have an airport so I train to Autumnport would be really handy.,NashboroughServer,chv0ezs,1,t5_2xsbt
