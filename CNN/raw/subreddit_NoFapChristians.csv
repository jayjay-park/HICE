111408,0,t3_1v90gt,Im really sorry to hear this. I think unotimpossibru has a valid point and that certainly might help you. I know my time struggling whether I wanted to be a Christian or not really strengthened my faith because I decided it was my faith. I would recommend digging into the Word and seeing what God has already said about you. Here is Romans  ESV Therefore since we have been justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.  Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.  Not only that but we rejoice in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance  and endurance produces character and character produces hope  and hope does not put us to shame because Gods love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. For while we were still weak at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.  For one will scarcely die for a righteous personthough perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die  but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.  Since therefore we have now been justified by his blood much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.  For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son much more now that we are reconciled shall we be saved by his life.  More than that we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received reconciliation.You  are loved! The Lord hears every word you say. It is difficult but the Lord wants to see you succeed and will guide you.Praying for you brother stay strong!,NoFapChristians,cer47fz,1,t5_2ysnf

This feeling that you say you have I feel numb...I feel still...I feel distant from God...I feel distant from the calling I once knew he had on my life I think you feel what all other guys have felt at a point where they knew they had to change and turn things around from themselves and God. God sometimes let his children know what the right way is and what is not. This absence what youre experiencing because of PMO could also in my experience mean a deeper problem. You could be on a way where you eventually can disconnect from God totally. Maybe God is letting you feel through this experience because this isnt the life God wanted for you and for all other people in the world. HE wants you to be happy and a better life for you. And I believe the first step is to get things right with God again. Seek out God and pray go from there. God be with you brother!

A big factor in this revelation is that much more Im drawing strength from God over myself. I have noticed my view of people especially women has changed. Even though I never was the misogynistic type I have noticed that things like oversexualization of women doesnt bother me because it triggers me but because I am seeing them as abused women and not an aggregate of body parts.Those are the  main things I have really noticed.

2870919,0,t3_2szbs6,This is an interesting question. I am myself going through a conversion process and as others have pointed out dating someone who loves God more that you do could actually be a motivator. I was a cradle catholic and was dating this awesome Godloving Presbyterian girl. Once I started dating her I automatically gave up on the sin. However I could only mange a month without it. Being a God fearing woman she could see that my faith was not strong enough. Someone loving God cannot being having any sexual sin. She broke up with me . The breakup made me question my own faith and I slowly started reading the bible and understanding the consequences of my sin. According to Catholic tradition fapping is a mortal sin something that leads to spiritual death. I have also been reading St. Augustines confessions who also gave in to sexual sin early in his life. Finally I have been praying and contemplating deeply on this issue and I feel that I must master my flesh to be able to truly love a woman. Loving someone is an act of selfless giving and until I cannot control my flesh I cannot give my self fully. Hence it is better to have overcome this sin of the flesh for atleast a year before getting serious with someone again. A year may sound a lot but its really a test of how much of a man you are. ,NoFapChristians,cnufa8b,1,t5_2ysnf

3077861,0,t1_coh0n77,Romans   | English Standard Version ESVgtgtA Living Sacrifice  I appeal to you therefore brothers by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that by testing you may discern what is the will of God what is good and acceptable and perfect. gtGifts of Grace  For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. For as in one body we have many members and the members do not all have the same function so we though many are one body in Christ and individually members one of another. Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us let us use them if prophecy in proportion to our faith if service in our serving the one who teaches in his teaching the one who exhorts in his exhortation the one who contributes in generosity the one who leads with zeal the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness. gtMarks of the True Christian  Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil hold fast to what is good. Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not be slothful in zeal be fervent in spirit serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope be patient in tribulation be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. Bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for evil but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible so far as it depends on you live peaceably with all. Beloved never avenge yourselves but leave it to the wrath of God for it is written Vengeance is mine I will repay says the Lord. To the contrary if your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him something to drink for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head. Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good.

3168550,0,t1_coq5jc4,Why do I get the sense that you are being vague? If you are referring to what he says in the first chapter about desire it might behoove you to understand that the Greek word epithumeo does not translate into English as desire but rather something like lust an overwhelming desire especially for something forbidden. I also get the sense that you do not allow yourself to desire a rightful end having a healthy sexual relationship and not just with a woman but with yourself  with your own sexuality. This if it is true is a sin because it leads to confusion and selfhatred. I will pray that your eyes be opened but if you are not interested in these ways tell me that I can spend my time elsewhere.

3276108,0,t1_cp097mj,On the part of reaping what we sow while on earth does that mean any sins we commit that the punishment will be within our earthly life? What book or verse is that in?Im so paranoid like if I cant quit in time or if the second coming would be on a day during a time of relapse for me that I would be considered sexually immoral and therefore go to Hell or experience eternal seperation from God.  After all I think there are verses that say things like there is no room for the sexually immoral in the Kingdom of Heaven as well as a lot other stuff that is listed. Think it was in Matthew or Acts since those are the only  Ive read recently but maybe not.I also have been viewing things the same way as op in the sense that my life as well as my families life in general has been crappy for the last few months and I wondered if it was because I had grown too far from God and that my families sinfullness as well as my own combined made God want to stop blessing us.Max Ive been making it without PMO is only like  days a couple times with a lot of failed attempts being at  days. And I keep telling myself that if I would have just made it a little bit longer that things would go back to the way they were for me and my family. Ive been finding myself telling God havent I made it long enough? Can things go back to way they were now and I will continue to do good?Sometimes because of how overwhelming the temptation is for days on end it feels like it drags on forever and when it feels like it has been a week I will check the date and disappointingly see that it has only been something like  days.,NoFapChristians,cp1pb7n,1,t5_2ysnf

3738616,0,t3_336t6z,Lately Ive started to get curious about why guys and gals with long streaks suddenly just snap and relapse.  If the number of days we accumulate not fapping equates to a habit that gets stronger over time then we should feel so much stronger in resisting the urge.  I havent gone beyond  days by intention but I know that when I relapsed at  days my will was as weak as when I relapsed with just a day of streak.  Was it just my mind playing tricks on me? Did I really got stronger with the long streaks?  Sadly my answer at least for my case is no.  So instead I have this theory one that is borne out of how I am keeping up this streak.  This streak is both hard and easy.  Hard in the sense that all the familiar urges that grow over this time of abstinence is there.  But easy in the sense that I can silence the urges almost in a snap it if I can truly convince myself that giving in to the urge is not good for me using the realizations that I had gathered or been given one by one day after day.  So the theory is this  nofap is not a habit you can cultivate.  Rather its a mind game you have to win.  Theres no muscle of the will that you need to make stronger.  The road to victory is realizing why it should not be a part of your life that its not a replacement to anything nor a form of release that you are entitled to from time to time.  Until that day sadly relapse will always be just one bad moment away.  I know because Ive never had a streak longer than  days in over a year of trying this. And that one streak was simply hanging by a thread that I know will snap anytime soon because I simply dont have a reason not to give in.  Of course I could be wrong and would definitely welcome other views.  ,NoFapChristians,cqifct1,4,t5_2ysnf
3756017,0,t1_cqjwnvb,I think lust is allowing yourself to have some sort of in depth sexual fantasy.  It is virtually impossible to not have sexual thoughts but try not to dwell on them try not think of any deviant things and avoid porn at all costs.  If I see a beautiful woman I am drawn in to look at her and there is nothing wrong with that even if Im admiring her figure but I am becoming more and more capable all thanks to God of just leaving it at that and not having any sexual fantasy going along with it this is tied into not looking at porn.,NoFapChristians,cqkew6x,2,t5_2ysnf

If you are going off a purely biblical ideologyhow can you conclusively say that something that isnt mentioned ONCE is a definite sin? It is possible to masturbate without fantasising you dont have to belive mebut I have done it. Perhaps making a habit out of it is playing with fire but I know for a fact it is possible.Finally id say that the bibloe is actually very explicit on sexual sinpre marital sex extra marrital affairs homsexual acts bestiality were all mentioned...I think anything else could definetley be argued as ok in Gods eyes as long as it was in the confines if the marriage bed or did not involve lust for women...again biblically id ask you to state a case for it definitely being a SIN.We all do this thing for our own reasons but if he says he doesnt fantasise etc then leave him to itour own failings arent what we  should measure others by at least IMO.,NoFapChristians,cqpi250,1,t5_2ysnf

4092827,0,t1_crmson1,Thanks for mentioning  Cor . To be honest it has never worked for me before now. Not sure what is different this time. I think the keys this time have been that we both totally agreed going into it. Also on the time frame. we added some positive exercises in the place of normal marriage intimacy. She knows Im trying to have victory here through Christ. She knows it will benefit our marriage. And she knows deep down that it is a group problem. That last one deserves a longer explanation and discussion but for now I will simply say unequivocally that my problem with PMO is MY PROBLEM. Not hers. Neither is my problem with PMO a matter of not being attracted to her. I am. But the sin beneath the sin of PMO is a kind of intimacy disorder. And that makes PMO a symptom of a deeper more systemic problem as they say. The whole family system is sick in some way ways and we need to discern together its non sexual roots and sources.

Dont worry so much about your past or the nature of your sin because sin is sin no matter what kind. Look to God. If it is his will anything can be done.

When God changes our heart then we earnestly seek after Him with all of our being not just our brains.  We pursue Him at every corner.  We find that the things weve been trying to use to cover up our need are failing.  We find our true need.  To connect to and live from the awesome power of the One True God.  When we connect submit and live toward Him everything changes.  Power starts to flow out of us that we do not generate on our own.  We push past the I cant and we begin to embrace He can do anything.  I am His.  I am a tool of the Living God.  My life and every life is under His sovereign hand.

I see too many threads about ex homosexuals saved by Christ with no actual evidence that theyre heterosexuals. With Christ yes it is possible to abstain from anything...but I believe changing your entire sexual identity is another thing entirely. Im not saying it isnt possible but physical attraction is a simple thing. Yes you can be attracted to the opposite sex in a number of different ways but physical attraction is instant. There is no thought required for it. It is primal and also the foundation for an intimate relationship with someone.

9766977,0,t3_5f0q46,I lost my dad when i was  and my missed opportunities come from not having another man guide me until I was . I dont feel bad about the missed opportunities because I was doing my best to get them but I did not have the people skills to take advantage of them. That was not my fault. Talking to my pastor about this stuff has helped but it still hurts. I feel like all the men who said they would be there at my dads funeral should have been there when I asked for their help but they all rejected me and I had no other measuring stick than rejection until I moved churches. To get the spiritual fire going I finally obeyed Gods Word where I was trying to ignore it. I was rejected by all the men in my life and that was my reality but the Bible says to bear one anothers burdens. Eventually I obeyed what God was trying to tell me and moved churches and got close to my pastor and I dealt with this stuff but I will not go back to my old church because I am afraid of what I might say. Occasionally I see the men who promised to be there for me and never were and I dont say a word to them because now I know how much they betrayed me.

10034237,0,t1_dbeozso,I think that we are missing something in the modern american church. We talk a lot about parent and child and we talk a lot about husband and wife but in between that we need to be mentored and discipled. There are things you need to be learning right now about very close intimate intellectual emotional and spiritual relationships that only a mentor can show you that would really prepare you for marriage. And show you some things. Like in I corinthians  it tells married couples not to defraud one another. Ever sermon every conversation I have ever heard about the subject has been about defrauding one another sexually. But as singles we need to have conversations with people about what other other areas we can defraud that person. And then prepare our best to not defraud them. If its developing an emotional connevtion how can you prepare to develop a healthy emotional connection now? If its being a spiritual leader in the home how can you prepare to be a godly spiritual leader in the home now? I think it would be wise and right to talk to a pastor and talk about the non sexual things that would be defrauding a wife and how to prepare for them today. And believe me it will take your mind off porn. As for I corinthians  it is talking to couples not singles struggling with porn. I would argue that I Corinthians  is talking to any unmarried person struggling with sin including porn to stay single until they deal with the present distress. ,NoFapChristians,dbfhkcc,1,t5_2ysnf

10416296,0,t1_dcoabfs,Wanted to let you know I saw this and Ive made a note to respond in more detail later when Ive got more time. The gist of my next longer response though is that my turning point was this at some point my anger and resentment was poisoning the marriage  not my husband. Regardless of what he did I had a role of putting the marriage back together too. This extended anger and resentment was sinful especially in the face of my husbands transformation. Im not saying it was sinful to be angry at all  no that would belittle the hurt but at some point it has gone on for too longIt was also recognizing the depth of my own sin  and the conviction of the Lords Prayer  God forgives as we forgive others. If I could not forgive my husband who was I to ask for forgiveness? Sure my sin may be less in the worlds eyes but in Gods eyes its all sin and has the same consequence  separation from a life with him. Yourbrainonporn.com is a very objective and scientific exploration on how it affects the brain and was helpful for me. An analogy to junk food is also helpful.

Circumventing an app with a builtin browser works like this  Many apps have certain functionalities that look like an app but are actually just mobile web pages designed to look like an apps UI. The majority of Help and About sections of iOS apps are like this. When youre in those sections it looks like the rest of the app but its just a mobile web page. The key to circumventing is finding a way to link from that section to something like Twitter or Google where you can search for other bad stuff.Even if there was a way to whitelist certain websites on iOS across every and all app and I doubt this is feasible in the way suggested this would destroy the functionality of most apps because these apps are constantly pulling from webpages to load content into your app.  I believe there are probably iOS browsers that allow accountability partners to approve certain websites but this functionality is not going to work across all apps.,NoFapChristians,dd5952v,1,t5_2ysnf

Im lucky in that my church had a sermon series on porn and when I finally had to confront what I was doing and confess it one of the pastors was right there to pray offer counsel and a good counselor.One thing he said really hit me  he said one survey showed  of men in the church reported a problem with porn and if you limited the survey to pastors it was   that was sobering shocking and depressing.I cant imagine how much worse it is for women  we recognize that its rampant with our men but Ive never heard it discussed regarding women other than in the context of a womens whose husband is addicted.  I suspect that makes it harder to look for help.  You are NOT alone  I know at least one other woman is an active member here ... and I see shes responded to you Hi ek!.Welcome again and dont hesitate to give us a shout if and when you need some prayer or encouragement ... every one of us does at one time or another and we all help each other ... thats what makes this group a huge huge help!,NoFapChristians,df19g7j,2,t5_2ysnf

Remember the power hes given you. Tell the devil to flee from you  in the name of Jesus. The devil has no power over you. Read Psalms     and  and Romans  and  everyday. Those Psalms chapters were prayers from David asking God for forgiveness and cleansing after he just committed adultery and murder. Read those chapters as prayers to God and ask him for forgiveness and cleansing. He will cleanse you of all unrighteousness if you let himst John Who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?st Corinthians There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear itYoure an overcomer through Jesus. When you believe in Jesus you overcome the world and all of its sinful urges and temptations. Sin has no control over you anymore. The only power that sin has over you is the power that you give to it. The devil is weak and hes already been defeated by Jesus. His temptations are just an illusion. Jesus was able to resist the devil in the desert at one of his weakest moments. He fasted for  days and still resisted temptation. Ask God for strength. No temptation will ever have enough strength to overpower you. Pray to be lead not into temptation. Pray to be delivered from evilRomans For sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under graceShall not have. It has  control over you. Dont let the devil fool you. Ask God to fill you with the holy spirit everyday. Also try praying and fasting. Jesus said that praying and fasting can give you mountain moving faith. Pray fast read the bible and ask God to give you strong faith so that you can overcome these temptations. God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble. Rely on his strength at all times. Make sure that you truly want to stop and it will become much easier to resist. Jesus said and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. The truth is that Jesus has already taken care of your problem. The devil is the father of lies. He would like for you to continue falling for his deception. Read those Romans chapters everyday and youll begin to know more on who you are through Jesus. Use bible verses to fight against the temptation. The word of God is the sword of the spirit. Push out the sin that you struggle with with scripture. The devil is weak. He is pathetic. He is beneath your feet. He cant control you any longer. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. God is ready and waiting to give you strength. All you have to do is depend on God and ask him to give you strength to deliver you from whatever you struggle with and he will. I pray everyday for God to keep me away from temptation and he does. Follow the example of Jesus. Read the bible and see everything that Jesus taught and did and temptation will be much easier to handle. I asked God to help me and he took away my desire for porn. He can help you as well if you truly come to him and truly want to never look at it again. I was addicted to pornography but when I truly asked for his help he freed me from the addiction. Pray to God everyday and ask him to kill your desires for the sinful things that you struggle with. Ask him to take away your interest for them. He may not do it at first but dont get discouraged. Keep on praying and asking for his help everyday and soon you wont struggle those sins anymore. Dont give up. Draw nigh to him and hell draw nigh to you. Always fight your sin with scripture or it will defeat you. Trust in God and always rely on him and his word to fight for you. Get into the mindset of Jesus has freed me. Im never masturbating or watching porn again. Sin is beneath me. Heres a good verse to use against temptation. Make sure to memorize itGalatians Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondageI also have a post from seven days ago that you should read. Its called Depend and rely on God. Its the most recent post on my profile. It might be able to help you ,NoFapChristians,df5bdhb,1,t5_2ysnf
11280815,0,t3_60j9ks,Youre not gay youre struggling with homosexual temptations in the same way that I am not a fornicator because I struggle with sexual temptations. Dont make the mistake of defining yourself by your sin! You will be amazed at how your brain will heal itself as you wean yourself off of porn. I have been starting to make moderate progress in beating my own addiction and am already amazed at how my thought processes are becoming healthier.,NoFapChristians,dfanwrr,2,t5_2ysnf

11473078,0,t3_63pl6e,God gives us signs in many ways and yes I agree it is a confirmation. Remember how its rare so that when temptation comes you wont dismiss it as eh just chance.On a sidenote I wouldnt interpret it as God getting fed up with you ... He loves us infinitely and His mercy never runs dry ,NoFapChristians,dfwgve7,1,t5_2ysnf

11621652,0,t1_dgdbdio,To be honest I have mostly taken these teachings from the Church that I go to.  I have not searched out the verses and put them all together myself.When I was in school we had a Bible teacher who was almost Jewish Christian.  He had a beard and was very thorough in explaining his beliefs.  He taught that sex married you in Gods eyes though he did support marriage simply to keep the union sacred and preserved.But at my Church which is Anglican Or Church of England we are taught that any sex outside of official marriage As done by the church and the government is sexual immorality I think adultery is the wrong word.Ill just take this site Sex before Marriage and summarize its arguments for you.  If you are not satisfied with this then maybe we shouldnt argue because I am not up to the task.  Seek someone more qualified if that is the case. When God created Adam and Eve he said Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife and they shall become one flesh Genesis . One flesh refers to sexual unity but also to the deeper spiritual unity between husband and wife in marriage.In the rest of the Bible Gods design sex is to be enjoyed in marriage is always assumed. This is especially clear from the fine that a man has to pay for sleeping with an unmarried virgin Exodus  and from the requirement that a woman should be a virgin on her wedding night Deuteronomy .In Mark  Jesus gives a list of sins. Among them are sexual immorality and adultery. So there is sexual immorality that is not adultery. Sexual immorality refers among other things to sex before marriage. Paul says the same in  Corinthians  Because of the temptation to sexual immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. So if you want to have sex there is only one way not to fall into sexual immorality to have your own husband or wife.Hebrews  encourages us let marriage be held in honor among all and let the marriage bed be undefiled.,NoFapChristians,dgdbptz,1,t5_2ysnf
11686626,0,t1_dgkonoy,Have you talked to your pastor or his wife about this stuff? Over the last couple of months I have gotten to the place where I have to deal with the relationship I had with my previous pastor. Basiclly my dad died when I was  and at my dads funeral my previous pastor said if I ever need anything he would be there for me. No matter how much I asked or needed him he has never been there for me. To make matters worse I am called to ministry and my previous pastor taking every oppertunity to blow me off is a detrimit to my testimony and a huge block to me actually entering the ministry God has called me into. As I take steps to once again enter into the ministry me and my pastor agree I can not run from this problem anymore so sometime in the next month I will have to sit down a resolve this problem in the right way. In fact next week my pastor is sitting me down with his pastor and we are talking about this whole problem. Seriously  months ago I didnt know where to start when I realized I could no longer run away from the problem so I just started writting what happened over the years and let me tell you the letter was ugly and its better to say my previous pastor did nothing than to say what he did. But after writting the letter I was floored by the fact that instead of seeing myself as lazy I realized I was a self starter. It was a great positive to come out of begining the process of making a bad situation right. ,NoFapChristians,dgkp35w,1,t5_2ysnf
11765749,0,t3_67uvks,Not sure if this will help but just maybe....Im a former meth addict. What started out as a manageable fun habit turned into a full blown no way to escape nightmare addiction. I couldnt find a way to stop and break the cycle so I finally just surrendered to it. Worst decision I could have made. I finally hit rock bottom and found myself homeless jobless and in county jail on drug charges facing  years in prison. That was my turning point. I gave my life to God and ask Him to help me start rebuilding my life. After  days in jail I was released on probation WOOHOO! No prison time!!. The first thing I did when I got out? Started looking up friends that I knew had meth. I spun out once again...it seemed I just didnt know how to stop. Wasnt God supposed to be helping me?!?! I finally realized that I had to take the first step to sobriety and He would strengthen me and help me through it. Im never going to do meth again ever! was too big of a goal to daunting to unattainable. Ill go a week without meth! I can surely do that! nope still too big a step.I had to acknowledge where I was my weakness in this area and the need for baby steps.I will make it to midday without doing or seeking out drugs. I made it. I will make it to bedtime without doing or seeking out drugs. I made it.After a couple of days like this I got bold and set a goal of an entire day then  days then a week then  weeks and so on. It was hard but I was able to do it. And once I made the decision and set the small shortterms goals I found the strength of God was there to help me.Ive been clean a long time now and those days of addiction are far behind me but it was hard. So very hard. You CAN do this. And ifwhen you fall down get back up and pick up where you left off. I had to tell myself many times I may not get any better today but I refuse to get any worse. I may not rise up but I refuse to fall any lower. Addiction is addiction regardless if its porn drugs gambling whatever. You have to have the desire to change and then act upon that desire by setting small shortterm goals then pushing until you reach them. When the urge hits you to do what you said you wouldnt stop and pray. Give thanks to God for Him giving you the strength and resolve to resist this temptation. He will help you through it. Hopefully this will help at least in some small way. Feel free to message me if you ever just need someone to talk to.,NoFapChristians,dgtoeub,9,t5_2ysnf
11785667,0,t1_dgvjoqd,yes. Still changing in frequency. It seems random to me some times I will go weeks with out them once a few months a go I had them three days in a row. Granted generally they do not have a dream factor with them. They do not bring as much of a struggle with them afterwards as they used to either. ,NoFapChristians,dgvy0co,2,t5_2ysnf
11799926,0,t1_dgxja8r,Then do what gideon did and replace the problem. Instead of falling asleep to netflix fall asleep to reading a book. Heck doesnt even have to be a holy thing just a not bad thing. ,NoFapChristians,dgxk97d,3,t5_2ysnf
