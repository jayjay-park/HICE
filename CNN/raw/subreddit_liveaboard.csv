You going to do all your eating at the university?  How handy are you with tools?If it is an overglorified bunk and you can turn a wrench sure why not?  I dont think Denmark gets hot and cold like the US Liveaboard in Boston or New York without a whole bunch of gear and you would freeze to death.  I have heard of a couple going vagabond on the American gulf coast in a Catalina  so it isnt that much of a stretch.  Need more Euro input around here. ,liveaboard,cq09mof,3,t5_2sdex

4206744,0,t3_38tem4,We anchor nearly all summer and it took me two years to really get proper sleep rather than having an ear open to the boat all the time.You need to develop trust in your anchoring gear and ability which does not come instantly.Now I sleep well but I will admit to sleeping in the saloon cuddling my anchor alarm if we are anchored in bad weather.,liveaboard,crzr9vx,1,t5_2sdex
4242880,0,t1_cs3fcz4,I disagree. Jamaica has its share of social problems but once you are out of the tourist hot areas you will find that any American city is more dangerous.

6126393,0,t1_cylzdjh,I posted the houseboat for laughs. Its undoubtedly abandoned trash and no sane harbormaster would allow that thing into their harbor. Its just too risky and time and again people take on these projects and then abandon them. Im sure whoever has it now would give it away for free if they could get rid of it.Power boats are much nice to live on if only for the fact that they have windows you can look out of as opposed to the little bunker style slits at waterline sailboats have.What kind of money are you talking about ? Are you looking for a cheap project or do you have money to spend. ,liveaboard,cym09ip,1,t5_2sdex
7081628,0,t3_4citu7,Ok until you get those rotten bulkheads replaced youre in danger of having the mast fall over. If youre lucky you can get the old ones out in one piece trace them onto new marine ply seal it up really well with epoxy on the edges and then bolt the new ones in. The cabin sole is probably completely rotten as well. Expect to spend    to get it all solid enough to sail.When it comes to  boats I wouldnt pay over  for this mess.

9031448,0,t3_53x6np,There are two people who live on the hook here in the middle of Clear Lake. One guy has been there for years. The Wednesday racers have hit his boat multiple times. I think you could get away with parking your car behind some of the bars or restaurants at night but Ive never figured out where you would tie up your dink while at work all day. Im pretty sure the outboard would disappear within hours if it was tied up unattended anywhere in our area.,liveaboard,d7xfqx6,3,t5_2sdex

10662068,0,t3_5sk5lp,First a caveat Far too many of these dreams end up for sale at a loss after a year or less of the reality of living aboard much less transiting open ocean. Do yourself and your family a massive favor and spend some of your budget whatever it may be chartering the type of boat you are looking at for a month or a few weeks first.Even that isnt really an adequate preview but at least you will have dipped your toe in first. And it absolutely wont work if your wife isnt entirely on board. So you need to be thinking about ways to sell the lifestyle to her first. A few positive experiences on summer trips can pave the way to something more lasting.Or save you a lot of money if it turns out to be intolerable!Longrange seaworthy trawlers are a rare breed and they are correspondingly expensive even used. I am sure people have done it in other types of vessels but the only ones I am personally familiar with that have made the transPacific hop have been folks in Nordhavns. Gorgeous boats very well built with the systems and tankage to handle the jump... and priced accordingly.Theres a big difference between trawlers and sailboats when it comes to longdistance voyages which is fuel. People can and will debate the suitability of your el cheapo production sailboat for bluewater voyages but the fact remains that many of them are used successfully for that purpose. They are whether advisable or not physically capable of those trips.Powerboats though gotta have fuel. For long distances a LOT of fuel. That imposes size and stability constraints that mean your average Nordic tug no matter how comfortable and attractive isnt going to be going to the South Pacific from Seattle anytime soon.So even assuming the whole cruising lifestyle is something you are cut out for youre either going to have to boost your budget or trim your range. Or learn to sail!But many many people dreaming of palm trees bite off more than they can chew after the Boat Show anyway. Living aboard in Puget Sound and cruising up and down the Inside Passage is both more than enough of a challenge and offers more than enough enjoyment for most people. I dont want to tell you to lower your sights but think about whether or not something more local would be equally satisfying for you at least to start off with.TLDR No youre probably not on the right path with trawlers.,liveaboard,ddfplzk,11,t5_2sdex
11006850,0,t1_defl1mm,Yeah Id push through the  range. Plenty of space for everyone and still able to be rigged for singlehanding.Speaking of which how much sailing experience do you have? Id get a US Sailing or ASA certificate and experience. It will help you get a hold on the larger boats. Even a single day with a certified trainer not just some old salt can move you light years ahead of just regular experience. A few hundred dollars that would have a big payoff over the years. ,liveaboard,deflga5,2,t5_2sdex
