Its good for helping carve spoons and cups. The woodmans pal is excellent at branches saplings and is an excellent drawknife  chops OK up to about  to  inch dead wood splits poorly and is poor at feather sticks.

A link to one legitimate source to support this claim.  No blogs.  No conspiracy theories.  Cold hard science.  Remember I dont know anything about science so please enlighten me by showing me some.I never claimed I knew any science.  But I find it amusing how you first say science is bullshit.  Now all of a sudden you imply that science supports the idea that race mixing is bad.You do understand that human beings have been around for roughly  years right?  And that during that period after leaving Africa and settling all over the world that humans not only mixed races but mixed species i.e. with Neanderthals?Then of course there are the many many examples of people of mixed race that have done good andor contributed a lot to society.  One could even say these people are actually the grand majority of what constitutes people of mixed race.And lets not forget that genetic variation is beneficial for species which is why its no surprise when researchers found out that humans are both taller and smarter than our ancestors and attribute this to a rise in genetically diverse populations.  You can read more about that hereAnd yeah one would think you would get banned for being a racist asshole which I hate to break it to you but thats exactly what you are.  However I am no moderator so thats not up to me.  But as a general rule racist assholes are not very happy or productive people and thats obviously far worse than being banned.  You can always make another throw away account anyhow.  But this is your own existential question I give to you.  No need to answer me.  I mean how could you or anyone for that matter convince a stranger over the internet that you are happy?  But ask yourself are you happy?  Do you really want to go through life as a racist asshole?I wish you well.  I want you to know I am not being sarcastic.  I honestly hope that things improve for you because I know it must be hard to go through life as a racist asshole.  But you dont have to live like that you know.

Can you identify the local wildlife trails the paths most used by animals? If so be sure not to camp on top of it or youll have visitors all night.

If the slingshot video included maybe showcasing some tracking skills or anything else relevant to bushcraft itd be fine but slingshots and marksmanship have their own subreddits.

6904019,0,t1_d0yojmw,gt I think itd be good to teach some of these bushcraft skills to kids because I sure didnt learn it from scouting.I think there are things you cant do which I found quite frustrating at the time.  We had a troopwide ban on fixed blades which limits whittling spoons and especially batoning wood down to get at a dry inner core. So much of modern bushcraft is centered around that thick full tang fixed blade nowadays.  No more home built alcohol stoves which is a shame because some troop wrote up the very first instructions I ever saw on how to make one nowadays there are  videos on youtube today if by chance you have no idea what Im talking about. I remember getting chewed out by some scoutmaster for using a dulled utility knife blade on my ferro rod. I just didnt want to mess up my folding swiss army knife. Leave no trace which I cannot fault limits the cutting of live trees unless we had special permission from private land owners. There was an exception barring high traffic public lands like National parks Appalachian Trail etc to allow us to eat wild plants if we harvested them in a sustainable manner. LNT also prevented us from creating new firerings where there wasnt one established already. Fallen dead wood only no standing deadwood. Any bushcraft shelters would need to be disassembled and scattered widely before leaving too.That being said I have fond memories of my time in Scouts. I carry the knowledge of knots lashings wild edible plants firestarting cooking backpacking rappeling etc. to this day. Edit Example of trooplevel prohibited items. ,Bushcraft,d0yw1l6,2,t5_2qnfs

You then send the boys off to gather supplies split up and build a camp for overnight. We would usually do it in the mid to late fall so shelter building was super important. Its a good way for the leaders to kick back and not do a whole lot while giving the kids a whole day of activity. Just dont let the kids build their shelters on top of a fox den. Had a buddy that did that he ended up having to fight off a particularly angry momma at  am.,Bushcraft,d0zgme9,1,t5_2qnfs

Henry was fine with a  inch knife Jerry had a Kabar and Billy would have carried a sword if we allowed it.  Id love to see the BSA reevaluate this but its really a troop thing on any camping trip other than to scout camp for the summer.  If your scoutmaster thinks your knife is reasonable hell allow it if not hell put it in his car or his bag until you get home.With that said last camping trip I brought my BK and showed and allowed the boys to make wooden mallets .  Once there are  or  mallets in camp everything looks like a tent peg......,Bushcraft,d0zr46u,2,t5_2qnfs

8356615,0,t1_d5m3gfr,Good question.  The carving axe is often similar in size to a hatchet but of a lighter weight.  This particular carving axe is unique in a few ways.  First the majority of the axe head is a mild low carbon steel designed to be struck by a mallet or baton.  The edge itself is a wedge of Bohler K tool steel that is hardened to  HRC giving it extremely similar cutting performance to the quintessential O bushcraft knife.  That opening between the handle and the cutting edge allows you to choke up really close and gives you a lot of control for finer tasks.  When I go campingbushcrafting I dont only take this axe.  I take a knife with me.  And if I have a larger project in mind I might take a couple of other tools.  But for general camp tasks or things like shelter building or fire making I dont even use my knife.  I use this axe.  The speed and efficiency of performing a task like making a tent stake is much much better using this axe than using a knife.  And it requires much less effort.  The axe is still heavy enough that I can split kindling just fine and the noncutting steel in the axe head is perfect for batoning should I need to which I almost never do.,Bushcraft,d5m4nwk,6,t5_2qnfs

10348516,0,t1_dch0acn,I had a friend who as he was attempting to collect water to boil for coffee punched through the January ice on a shallow stream in the western Adirondacks several years back. He went in up to his knee totally flooding his boot. Once he got back to camp in order to dry out his boot he placed several lemon sized rocks next to the fire in order to warm them up. The first several worked just fine gently heating the interior of the boot and producing a fairly constant output of steam. It was only after the third installation of these hot rocks that he misjudged just how hot they had become. He dumped out the old rocks and using a bandana over his winter gloves as an impromptu ovenmitt he quickly dropped a new heated rock into his boot. The smell of melting foam rubber and nylon immediately filled the camp as the scalding hot rock fused with the interior of his Lowa winter hikers. He was not a happy camper and the next days hike back to the vehicles was not a particularly pleasant one ,Bushcraft,dch2bg8,2,t5_2qnfs
10356017,0,t1_dchw7ab,I never have a spear is too narrow in comparison with its length for any spin I could put on it to be of use and it usually caused it to twist in the air. Keeping the center of balance slightly forward of the grip seemed to keep the spear stable and still give plenty of force behind the throw. The guy that showed me how always held it at the balance point but when I tried that the point always raised up after I threw it. I would sugest taking a few throws just changing up where you hold it to see what works best for you then sticking with what worked best while you work on acuracy and power.The spear I got to practice with wasnt anything fancy basically just an old shovel or hoe handle that was given a point and had a leather cord wrapped grip so you should be able to find something cheap. I got to throw a nicer spear with a steel blade a couple times and it threw about the same as the pointed stick. I am assuming you have a specific spear and purpose in mind so try and find something about that size and weight to practice with if you can then take some practice throws with whatever spear you get to adjust to any differences.,Bushcraft,dchwy0o,2,t5_2qnfs

At  a plastic handle will give you frostbite almost as quickly as metal.My thought was simply that at  or lower there is no way I would ever remove my liner gloves even while sleeping.

11045552,0,t3_5xmyk3,Honestly the best thing you can do is get to know your own local laws and work within them. Knife and Gun laws in Australia vary a little by state but generally speaking theyre about common sense and safety. Licensing requirements and transport requirements especially for firearms are stringent for good reason. Knives are considered tools in Bushcraft although some police will frown and call them weapons. In that case pop into your local police station and have a chat about it. Knowing the fine line and being well informed should see you avoiding any issues around carrying in the bush. Carrying knives around town is another issue altogether again though there are simple rules generally about sizeblade length and foldability. If followed you should be fine.,Bushcraft,dejzsri,2,t5_2qnfs
11045611,0,t1_dejlyoz,gt Knife laws are wildly different state by state.In some cases even city by city same for gun laws.

Speedway IN has a law on the books that says concealed carry is illegal but its from the antitransient laws of the s and s pinball machines are illegal within town limits too... because dont ya know pinball machines attract transients... and is invalidated by state law. ,Bushcraft,dek01fw,3,t5_2qnfs
