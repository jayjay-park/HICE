1759653,0,t3_2emv4t,As evidence against the accused I present the following snitch logs copied on the night of the incidentClick the evidence links on the right sidebarIn these pictures you see that the accused broke a door which was stone reinforced killed four cows there were more killed but only four deaths captured by snitch and broke yet another stone reinforced element gate in order to take the item drops from the wrongfully slaughtered cows theft.I am dropping any accusation of murder as under the Mount Augusta Criminal Code death in the due process of attempting to capture an accused is NOT admissible as a murder charge as all people do have the right to self defense under the Mount Augusta criminal code even the accused.,mtaugustajustice,ck0ymip,1,t5_2ujyn
2221002,0,t3_2khtuc,Right hey there guys this is my side of events. On the th of October  I was attacked by Spada in the desert he then began to chase me but I managed to escape. Unfortunately I could not manage to open up fraps to record this as I was running for my life. However I do have a screenshot of him combat tagging me  After shooting at me he began to run at me with a sword. I do have witnesses. After that I did not feel safe on civcraft and I was not the only one. Gta goldenegg and a few others also felt threatened to go near him. We heard that there was a private bounty on him and we felt he needed to be caught as this was not the first time spada had attacked people for fun. The next day we decided to pearl him so we could safely continue to do our day to day buisness. I and several others attacked spada. Fast forward a bit and he wins the fight and pearls me fair play. Spada did release me from the pearl but did not return all my things. He went to hide in new detroit with my things. Eventually after attempting to kill several others he returned to Mount Augusta. Spada later returned to Mount augusta. Spada opened the door into his house in mount augusta and I entered hoping this meant he would give me the things I was missing. He hit me with a sword. When the Thothslibrarian the peacekeeper was not looking.  Spada also hit garkingbing when he was afk to provoke us. After this spada gets out a poison potion and attempts to throw it at me he misses and hits himself. He then begins chase on me. Luckily I manage to escape. At this point I leave feeling more unsafe than ever.,mtaugustajustice,clm559s,2,t5_2ujyn
2224249,0,t1_clmja38,gt I store des alt account in a chest in my house. I log on later that night to find that all of those people including now chootytamtam amb and littleowl in my basement after they broke down my doors and broke into my basement. They said to me in the mumble that they were about to break des alt account from the chest. I free him and repair my house from their damages. Not once did I get reparations from them breaking and entering my house.The purpose for the vault break was that Des was unjustly pearled and we needed him to help defend Thoths from the Americans as he was holding Jarls pearl.Furthermore your statement gt I speed pot and run down hpoom while they all chase me.Is not entirely true. At no point was AMB involved in anything and I was busy standing on RNNYs house Thoths can vouch for me that at no point did I chase after you on the day.  The people involved in the break where GTA Delp Owl Hyzonko who got everyone out of Spadas basement Chooty Wanado GarkingBing a person I forgot the name of and myself. The people harrassing spada the following day after the break where the same people minus me Owl and the person I forgot the name of.The only player that broke any reinforcements as far as I am aware is Garkingbing from what I saw in the screenshot Thoths sent as I wasnt there.gt any spec of respect I had for goldenegg.    You never had respect for me to begin with XD and since my involvement are minimal I feel that the loss of respect is unjust and I would like a spec of respect reps!tldr Some of what Spada is untrue.Edit since I am a nice guy I WILL pay for the reinforements lost from saving des  stone blocks  iron ingots and a stonebrick block,mtaugustajustice,clmk0gb,5,t5_2ujyn

2771245,0,t3_2rt7fd,That first statement is fucking bullshit even though none of you would ever admit it. As if cutting the head off would kill my fucking city. But zaphod is all hot air. He talks big game but never backs it up. He never does shit but talk and complain. He quit before. Hes not important. Hes poor. Fuck him!Fuck you! I stuck by this shit hole when nobody else would twice already! You think I wouldnt yet again? But you quit before already. You clearly dont care. Read my resignation letter for once.gtYoull be able to continue on without me but know that Im always here watching over my city. Do you think someone as obsessive as me would let the city fall to death even if everybody else left? Even when I wasnt playing I checked the sub at minimum weekly. This is what insults me the most. The implication that Id be so uncaring to keep my city alive when Ive already done it before. Hell Id be willing to bet at least one of my close allies would come back to help me with all the people who dont like us gone. Come fire lava and cobble mountain Mt. Augusta wont die as long as Im free!At any rate there is still no procedure for what to do in the face of treachery by refusal to act and she is safe from double jeopardyor is she? I didnt pass down a guilty or not guilty charge I dont think. I simply said the case is closed. The most extreme punishment I could imagine would be exile. Simply strip Screenname of her rights as a citizen. I doubt this could be done or whether it even should be done. Its obvious that revenge would possibly result in one form or another if we did such a thing. I propose a small fee of repsd be paid to each and every registered citizen by the accused in addition to at least  weeks endtime for jeopardizing the city handing out information to criminals listing key targets to provide max damage and betraying her countrymen by inaction. I recognize that these punishments may be too harsh so I wont be making any verdicts without input from the other judicial figures. Besides I doubt its fair for me to preside since Im clearly heated by this whole thing.On a personal note Im just as deeply hurt by this evidence as I was by the previous bit.,mtaugustajustice,cnj2wnj,6,t5_2ujyn
2886816,0,t1_cnw8c4s,Ill do some checking later to see if theres a way based on skype logs but otherwise word usage punctuation choices spelling are the typical differentiators between people but are as you point out difficult to leverage in a conversation sample set that is so small.,mtaugustajustice,cnw8ff8,1,t5_2ujyn

4083429,0,t1_crlpg7h,Nah thats the amount of stuff that was stolen. Im just saying give some to zap who I stole from and use some of it to reimburse the other crime stated in the thread. zap says I stole  diamond blocks from him but I only took  diamond ore. I know I wont ever get any of my items returned so I dont really consider reps to be in my hands now. ,mtaugustajustice,crlqiwa,1,t5_2ujyn
4260313,0,t1_cs5ub82,I didnt do anything to your house. Look at the logs like I know you have. I was there. I didnt click my mouse even one time to hurt your property. Not even once. I cannot see at all how I have done anything seriously criminal. With this assault charge are you saying that youre only lying because you believe me to be lying? Thats not how this works. I hit you one time. If i would have beat you down my naked unarmed character to half hearts in your full diamond armor wouldnt you have said something about it? Ridiculous accusation. Every minute I spend facing that claim is another minute i spend thinking about leaving this city as im being slandered by a respected veteran member and can say nothing to prove it. I dont deserve any of the resentment you hold towards the griefers because I didnt grief anything! That is fact. ,mtaugustajustice,cs5uu04,1,t5_2ujyn

4409694,0,t1_csmngx0,Mhm thanks for the mention meunier. Glad to know our wooden houses on the asscheek of the desert have caught your attention. Whether it looks like a ghetto or not Thorne is the newest and possibly one of the fastest changing districts as it is oriented towards all of the incoming newfriends. Id like to hear your reasoning behind why you thought it would be okay to grief anywhere in MA regardless of what you think about how it looks.Btw the grass looks dead because almost the entire district is in the desert and biome colors make them look yellow.,mtaugustajustice,csmph2e,0,t5_2ujyn
4614382,0,t1_ctc7oet,gt Its not even that the evidence doesnt exist out there its that Eden did a shitty job of gathering it and providing it to the judges.The cases that came out of last weeks incident were the most highprofile since Ive been here possibly even since the founding of . Mt Augusta. You were certainly well aware of them yourself as were most other active Civcrafters. If you or anyone else has evidence that was not provided by the prosecution why didnt you bring it to light during the trials?,mtaugustajustice,ctc814x,5,t5_2ujyn
