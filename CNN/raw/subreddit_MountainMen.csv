3065889,0,t1_cofriiu,I just haul food in.  Most of the time I want to spend my days doing something other than digging up little mampm sized root tubers and hunting is pretty much definitively illegal and considered a moral outrage.  Besides one person could exhaust an area pretty fast unless they were eating deer.  Most people who arent working for the deer hunters would love it if you ate the deer.I like digging up the little root tubers and I especially like the berries and fresh greens.  I eat quite a bit of forage and am always trying new stuff but its probably  of my total intake in a month long stay.  Theres about  lbs of dense calories that need to be supplied for that length of time.  Also hey coffee... chocolate.Im totally hijacking this thread though.,MountainMen,cofrydx,2,t5_2sufh
