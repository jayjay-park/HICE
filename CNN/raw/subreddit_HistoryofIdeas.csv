1872737,0,t1_ckeu02b,I partially agree with you especially when it comes to my generation they definitely took as much as they could from society and gave back very little. In the end I also jumped onto the passing floats and joined the parade.However  years ago it was not a bull market.    was the deepest and longest recession since the s preceded by five years of inflation and stagflation. The bull followed later.As for sympathy Im not asking for any. I have retired and I am set very comfortably for life provide I dont live past  years and I am fine with that. As for metaphors  I believe that teaching a prisoner the physics of the iron bars is as important if not more so to teaching a person the dynamics of the bond market it is good to know if you are planning on cutting through the bars with a knife. The prisoner would of course need a knife which is equivalent to getting a job in the bond market which is always easier if you have the right contacts. ,HistoryofIdeas,ckeuwi7,3,t5_2swgc
1898625,0,t1_ckhuf1v,I have read the available online documentation of his life and case thanks.gt Fact anyone who thinks those two facts can be glued together into an argument it an imbecile.Well his murderers destroyed or lost the paperwork but they themselves admit that it was among the charges.  We we being the modern scientific extollers of his virtues seem a lot less emphatic about gluing them together than you seem to be about ungluing them.For what purpose?  The fact that Bruno was executed and the fact that Galileo was imprisoned are not in dispute.  The fact that the church defended its actions in these cases right up to the same few years in which they were colluding with the Third Reich is also not in dispute.The fact that scientific merit can stand on its own is not just attributed to that scientific merit.   The ages of enlightenmentreason that spawned the French and American revolutions that in turn permanently damageddestroyed the church as a bearer of politicalmilitary power were not just philosophic or scientific exercises after all despite their beginnings as such.In short the reason that scientific merit can stand on its own is that there is no longer a church with the power of the state to stamp it out.  In that light Bruno and Galileo are certainly martyrs Im sure that pun is intended by those who use it disregarding how accurate their ideas were.  So while Bruno and Galileo might be rightfully unglued from a modern Astrophysics textbook they are still very much glued to the destruction of the notion of a political power derived from religious authority.  And the two obviously go hand in hand after all while we as western industrialized societies were ushering in the computer age in  the Popetobe was still defending the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.,HistoryofIdeas,ckhz2nl,-2,t5_2swgc

2331270,0,t3_2lyd30,You know as a Classicist seeing Page duBois and good book any where near each other is like being dunked in a bucket of ice absolute and utter mental shock. I suppose Ill at least read the view and give this book a try...Oh wait...Perhaps duBois thinks she has to fight the monotheists on their own turf but it makes it so easy to discount what she says. I am including atheism in monotheism because thats what it is a belief in the inexistence of God  of one god that is. There are citation gaps when she struggles to make the case for a prejudice against polytheism to the point that she includes online comments and quotations from Yahoo! Answers complete with typos and general insanity. She makes claims at polytheistic societies being more open and less warmongering than the monotheistic ones linking the Wests thunder God with its much more violent history.So about on par with her work within her discipline then thought so. EDIT I feel like I should expand about especially since Ill almost certainly read this book anyway because Im a damn sucker for this kind of thing. In essence I think a similarly themed book WOULD be very interesting from a proper Classicist with a background in ancient religions because that is the area where a lot of debates on the nature of polymonohenokathenotheisms were played out from say the th century onwards. In particular the shift from poly to monotheism under the Roman empire is very well documented and Vedic Hinduism is actually a very popular point of reference when we study these ancient religions so people are hardly unaware of or hostile towards polytheism. ,HistoryofIdeas,clzuwib,3,t5_2swgc

3370929,0,t3_2yriqd,This sounds like it was written in .  There are certainly problems with a number of the thinkers they mention but on this point theyre dead wrong gt Here left and right touch in their extremes it is precisely a libertarian ethos of freedom that dominates their vision as David Harvey has insightfully pointed out This is the world that libertarian Republicans construct. It is also the view of individual liberty and freedom embraced by much of the anarchist and autonomist left even as the capitalist version of the free market is roundly condemned.Its absurd to attribute this to any of the thinkers the authors name whatever other problems they might have with them.  Charles Taylor said something very very similar about Michel Foucault in Sources of the Selfi.e. that Foucault promotes an anything goes ethos which is absolute nonsense and that was just as foolish a claim then as this is now. With statements like thisgtTodays radical intellectuals do not feel compelled to defend their arguments or respond to their critics. Their purported radicalism becomes all the more opaque when the coherence of their claims is called into question. A concern for an exaggerated subjectivity identity politics antiempirical theories of power an obsession with difference  all serve to deplete the radical tradition of its potency.The authors essentially demonstrate that they havent really read anyone theyre complaining about  of course they already do that by failing to address a single argument or notion from any of these people.

7422867,0,t1_d2ln1fh,Well I came to the same sort of positions as the communist left by reading Marx and having a general political experience.  So I guess one could say that it is more of a classical Marxism.  The Italian left communists were about a return to Marx and so to was Lenin when he broke with Kautsky which is one reason why the communist left likes him and is why they like State and Revolution.  But Bordiga and the Bordigists came up with something called the invariance of Marxism  By this they didnt mean turning Karl Marxs ideas into a dogma.  The term Marxism is not used in the sense of a doctrine that was discovered and introduced by an individual named Karl Marx but to refer to the doctrine that emerges with the modern industrial proletariat and which accompanies the latter throughout the entire course of a social revolution and we continue to use the term Marxism despite the vast field of speculation and exploitation to which it has been subjected by a series of antirevolutionary movements.  It was supposed to be a means to defend the theoretical ideas of revolution against three particular groups of people Deniersfalsifiersmodernizers. We fight against all three and we consider the third group to be the worst of the lot.  If you read some of their stuff they often talk negatively of people who try to update Marxism.I think that most of the ideas of the communist left have been clarifications more than anything else on such things as fascism and the party its role in the revolution and connection to the class.  The only real development that I can think of is the ICCs theory of decadence where they think that every historical epoch has an incline and a decline even capitalism.,HistoryofIdeas,d2lxjkl,7,t5_2swgc
