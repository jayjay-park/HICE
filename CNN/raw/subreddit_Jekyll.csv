3476244,0,t1_cpoe35d,Ah so it is the jekyll source files that go in the root of that branch and not the static result files?,Jekyll,cpoimuf,1,t5_2tv1l
4929214,0,t1_cufa3t8,Here are two posts from the blogThese are two of the latest posts you can see at Ive compared the files but cant find anything that would hint towards a solution. Both files have same line endings stat ltfilegt gives the same information on both files... Its such a mysterious problem!I just tried out another variation I touchd a new post file on the Ubuntu machine then edited it on Windows using WinSCP and Notepad. This post does work just as intended so it really boils down to the file creation not the content so line endings etc. should not be the cause here am I right?.EDIT Sorry the file links are not working at the moment trying to find an alternative...,Jekyll,cufv7pd,1,t5_2tv1l
6795497,0,t1_d0mj7u2,are you using an open source repo for your site? Itd be nice to see more of what youre doing.,Jekyll,d0mk688,1,t5_2tv1l
7357053,0,t1_d2edlem,Short answer No. But theres work arounds.Try first to use it as an ltimggt. You can use creative css and styling to get an ltimggt to behave like a bg image. If thats too dumb just write it inline in the html. ltdiv stylebackgroundimage url  item.bgImagePath  gt... I have an implementation of this kind of thing on my portfolio loganpendergrass.com based off some tympanuscodrops stuff. ,Jekyll,d2eg377,2,t5_2tv1l
8784938,0,t1_d73s8ct,Thank you for that! ... but I have no idea how to do what you suggested  Do you mind showing actual code bits from the configs that are required for this?,Jekyll,d73sg1x,1,t5_2tv1l
