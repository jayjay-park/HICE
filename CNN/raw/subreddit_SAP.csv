372702,0,t1_cfhxrkb,I ha e worked as a developer for production support in SAP. I have done what you say many times in my work. Most of the times I get whats going on. It has even become fun with standard programs that are only in German since I had been doing some Duolingo German and it helped a lot. Is there any way to grow. I have basically just used se to code from scratch or to give support to others. I have made and continue to add to a personal file woth hints tips and what I learned that is why I ask of any methods or ways to code that could be differentnew to me so I can add them to my fileknowledge base,SAP,cfje9dq,1,t5_2qkeg

1011428,0,t3_256ss7,Hey  Thought I would give you my  cents since Ive pretty much done what youre trying to do but not from HR.  I did a Business Process based I.T. degree and got a job in a large company here in Australia as an Internal Functional Consultant in the MM module think Procurement  all up about  years of SAP experience now.  I was pretty lucky as I had zero experience in SAP to begin with but I had a team of  who I could bounce ideas off and they took me under their wing.  I also totally agree that the field is extremely large there are tons of different modules you can learn HR being just one of them but once you learn one and work out how SAP works its not too hard to move between them.  For example I started off in Procurement MMIMSD and moved to Enterprise Asset Management think maintenance but if anyone asked me any HR questions or I needed to look up employee information its pretty straightforward.  Anyway you can do courses in SAP classrooms may cost an arm and a leg but I think you should check out this SAP Learning Hub its a cloud based learning solution so you can log on from home and learn that way.  If you pay for it it costs approx around k AUD but you can sign up for a free version which has a few courses that might perk up your interest  check out the ones under the Human Capital Management heading.this has a list of some of the courses for free  ,SAP,chj99c3,2,t5_2qkeg

All changestransports moved through the landscape are sent to the training environment after moving to production.
