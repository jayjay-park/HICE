11780868,0,t3_6833cj,UJ I will be honest it does seem like there have been some good quality posts the past couple of days that encouraged discussion like the marathon training plan one. These seem like the type of posts I see in advanced running when I periodically lurk bc Im a plebe but I cant tell if its skewed because people are trying to show you can have good content discussion that isnt karma whoring. I think itll go down if this moderation approach is maintained over time. I actually explained responded to a comment that wanted to know why their post about running with their dad was downvoted. Cant win. People are still going to be butthurt about it. ,RunningCirclejerk,dgvedpy,7,t5_2tk2y
