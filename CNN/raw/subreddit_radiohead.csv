450321,0,t3_1z7w3o,Proper music geek here.  The part of the song that you mention is in a closely related major key to the rest of the songs minor key G major to B minor and follows a descending tonic to subdominant whole step leading tone.  That is a G chord is played stuffed followed by a G chord with an F bass stuffed followed by a G chord with an Eflat bass stuffed and finally hitting a G chord with a D bass we thought you had it in you but before resolving.  A few songs I know off the top of my head that have similar motifs ... Sunny Afternoon by the Kinks keys of A and Dm Dear Prudence by the Beatles key of D Cant Find my Way Home by Clapton key of D  or  to  and Im a Man by Chicago Am V Schneider by Bowie Babe Im Gonna Leave You by Zeppelin Not that Radiohead ripped any of those bands off of coursethe chord progression is a very common one and its used a lot in a ton of other songs that I of course cant even think of right now.  Its just one of those thats entered in to everyones subconscious like the classic IIVV tonicsubdominantdominant progression has.  On a side note this song is actually way more interesting than any of the above songs for other musical ideas the back and forth between the minor and relative major during the verses repeating that descending whole note leading tone pattern in the relative minor during the portion thats in that same accelerated cuttime pattern without resolving it traditionally and the use of the flatII II and flatVII to modulate in to G major from B minor for the aforementioned part you recognized.  Just another example of Radioheads musical genius  and all crammed in to a fleeting !Edited for formatting and a brief dorky musical digression.  ,radiohead,cfrg6zy,18,t5_2r3p6

If you listen to some bootleg live recordings from  theres a soundboard recording of their Bonnaroo set floating around thats a bloody masterpiece some of the songs sound quite different than in their finished form.    As much as I adore TKOL and its Bsides I also worry a bit that In Rainbows may be the last classic guitarbased album we ever see from them.

1027202,0,t1_chl0l7j,Well as you highlighted thats just how I hear it. Part of it does have to do with the reduced compression but certain things sound a bit.. weird? in the mix. Drums will always always benefit from reduced compression but they definitely seem to be presented a bit forward in this guys reworked mix. Yorkes voice seems to be pushed the slightest bit back in the mix which allows the guy to present certain textures that are panned hard to the right and left channels a bit more forward giving them a more pronounced feel than the original mix. Again these are personal observations and I have in fact heard the stems before though I should admit never compiled. I also have some vague familiarity and knowledge of music production so Im usually paying pretty close attention to the mix which is why those little details caught my attention. Now Im not saying that this guy is being dishonest in his mix at all and it very well could be that he just mixed and mastered it to his own taste. I just wanted to put my two cents in. ,radiohead,chl1rw1,6,t5_2r3p6

Ive listened to Dark Side of the Moon Wish You Were Here Animals and The Wall. They just wont click for me. Radiohead was the exact same way as were The Beatles as were Arcade Fire. Those are my  favourite bands. Is there something that Im missing with Pink Floyd? I Just dont see anything special. Their music is pretty slow and Im just not entertained while listening.

If Im going to really sit down and enjoy an album I use my records and turntable. I love collecting records as a hobby. My listening rig is nice but nothing special and certainly wouldnt do for a true audiophile.I still listen to my old cd collection for stuff I havent or dont intend to acquire vinyl copies of. If Im working on the computer Spotify streaming is usually my goto.My iTunes collection feeds my phone and I use it with a pair of Shure headphones at the gym or on the go. I also sometimes use Apple Airplay to stream my iTunes collection to my stereo. I encode my cd rips in Apple Lossless so that I have a quality backup of my collection but have tons of .mp downloads from record labels bandcamp etc in there too.I enjoy listening to music through all of these mediums. They all suit different purposes and Im grateful to have so many options and and formats and ways to listen.

And I also think The National Anthems bass line drum beat and everything else for the first half are really sick I thought it had the potential to be an even cooler guitarbass song if they had some sort of chorus to complement what they already had and couldve played around with the structure a little bit the horns at the end are good for a bit in certain parts but I think by the time the songs over its a little overkill.

2002724,0,t3_2hoe9t,I cant speak for everyone but if an album were to have half of my favorite songs from that band on it and then half simply good songs Id be willing to overlook the good and call that album one of the bands best. Some of their best material is on there so why shouldnt the album be acclaimed?Now some people consider album consistency more important than an album with inconsistent greats. For them if they see Kid A as more uneven like you they could never consider it amongst a bands best since the notsogreat songs drag it down. So even if two people think of individual songs on an album the same way they may have differing views on how much that impacts the greatness of said album.Personally since so many of my favorite Radiohead songs are on Kid A Im willing to overlook the parts I dont like as much and consider it one of their top albums.

2030392,0,t1_ckxrvup,i think they work out different deals with labels for the most part most artists earn pennies on the dollar. its a bit hard to calculate because spotify pays pennies per play but they dont play an ad for every song and they earn revenue from paid memberships as well. hard to calculate how banner ads fit in as well. but basically theyre raking in a lot from advertising and a captive audience. theres definitely some kind of payola as well because when you shuffle it will play suggested tracks which sometimes have nothing to do with the artist or genre youre listening to like playing Lady Gaga when youre listening to the Joy Division station or something like that. if you dont pay and you run out of your  skips per hour you could be forced to listen to shit you dont want to and im sure theyre not doing that for those artists for free.personally i only use it on my phone to quickly check out a new artist or for stuff i cant quickly pull up on mobile YouTube or Grooveshark. i prefer torrents soundcloud and artists YouTube channels.,radiohead,ckxwo23,1,t5_2r3p6

Whenever I put Radiohead on in front of them they just say that its good but theyre probably not paying attention. Im the youngest in my family...Oldest brother is into heavy metal no idea what he thinks of them. Second oldest brother is into mostly Pakistani music but loves Prog Rock Pink Floyd is his favorite band ever and some rap. He thinks theyre not bad. No idea what my third brother thinks of them. Hes more into rap and dubstep. Sister mainly listens to Alt Rock but same situation as you and your sister. She loves Jigsaw Falling Into Place and occasionally likes another Radiohead song. Only band we both listen to is Cage the Elephant. Most of my friends absolutely hate Radiohead. Ive argued for hours talking about how amazing they are but couldnt turn any of them.

The interesting thing about songs whos connivers emotions are so strong we find them repulsive is that those songs are so much more impactful when we find ourselves in the same situation.

I was stunned to read articles in magazines that state how Thom and Nigel felt about the record and then hearing about other fans reception.  I guess this is where I disagree with Thom.  It may be long it may be a less cohesive flow but the songs are so cool Christian themes mixed with fairytales and nursery rhymes and political angst buzzing around the mind of a father singing about the darkness in the world with his son in mind.  This dystopian view of the present day paints such an accurate picture of the dreary aspects of life with the extremely articulate instrumentation that its impossible for me to find something amazes this much. ,radiohead,cot86l5,1,t5_2r3p6

Ive almost come to view that CD as one big hourlong song. Its very hard to pick apart amp split up as I think it really takes something away from each track by segregating them from the whole. Definitely one of the most cohesive albums Ive heard. Took the easy way out amp chose Treefingers as the least favorite. If I were forced to chose a least favorite noninstrumental from Kid A I would probably say In Limbo. Similarly for OKC Id choose The Tourist as least favorite if choosing Fitter Happier wasnt allowed. In Amnesiacs case... Maybe Dollars amp Cents.edit It also seems Im one of the only people who enjoys We Suck Young Blood from HttT. Thats definitely a top tier song from that album for me at least. Something about the ambiance of that song with the subject matter just makes for a strangely morbid yet satisfying experience that I dont get from a lot of songs. Hmph.,radiohead,cpl51a8,9,t5_2r3p6

4289438,0,t1_cs8vvr3,Sure Ill have a shot at it sorta.Basically it can be their best album to someone based on how that person feels heshe can relate to the album at the time based on that persons emotions and interests. So any one of their albums can be considered fantastic and splendid to someone while the person next to them can find the album revolting and thats perfectly fine. For example Kid A generally has a depressing and sad tone. I know Thom doesnt like to associate depression with his music but theres no arguing the fact that Thom and the rest made Kid A at a time where Thom was facing some sort of depression  I could go into why his whole confusion and depression came to be but Ill spare you and assume that you already know  and that his generally sad mood contributed to the generally sad tone of the album. It just... Works that way with emotions. Youll want to listen to and make the music that matches your feelings and emotions because its relaxing and comforting and its something you can relate to. Of course subconsciously you may not realize that at first. So if youre feeling like you want to die hey give Kid A a listen. Its usually pretty comforting in times like those.Now the point that Im trying to bring across here is that Pablo Honey similar to an album like Kid A evokes very specific but strong emotions that can be related to again just like Kid A. So... Why wouldnt lots of people like Pablo Honey? Well I think theres an explanation. Adults in general youre all very prone to sadness anxiety and depression  some more than others. Hence an album like Kid A is going to be seen as relatable and comforting to many of you granted this isnt the ONLY reason that many will listen to the album but it can be a huge one. Pablo Honey? Well thats an album created purely as a result of the bands confusion and disorganization at the time with a touch of hopefulness but its mainly based upon teenageyoung insecurity anger sadness and angst plus that teenage craving for love and affection especially of those that you simply cannot get to love you back. Being that the vast majority of Radioheads listeners are adults that have matured out or so I assume? most arent going to be able to relate to the insecure immature simple and dumb sound and lyricism that Pablo Honey features. Again thats perfectly fine but its probably one of the reasons why most of you dislike Pablo Honey.Me on the other hand? Im a teenage boy and Pablo Honey is one of my favorite Radiohead albums thus far. Yeah its got blatant and stupid lyrics but that so perfectly embodies a lot of teenagers behavior dumb blatant and without much deep thought. Theres none of the usual cryptic Radiohead lyrics and no major themes across the album regarding life and death and all of its inner meanings and truths. No none of that. Just plain old lyrics like Even though I try... I cant which I couldnt stop listening to after much much time and effort spent unsuccessfully trying to please and get the attention of a girl I liked. Thinking About You is still the perfect song I would use to describe how I feel about a certain girl right now. Thom just constantly yelling PROVE YOURSELF! in the song of the same name helps me relate to how I feel like Im not good enough and how I need to prove myself to everyone. Creep also channels insecurity for obvious reasons. Plus all the general sadness and anger that Thom can channel through his vocals combined with the genius guitar that made Pablo Honey rock and not pop are brilliant. I love every bit of Pablo Honey and while its not their most masterful its their best to me at least. For you? Highly unlikely. For me yeah Kid A is super moody and blends perfectly plus its great when I just feel generally depressed and TKOL is amazing when Im in a chirpy yet somewhat relaxed mood but none can help me relate and make me feel the way that Pablo Honey does. Whats not to love about it! EDIT decided to make this comment a fullyfledged post. If you see a post floating around with the same text thats mine.,radiohead,cs953cu,3,t5_2r3p6

4626508,0,t3_3ecnep,i am a massive radiohead fan and there are only a few songs i will skip every time but im probably in the minority in saying optimistic is one i always avoid.  i think it would have been fine during the ok computer era or maybe even somewhere on in rainbows but i feel like it almost kills the mood and atmosphere of kid a because it is so out of place when listening to the album front to back.  im not saying i hate the song but i think it is the weakest song on the album that is my favorite.  Edit ok you actually asked for hate.  i hate feral.  i never agreed with the negative reviews on tkol.  i think codex is one of the most beautiful songs in the entire catalogue i think lotus flower is the sexiest radiohead song and love the weird movements and time signature changes on  little by little.  but i think feral is an entirely pointless song and there is nothing about the song i find redeeming at all.,radiohead,ctdqs36,12,t5_2r3p6

Having such a big name doing the music and if they had vocals which Im assuming they most likely would have it might have taken away from everything else plus the Dust Brothers did an awesome score on their own. Also if you havent listened to the audio commentaries yet and have access to them I would really recommend it. They provide a whole lot of insight into how the film was made and why they made certain decisions plus theyre just fun to listen to. The commentaries for Finchers films are always weird though like they take individual audio clips and place them over the film instead of just recording a conversation over it. ,radiohead,ctm50eq,1,t5_2r3p6

The Mona Lisa was hardly known for the first  years of its existence  its fame reputation and influence is largely a modern notion  post  post theft.gt At the time of the Mona Lisa heist Leonardo da Vincis masterpiece was far from the most visited item in the museum. Leonardo painted the portrait around  and it was not until the s that art critics claimed the Mona Lisa was one of the finest examples of Renaissance painting. This judgment however had not yet filtered beyond a thin slice of the intelligentsia and interest in it was relatively minimal. In his  guidebook to Paris travel writer Karl Baedeker offered a paragraph of description about the portrait in  he had a mere two sentences much less than the other gems in the museum such as Nike of Samothrace and Venus de Milo.gt ...gt Satirical postcards a short film and cabaret songs followedpopular culture seized upon the theft and turned high art into mass art.

6408844,0,t1_czi1f6p,On a side note... About the idiot rushing the stage. It was night two BTW not the same night as Karma Police sing along. Anyways when the opening chords of Airbag were played the fucking place went nuts. Any OK computer song will do that but Airbag I think is special because album openers usually are and I think those chords are the first thing from Radiohead a lot of people ever heard. The Bends is awesome but I think a lot of people came on board during OK Computer release. It was a hard album to ignore. Critics were fucking drooling all over it and the paranoid android video was so different so eye catching and so everywhere. I mean fairly regular MTV play. Every mag you picked up christened the album as a modern masterpiece. So when they played Airbag a somewhat live rarity it was so electric. Coming out of a small break it was song  in an encoredefinitely helped. Crowd goes nuts between the set and an encore. When that goon rushed I first worried about Thoms safety then worried if the show would go on. I was once at a Rage Against the MachineWu Tang show that was ruined by crowd stupidity and a White Stripes show that was almost ruined by a dumb portion of the crowd. Plus countless small venue unknown band shows that had a shitty crowd. But that dudes stupidity almost made the moment more special after we realized Thom was good and the show indeed would go on with absolutely no lull in the electricity that is Airbag. He looked like a bad ass and he did not look like the guy we saw in Meeting People. Im not endorsing that asshole behavior by ANY means and it might be a had to be there moment but thats how I remember it. Telling the world youre back to save the universe is kinda cooler after a run in with a crazy unpredictable jerk off. ,radiohead,czi4cy1,3,t5_2r3p6

7169695,0,t3_4dop80,I was bored one day browsing around in the CD aisle of an electronic store and I came across OK Computer back in the summer of . The album cover caught my attention. There was a little sticker tacked on to the plastic covering that reads  A Grammy nominated Album and then some little blurb about how the band continuously change their sonic landscape in just three albums... or something to that effect. I flipped over to the look at the tracklist and lets just say I was sold just based on the name of those tracks alone. I picked up Pablo Honey along with it just because I faintly remember Creep.   Having absolutely no idea who Radiohead is I was completely floored by OK Computer. I couldnt believe what I was listening to. It was unlike anything out at the time. I loved it so much that I went back and picked up The Bends and so began my lifelong obsession.  was also the year Radiohead was currently in the studio recording Kid A so I was in the midst of some truly productive and spectacular moment in the history of the band. Kid A being my first experience as a new fan of the band so I was already hotly anticipating the release of that album.  OK Computer is a timeless classic. It is up there in the pantheon of past classic Rock albums. ,radiohead,d1t4l5n,13,t5_2r3p6

I move my head to music I sing inside my head sometimes but at concerts I generally try to be spatially aware so Im not interfering with another persons viewpoint or area especially when standing. I dont sing out loud sorry Im not keen on this as its irritating cant hear the band then amp other people cant hold a tune and I try not to dance in a way that could potentially affect others negatively.

7218190,0,t3_4ebkyz,Before I became a fan I did listen to some Radiohead tracks Pyramid Song EIIRP Exit Music Karma Police Paranoid Android and later also No Surprises due to a House episode and Lucky due to a Six Feet Under episode. I knew of the existence of other songs and even tried to listen to some of them Idioteque Lotus Flower but it wasnt until a few months ago that I decided to really sit down and listen to their whole discography. Turns out I like a whole lot more than just  songs...Funny thing is that I have considered Pyramid Song to be my favourite song for as long as I can remember. I think the reason that I never bothered to look further than those  songs is because I rarely like more than a handful of songs from one single artist. Usually I only like one or two tracks. Granted some of the songs did take me some time to warm up to and quite a few of them I still dont like Idioteque Let Down... but Radiohead is the one artist I like the majority of the discography from even though they make really varied music. So I suppose its my favourite band now.,radiohead,d1yni11,8,t5_2r3p6

7485918,0,t1_d2t25bz,of course SOME people do separate CD and vinyl masters but for the most part that is uncommon. afaik radiohead doesnt. you cant just rip a vinyl and throw it in your DAW and compare the waveforms because the mere act of pressing an LP will insure that they dont look the same on top of all sorts of coloration that happens when you playback and rip a vinyl LP.  There are many practical and psychoacoustic reasons why your LP of httt sounds different than the CD but the original master they used to print the LP isnt necessarily one of them. this video gets into why,radiohead,d2t3wj8,2,t5_2r3p6

The lyrics are undoubtedly about mob mentality the music is scary af so the point might be in warning that the leaders often play a game of witch hunt with the public to divert from real problems and to satisfy their dark urges of burning the witch.No matter what the point is the symbolics are a pretty clear criticism of that frightening state of mind and todays wicked system.,radiohead,d2thqll,3,t5_2r3p6

Its hard not to hear these songs in the context of Thoms now severed relationship of course. And an ingenue is certainly not an analogue for a wife or partner but a young enchanting womanperhaps a mistress of sorts.

People who are unfamiliar of their work may just think all their songs sound similar to Creep or everything else that only seems to make the radio. I remember my mum being surprised when I told her  Step was a Radiohead song. Its the diversity of their music that makes them so great in my opinion. ,radiohead,d2uwyd3,4,t5_2r3p6

Someone threw the ALBUM IS OUT MAY  MOTHERFUCKER thread up before anyone even had a chance to finish the Daydreaming video. Gush about the release date over in THAT thread if you must. I am suspicious of those who see new material theyve been waiting for for FIVE YEARS and immediately start thinking about the possibilities of other songs instead of digging in and enjoying the material that is right in front of them. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush right? It smacks of karmawhoreness to me and thats about the kindest label I can ascribe to it. PLUS you know...I get a little butthurt when a song really speaks to me and other people seem to totally fucking miss it deciding they would rather make Ed OBrien fart jokes and watch the Up votes roll in. It is an affliction with which Radiohead fans struggle their entire lives I dont like having to dig through endless offtopic posts to find someone who validates my love for an astonishing piece of music.

I put Kid A on shuffle and once the album ended the next song that played was Let Down. While I listened to it I looked around at all the other people and realized that although life can feel empty sometimes it can also be beautiful whether its found in a song or in other people.

7606853,0,t1_d36tovi,An interesting thing is to see when if its not already the case it will become artificial being just another way to try to save economically speaking the musical industry playing on the communal factor of music ? Its not a secret that shows sell more and generate more incomes than LPs and shows before anything else allow if not are based on this communal factor in lack of a better word. By recreating this atmosphere of communion not around a performance but the release of an album artists but also managers labels... hope to create an event around it and generate sales similarly to selling a record after a gig. I loved the BBC listening party because of the album because I am a fan but also because musicTom Robinson made a great job in bringing people together. But I truly wonder if this will be replicatedadapted cf Drake as you mention Chance but also recently Beyonc James Blake etc etc to the extent of becoming a new traditional model as you say losing its charm originality especially when by people who care less about the music as Radiohead and music do than they care about the potential sales ? tldr  when will this be just another commercial feature ? ,radiohead,d36uyca,1,t5_2r3p6

In which case there was no way the songs could ever have been radiohead songs to begin with. Its hard to say though. Ingenue sounds like a song thom wrote out beforehand and I wish it had been a radiohead track in a way. I dont see it as amokamsp but amoktkol.

It was like they filled the entire space with an internal architecture of sounds I dunno.Whereas I dont think most of AMSP excepting Ful Stop Identikit maybe Burn the Witch really gains much by being played live and certainly not in large venues even relatively small large venues. It feels more suited to really intimate venues. Or maybe it would fit large ones if you actually had the orchestra there too.That said the general mood during this tour seems to be great so there is that.,radiohead,d3lm6w8,19,t5_2r3p6

Its more of a majorly conflicted lovehate relationship. He owns or at least has owned at some point at least one big powerful car just as a toy his own words  he also noted that he only used it a couple of times a year  some sort of jeep I think. He also mentioned a racing car as an example of his idea of beauty to an art magazine once although he eventually went with a picture of a cliff face or something as an even better example. And I remember getting the impression  from various interviews and articles  that he does like driving fast. On the other hand for quite a while he apparently drove a Mini as his main car.Hello. I am your resident creepilyinterestedinThomYorkesrelationshipwithcars person. Between  and maybe  or so I read and watched entirely too many interviews and the cars thing is one of the few areas where interesting discrepancies between his art and what we can discern of his life pop up which is why these bits stuck in my memory in particular.,radiohead,d3ubz2r,14,t5_2r3p6

Radiohead and the Beatles including PMJL solo work are my top  and no other bands are really even close atm. Dont like muse but Ive tried at least. I really like coldplays work up through a rush of blood to the head. Especially love their early eps the blue room brothers and sisters etc and parachutes. Zeppelin use to be my favorite band in high school. Love over the hills and far away ramble on and many more. I know a decent amount of Floyd but I really want to listen to a lot more of them. Love the  songs I know though.At this point Id only listen to the who if I wanted to drum along to a song by them. Nirvana and RHCP both kick ass. Although I think Dave grohl spelling? is supremely overrated as a drummer. Cobain as a singersongwriter is among my favorites.

Because Thom yorkes voice is not so amazing as Matts!! Matthew has devine voice !and Ugh! Ths IS Matt Bellamy! singing a radiohead song. Id recognize his voice anywhere.also GTFO if you dont trust that Matts Bellamy is a enormous fan of Thom Yorke thats because he decided to cover that song.. GTFO if you cant feel Matts voice.

8205279,0,t3_4rpsvj,Its absolutely incredible and ought be taken in on a primo sound system...the way many of us would listen to Radiohead records. Honestly I find them to be complimentary artists to listen to Radiohead speaks to me profoundly about modern alienation...and Kendricks understanding of selfloathing and depression is so true and vivid. Whats great about both is also how their messages are rooted in deeply personal situations but they write in ways that speak to the bigger picture. Im a white dude from the country whos probably rather ignorant to some of the specific situations and ideas that Kendrick addresses but the way he frames his message makes it accessible to anyone whos dealt with depression. Basically Maybe you cant understand the situation that triggers these feelings in me but we all have different things that are specific to us and the pain is real for all.In short both Radiohead and Kendrick have an uncanny ability to be deeply personal yet broadly ecumenical at the same time.EDIT I also saw Kendrick live at Okeechobee. If you ever get a chance you must go see him and his band.,radiohead,d537qcr,1,t5_2r3p6
8206227,0,t3_4rqbvm,I think Radiohead is more rare on all fronts . They are much older. Older bands not only tour less but have less of a lifespan remaining for tours. God forbid but it could be possible that this is Radioheads last tour. . Radiohead is putting albums out and touring at a decreasing rate. . They connect with a generationsweeping audience. They have been around for a long time but havent been dubbed dadrock due to their constant innovation. That is very hard to do especially in later years. . They have a large following while maintaining a very strong cult fan base which maybe the strongest cult fan base of all time. I dont know of any other band that has done that so well. Anyway it ensures that tickets sell out quick and prices can be high.. Its fucking Radiohead. ,radiohead,d53bzx9,9,t5_2r3p6
8206723,0,t1_d5341dg,Idk man Im a huuuuuuuuge fan of Kendrick but I dont think I agree. Radioheads trademark is experimentation combined with altrock roots. So theyre constantly making polarizing boundarypushing music. Kendrick is a brilliant rapper but hes more an example of masterful hiphop than he is a gamechanger.For example you compared To Pimp a Butterfly to Kid A and said it was a bold experiment. To me something like Yeezus better but still not all that well fits that description. The thing that made TPAB great was its combination of complex nuanced perceptive lyrics with great beats that took you through a sort of tour of westcoast hiphop history. Certain songs like u or For Free? were a bit more experimental but for the most parts Kendrick succeeded by having a great understanding of the history of rap and using that knowledge to his advantage. Take something like The National Anthem. The reason thats great is because its experimental sound making you really feel emotionally. Compare that to Alright or Hood Politics which are great because they sound good and make you singalong but mainly because the lyrics make you really think.,radiohead,d53e87r,6,t5_2r3p6

Its a God who created and loves you. About the animal analogy maybe I communicated it poorly. I was simply trying to talk about the concept of relative truth and how without the Bible there is no ultimate truth only us trying to define it ourselves. I mean even George Washington said that its impossible to rightly govern a nation without God and the Bible. Just wondering when did I even talk about authority figures? The concept of the Bible being the one true book and it having divine inspiration are difficult ones but I suggest you read this in your free time.

I liked it from the first listen and dont need the Basement version to enjoy it  though I will admit that the bass in the live version is better at creating the onbeatoffbeat ambiguity which is so groovy!

A bit of context in art goes a long way despite this being a beautiful album anyway. Musicians do write about personal hardship sometimes. Im not looking to peer into Thoms life like a voyeur.

If you doubt it try the Scotch Mist version!      Jigsaw  they need to bring it back live! NOW.    Videotape  no description will do this magnificent thing of beauty any justice. Im not even going to try.    The best part of In Rainbows for me is how playful and relaxed it sounds. I can listen to it any number of times in a row and just feel unadulterated happiness.    And I havent even started on the Disk . Go Slowly and Last Flowers are as good as any of their top ten songs!

8935053,0,t3_52nsh2,Probably my second favourite song in terms of Thoms vocals on OK Computer after CUTW which says a lot coming from an album with Exit Music and The Tourist.  One of my favourite things about Electioneering is that you can see in earlier albums how they take advantage of the dynamics of Thoms voice especially in Pablo Honey which has moments like that shout in You virtual snarling at times in Anyone Can Play Guitar etc and I think the vocals on Electioneering are the natural escalation from that. A lot of the songs meaning and memorability comes from how Thom is singing the lyrics  I mean at times the way he spits the words out like theyre poisonous sounds almost painfully rough on his throat.,radiohead,d7lv0kn,2,t5_2r3p6

To me it represents the coalescing of the various ideas expressed around the song especially There There to which it serves as a precursor. Its my second favorite from the album simply because it builds tension without any form of release in sight atleast within the song which mirrors the promises and build up politicians create before it all fizzles out. The top spot belongs to WIEAYB. Everything about that song is otherworldly.As for it being a meme dont be bothered with what people think. Thom singing it at every other live show didnt help its case it brought it to public attention that didnt understand its context and degraded it to meme status.

Its like the whole first section you dont really know what key the songs in and the whats there? chorusy thing feels like its sort of leading somewhere and Thoms vocals sort of sound like something flying and then when that riff comes in and all the percussion continue it feels like the song has finally LANDED. Its just so satisfying to listen to. As for the rain down section this bit is my personal favourite section of the song. Its just something about all of the backing vocals intertwining that really strikes a cord and the chord sequence is just brilliant. And then when the riff comes back in and Jonny starts going crazy its just so much better than it would have been without the rain down section because its such an incredible contrast. The rain downs just make the ending even crazier.,radiohead,d84c2im,3,t5_2r3p6

9793444,0,t3_5ff4ze,Like Spinning Plates  I think its really clever more than anything else. With everything being reversed the audio has a spinning sensation and the manipulated vocal sounds like its trying to be sung clearly but keeps on getting pulled around with that spinning sensation and ends up sounding alien. It all feels like it could lose stability and collapse at any moment like spinning plates but instead it reaches a perfect balance when Thom comes in and sings the title.  It still blows my mind today. Bloom  Theres so much going on in Bloom that I still find it interesting today. It doesnt sound like the guys in the studio to me.  It sounds like the band went outside started levitating and then took out their sticks and together started conducting the Earth to make Bloom.  It feels like forces of nature clashing when I listen to it but not in a scary way or anything more in an empowering way and a beautiful way. I find it one of their most uplifting songs. The National Anthem  It was the song that got me into Radiohead and years later I still love it. Similarly to LSP every part of the music including the lyrics work together to form a particular feeling or mood. Except this time its more anxiety. I always picture a crowd of people closing in on Thom as the song progresses and as the brass gets crazier making him feel more and more claustrophobic. And when listening to it on Kid A its followed by HTDC to make possibly the best onetwo in their discography to me. Its also a riot live. BASS. ,radiohead,dak95un,3,t5_2r3p6

We are helpless to resist shows how when relations go downhill sometimes there is nothing we can do.

Kanye west to me its undeniable that he is a musical genius most people from upon him and brush off his work because of his public image but I think he is a musical genius.. no other hiphop artist comes close  favorite album all of them. Kendrick lamar I was drawn into his music because he felt like authentic hiphop in a time when everything sounded so generic and lost.. over the years Ive seen him perfect his craft and approach it in a serious approach. Developing a very beautiful and jazzy style while still sounding street and staying true to his roots. favorite album to pimp a butterfly . A tribe called quest mostly for nostalgia but also because they werent afraid to be artsy and weird making conscious rap over dope yet jazz influenced beats. During that time something like this was absured and led to influencing a new sound which is deemed as the golden age of hiphop.  favorite album midnight marauders . Chance the rapper chancellor Bennet is an amazing individual outside of the music he is crearing. Though Im not a religious man he makes me appreciate his spiritual approach to the music he is making as well as the community he was born and raised in. He has matured from a young immature talented emcee. Into a father who is on a path to influence some positivity into the world around him. favorite album coloring book . The wild card pick Young Thug so this choice catches alot of flak.. young thug is a pioneer in the current mumble rap era in hiphop.. and alot of people disregard that form as anything musical at all. I disagree and actually consider most of these mumble rappers more like street singers then rappers. Thugger is the perfect example he created a new sound or way to sing though its not technically very impressive the structure and creative talent is what I find very exciting and interesting. He to me is an innovator and approaching the music in a refined street style. Something that can bridge the gap flawlessly from the streets to a lavish lifestyle favorite album the barter Sorry for the long post but I wanted to potentially give some radiohead fans.  who may have never given hiphop a chance an insight into some of what I think of as beautiful music as well.

At the end of the day its really none of my business. I love Radiohead and that is my only connection to these people. So I keep trying to stop thinking about it but I cant. Theres nothing else to even say but I still just want to say something. I need to process this somehow. What a horrible thing to have to happen. It hurts. And it hurts even more knowing the pain each of us feel over this is only a microscopic fraction of the pain felt by her loved ones. And on top of these weird conflicting feeling of being so heartbroken over the loss of someone I knew so little about and so creepily worried for the wellbeing of a stranger and his children I also cant help but wonder what this means for the future of Radiohead. I mean I was hoping thered be a webcast or something soon but clearly thats not gonna happen. I wonder what else might not happen. It feels selfish and callous to think about that part of it but at the same time it feels invasive and weird to think too hard about the other stuff too. Its tragic no matter how you look at it anyway. Shit I need a distraction from this. ,radiohead,dbexikq,6,t5_2r3p6

Planet Telex and Life in a Glasshouse were also early favorites. Almost all of In Rainbows except for  Step and All I Need took a long time for me to appreciate.

10172956,0,t3_5ln8i8,The one thing most people forget when talking about this song is that one answer while different in wording might be the exact same answer on a superficial level. And to be fair there is for example a reason that some music is written as  and not  though its technically possible to count one as the other. But that said Ive seen a lot of people ridiculously overcomplicate Pyramid Song only to reach the same conclusions. Sometimes its because we instinctively prefer the idea of a chord sequencesection being in one singular time for example not breaking up a  song into one part  and one part   It simply makes more sense to add it all up. Other times its because that we account for insignificant details to show of our knowledge.The problem with Stevens answer is that the timing of most of the progression is not in  but in . Measuring out the beat of the song and the repetition of melodical phrases and drum beats the signature is constructed by using  times  and adding a  as a curl on the tail also to create confusion regarding the swing feel of the song. The total number of beats however are  which can be divided into a subset of  hence is ultimate answer with simple . The problem arises when he tries to pass off counting  over every part since you can divide every bar into  since it goes up with both three and four. This however ignores the feel of the piano and drums of when the repetition of the beats begin again and creates instead an unnecessarily slow  polyrhythm feel when the best approach is to simple accept that while it adheres to the rule of simplification it remains much more practical and accurate to simply count  times  and a single .,radiohead,dbx5skt,23,t5_2r3p6

10712004,0,t1_ddkrijq,Problems with your nonargument Its impossible to be  wrong. Your response is an ad hominem which is a logical fallacy and doesnt address my claim.  Ive spent two weeks there and my sister is a foreign aid worker who spent two years there.  My thoughts on the experience where that its the only place Ive ever been and Ive been around the world where I was harassed by children with machine guns twice were people refused to talk to me because of my religion and where I was kicked out of a restaurant because of my religion. The vibe in Jerusalem sucked and had this awful sense of hostility but the coffee outside of the Damascus Gate was the best coffee Ive had in my life and the shwarma a couple blocks from the Mahane Yehuda market was the best shwarma I had while I was there. It was also fucked up that a giant fucking wall split the neighborhood I stayed in Beit Henina although I did think it was funny someone spray painted Justin Bieber on it. The condition in Bethlehem was sad but the Tent was a cool restaurant. I far preferred the north and Nazareth was the best city I went to shout out to the Fauzi Azar Inn and Tisreen for being awesome places although I did like Akko and Haifa quite a bit. I liked Haifa because of the whole integrated city thing and Akko because it was just cool. Actually the best falafel Ive ever had in my life was in Old Acre right below elJazzar Mosque and next to this cool corridor with an awesome shishah kiosk. Sadly I didnt get to spend more than a half a day in Tel Aviv but felt mixed about it. It was pretty and the food good but someone refused to talk to me because I wasnt Jewish which left a sour taste in my mouth. The way people were divided up in Ben Gurion airport was wack and it was obvious to anyone paying attention that Muslims were receiving worse treatment by airport staff.So Im happy to have a discussion with you  if you actually read my comments in this thread I advocate unity and liberalism  but if youre going to come at with me bullshit then fuck off.  ,radiohead,ddkv2x2,2,t5_2r3p6

Kid A was my first album adventure and TKOL might be my favorite. I was so excited about Radiohead early on I wrote a blog each time I got a new album while I listened to it for the first time with virgin ears. I quit doing that more recently but I wished Id kept it up. Found HTTT and PH at a secondhand shop and snatched em and my collection is officially complete. Its so awesome to have all the albums on CD and Im so obsessed Ill probably get them in vinyl. And I dont have a turntable yet.Keep us posted as you listen to more!

Theres a full band interview somewhere from Hail to the Thief era I believe when Thom is asked when hes going to give Phil his drumsticks back and they laugh about it.So when the CR videos came out last year the joke became that they finally replaced Phil entirely. Its just lighthearted silliness.,radiohead,detfnmj,13,t5_2r3p6

11152625,0,t3_5z5yeg,Try some music that isnt as well known there is a great Indie Dream Pop band from Brooklyn The Antlers who have  albums as a group  as a solo act but the past stays in the past Hospice Burst Apart and Familiars. All of them are really great records and they are the kind of band where like Radiohead when a song clicks it really clicks and you are hooked. Burst Apart even has a pretty decent Radiohead influence. Another band from Australia King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are a Psych RockGarage Rock mix who came out with an album Nonagon Infinity the whole album loops into itself so its never ending technically the last song goes right into the first and the first goes right into the second so on and so forth. Its pretty mental when you hear it and its kind of batshit crazy but in a good way.There are a lot of good bands that while they may not come anywhere near close to Radiohead The Antlers are a big favorite of mine just look around find the era of Radiohead you like the most King Gizzard is like if Bodysnatchers met the whole The Bends album and had a child and Ok Computer was somehow thrown in there. The Antlers is liked Ok Computer mixed with the prettiness of the sound textures of songs like Weird Fishes and Reckoner and a little Kid A mixed in maybe...sort of. But yeah find the era of Radiohead you like the most and what genre or subgenre they played with and look into bands that might be in that genre like with The King of Limbs being more of an electronic route and Ok Computer being more of an indie rockalt rock route. But look around man and you might find something that really surprises you and I hope you find that peace.,radiohead,dew4zgk,1,t5_2r3p6

11216332,0,t3_600xt1,The first song I heard from them was probably Karma Police in January of last year I really liked it but never came back to give them a more in depth listen. Then Burn The Witch and Daydreaming came out they were on repeat in every music player I used but again never had the time to listen to the rest of their stuff. But when I listened to AMSP for the first time in August I was completely speechless it was not like anything I had heard before it was a magical experience from start to finish and at that moment I knew that I needed to get into them. Then I listened to OK Computer in the end I was almost in tears because of how magical that album was. Then came Kid A followed by In Rainbows The Bends Hail To The Thief The King Of Limbs my favorite from them though it took about two listens to click Amnesiac and... that one. In a matter of weeks they became my favourite band I was really obsessed with them and I still am today honestly.,radiohead,df3cvxk,1,t5_2r3p6

11684511,0,t1_dgkeuqq,Good to know that. If you think about it that way yes Thom is the conductor. But in reality they are all music composers. The members contribute their very own abilities to the band. As someone who listens to a lot of different genres jazz blues rock alternative pop funk hip hop electronic and much more I really feel the urge to tell people that the band is something you can only get in every a thousand years lol.

11742509,0,t1_dgqtz6b,Scatterbrain is a great composition and one of the ones I was most looking forward to after hearing the first live bootlegs in . I love the descending guitar figure that never lands at any tonal center. I just found the final record too plain and flat for my taste and think it would have been better served by a different era of the band when they were more patient and clever with arrangements. The style of HTTT is a blunt instrument that works really well with some songs  the singles and A Wolf at the Door  but not as well with others. If in some alternate reality theyd recorded it for the Kid A sessions or shelved it until AMSP I think the results would have resonated with me more.,radiohead,dgr1khy,1,t5_2r3p6

The doors to the venue were open though because they were still setting up so my friend and I wandered in and the band was soundchecking.  We ordered a few beers and sat down before security came over to kick us out.  Bradford told them it was cool and to let us stay.  So we sat there with shiteating grins on our faces it was literally just us Deerhunter and two bartenders in the place!  And to top it off Bradford signed our copies of Halcyon Digest midsong during the actual show!,radiohead,dgx1995,1,t5_2r3p6
