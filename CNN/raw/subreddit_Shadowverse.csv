Although I really dont see why cards like Fairy Circle cant simply have tiny fairies in a circle rather than one fairy thats focused on the art... You know what quests my sister rerolls the most when she plays Hearthstone? The play  win  coin quests. She almost always keeps the Deal X damage to heroes Use X Spells or Kill X minions. She would rather take  coins less simply because she finds those quests more enjoyable. I personally keep the higherrewarding quests but I dont know if casuals even like doing longer quests. They usually want to be done with the game in half an hour. ..Youre comparing cards in adventures for Hearthstone that came out quite some time later. Imagine you just started playing Shadowverse a year later. There will be  packs given Cygames wanted a new expansion every three months. Would you feel the same as in Hearthstone with all these different choices? As for base cards I agree.

The problem is that the opp doesnt get a chance to respond before their board is wiped and they take heavy damage.

9389902,0,t3_597c3t,I think your first two points are largely negated by the existence of Evolve which both gives you more options and is difficult to decide when to use sometimes. ampnbsp I think  board slots can actually make things more difficult as plenty of times you really wish you had  but cant play out everything you want on a turn. This adds more decisionmaking and means you cant just reach a critical mass of card advantage and then puke your hand out and win because your opponent doesnt have AoE. ampnbsp Fatigue does add complexity to the game in a sense but I dont really see how not having it reduces the complexity of the game. The game is not designed to go until a player has decked themselves and really trying not to deck yourself can be just as complex with some decks as trying to calculate fatigue damage in Hearthstone. The extra element to consider in control matches is not over drawing rather than how much you can safely overdraw without dying to fatigue. ampnbspFor the high skill cap cards point honestly I dont know how you can have this opinion. You named basically the only legend in Hearthstone that requires any kind of skill to play around or with Sylvanas but I dont think there are that many more like her. In this game you have much harder to use and complex cards in general just look at Forest and Blood legends and epics if you want some examples. ampnbspThe noninteractive cards and decks thing is just a disagreement we will have. Most people from card games that existed before Hearthstone dont share the views of Blizzard and the HS community that mechanics that involve face damage things that are difficult to interact with and combos in general are bad. We come from games where you are expected to learn the limited ways you can interact with these strategies do so as best you can and accept your loss if your deck wasnt favored and they managed to draw well. I admit that playing against this kind of thing can be aggravating but I dont think that is a good argument for removing it from the game. I think playing the decks yourself later to see that they are not as unstoppable as they can seem helps as does considering the fact that having these decks in the game allows for more design space when it comes to slow broken control effects. Hearthstone is a perfect example in that they have never given Control decks good enough options because if they ended up with a true Control meta where aggro was pushed out by antiAggro tools they would have no decks to check the hard Control like DS and PtP do. ,Shadowverse,d968j11,9,t5_3c35m

9412289,0,t3_59je45,My experience is from  Arena wins in HS and been playing Shadowverse for a few weeks managing to consistently get  and achieved   times already.To start I dont want to make any definitive tier lists. From my  s Ive gotten  three times with Dragoncraft  with Haven  with Rune  with Shadow and  with sword. Ill post some of the deck lists below. out of ten if you are offered Dark Angel Olivia take it. Unless you plan to curve really low and aggressively Olivia can often win the game on her own.I would recommend picking Dragon first since it has the best resources in terms of removal and late game grinding minions. Its the closest to Mage from Arena. Their early game is meh but enough dragon warriors can make it  easy.Rune is really reliant on a good draft and Id recommend drafting towards an Earth rite deck instead of spellboost. Cards like red hot ritual and Remi Rami Witchy Duo are premium.Haven is easier to draft well since its less combo heavy. Beastcall aria pinion prayer and sacred plea are great. Blackened Scripture is premium early removal and can be used on later minions with effective trading. Themis Decree is also a card that can punish overextending.Sword is a more tempo reliant deck. Buffing and swarming then keeping board control. Doesnt play that well in a grindy long game.Shadow is pretty much like dragon but better tempo cards with enough shadows. Drafting even one Mordecai means you can beat pretty much any control deck. However it lacks the same draw power and removal spells. Last two is Fairy and Blood. Theyre much better in constructed imo but I may get  with them soon enough. Just always keep in mind Bloods premium aoe spell Revelation. You cant ever overextend. ,Shadowverse,d992nls,4,t5_3c35m

Your actual win condition is DShifts then you just use FampG instead of Flame Destroyers to rub it in.ampnbspThat being said Ive been experimenting with FampG myself today. There is a lot of removal in everyones decks sadly so its hard to get them off under normal circumstances. And with current Aggro meta you can lose before getting serious.I tried Dragon and Haven decks ran mostly wards and draw cards PleaCounsel DogmaOracle Ding Dong Decryption cards that give Defense like Cloud Chorus and some removal. In Dragon I made use of the PP givers Oracle Aiela and Phoenix Roost while as Haven I used Shrine Maiden.You could also try Forest Liza and Sword Shadowed but I felt there is not enough cards to cycle your deck and the craft gimmicks dont really suit FampG.

Normally Altered Fate enables you quite a bit of consistency in getting  shadows especially if you can just crap fairies into your hand.

9740977,0,t1_dadqm4u,No you should not get double the gold. You already get  gold by getting  win and also get a pack which is worth  gold whether or not you think it is worth that much. You do not need to accumulate gold to buy packs. Look at it this way if you get  win you get like  worth of gold and if you get  win thats like  world of gold. It is NOT a free pack that you gotten in the end of arena. It is a pack worth  gold that is not redeemable in any other way except getting the cards. I got  win like  out of  times and thats really good value. Your gold is suppose to run out. Why should playing the game free of charge be  sustainable? Want more packs? Give Cygame money. You are not losing gold in arena at ALL. Its a nice way to rewards good players to buy packs at cheaper price. Each pack ticket you gotten is worth  gold.

For the last few weeks however Rose Forest was declining in both popularity and win rate as well hence the decision to remove it. As for Silver Forest it saw too little play for us to properly judge its strength.As for Purgatory Forest we were considering to move it to Tier  judging on its performance lately. However after some discussion we decided against it for now. We believed that it is a really strong deck but very skillintensive and easily misplayed at the same time.

Imo at master rank a good ramp dragon deck updated with enough Fafnir odins Genesis Olivia and lucifer can beat a lot of the top tier decks consistently. The problem the deck has is because of how late game orientated it is a lot of the time your hand is auto concede because of too many late game cards . However Im currently doing decent with ramp dragon in ladder  I know a few people who made masters with ramp dragon. Its not easy  and aggro dragon is a lot more brainless to climb with but ramp dragon is not as bad as people make out .

You were clear on what you were steering away from and had an idea on what cards you did like. This should have easily given you enough room to go for a budget deck and an expensive deck.Its okay if you dont want to commit on certain legendaries and be stuck with a deck you dont necessary like but most likely you know if you like to go aggro control etc.... why not just play Take Two? This kills off the vial agonizing gives you a variety of different decks guarantees you  neutral cards and  goldlegendary uses  cards and will increase the range of the usefulness of well ... every card.

10053924,0,t1_dbi1m83,Well the level of ramp is fairly good already so I wouldnt add extra ramp. If we make the ramp any faster it might be broken.I would like more early to mid game potential. A few things I would like are A  cost class neutral card that has ward and cant be targeted by spells or effects. maybe a  in terms of stats. Ramp dragon tends to lack the many defensive abilities other classes have and I feel like this would be a great help to it. Also if we make this class neutral slower decks may be able to make use of it as well. Originally I wanted it as a  drop  with the same effect but that would be way too strong. Some sort of spell delay. Either a monster or card that causes everything in your opponents hand to cost  more. Not sure the cost for it though. The cost would be the trickiest part to balance if a cost like that ever comes into existence for this game. Another tricky one but Id like a more reliable low cost card draw. I just feel that dragons card draw for early game is just a bit too weak unless youre playing rush or discard.I probably have more that I want but these are the general ones I can think of at the moment.,Shadowverse,dbi1uhs,1,t5_3c35m

10105264,0,t1_dbo5mnk,This is why I think D Shift needs to go. Its just not fun for everyone involvedthe D Shift player loses most of their games against certain archetypes wins most of their games against others et cetera. Its not interesting to start a game and almost always know the outcome just based on deck composition. Certainly all card games have bad and good matchups but D Shift is really in a whole other category.Seraph and plenty of other control decks like Satan have a similar concept but they are far more interactible. With Seraph you always have at least one turn to banish or otherwise deal with it. With D Shift the moment they hit  or  mana the game is just over.And thats to say nothing of the card design space... its been said before but Ill say it again right now cards that cost  or more mana are essentially out of the meta. All the cards in the new expansion that cost a lot of mana will see very little play because D Shift. As long as D Shift exists in its current form there will be a massive slew of potential cards that they either cant put in the game or put in the game knowing they will see no play.,Shadowverse,dboq7dw,2,t5_3c35m

Imperial Dragoon is a strong waveclear  face damage at the cost of your hand very good as a finisher.DE Standard has Forte which is a very good card for face dragon. Or dragon in general really. Its a legendary though so dont count on getting it too much.Im not sure which pack Wyvern is in but that card is a huge upgrade  to any dragoncraft deck. Cost reduction on a costheavy deck.

10261479,0,t1_dc73xh9,Most Hearthstone Arena players solved this a long time ago by generally ignoring card synergy and drafting based on a cards tier score and filling out the curve.

10262125,0,t3_5myckb,Thats the list I found for a few. One of which I made and it isnt bad IMO. ,Shadowverse,dc79nds,1,t5_3c35m
10262214,0,t3_5my4sw,This deck is definitely slower than aggro bat. This deck ultimately revolves around low cost officers and commanders but it requires a good curve on hand. Many times the officer buffs cannot be activated as the board is only consist of commanders or the officers has been traded away already. It also lack the reach of aggro bat decks as it does not have direct damage outside of Dance of Death. Against aggro bat you constantly have to trade into vaniaveight and even yurius too or else you will lose first before you can kill them.As for Daria Levipiercing rune can easily clear your board on turn  and it is not uncommon for daria decks to summon some craig clarke golems witchlette and oglers at turn  which can trade into you quite favourably. And unlike daria decks which have a plan B if they dont draw daria at all the game is pretty much over after turn  or whenever you used up your evo points. Haven is also another very bad match up especially with heals wards like temple defender and cards like cudgel or even tribunal to get rid of your board. Overall I feel that the deck is just too inconsistent as you would require the right commander officer pairings at the correct cost curve and the officers you put down wont be taken out before the the commander can come in. Sure when you had a good draw and favourable matchup you can win by turn  easily but thats uncommonor am I unlucky when I played this deck. ,Shadowverse,dc7a0gj,39,t5_3c35m

Was experimenting with similar and quite often it had some bricky hands where you are forced to play some sub optimal playscursed on  risk walking into a decreecalamnitywill of the forestconflag. Evolving cursed and not trading gets past dragon aoe but most of the other non target removals can shut down the combo if you arent careful.I still have a lovehate relation with maid servant. The lack of stats really can bite you in the ass in the more common match up though she is your consistency here with goblin mages. On the fence on alwidas command in this particular build. On one hand you want to focus on the combo around  to set up which means it often sits in hand. If drawn early. However it provides good value represents  damage with cursed on field though not that efficient in dmgcost and if you dont have the general its a decent play. I may drop it to  and run more infiltratorssnipper. ,Shadowverse,dchjn9j,2,t5_3c35m

10419346,0,t3_5p7rrb,I dont get all this complaint against Levi. This is a class specific card so its powers are adjusted to how that class works overall. The only Runecraft players that will evolve him just for the pp spell are the ones spellboosting andor playing aggro. A lot of other classes have cards that are always played with an evolve the moment there is a deck that it will fit you will see everyone running it and people will complain if the deck has over  winrate. What about Floral Fencer and its two follower spawn that will be boosted by Royal Banner? What about Priest of the Cudgel that can erase a follower negating its Last Words which are crucial in decks that play them and hitdestroy another? Also Crimson Sorcery is often used as a control spell probably only Daria decks will face it every time so compare it with other classes that have great aggro decks that can win in turn  like Blood.Runecraft was needing another deck style because Earth Rite was bottom tier and it is still not a tier  deck so if you want this card nerfed everyone will be playing DShift again and the class will fall to oblivion if everyone just play aggro decks against it. ,Shadowverse,dcp3nrr,5,t5_3c35m

10446346,0,t1_dcs570p,Theres a lot of nuances that go into playing control well  Im sure Ill miss a ton of them but Ill try to go over some tips real quick. Well its very important that you mulligan for a  drop that isnt Maid Leader. You need to establish board presence and control it for nearly the whole game  if you can force a face deck to trade with you then youre doing a good job. With all of the crazy aggressive decks out right now its easy to fall a bit behind which is why setting up good Cyclone Blades is mandatory  you can easily clear a Daria board especially if you got a  cost Gelt from Amelia and have an evolution point. I always say to myself please play your entire hand  and cheer because they usually do and get heavily punished. With that said its also pretty important to not go allin unless you know for sure you cant get blown out or its necessary to win...hold back some low cost cards like Blitz Lancer or White Paladin so you can play a dude and Cyclone Blade in the same turn if shit hits the fan. Playing all of your lowcost dudes into a boardwipe can mean an instant loss  especially against Haven.Monika is really great when you have to go first as shell usually give you board control back on turn  when you can evolve. Albert Fangblade Slayer and Alwinas Command are great finishers that also can help clear the board if needed. I love Fangblading a Underworld Watchman Khawy for the win since they take the damage and die before his effect happens.Theres also some match dependent things like I almost never mulligan my single Odin when playing against Seraph since its the only way to banish in the deck.If you look here youll see that  of my wins were against Runecraft all playing Daria of course so the deck does very well against it it can still obv draw the nuts like any other deck. Like I said I think the hardest matchups are Seraph and Nep.I hope that helps a little  best of luck it may take some time getting used to matches usually last until turn  its def my favorite deck and completely crushes for now...hopefully continues to do so as I continue up to AA. haha,Shadowverse,dcs6hve,1,t5_3c35m

10477702,0,t3_5pz9v2,I actually have a midrangey face build that abuses ambush mechanics since I noticed Tempo Rune doesnt usually run AOE so it doesnt have any way to deal with ambushed followers.On top of that RoB introduced cards that while not explicitly designed with Ambush decks in mind benefit a lot from having Ambush in the deck. Such cards include Hamsa use with Shadowed Assassin to try and force an unfavorable board clear or just hit face with supercharged duck if they dont respect Monika having sticky ambush followers on the board means a stronger evolve effect and Cyclone Blade drop an ambush follower to greatly increase the chance of being able to use blade on turn .I tried Koga but I found her to be a bit too slow with all the AggroTempo around right now so I actually prefer Ninja Master. Turn  Ninja Master  Turn  Albert is  damage reach  if you have a QuickbladerMentors to fill out the curve with evolve which is only  less than the infamous Cerberus  Phantom Howl combo and unlike Aggro Shadow Sword actually the ability to search for the cards needed to pull off the combo Maid Leader Avant Blader Conscription,Shadowverse,dcvr87a,1,t5_3c35m

I personally consider Olivia among the best neutral Legendaries along with Odin. Bahamut sees play with Ramp Dragon and a lot of Control decks like Control Blood as a wincondition. Pascale will only see play in EarthRite decks which are in a semimeta state i.e. their popularity really depends on which rank youre in and even in EarthRite Pascale doesnt see an incredible amount of play. ,Shadowverse,dcwqyjr,2,t5_3c35m

The problem comes into play when Aggro is so powerful that it beats every other deck by more than a  average Win Rate.gtIs it that way currently in SV? Not really but its pretty darn close. Only because Daria Rune is so prevalent that it crushes most other decks that would in turn average out Aggro so people arent playing them as often.gtIf Aggro wasnt allowed then decks like Earth Rite Control Sword or similar would completely dominate the game and youd have  turn matches on a regular basis instead of it being fairly rare.My thoughts on Aggro.

10544393,0,t3_5qzf78,Since you mention Tournaments heres data from the most recent and by far the biggest RoB tournament which ended just yesterday. I posted this another thread so Im just going to copy it overgtPie chart shows class usage breakdown yellow is runegtTop  playersfinalists from  entrants and their choice of  classesgtYou can see all the decklists by clicking the leader icons but conservatively  of the rune players are running Daria. As for master ladder? The analytics are up at shadowlog and have been posted in the weekly meta threads but Daria has obviously topped usage usually by around double that of the second most popular deck and retained a toptier though not absurd winrate. I think the ladder stats are borderline  it simply describes a very good deck that happens to be highly accessible but I wont call the numbers gameruining. The tournament data tells a slightly different story  there is an absolutely clear candidate for best deck to take to a tournament and the tournament meta is badly warped by it. Can the meta correct itself? Maybe. The next instalment of JCG is not far away and therell be more data then. But Im definitely expecting them to be paying attention by now. gt The dev team is made up of MTG pros one of them being a former world champion. So their knowledge of card design and such is much greater than most if not everyone here. So yes they knew what they were doing when they created the card there is a reason why the stats and effect are as they are.Devs are not infallible no matter how experienced they are though I definitely agree that they know what they are doing more than the vast majority of players. MtG itself has no shortage of terrible and broken cards that required heavyhanded fixing after they have been released. ,Shadowverse,dd3bp0k,10,t5_3c35m

10598316,0,t1_dd94qcd,The main control decks in the game are Sword Blood and Haven.    Blood Control is really strong when you learn how to play it properly. It is a doubleedged sword Vengeance is a mechanic for Bloodcraft that activates at hp but its effects are very potent.    Sword Control mostly uses big wards like Frontguard General along with many other controlesc cards with RushStorm Charge like Blitz Lancer and Jeno.    Havencraft is the most controlesc craft in the game. They have the best removal overall with Priest of the Cudgel Sledgehammer Exorcist Themis Decree Blackened Scripture etc. Also they have the strongest healing in the game overall. If you like Slow Control decks Haven is probably one you could take a look at.    There are a few others Rune is supposed to play like a Control deck but it has a Hybrid deck Dimension Shift ControlCombo and a GrindControl deck EarthRite. Only problem with these two is that the former isnt consistent and the latter doesnt have a true method to win the game. It just grinds into submission.,Shadowverse,dd94v6j,1,t5_3c35m

10608312,0,t3_5rtqbb,Ive probably spent around  on expansions and adventures in HS. I really did love the game. I have  kids so its hard for me to really sit down and play mobas or any other game really but I can play mobile CCGs on a tablet or phone. Thats what drew me in. I still can enjoy the game but I cant stand facing the same exact decks every other game. Its not fun. I have a huge collection and will maybe go back if they decide to fix the game but Im not holding my breath. I was starting to lose hope with this game as well because of Daria but Ive been seeing that deck way less lately for some reason. Which is fine by my. I seem to have the worst luck when it comes to RNG in these games minus draw luck so I really can appreciate their effort in keeping it to a minimum. A lot of games still come down to who drew better and curves out better but I feel skill is still an important factor here. Who can manage resources better bluffing counting damage in aggrocombo decks like roach etc. its definitely fun  month in. Im not even a huge fan of the artwork of the game. Its what took me so long to try it but I love the game mechanics and cards to overlook it. Im definitely here to stay now.

I would not rate vanilla card like Island Whale that highly since there are many ways of dealing with a big fat body in the arena now. Draconic Fervor effect is nice but at pp many times it is too slow and can be a dead card in your deck. Ethica evolve effect is pretty terrible and she can be dead draw late game. Pyroxene is value card but unreliable since its last word need to proc and discard  cards can screw up your gameplan pretty badly.   ,Shadowverse,ddbdmad,3,t5_3c35m

10663853,0,t3_5skz1e,Personally I prefer running Spartoi Solider and Healing Angel at  and dropping s entirely. The s have a higher power ceiling but most of them need to be combod with other cards to get there and theyre just really slow in general. The s are better for just surviving the early game which is all they really need to do since Nephthys gives you a nighunbeatable late game assuming your opponent isnt playing DShift or Seraph. Also I prefer Spartoi Sergeant to Lurching Corpse since its more consistently able to trade early game and helps guarantee you can play Deaths Breath with necromancy on . Also whenever I Nephthys against a board of one big minion with Corpse in my deck it seems to always take the kill instead of Khawy so I cant heal. Other than that Id play the third Tempest and find room for some Undying Resentments probably over at least one Pact having your removal up a turn earlier is a big help against aggro.

10700921,0,t3_5t1t05,To answer yor question yes. Your examples of Olivia and Sea Queen Otohime were merely efficient followers.I would have expected something more oppressive to be concerning. Specifically your followers getting removed every turn preventing you from progressing but it sounds like you have board and at least a lead so thats not been an issue.Also forest has a lot of smaller followers meaning during the early part of the game youre most likely able to play your early drops without much of an issue. Naturally this could lead your offense to die down a bit during the mid and late game where Otohime a strong mid game follower and Olivia great late in an even matchup to turn around the situation happen to shine.These two cards in particular can get value of  for  where they use  card to get similar value to two of your cards.

10708134,0,t1_ddjomif,gt and for that to happen this game needs wider appeal.We want the Skyrim audience! DDDScrew that. Every game Ive been involved with has generally become worse the more popular its become. The more niche a game is the less pandering it has to whore itself out with. Then again niche games are also harder to earn money with so theres a balance to be had for sure.gtif you look on other CCG subs like Hearthstone every time SV is mentioned there are always people talking about how the art is a turn off for them which bums me out because theyre missing out on a great game.Their loss. If theyre like that then I dont want them here.gtObviously its anecdotal evidence but when you continue to see different people say the same thing over and over again youve got to accept that it is a limiting factor for the games growth.The problem is that the very SAME stuff might be the reason why a lot of players got here in the first place. It was certainly a factor for me. Ive never even played HS because it looked boring as fuck but I gave SV a spin because of the art and here we are. Tone it down and it becomes just like its competitors.gtIt is however probably the reason this games playerbase is almost  late teens to mid s and male again anecdotal evidence and that needs to change if this game wants to take off in any way.Right the same audience that most enjoys video games also enjoys this video game. Amazing.Look if SV has to pander to the god damn FACEBOOK audience is order to grow then Id rather it just not grow at all.,Shadowverse,ddkgpn7,2,t5_3c35m

As far as my experience goes Daria Dshift play daria the turn Dshift is played hoping to draw spellboosted Oglers and blade mages which adds the sometimes lucky element to the deck.

Each time you build a deck you should ask yourself how you plan to win.Even DShift isnt solitaire. They have to interact with you to stall the game long enough to pull off their combo. Your plan obviously is to end the game before that happens. If thats not interactive enough for you then I dont actually know what you expect from the game.Different archetypes will have different strengths and weaknesses. Thats normal and desirable.

It seems that you played hearthstone before. That is truly a game that embodies your statement. To go from hs to sv and not notice a difference means one of  things. You played story mode only. You have an exceptional propensity one may even say a talent for being bad at card gamesCountering your opponents win condition can come in many forms beyond the simple odingtseraph. When you play seraph into dshift you avoid building an unnecessary board to make targeted spells become unusable for spellboosting. Against control blood some decks want to bring them to  defense so they wont be in vengeance after dire bond heal and the blood player would be low enough to burst down but too healthy for the reduced cost diabolic drain or revelation. In sv the success of your own win condition can be greatly influenced by how your opponent plays and this is not so much the case in hs.When you talk about card games being psychological warfare you arent exactly wrong but you do contradict your earlier argument. It feels like you wrote this while forgetting everything you already wrote every few minutes.Yes reaching your own win con is always your ultimate goal in any card game. You never win by making yourself not lose you win by... winning. However the way you talk about preventing your opponents win con being secondary is somewhat questionable. To be real technical about it nothing in a card game can ever be more important than reaching your own win con. The issue is that oftentimes playing to your win con directly involves preventing the opponent win con. Its almost as if control as an archetype focuses on this idea.Im assuming you were originally responding to some shitter who thought dshift was op. You have the right starting point that dshift is not op but your arguments dont really go the right way. Dshift isnt supposed to not have counterplay. The problem with dshift is that once the opponent knows what the general counterplay is there is almost no turntoturn thinking for them. Usually the counterplay to dshift is to just smorc which doesnt require thought outside of who to evo so removing my board is harder. If you are playing seraph and your plan is to play no unnecessary cards on board there is even less thought involved. And for something like control shadow you want to get your wards out before they can combo. For dshift the counterplay is simple on a turn by turn basis once you know what it is but for most other decks that is not the case.,Shadowverse,ddpcd2h,3,t5_3c35m
10756433,0,t3_5tus4n,Honestly it looks like you havent ever played Hearthstone because Ive never seen those pics in Valeera or Night Elf pics in Hearthstone at all. As far as why people complain about the art style in Shadowverse its because the card art is far more prominent. When you evolve a card its enlarged along with the character portrait so you can very easily see the cards. Not to mention that the voices are very very lolilike. Im mainly playing on English but Ive heard the Japanese version as well so I know quite well how animeish it feels. Next look at the meta decks in both games. Hearthstone has some fanservice cards but they are hardly ever used. The only one I remember is secret keeper but you wont even notice that unless you enlarge it which is always done in Shadowverse thanks to evolving.. A lot of the decks in Shadowverse are nearly  in terms of female  male plus monsters. Forestcraft is almost all entirely female cards. Those are most that I think the complainers have. Maybe possible that people first notice only two males as the starting characters which is hardly a thing around here as well.,Shadowverse,ddpg1rq,1,t5_3c35m

10858614,0,t1_ddzzb3s,definitely reroll. First if you only got  legends from the  or so packs you got unlucky. Second these legends are the type that require lots of other cards to be good. Mary is good but is played in control blood which requires quite a few other cards. White wolf is only viable in one deck silver bolt pretty expensive. Eidolon could be included in seraph decks but you dont have seraph. And Alex is okay found in control sword but not the best legend.,Shadowverse,ddzzmru,1,t5_3c35m
10860829,0,t3_5v95z1,Looking over these nerfs... it seems that tempo forest may replace aggrocombo roach in tier . If roach has to cut all its  drops to retain tutoring consistency its ability to create earlygame chip damage will be all but gone as are its chances of dropping a large Elf on curve and its ability to fuel roach with tokens. Its a nowin situation either the deck gives up the consistency with which it can tutor its wincon or it gives up tokens that the rest of the deck needs in order to work.I dont think the Piercing nerf will actually accomplish very much. It makes tempo rune unable to Crimson in the same turn if theyre going second but Crimson is still in hand and can be played the following turn so the only loss for rune is in terms of immediate board control. Unless the rune players opponent had actually played on curve every single turn up till then to get three followers out and somehow not have lost any one of them there is no tangible difference in how much tempo the pre and postnerf Piercing allows the rune player to influence.If anything this nerf has a more noticeable impact for Dshift for whom the amount of total mana saved via the spellboost provided by a pp Piercing is reduced.,Shadowverse,de07uqq,22,t5_3c35m

Upping the cost to  means that it cant be combod with Levi on  while turn  plays will often be unaffected. It can make turn  Daria less common and also decrease the gap in winrate between going st and going nd with Daria.

11043411,0,t3_5xomj3,. Most people have skullfane in auto dust so few own it. Eidolion didnt make a big splash so that didnt get crafted by many. . It is a big gamble vs aggro. It is easy to draw all acceleration or all amulets. It makes it easy to brick vs fast decks. . The big swings come later than they should. Eidolion starts on turn  with investing a dead turn  and skullfane is on . This means your big swings are slow compared to most midrange decks. AKA  it stabilizes late.All this doesnt mean it is trash. Actually I think it is plausible but may need to inch closer to storm haven. I havent experimented with it for a while but it is an interesting concept. ,Shadowverse,dejr22n,3,t5_3c35m

11079692,0,t3_5y7a6z,Well thats one way to buff Suicide Blood as a playstyle. Curves perfectly with Devil of Vengeance too.There is one significant advantage that makes it a better activator than Soul Dealer though. Its a card that remains useful even in late game since it seems to only cut health if you are above . If you are already in Vengeance its basically  cards and a follower with no strings attached. Makes it quite excellent for Control Blood too since you can blast yourself with Dire Bond and play this afterwards to gain a ton of cards.,Shadowverse,denvfvv,1,t5_3c35m

Then this expansion they basically forgot about Discard and have printed a bunch of nonsense cards that dont really fit anywhere and are complete trash live the egg and orca summoner from the mana costs and effects you get the impression they think dragon always has  more mana than the opponent and time to rush face for lethal.

11174913,0,t3_5zjh5z,gtbut I just feel as if a meta dominated by control isnt healthy for the game. I know you people will cry Dshift! and I will agree that it will keep control in check for the most part but Dshift can only do so much because aggro exists and we all know if Dshift becomes too popular aggro will rise up and squash it then control will come back up.You are saying that Aggro decks might die off and Control will dominate and yet you also say that D Shift is going to counterbalance the meta so that Control decks do NOT always dominate and Aggro can be viable.So... what seems to be the issue? That seems like a counterbalancing triangle of archetypes which has sustained formats since Ophidian beat Combo beat Sligh beat Ophidian.Control decks are already expensive. Keeping up with new expansions every  months in a nonrotating nonbanning game is already expensive. The fact that TotG may inflate the costs of certain kinds of decks is merely a symptom of a larger issue which is that the more cards in the pool the harder for a new player to keep up.

But it sounds like you wanna try sword and unfortunately you did not manage to open any sword legendaries at all which would make going sword a bit more difficult. Also moon almiraj is mainly only used in storm haven which requires at least  more golds garuda but the rest can be filled with bronze and silvers. If you are set on playing sword then I would suggest trying for more rolls to get good sword legendaries like albert or aurelia.

11261670,0,t1_df7x29d,Firstly you argued this is how card games work as in first to draw a subset of cards wins. I disagree. Mabinogi duel another very popular card game has various wincon cards but various counter cards. A card like seraph for instance could be neutralise removed or delayed. Alot of monsters in mabinogi duel are also very powerful with varying effects like clearing the board in one go or dealing direct damage after X turns. At the same time cheaper cards can be used to either delay or counter. Mabinogi duel is more about skill than cards  purely the way the game is. About countering the other opponents play.Old yugioh had a subset of cards where if you draw a certain good hand or draw cards like pot of greed which allows you to draw more cards before your opponent allows you to win purely by strength. Modern yugioh isnt perfect but is much better. They are obviously tweaking it so the game is not about who draws the best cards first but who can play better.Another example is pokemon tcg online where again theres very little win con cards  powerful creatures yes but also ways to deal with them. Theres no creature that will take all your hp  quite the opposite. some pokemon if you allow to be lost will actually cause your opponent to gain slightly more than if they defeated a normallower tier pokemon.Secondly Im saying if you increase hp pool it makes the wincon cards more viable than slowly taking down your opponents hp. As in my example seraph and astaroth would be a player much much closer to victory if you had more hp than someone who is playing monster cards or heck even albert. So if you dont nerf those cards or change their behaviour it shifts it so more players use haven etc. yes  hp is just  more hp and wont exactly be a major game changer but you are giving wincon decks better value compared to aggro decks. That much is certain.,Shadowverse,df8hs64,1,t5_3c35m
11262504,0,t3_60nptx,The general cards Id look at as general use in each class areForestcraft  Ancient Elf should be your top priority.  They are extremely flexible being able to create  on turn  or being able to bounce a lot of card to hand to get your spell count up again.  I would say they are a must build.  After that its a bit of guessing.  If you like aggro or combostyled decks Rhinoceroach is great.  But Id wait until the expansion hits on the th to spend outside of that for Forestcraft as theyre building a huge identity around control and it might shift whats valuable in their set.Swordcraft  Albert as much as I hate his guts I play a control deck so I always have to avoid his  HP kill is brilliant.  Almost impossible to not recommend using him in any deck since hes so flexible.  Outside him Alwidas Command is also nice and useful in many situations.  If youre into midrange or Control Aurelia might be valuable.Runecraft  Timesword Mage Levi is seen in virtually every Runecraft deck.  Extremely useful regardless of situation.  The two Runecraft archetypes have their own major centrepieces Daria Runecraft having well Daria and Dimensional Shift Runecraft having Dimensional Shift.  Or if youre like me and like controlling games but not really winning them craft Professor of Taboos and Calamitous Curse so you can play Earth Rite.  Get to turn  then realize you cant control one more  or  and fold.  Dragoncraft  Um...hard to really recommend much out of Dragoncraft.  They have some nice basic pieces but typically dont agree on the top end.  Breath of the Salamander might be about it.  If youre going to face smash with the set go with Dark Dragoon Forte.  Otherwise they typically borrow Neutral legendary cards to finish out games.  Shadowcraft  Foul Tempest and Deaths Breath are typical control pieces.  If youre going anything midrange Cerberus is incredibly efficient.  Since youre familiar Hearthstone imagine Thalnos levels of flexibility.  If you like a more controlled game Mordecai is fun...again very grindy if youre playing him.  Bloodcraft  Revelation.  One of the best control cards in the game IMO.  Actually if you want to invest lots of vials someday go Bloodcraft control.  Its a lot of fun with your endless heals.  Queen Vampire gets played quite a bit in most decks as well.  If youre going more offensive Vania is great for chipping in  more damage.Havencraft  Themis Decree is in most decks.  The tools to build other decks tend to vary on what youre building after.  Youll find Havencraft has many decks with vastly different lists...it makes it fun to play but also extremely expensive if you want multiple Havencraft decks.  If you enjoy winning by not losing craft Enstatued Seraph.  If you like playing with countdown timers go with Garuda and play Storm Havencraft.  There are a few more deck types but again youre looking at different card sets for each archetype.  Neutral  The must have expensive Neutrals are mostly finishers for crafts which dont have a good one.  Lucifer is an excellent jack of all trades though Id hold back on him until we see how Israfil pans out.  Odin will be a must if you like control.  Hes as painful as Hex...but priced properly.  Youll find youll be using him and Bahamut as top end pieces in many decks so Id keep a copy of each.,Shadowverse,df8l6rl,1,t5_3c35m

11277348,0,t1_dfa9moe,I wasnt arguing that its good. I was the guy who started the its a  mana bellringer meme. But I think it has more of a place in dragon decks than Aina by a long shot. There are justifications for running egg against aggro. Why would you run Aina exactly? The situations where you have a big board and so do they are vanishingly rare. Youre hoping shes a  for  essentially. She has antisynergy with Urd she will be reborn without the fanfare so a . Racing situations with face she might see some utility but I dont think face dragon wants to replace sea dragon with something thats situational. They already have enough storm reach with Sea amp Forte. I think Aina is a good card put into the wrong craft and mana slot she would be ideal in a craft with lots of weenies Sword or Forest though its obvious why those crafts dont need another storm follower.Keep in mind egg was rated  and Aina a . Thats where Im coming from on this I think those ratings are just unbelievable in relation to each other.,Shadowverse,dfa9rlr,1,t5_3c35m

Your list can only comfortable play  bats on   copies if Baphomet is inexplicitly played on  it dies to a  drop or Angel of the Word Another common addition in lists. They are much more likely to have a good opener than you are. Youre forgetting that favourableunfavourable is a win percentage span of   usually. Losing this much consistency means youre not answering their earlygame as often as you should be thus pushing even bloods running an attrition package over the edge into the unfavourable territory.At any point where one of your turn  plays is punished you become down one board tempo that you will never recover with your list Wardrobe goes  for  but Floral exacerbates the issue by being a  in  on the same turn.

11417547,0,t1_dfq5hyv,I used to play physical MTG and spent literally thousands of dollars on it but I dont have the kind of money to throw around anymore nor would I even if I did. Im not going to seriously compare a physical TCG and a videogame CCG though for what should be obvious reasons especially the fact I sold off my Magic Cards and got back over . I mean if you can get everything for free why did you feel the need to spend ? I have all the cards in Magic Duels the FP Magic which has more cards than this game totally for free and thats significantly easier to accomplish than grinding it out in this game would be you cant actually even get all the cards FP in this game anymore but I was never arguing you should be able to.  I dont see a lot of point in arguing this point with you because its pretty clear that you are going to just be stubborn and have your mind made up that CCGs have to be expensive and thats just the way things are. Maybe they make more money on it this way honestly I dont know for a fact and neither can you so I wont bother speculating. Its too early for even Cygames to know what effects this change will have in the long run. I guess the only question I would ask you is why are you so opposed to this game costing less money? If they doubled the drop rates of all the cards do you think Cygames would lose money on it? Are you trying to perform mental gymnastics to justify your own purchase? Im still considering spending money on this game but Im also considering quitting. I just havent made up my mind but still dont know what personal stake you have in this game being expensive. Remember just because a product is more expensive it doesnt mean that a company will always make more money. If they push past economic equilibrium they actually wont make as much profit as they could. ,Shadowverse,dfq614a,1,t5_3c35m

11527982,0,t3_64jr1l,Shadowverse currently is a coin flip depending whatever you go first or second..... You are way more likely to win for just going st and do nothing but face burst. You can win easily for just hitting face along the curve if you go st and lose if you go nd and the enemy gets to play along the curve.DE was the last time the game was considered competitive and fun.What I dont like is that SV is way too autoplay nowadayssince RoB expansion you cant really missplay since the choice so obvious. This wasnt the case with DE meta where you could beat lesser skilled players with PtP and that deck had so many plays and chance to missplay. Now the best top decks are autoplay and I dont have to think at all it feels like everything up to matchups and draws.Also the powercreep is rampant.At this point the game not much more different from Hearthstone,Shadowverse,dg2p5ub,7,t5_3c35m

11646499,0,t1_dgfthvp,Really I wasnt arguing for extreme rules complexity. I believe unique interesting mechanics can be added to the game without the bloat associated with Magics more complex rulings. A lot of the issues in Magic relate to the more complex layers system when there are simultaneous state based effects for example or the stack and timing issues related to the stack will never be a problem in this game. Im not fond of the way you described Yugioh as autistic but whatever. Nonetheless Yugioh is a mess because rules arent often clear and you do have to reference errata. Magic does a much better job because its very rare that games actually get held up because of quibbling over rules as long as you have two experienced competent players. Obviously the learning curve is steeper in Magic and I dont expect them to implement instants in this game or anything of the sort as that would be a complete radical overhaul of the mechanics. To reiterate I never said that Magic was the superior game I just said I have been impressed with the various interesting set mechanics they have come up with and I would like to see more setwide mechanics in Shadowverse beyond just the basic class identity. If the game doesnt grow beyond that Im afraid I may get bored of it. ,Shadowverse,dgg57mr,2,t5_3c35m

11671578,0,t3_66gjop,I think theres a Neutralcraft deck lurking around the forum somewhere. If I remember correctly its titled Spearcraft. You could use that to do your dailys since you can build it for any faction in the game. If your card pool is limited at the moment I would recommend that you not try to climb unless youre planning to spend money. EDIT If you want score rewards for ranked then its ok if youre losing. Some people purposefully concede to stay at a certain rank. Maybe do that until you think your collection  decks available is ready for higher ranks.,Shadowverse,dgizmj7,1,t5_3c35m
11675569,0,t1_dgjatx3,I did actually try it very early on in my experimenting. For all the decks I try them out in Master Ranked to see how it does. But since it was early on the meta game was pretty unstable and I mightve not have had the most optimized deck so take what I say with a pinch of salt. Out of all the gawain decks I played it had one of the lower winrates next to otk cannon and regular support cannon deck. Against both dragoncraft and shadowcraft giving up a turn to play the standard was often asking for trouble and playing multiples of it chunked up the board. That being said though against certain craftsdecks the  accrued great value overtime and attacking with a  or more enhanced albert was always fun. So its probably not the best of the gawain decks but its alot of fun.,Shadowverse,dgjfxcn,1,t5_3c35m

I play more suicide blood so lately Spiderweb Imp has been the more go to play especially when going second.Although honestly why are you running Spiderweb Imp in aggro blood? I would have more struggles debating on Vania going first pushing for bat damage if not expecting sylvan justice or whole soiled swing or blood wolf assuming no magic missile or pings.,Shadowverse,dgpy0ko,2,t5_3c35m

11734581,0,t1_dgq4qg1,gt is mostly alwidas albert and luminuos mageknight?Yeah it kinda is I rely a lot on having control of the board till a turn where I can do a final burst. Usually around turn  it becomes impossible to hold board anyway eachtar second breath of salamander or whatnot supermega legendary dragon pulled out of his ass. Early damage helps a lot if I manage to bring opponent to  hp by turn  its already a great frontstep but I can see in your case that you need the  hp to force suboptimal play to the opponent. Its just I dont see your deck winning against shadow they have so many good tools to clear and buff board. Demon strike is not a so great spell btw  damage for  mana is veryyy expensive most of the times it means you cant play much else in the turn you try to improve your reach on the opponent. Would have to try your list for a better judgement but the main ideas smorc and aggro seem good in your choices.,Shadowverse,dgq57pj,1,t5_3c35m

11746734,0,t3_67jiss,I recommend dropping the third Neph. You dont really need her since Ledger eating Liches means she ends up being used to pull Mordecai.Id drop Angel of the Word. The extra ping is nifty but she has a poor statline when being played on curve. Try Healing Angel instead for a better curve play and healing.Foul Tempest is a dodgy pick. Its a good tech option for skeletons and forest but not much else. Ledger mostly gets its  shadow by turns  and youd rather use it for Deaths Breath instead. Any later than that and you have Khawy and Mordecai to control with. Its rare that Foul Tempest will be the optimal play.Add an extra Urd. You dont get Ledger all the time but the ol Attendant  Urd combo is still super great at generating momentum.Tech more removals. Neph relies very heavy on removal spells so dont depend on Zombie Party for everything. Hungering Horde tends to be quite helpful for this.,Shadowverse,dgrisut,1,t5_3c35m

11756631,0,t1_dgsm3pu,A lot of tournament regulars are quite open to trying new concepts and deck compositions!  As aegis and grail based decks have rather meh results vs shadow and our various storm haven decks decks still feel too coinflippy your post caught some attention.  If you havent noticed Maki used your deck in the CF vs SN showmatch although we really had time to test it for a couple of games.gt For a master player to have a  winrate means another masterAA player will have a  winrate both are among the extremes.Thats not really how it works thought.  It takes  players with a  winrate in masters to sustain  person having a  winrate.   winrate is a pretty safe estimate for a good player playing a tier  deck imo.Expanding the reward range while lowering some of its attractiveness no longer k gold imo is a good direction.  Those who plays more will have something extra while those who play only a handful of games may still be in range for the k reward.  No longer do people need to grind for  hours a day and hit the k ranges to get to top .,Shadowverse,dgsn6re,1,t5_3c35m

11779899,0,t3_683491,Aggro Necro is really strong but its actually Midrange Necro thats considered the strongest precisely because it often crushes Aggro Necro. Start off the same but then Aggro variants struggle once the opponent starts spamming Deaths Breath.Ramp Dragon win rate isnt actually that amazing as the storm stat people keep ranting about is inflated from user reports. So its natural if you only have around a  win rate. The deck will be very incredible if you get a good ramp curve but is prone to bricking as expected of ramp type decks.Also most factions except Runecraft have decks capable of competing with fairly decent win rates and in Runecrafts case its because Ramp Dragon is one of Darias worst matchups not because Daria cannot compete with most decks anymore. Notable ones include Roach Forest Vengeance Blood Storm Haven and midrange Sword. Also meme frog sword deck also does well against Ramp Dragon!,Shadowverse,dgvaf4g,5,t5_3c35m
