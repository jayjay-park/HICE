5120339,0,t1_cv36ios,All I see from you is incessant whataboutery. I have even linked to a post where someone involved in that discussion group has claimed negative claims about the DPRK are bullshit and all you continue to do is engage in apologism.shruggtWHEN YOU CLAIM I SUPPORT ITNo. Again as you seem to be hard of thinking YOU ARE PART OF A DISCUSSION GROUP THAT SUPPORTS NORTH KOREA AND IGNORES OR MINIMIZES EVIDENCE OF ITS WRONGDOING. YOUR DISCUSSION GROUP IS AS CONTAMINATED BY THE ROSETINTED SPECTACLES OF IDEOLOGY AS ALL THE GROUPS YOU USE ISREACTIONARYBOT TO ELIMINATE FROM YOUR DISCUSSIONS. YOU ARE JUST AS LIKELY AS GROUPS YOU CRITICIZE TO ALLOW YOUR IDEOLOGY TO OVERRIDE OTHER CONCERNS WHEN EXPRESSING AN OPINION.See I can do allcaps too. Cruise control for cool.,TheRealissues,cv36yr0,1,t5_39rpu
