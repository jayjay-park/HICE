Jeeps that have not tend to reach a stage where everything starts to go wrong. That is what happened to mine.Electrical  Does everything work?Top  If it is a soft top has it been put up and down regularly. Mine had not and although it looked in good condition when I got it down for the first time it tore in a few places. Suspension  Has it been heavily offroaded?Drive Train  Is it leaking anywhere?

3661732,0,t3_32b1xb,Get the Mustang. If you dont know why you need a Wrangler you dont need a Wrangler.Edit Let me explain. Wranglers get shitty MPGs and have shitty handling. Once you get big mud tires on them they tend to tram line every groove in the road. They are basically the exact opposite of good aerodynamic design. The ride is bumpy and noisy. They are expensive to start with and get even more expensive once you start building them up and if you arent going to build it up why get one at all?But if you live where there is snow or mud or rocks or other dodgy road conditions they cant be beat. Where I live we typically have three feet of snow on the ground from January to April. If I break down Im at the mercy of someone with a more capable vehicle to come rescue me. I dont like that I want to be the one with the more capable vehicle. I want to be my own first responder. Its just a matter of selfreliance.Jeeps in the sunny suburbs are fine too. People like to build them up as weekend warriors. Nothing wrong with that. But there are a million other awesome cars I would consider before buying a Jeep Id buy a Challenger over a Mustang but thats just Mopar loyalty. So Im here to warn you away from an expensive vehicle whose capabilities you might not need. If you really want one you wont listen to me anyways.,Wrangler,cq9nv2g,9,t5_2u1rr

Aluminum is lighter and unless you go heavy wheeling where aluminum forged wheels can crack if hit too hard like aired down to psi on a rock aluminum will work and open up WAY more variety on style. Steel wheels are super durable however. They can be bent but if youre wheeling that hard I dont know a wheel you can use. If youre doing mudsnow I would go with either a Mud Terrain or AllTerrain. Whether or not you want  wheels is dependent on if you plan to air down your tires before wheeling. Air down to  PSI? . Keep at psi? Whatever your style preference is.,Wrangler,cz7k6gd,2,t5_2u1rr

6770726,0,t3_48goup,The Unlimited has a higher residual than the dr which turns for a lower monthly lease payment. Each FCA business center in the country is designated different programs regarding lease programs and rebates based on their market and based on which vehicles FCA wants to sell more of. FCA has no issues selling Wranglers so there are hardly ever any rebates and never any incentivized lease programs available. If you havent financed a vehicle before and havent established much credit then it might be more difficult getting approved for a lease as they have a higher standard for leasing approval and if you do it might be for a lower tier and your monthly payment is higher due to the standard APR or money factordifferent banks use different forms of calculating interest for a lease.If you are going to modify the Jeep then I would definitely reconsider purchasing vs leasing. Also you should be able to purchase a wear amp tear program that covers up to  or more in vehicle damage if you go offroading and something is messed then youre covered on that up to the predetermined amount when returning the vehicle. Leasing is great for people that want to switch into new vehicles every few years and dont want to worry about any repair costs because they are covered under the factory warranty. Leasing is also great because you dont have to worry about the depreciation as you just return it when your lease ends. If you do lease it and decide to keep it at the end of the lease then you have to reapply for a new loan and if you have had any credit issues before reapplying it could affect you being able to keep your vehicle.I personally would shop for a new Jeep Wrangler vs preowned because they hold their value so well that some preowned Wranglers on the market are almost as much as a new one. A lot of people do not know how to buy cars and make it so much more difficult for themselves by negotiating everything individually. Last thing you want to do is negotiate price for  hours before applying for a loan only to find out either youre not approved or the payment is higher than you anticipated and you leave because it didnt work out. What I would recommend is applying for a loan with your own bank or credit union before car shopping to find out the loan amount youre approved for and what you can afford. With this you can shop around multiple dealers until you find what you want without having to run your credit again with them. If you get preapproved with your bank or credit union for say  and youre comfortable with the monthly payments and know what your payments are based on what your bank told you then you have an idea what to shop for. Once you find the Jeep you want to purchase then you can request the total OTD with taxamplic and dealer doc fees etc. You can request the dealer prints you a purchase order do not sign it to take to your bank and see if they approve you on that specific vehicle. I think invoice pricing on a new Wrangler is extremely aggressive and you can request the dealer show you the invoice. Some dealers might not show it and others might. Every sales person will know that you want the vehicle thats why youre there in the first place and their job is to get you excited about it. Youre going to be excited no matter what so dont be hostile or awkward just ask the questions youre unsure about and put together a deal if its the Jeep you want to buy. Im a manager at a Jeep dealer on the west coast. Happy to answer any questions you have. ,Wrangler,d0jqr85,1,t5_2u1rr

7261980,0,t3_4eod35,To really do a quality . spring lift expect to pay US dollars by the time its all said and done before you get into tires and wheels.  With sales and all that you can save a little here and there.  For lifts there are several good brands and it really depends on your driving style which is best for you.  If you are going to go off road a lot then Rock Krawler and Metal Cloak make some great kits.  If you are going to be on road mostly and want a nicer ride the AEV is pretty good.  For a healthy mix Teraflex is another great choice.  If money is a big hindrance and you just have to have a lift NOW take a look at Ranchos  lift because it comes with some high quality shocks even if the rear is just spacers.  Mopar also just came out with a great  lift but it is not cheap.  No one really makes a  complete lift kit because each Jeep is unique and is built for different things.  When I went with the Teraflex lift on mine I had to add an exhaust spacer a new front track bar and control arm drop brackets.  Regardless of lift manufacturer if you do not replace your control arms get a set of AEV or Rancho control arm drop brackets as it will correct your caster and give you a better ride.I really strongly advise you to wheel it stock first for a long time then let it tell you what it needs.  A stock JK esp a Willys that you are mentioning will go VERY far off road.  When you are ready to buy you can build it up piece by piece.It really seems like Im rambling at this point and if you have any questions about anything in particular just reply and Ill answer there.,Wrangler,d23mwoc,3,t5_2u1rr

7914073,0,t1_d45lwo4,Calm down.. The closest off road park to me is about  hours from me. And most areas that Id be able to go to that arent an offroad park are moderately smooth. I plan on going offroading. A lot. I just cant do it a lot because Im in college. The most the jeep will see for a bit will be small boulders. I got the jeep because me and my dad want to plan trips with his college pals to go off reading at Rausch Creek. I said I wouldnt be going hard off reading. Not that Id be a mall crawler. Im not a fake. I saw the fun people had in their jeeps and thought that I would really enjoy doing that disregarding the paved path and roads. The skid plate is just so that if I do end up encountering a large enough boulder that could cause harm to the underside Im protected. Its not ironic. Its forword thinking. EDIT I mean maybe I dont need the skid plates yet but itd be nice to not worry if I do go out and do some harder offroading. I realize I might not have stated it as best as I could in my one comment. And most offroad areas that I have found so far are just gravel roads with small boulders in the paths so I dont see much pain in just having the additional protection.  Also I realize college isnt really an excuse for not going hard offroading ,Wrangler,d45m7wh,1,t5_2u1rr

That withing itself is a major problem as it can lead to many other malfunctions as well as the constant starter fire.If you can hop under the Jeep on the driver side of the engine block is your starter check on the back of it to see if all wires are good if the negative and positive bolts are rusted or anything and if the plug is connected in between.

It would be much easier to get a nice and even coating with the wheels off but then you need to put in the time and effort to get the wheels off so it is up to you.

11631030,0,t3_65wssb,I bought a  trailmaster. I returned it a couple days later. It was like a  pound tuning fork on the roof. Some people will say you can get rid of the whistling. I couldnt. No matter what trick I used from YouTube or message forums. NOTHING worked. Not tape not rubber inserts not fender trim on the fins not silicone not rubber trim not drilling. Also the wind buffeting at higher speeds was crazy. I couldnt even hold a conversation in the truck while doing  without yelling. I think it really depends on two factors. The brand of light bar and the apillar mounts. When people say they got theirs to stop whistling I dont believe them. Not matter what I did it just changed the pitch and at what speed it occurred at. It had a sound like I was rubbing a giant crystal glass with vinegar. If you are seriously thinking about it. Do yourself a favour and find a guy with one on the truck and go for a ride. Make him prove to you his setup doesnt do it then buy his exact hardware. I wanted good lighting at night. That trailmaster was like  lumens. I fixed my lighting issue by getting two ridgid industrys with a  lumens a piece and mounting to the bumper. Not a sound. ,Wrangler,dgee1jk,1,t5_2u1rr

11687434,0,t3_66rrkn,Honestly go wheel your stock jeep and see where your deficits are and go from there. Recovery gear is always good. A winch will get you out of a lot of situations. Tires are a good investment. You can fit s on a stock suspension and flat fenders mine are factory fenders that I trimmed but will have limited up travel when your swaybar is disconnected. I have a teraflex . coil level kit not the spacers and it is pretty good. I would like a .. lift for my s to be completely happy. I highly recommend the STT Pros. I have the s and they are fantastic on and off road. The price is good too. I got them from Tire Discount Direct for  each delivered to my door. Ive had KM KM MT Baja MTZs. The MT Baja MTZ were the loudest. The KMs were the quietest but really soft rubber and didnt last as long as I thought they would. The KMs were great but I sold that jeep a year after having them and dont know how long they held up. The STT Pros are the second quietest MT tire Ive run and will be getting another set when these wear out. Wheels and tires can easily eat up your budget. Also dont be afraid to give wrenching a shot. There are so many guides and how tos on youtube and jeep forums that you can figure out almost anything with a little diligence. Even a suspension lift can be within your grasp. ,Wrangler,dgksdzc,4,t5_2u1rr
