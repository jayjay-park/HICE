1913172,0,t3_2gjaa2,Very nice especially with the drag and drop interface! Does a great job on a lot of pictures. Its a lot of fun just dragging pictures on it en seeing what is does with them. It doesnt always get important details right but i can see myself using this to quickly get some bits and pieces for composite images.,lowpoly2d,ckjq3kf,1,t5_32146

6831250,0,t3_49agtx,THIS is the right way to use lowpoly! I dislike the normal submission of low poly people because they just take a picture and present it at face value.  The polygons arent used to tell a story but simply to show the image at face value pun intended. The single polygon face the hair the eyelashes are really great. The nose is so simple but works so well.  I love the background image but maybe thats because Im a bit of a sucker for space.  Your image really shows a story keep doing what you do!,lowpoly2d,d0qmfed,3,t5_32146
