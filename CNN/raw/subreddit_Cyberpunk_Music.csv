2107754,0,t3_2j2e9n,Its also intresting that Word of Wikipedia says the movie had some influence on William Gibson when writing Neuromancer but that was more due to the dialogue than the plot.gt Yeah like Escape from New York never made it big but its been redone a billion times as a rock video. I saw that movie by the way when I was starting Burning Chrome and it had a real influence on Neuromancer. I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake You flew the wingfive over Leningrad didnt you? It turns out to be just a throwaway line but for a moment it worked like the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot. Also put John Carpenter and a synthesizer in one room and nothing bad can come out of it.,Cyberpunk_Music,cl7qora,7,t5_2t4qa

3827196,0,t3_3499yo,I honestly think a lot of cyberpunk style music gets it wrong or people mislabel something as cyberpunk when its like...synthwave.the deus ex soundtrack the first deus ex i think does a really nice job. but to outline more examples of my style when it comes to this i present bioxeed  vaccine This song was made for an old hl mod called dystopia which was a cyberpunk FPS. incredibly great for its time. I think it captured the game perfectly. Really helped drive home the vibe that you are infiltrating some evil corp hacking their systems and destroying their business.the progression is just perfect. and importantly it has this dark ambient sound to it. i think thats what really helps define the genre musically. a dark ambient dampb style track. nothing too fast but not super slow either.my second example is NDGO  rdthe lyrics in this song help tremendously it really paints a nice dark story. Again like bioxeed you have this dark ambient backing track with a medium paced drum track.john murphy   days later theme songthis is not cyberpunk but it basically follows the same template. it paints a story of an apocalypse which i think is different than a dystopia. the reason i bring this up though is because there isnt very much that seperates this from being a cyberpunk song. it mostly consists of live instruments which i think drive the apocalypse genre home. change those out for synthetic instruments and change the drum track up a bit and you have cyberpunk. the chord progression and key is the core of what i consider cyberpunk music is essentially the same.pertubator to me is not cyberpunk.another post on this sub which is tactical sekt  siege engine to me is not cyberpunk. thats military industrial EBM which I do like but that is not cyberpunk to me. i outlined these two because they are posted on the sub pertubator gets posted pretty frequently. more importantly TONS of songs get posted here similar to those that just arent what i would consider cyberpunk by any stretch.in fact I dont really consider very much in the industrial genre cyberpunk.so tldr to me cyberpunk music would be something with a nice ambient backing track in a minor key with a slowmedium drumcord progression. thats what helps drive home the whole dystopian theme of cyberpunk when I listen to music related to it. when i listen to something cyberpunk i want the feeling of walking through a city that smells of wet concrete on a foggy night. light posts illuminating the sky every few miles with tall corps lighting the sky above slum apartments surrounding it. something run down opressed. think north korea with technology.,Cyberpunk_Music,cqsj6cs,13,t5_2t4qa

11081742,0,t3_5xmtwu,For me its less about the heavy EBM stuff e.g. Front Line Assembly  which sure has its place  and more about any track that evokes a future episode andor the feeling of a future space. These tracks are usually electronic but are not necessarily so. A good example would be Lucretia My Reflection by Sisters of Mercy  a track that isnt electronic but which brings to mind images of sprawling industrial machinery and pipelines a semihostile society in which human desire is difficult to fulfill overcrowded train stations and general angst.The great thing about cyberpunk as a genre is that it dovetails with a number of others. Example postcyberpunk in which the surfaces may be more pristine even as the corruption becomes more abstract or dystopian literature where the dysfunction of a cyberpunk society is emphasized. Similarly the same can be said of the stylistic range of what qualifies to me as a cyberpunk track. Perhaps some sinspired new retro wave  synthwave  outrun brings to mind the selfconscious technologicallyforward attitudes of the cyberpunk stories of the early Gibsons action era whereas something colder and more minimal would be more fitting in a universe like GitSSAC or Moon.What matters most is how a songpiece feels and what it evokes. When it comes to posting in this sub I care way more about the images and feelings I can attach to a song than I do about how obviously the song fits in with the top posts. Consider Leftfields Bilocation  a track I posted early on but which only netted  upvotes. Its difficult for me to imagine a more cyberpunk song vocals which veer between ethereal and synthesized a melodic foundation comprised of a beeping synth and a wash of electronic noise driving the tempo forward. Its not new retro wave no so it may take a bit more imagination. As such imagine a tracking shot through the bowels of a futuristic subway system dance hall or city skyline and youve got your perfect match. Even the title  bilocation  evokes cyberpunk themes as so many questions inspired by the genre focus on the fracturing or displacement of consciousness in those who hack or explore virtual environments control dronesandroids or get recased into artificial bodies. In this last case the producers  Leftfield  are actually doubly relevant because they were some of the pioneers who brought House music to the mainstream in the early s and electronic music and cyberpunk go together like peas and carrots.,Cyberpunk_Music,deo3t70,2,t5_2t4qa
