452881,0,t3_1z61h5,You dont want to go too long without sex because he may lose interest.  Constantly working for a reward that never comes is bad for motivation.  Think about your psych class and the reward system reward every time is how you train a behavior and occasional reward is how you reinforce a behavior.  You train people like you train dogs if you never give the treat the dog will unlearn obedience.I never had any interesting in the feminizationashumiliation thing it seems to take for granted that clothing for women is humiliating because its humiliating to be female.  But if youre in charge of him isnt being female elevating?  Dress for the job you want they say and your panties are worn by you so him wearing them seems to mean that youre letting him dress to be in charge.  If youre the Boss you dont let the underlings sit at your desk you dont let them use your office why let them wear your clothes?I suggest you lock him in a chastity device on Day One with the promise that if he does everything as hes supposed to during the day hell be unlocked at the end and therell be fucking.  Then give him a list of chores that are doable provided he works.  Make sure some of them are personal service to you fix you lunch give you a massage lick you to orgasm.  If he does all of them have enthusiastic fucking in the evening.  After hes all cleaned up lock him up again.  Tell him the day was wonderful and you want tomorrow to be just as good.  In the morning lightly stroke his cock with your fingernails through the bars of the cage or lightly stroke his balls if the device isnt a cage and tell him youre looking forward to unlocking him at the end of the day if he finishes all his chores.  And being locked in a cage solves the constant reminder problem.If youre into spanking just add that to your list of things hes supposed to do.  Take  swats like a man or whatever.  Make him prove hes tough enough to take it and earn your respect.Slowly increase the amount of work hes supposed to be doing and how particular you are about how well hes doing it.  After a few days if you finish the evening with a second massage and pussy licking but you dont let him out of his cage saying Ive enjoyed our fucking but you didnt finish whatever so you dont get unlocked today.  Maybe you can try harder tomorrow hell probably try harder the next day.  Or if you tell him that then tie him to a chair and let him watch while you masturbate with a vibrator and get yourself off.  Did you enjoy the show?  Tomorrow youll get another chance to play instead of watch.  You want to slowly increase the work he does but keep it attainable so he can in theory get the reward if he works harder.And dont limit your imagination here is he in good physical condition or is he flabby?   pushups every day not necessarily in a row could be on your list every hour you make him do pushups.  If he can only do  well he can do more in another hour.  As long as he gets  by the end of the day hes okay.   minutes on stairmaster is another possibility.  If he belongs to you make him get in shape.  Hell buy PX and make him cook all the food and do all the videos.Among older men there are apparently prostate problems if one doesnt ejaculate regularly but you can handle that by tying him down to the bed blindfolding him laying a towel across him and then giving him a handjob and letting go right before he cums.  The idea of the towel and the blindfold is that he gets no feedback he doesnt know how much he came he doesnt feel it its just that he was on the edge of orgasm and then it disappeared into the void.  He wont get any release from this and hell still be horny and eager he probably wont even get soft.  Then you wait until he does get soft clean up and lock him back in his cage.And if he does do really good reward him huge.  If he likes a blowjob and doggystyle and he really pleases you immensely blow him lick him until hes hard again and then get on your hands and knees and let him go to town.  Make sure he really experiences the wonderful rewards that you promise if hes obedience and pleases you so that he really believes in them.  If he stops believing in them  if he stops trusting you  the whole thing falls apart.  Not just your training but possibly your relationship.,FemdomCommunity,cfrqpbe,3,t5_2whne

2409163,0,t3_2myf90,He sounds a lot like me.  Shy submissive but big enough that he can avoid being forced out of his comfort zone.  Basically he is happy enough with the mild dominance you are showing and too shy andor scared to suggest that you push it further.  Also if he is nervous about admitting his kink having a kid in the house probably only makes it that much worse.  I was always nervous about scarring my kid for life.There is always the just ask him approach but honestly a shy guy would much prefer that you take charge and let him say no if it is too much.  I can probably come up with a lot of ideas if I think about it some more but let me suggest one to start off with.Get on top of him reverse cowgirl style with your back towards him.  Grab the neck of his ball sack with one hand and pull the skin of his penis tight assuming he is circumcised.  Ride him that way and with a condom.  . You will have a firm hold of his balls which always makes a sub happy.  . If you hold his balls down he wont be able to move his hips and you will have complete control over the rhythm of the movement.  . By keeping his skin stretched you will lessen his stimulation.  .  If you control the rhythm and pacing you should be able to cum before him.  Of course he might be really turned on my this so maybe not but that would give you the opportunity to talk about the ladies first principle.If you do cum before him you could stop and snuggle making sure the tease his aching cock which might be a good time to ask him how it felt.  Asking a guy after he cums how it felt is unlikely to get you a lot of useful information.,FemdomCommunity,cm9hcdp,2,t5_2whne

I would say that I get much more into it when our kinks line up well and their submission is evident if Im attracted to them even more so. Many subs to visit ProDommes expect their own needs to be catered to and as a paid service that happens but if its not something the Domme is into herself its not going to be the most exciting experience for either of you.I have a small select subs whom I thoroughly enjoy Dominating and playing with. I look forward to every session with them because the experience is focused on what I want which also happens to line up with kinks that they have and I think that is the biggest factor in your overall experience with a ProDomme. ,FemdomCommunity,cxvnjb8,2,t5_2whne

9148467,0,t3_55bl5p,As a single dominant woman actively looking for a partner Id say two things.  First get out to munches especially femdom specific ones and get to know your community even if theres no one compatible at any specific event.  People rotate through and miss some so if you make a habit of going regularly youll meet all kinds of dominant women.  Having friends in the community that arent sexually compatible with you is valuable as well dont just talk to dommes.  Having other submissive male friends can be a great asset.Second as far as okcupid I think the big thing is to answer related questions.  Back when I was on okcupid thats the first place Id look when trying to figure out if someone was submissive.  Its also great because you dont have to out yourself to people who havent answered.  Adding an explanation for clarity can make it even clearer and its still burried in questions that judgy people arent really going to read but potential dommes or at least ones like me definitely will.As a woman any question about sex I put up publicly will absolutely get gross messages andor sexist hate messages so most of my kinkrelated questions are private but a man who answers a lot of targeted questions in a submissive way will appear high on my matches and I will for sure go through and read them especially if they have explanations.Anyway hopefully that wasnt too long windedfull of typos.

That is patently rediculas. Do not try or think about  till you guys can handle an hour.I assume youve talked and listened and are doing your best so absolutely do not be ashamed or apologetic. If you are domming him and he doesnt want it just say fine and walk off.I suspect the problem is in his head and not with you. He either wants something else or he cannot let go to submission. Really therapy or meds or something Wellbutrin helped me open up a ton is in order.My guess is he is not giving in to being a sub. I used to be an insistent little bitch about what She said wore did. I let it all go and am happy Man. I may suggest things via  drooling over a flogger at the toy shop or offering services but thats it.My  cents Give him another chance. Tell him to stfu strip get you a beverage and give you a foot massage. You read or watch TV or whatever. He speaks shush him immediately and dont even look at him this will help him be less self conscious. If he is a whiny bitch and complains of not being into it  send him away. If he is good and if you want he can get more beyond the foot massage oral service to you or flogging or whatever.Best of luck.,FemdomCommunity,dcuwkhh,5,t5_2whne

10612478,0,t1_ddacoww,Thanks for the reply! The transition that you describe makes sense to me and I love the idea of making him participate in the process. Some kind of rigid structure sounds like it would help a LOT. Ill work towards that ifwhen we play outside of our current setting.When you say wrap the limbs separately do you mean wrapping the arms before securing them to the torso as opposed to wrapping the whole torso with arms along his sides? I hadnt thought of this but I imagine it would create a greater sense of restriction so it makes sense.Thanks again ,FemdomCommunity,ddalh1j,2,t5_2whne
10828482,0,t3_5uqsg6,LOL a day.  I miss being .OP youre young so Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt here and just attribute the cluelessness of your approach to your age.  Im going to do you a solid here and tell you something thatll help you find someone a lot faster  its less about I want and more about heres what I can do for you.Of course you want someone to control your orgasms.  So do I.  Were a dime a dozen.You need a way to stand out from the millions of guys all clamoring for a woman to take control of their sexuality.She has to be interested in you in the first place.So what sets you apart?  What can you bring to the table? What can you offer?  And no Im not talking about money.Are you an exceptionally good cook?  Can you prepare a wonderful meal for her?Are you good with cars?  Can you help her keep hers maintained?Im not saying that ALL kinky interactions have to have this titfortat exchange of services arrangement but if youre looking for orgasm control out of the blue instead of as part of an ongoing relationship then yeah you need to sweeten the deal a little bit.  Because the vast majority of women out there arent going to have much interest in a strangers orgasms.Thats who you are to them right now a stranger.  Neutral at best dangerous at worst.You could go the other direction and get to know some kinky women as friends and maybe even start dating one and then explore orgasm denial andor male chastity within that relationship and I personally think that will lead you to greater satisfaction than looking for random play but that also requires a greater investment of time and energy in getting to know people on a one on one basis.  And you have to be fishing in the right pool to start with  the kinky community.What I know wont work is simply posting I want someone to cater to my kinks online.  The only women who will indulge that statement are ProDommes for a price.  And even they wont touch you with a  foot pole if they dont like your approach.  They usually have enough men wanting their services that they can be choosy.so tldr young grasshopper from a slightly older guy who has had his orgasms strictly controlled for two years now by a beautiful gorgeous powerful woman  if youre looking for play with someone you dont know well you need to sweeten the deal with something you can offer in return.  But youd probably find greater fulfillment developing a relationship with a kinky woman willing to explore this sort of thing in an actual ongoing power dynamic.Good luck!,FemdomCommunity,ddwvqpd,14,t5_2whne
10927138,0,t1_de71myl,Theyre basically just a lunch or something meetup designed to help people into the community. You can pretty much always contact the arrangers tell them youre new and ask to be introduced to people. Keep in mind tho these events are in my experience usually in cafes and other vanilla scenarios so dont drop to the floor and expect people to step on you. Meet some people make some friends and attend an event or a party later thats more kink oriented see if you can meet someone there. ,FemdomCommunity,de7238o,6,t5_2whne
11018503,0,t1_degh0bc,Great minds think alike I guess! When my wife gets out of the shower I usually dry her off too! If you want to take it up a notch throw that towel in the dryer for a few minutes before she gets out. Nothing makes my wife purr like being wrapped in a hot fluffy towel!,FemdomCommunity,degx0ep,2,t5_2whne

11364489,0,t1_dek0byl,This is sage advice. uPandaleague your BEST BET to getting more of what you want is to make this about how sexy and beautiful SHE is  and NOT giving her a wishlist of shit you want her to do to you. Its ALL about framing the right context. If you give her a wish list it may become a burden or chore and she may get nothing out of it and just do it to be nice or resentfully do it because she thinks she has too. Everyone wants to be sexy.  If she associates these things with being a sexy Goddess how often do you think shell do them? And how willing will she be? ,FemdomCommunity,dfk5621,1,t5_2whne
11463235,0,t3_63001e,I am actually offended by this. I am hopping one day Ill find a female Dom who doesnt just want money or turns out to be a gay guy catfishing.I cant be asked to message or start conversation with any female Doms anymore because I know Ill either get ignored find out their fake or find out they just want money.I have never complained about these things but the fact you see most male subs this way just irritates me. I have barley ever met a male sub like this And its really annoying you just expect someone to want to be your perfect sex toy. I get you dont want the constant ask to only ever fulfil a guys kinks but I find what you said very hypocritical.,FemdomCommunity,dfvcmrr,3,t5_2whne
11554980,0,t1_dg5r245,I think you shouldnt worry those are two completely different things. Showing a Dominant what you like communicating to them what you feel expressing yourself during a scene all that is important and wonderful and not manipulative. The trick is to do it with tact with feeling with a clear goal of working together wanting to please each other and giving each other room to both be yourselves. Being manipulated and manipulative is not just a problem of one party thats sort of why I said it happened only when I was naive and inexperienced since there is also a lot a Domme can do to gently change that behaviour. I would not worry too much about topping from the bottom if I were you as I mentioned its sort of part of a journey and you learn as you go along. The best thing to do is for both to genuinely try to enjoy everything oddly enough Dommes sometimes tend to forget this due to being under pressure to preform. I laughed out loud when in the film she kept drinking the damn water so she could do the golden shower and it just at one point wouldnt go bladder shyness perhaps and the exasperation in her voice was dead on.

11572895,0,t3_656gka,No. Our sex life is just one aspect of what makes me love my pet. There are thousands of things that build my respect for him and his being confident enough to trust me with his innermost desires is powerfully sexy to me.,FemdomCommunity,dg7sl1d,9,t5_2whne
11596449,0,t3_65dua0,So while there is no definite sign that someone is a domme I do find that there is one telltale sign that signals someone is not a domme being uncomfortable with gender nonconformity.To be clear that doesnt mean the girl herself cant be genderconforming  I know a domme who is quite girly and wants to be a SAHM  but if they expect you to be genderconforming thats your signal to pass. If shes uncomfortable with males showing vulnerability if her idea of an attractive man is one whose only emotional settings are stoic happy and angry then that means she will likely be uncomfortable with you showing your submissive side.,FemdomCommunity,dgagsa9,14,t5_2whne
