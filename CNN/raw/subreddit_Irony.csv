9337318,0,t1_d8ziq7i,I watched the video.  He was describing how to get media attention.  By encouraging confrontation.  Confrontation gets viewers interest.  He was bragging about his ability to create a situation that he knew would lead to confrontation and coverage.  While trying to secure a donation from a person wanting to donate money.  And stupidly boasting and bragging. Its live action political theater.  Except Scotts claims about his savvy media manipulating skills.  And gets completely schooled by a guy much better at it. Double irony  the manipulater getting brutally double crossed in a media manipulation.       ,Irony,d8zknsy,1,t5_2qith
