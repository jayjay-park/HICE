485869,0,t3_1zoh35,Sprint Employee here. Yes you are still allowed to purchase the phone as a subsidized device. IF you would like to be on Framily which could save you all some money you would pay Month for any line which has received a subsidized device on or after January th this year. The  charge will remain on the line until it is eligible for upgrade again at  months. On the subject of the discount. The government discount will only apply to the data now unless you remain on your old plan. Not to discourage you from changing as the potential savings could still be greater on Framily but just to note.A suggestion from me would be to pay for the device online. You can request to pick it up at your local store. The store will likely not want to be bothered cancelling the web order to try to get you to do easy pay installment billing. When you get to the store ask them to switch you to Framily and let them know you understand that you will receive a  charge. They should not give you any issues though if they do tell them to leave the plan alone and call care when you leave to ask if they can switch your plan to Framily. They should be able to switch you. Once switched to Framily grab your free tablet! Its Month for GB of data and totally worth it! Good Luck.

958785,0,t1_chd6yax,This is  the answer.Spark devices only have a single transmission pathway unlike the singleband LTE devices. The phone sits on LTE all the time. If you receive a call then you fallback via eCSFB to the xRTT network to take the call but this means no data as that technology does not allow simultaneous voice and data.VoLTE doesnt have this limitation since all voice calls are done via VoIP and thus it functions as just another data session.On a side note this isnt new. Its been like this since the first triband LTE device released and its the same on ANY LTE band not specifically Spark. This article is just clickbait and aimed against Sprint. Any device that uses eCSFB for fallback from LTE to a G network like Verizon will have this same issue.,Sprint,chd9tvi,5,t5_2qibp

Sprint might give you a route to purchase it but Sprint does not offer it nor does Sprint sell it.You have  days from buying an iPhone to purchase AC. You can either take the phone in to have it examined by Apple or you can do it online in which case you are directed to a site that does an exam on the phone.The reason the phone is examined after purchase is because Apple wont sell you AC for a damaged device.That said understand that all AC is is a warranty extension with two ADH Accidental Damage and Handling incidents where you pay  instead of the Oow Out of Warranty price.But dont lose heart. Every iDevice Apple sells is covered by a one year manufacturer warranty. You do NOT need AC. Like I said all AC does is EXTEND that warranty for another year.So the standard warranty covers defects and you can go to ANY Apple store to have this taken care of under that standard one year warranty.I cracked my screen a month ago. TEP was . I paid Apple  OoW price for a screen replacement. They couldnt get to me so they replaced my entire phone for the cost of the screen replacement.This is one of the reasons I long ago stopped going to Sprint for any repairs or replacements.

5511063,1,t3_3qjyyr,spnknmymunky you seem to be confused over the phone unlock policy.  To avoid FCC action wireless operators voluntarily agreed to unlock all devices after a specific date if those devices had met certain criteria.  The operators are now bound by that phone unlock policy.Wireless operators are not however required to activate any unlocked device.  They are free to refuse any unlocked device  even if it is network compatible.  The exception is VZW because of its Upper  MHz C block open access provisions.  So for Sprint your FCC complaint has no legitimate grounds.  That may not be popular with you or many here but it is the objective truth.Now the D variant of the Nexus  is fully Sprint compatible.  And Sprint has activated many a Nexus  over the past two years.  So what you have is a poor customer service issue.  That is a Sprint complaint not an FCC complaint.AJ,Sprint,cwg36wu,2,t5_2qibp

6246684,0,t1_cyzmyie,Microwave is not the issue with Sprint or most carriers. I am not sure what USCC teaches but theres some serious misconceptions regarding microwave backhaul  fronthaul deployments that youre expousing.  The issue with slow Band  speeds on Clearwire was they ran dozen site daisy chains fed by a single backhaul point with few hundred megabit backhaul provisioning which was sufficient for their wimax speeds but not sufficient for Band  carriers where just one sector of a single site may require more backhaul provisioning than entire wimax site. The vast vast  majority of Sprint cell sites are direct fed with fiber optic cables. Thats why they had so much backhaul issues. They had to wait for land line deployments instead of opting for microwave links. Also Microwave backhaul has absolutely  impact on Band  or other LTE frequency propogation characteristics. They operate on different frequencies and equipment. The only issue that may occur is if there is insufficient capacity offered by the microwave link to the macro  micro site thus slowing down the speeds of the air links but never its propogation characteristics which comes from separate radio and antenna enclosures which are FCC tested to ensure comformity with out of band emissions which may interfere with other operators ie other carriers public safety members or non licensed spectrum microwave operators love to use. Furthermore Sprints issues inside buildings and urban lands stems from their lack of dense cell site density in comparison to other networks due to lack of network investments over the past decades.  Whereas Verizon ATT and Tmobile and others add cell sites on a monthly basis where required Sprint has not added significant amounts of cell sites to improve coverage or capacity in years. TLDR Microwave is backhaul  propogation characteristics of macro equipment,Sprint,cyzoi12,12,t5_2qibp

You wouldnt have to pay the device balance and the deductible just the remaining lease payments that you would pay monthly as if you didnt lose your phone.Some are on the fence whether or not the insurance is worth it.

8641046,0,t1_d6lp8sj,gtIf Im reading this correctly this means that  of the postpaid phone base is still on a subsidized plan. Thats still a lot of people who can head for the exit if they arent happy.Then theres another question. How much of that  is from national retailers like Best Buy Target etc. that might have a massive emphasis on contract sales instead of lease or installment options. We already know that Sprint corporate has been leaning heavily on lease and installment options the same has not been true of other retailers though. If Best Buy or Target gets paid more by Sprint to sell a device on contract wont they emphasize having reps use those options instead? Likewise if there is no difference in the amount they get paid wouldnt those sales reps use whatever is easiest to sell to the customer? People have been conditioned using  year subsidies for the last  years now leasing and financing is new and scary to a lot of people simply because its different and not what they expected when they walked into the store.Im not sure if it works the same way still but it used to be that Sprint would pay thirdparty retailers a flat rate for device sales. A portion of that flat rate would often then be used to reduce the cost of the cost of the phone at POS to get to that lower price there versus another store. This is why Best Buy for instance might have a phone for sale at  less than everyone else they were taking part of the amount Sprint paid them to sell the phone and using it to reduce the pointofsale price to bring more customers into their store versus a competitor or the carrier itself. The payments for these retailers are likely totally different now and might even be different between lease installment and contract sales.Best Buy does offer installment and lease options now but I remember not long ago when they didnt have those options at all despite Sprint essentially pushing only those in the Sprint stores. That would skew the numbers since the financials include all sales channels. If a sales channel doesnt offer anything but that option it will skew all of the rest of the numbers when it is bundled together. I know BB has offered these for a while now so its not directly related here but the underlying reasoning still stands. Were dealing with many different sales channels here across web corporate business government national retailer and preferred retailer areas. The investor update doesnt and shouldnt go into that much detail about how it breaks down across the board.,Sprint,d6lqnlv,2,t5_2qibp

Other than that you should be fine.I would also make sure the phone includes a Sprint SIM otherwise it could be a pain to get hold of one. Sprint handles SIMs different than other carriers in that they are associated with a phone not with an account so theres no problem with a seller sending the SIM with the phone and until very recently basically every phone used a different model SIM. The SIM you have may not be compatible with a G unless it came with a G.,Sprint,d6ni0ja,2,t5_2qibp

8688976,0,t3_4yx9b6,The subsidized  year contract pricing is what keeps a lot of the old Sprint Customers around today. I went to look and buy the Note  in store. They told me it is  dollars a month but since I was an old customer I got a  dollar credit so Id be paying month which still be x. The  year contract upgrade pricing is  up front and I keep my low rate unlimited plan. Anyways I didnt impulse buy the phone the store sales rep lost his commissionif Sprint works that way. While coming home kind of upset I decided I really didnt need a new phone so Sprint saved me money there. I understand that Sprint is doing this to be like other carriers but this is one of those things that makes old customers rethink if they really are saving money on sprint.

10125463,0,t1_dbr9emk,I will completely agree with your response to my second point. I cant yield that any politician I have ever seen is even within an order of magnitude of the self promotion that P.E. Trump is. For those visiting from rthedonald Im not saying thats inherently bad but MAYBE a little disingenuous.To my first point I would again reiterate some level of support for one candidate does not negate the other though it is extremely common for many businesses to do so. If someone built arms for the U.S. in WW but also sold spare tanks to the nazis after the win we would probably sit down and say hey thanks for your help but there is a little concern we need to discuss. I also recognize this may have happened that we indefinitely borrowed nazi rocket scientists yada yada...My whole point is that regardless of what other actions they take with any other candidate winning or otherwise Sprints tacit support here would be alarming to someone who views P.E. Trump that way.,Sprint,dbrcrcp,2,t5_2qibp

Im the only mod that works for the company and I was a mod prior to starting work at Sprint again in November but I work in a retail store like  of our verified employees not in marketing or Social Care etc. where this might be part of my actual job its not.We rarely remove posts and comments preferring to let the community updownvote as it will whenever possible. Unless its blatant personal attacks things in general getting out of hand or profanity which AutoMod takes care of. And our AutoMod leaves a reply comment for everything it removes for public visibility instead of just having comments disappear without a reason. I wish I could find a way to get AutoMod to only remove excessive profanity one word here or there isnt really a problem but the AutoMod configs dont really allow for that type of usage from what I can see.Our full AutoMod configuration is mirrored in our Wiki and linked in the sidebar so people can look through freely if they want we started doing that after the whole reddit blackout thing. We removed our subreddit shadowban list aka AutoMod removing all posts by certain users silently over a year ago. Originally that was setup so users could still view the subreddit but not participate since a full ban prevents users from even reading the sub. The fact was that the users that do enough to get banned arent usually users that are participating positively in the first place so it wasnt really accomplishing anything other than potentially looking shady. And several other AutoMod rules have been removed over the last year or so silently to see how it affected the sub in almost every case those old rules werent necessary anymore.

Otherwise they will have all of those areas doing exchanges since theres no one to repair. The primary purpose of the Asurion SampR footprint in retail is to reduce the number of device exchanges by providing the tools parts and training for any device that can be reliably repaired in the field. Then only if the part is unavailable in store having a repair center for them to be mailed in for a repair and as a last resort from there an exchange done.With that idea it might make opening new SampR and sales locations more cost effective in currently underserved areas if Asurion is helping subsidize that somehow.,Sprint,dd8x9co,2,t5_2qibp

As long as its simply an installment contract and doesnt require you to be on a BB plan change your plan and then go to BB and get the phone. Then call the employee customer care and they SHOULD be able to switch you back to your employee plan.This is how I run upgrades in my store for customers on those SERO plans and such and this is an extension of that.

It sounds like you have a large credit on your account and you wish to have that credit applied to the balance of your installment agreement.  I would escalate your issue I cant find anywhere in the TampCs where it defines how credits can be applied.  The only area I see any mention of credits is under buyback and mentions credit being applied to your sprint account.  No where does it state that any credits received shall be applied to your service plan agreement and NOT your installmentlease agreement. My understanding is that everyone has at minimum one Sprint account with an account number associated to it with a plan agreement andor installmentlease agreement.  As each agreement is separate in nature under one account.  Therefore there should be a manner in which Sprint can apply credits to either agreement.
