5627209,0,t1_cwtn1z7,Well the red Ibanez is entry level tone is ok for a start definitely need to switch the pickups havent gotten around to it yet sounds way too muddy.The other Ibanez is better it has a floyd rose style bridge so those are annoying wouldnt suggest for starters other than that its a great guitar sounds good but the pickups are really cheap. But thats something thats always replaceable. The bridge pickup is great for rhythm distortion btw but a little too sharpbrightwhateverthetermis on the leads. Clean is gross on the bridge pickup but to my liking in the nd pos. it sounds perfect to me. You can hear the notes crystal clear if you ask me. Other pickup positions arent for me but if youre curious the neck pickup is really warm and sounds a little fuzzy when trying to play rhythm. Middle pickup just always hums I dont really use it though to be honest.The CV is GREAT! I love it! Its a great guitar for clean tones and lead on distortion if you wanna do rhythm with distortion youll wanna mess with the settings on your amp a bunch so itll suit your taste. If youre into rock Like Aerosmith Bon Jovi or any band with a guitarist who plays an SSS strat then youll definitely find a good tone with this guitar! The Strat is used by so many different bands across countless genres of music. This particular strat has a very twangy tone to it. You can clearly hear the string being struck by the pick it sounds great to me! It adds some flavor to the tone for some reason. Im sure someone knows a better way to describe it than me but still its a great guitar! The single coils hum but that doesnt bother me too much.

6037944,0,t3_3y6jsw,First of all that design is fantastic. It looks so natural while still being new and interesting. I dont know about the gold hardware but thats a preference thing.Im not sure how to answer your pickup question especially if youre looking at Stratstyle single coils. For one thing a Stratstyle bridge pickup is about the furthest thing from a jazz tone as you can possibly get.What I would suggest is going with a lowoutput humbucking pickup in the bridge position which will sound thicker and fuller than the uberbright and twangy sound of a bridge single coil.For middle and neck positions traditional Strat pickups will work great for a blues sound. Either Seymour Duncan SSLs or Fender Texas Specials are good choices.Then you can wire cool things like phase switching and coil splits on the bridge pickup with those Jaguar switches to get all your inbetween sounds.,guitars,cyb35a1,3,t5_2rdye

Fantastic then and fantastic now. Ive recently discovered that the Razor pick is exactly what I need. I tend to grip picks very close to the bottom so often my fingernail was actually hitting the string and my playing to be sloppy. This caused my nail to weaken too. The Razor allows me to pick really easily because of its pointed shape. The picks might be pricy compared to a basic pick but they last for ages. Ive still got my original sample .mm pick that Chris was giving out on different forums to advertise the company. Its a bit worn out now but still very usable and comfortable.

Namely the Bigsby will never stay in tune with the stock bridge and the wiring while very well put together is cheap and bleeds highend tone from the output signal.I have a Wildkat that I have exactly how I want but Ive spent another  dollars on top of the cost of the guitar to get it that way. And yes the Kat is heavy but I imagine it will be similar in weight to the Ibanez. Theyll both be heavier than your Strat by a fair bit. Its physically smaller in size compared to the Ibanez though the right sizing for me... I wouldnt want anything larger.,guitars,d8p817e,2,t5_2rdye
9325251,0,t3_5857qq,I own an acoustic guitar shop and most of my inventory is  to  with the occasional guitar reaching K.  Is a K guitar better than a  guitar?  out of  times absolutely. Is a K better than a K guitar? Maybe  of the time. Is a K guitar better than a K guitar? Who knows  play them both.  The law of diminishing returns definitely applies to guitars just like many other hobbies. After playing thousands of highend acoustic guitars  many of them singleluthier built  I can tell you that somewhere between K to K is the cutoff for me. Any more than that and youre not getting anything nicer  youre paying for the name on the headstock not the sound. Like most hobbies this is purely a matter of exposure. I dont drink wine so I think  for a bottle of wine is ridiculous  Ill take the  bottle every time. But for a wine person whos drank thousands of bottles of wine and knows what theyre tasting the  might be worth it. A  DSLR camera will take great pictures but a pro wants a K or K camera etc etc.There are a very few exceptions to this. For instance a TJ Thompson prewar OM is a heavenly experience and they start at Kish if you can get on his list.

My first recomendation is to look only within that genre... meaning dont look at acoustics if you want to eventually play electric blues. This reduces the total  spent and gets you learning what you want to learn on day one.I agree with sambomike on acoustics except Id step it up to made in Mexico MIM fenders. I feel the Squires are just too poorly made. You can spend about  on a good MIM Strat and continue to use it in a band or jam setting later on. Again saving you money.,guitars,d9ihjl4,1,t5_2rdye
9502541,0,t3_5aw7wl,have you watched the LivingRoomDemos Youtube video of this pedal?  Id compare your base amplifier to whatever it is this guy uses and make your decision based off that.  I actually play to buy this pedal at some point.,guitars,d9ke2tq,2,t5_2rdye
9515970,0,t1_d9lfwq1,Oh yeah forgot about budget.. and Im in New Zealand too so I dont wanna pay heaps in shipping to import something  but Ive got a pretty flexible budget. I got the bass for NZ and Id spend up to that much again for a nice amp.. but youre right my Rumble will be fine for now and can be sent to the PA. I would have got a bigger one if I knew I would be getting this bass haha I was just practising on an old Jackson  string before which I might sell soon.

You might need to push that little rumble hard to be heard if your band is loud but if itll keep enough to give you decent stage presence then theres no reason you shouldnt just let the PA do the hard work....maybe stand next to the sub.,guitars,d9m289s,1,t5_2rdye

9999752,0,t3_5i5rdh,My personal experience is that  to  on a guitar and about  to  on an amp will set you up quite nicely. For example Squier classic vibe tele or strat and a fender blues Jr or bassbreaker. Also consider that all electronics are upgradable. I have a Mexico made Telecaster with Porter pickups and and Emerson prewired pot and switch kit. So all in all I have around  in a guitar that obviously doesnt play as nicely as an American made model but it sounds way better than one. ,guitars,dbazvq0,1,t5_2rdye

No method of playing is technically incorrect and if its comfortable for you and your technique doesnt suffer I see no problem with it.

I say this because I got out of a relationship where I was constantly being nagged to constantly save money when I had no reason to or to help pay for other stuff that wasnt my responsibility.
