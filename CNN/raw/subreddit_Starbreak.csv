7615306,0,t1_d321f51,Personally I like that there isnt a healer. It makes bosses feel like a really good accomplishment unless they can find the perfect balance.    ,Starbreak,d37tju0,1,t5_33z2i
7709101,0,t1_d3ibxfz,Look im not going to old man rag on you for identifying oldschool as something different from me but let me say this.  CSGO controls are relatively new gen especially from a control stand point.  CSGO doesnt make you stop it just rewards you for choosing to.  These are called nooverride controls.  CSGO lets you toggle controls without overriding movement shooting throwing a flash crouching it performs all simultaneously.  The ability to have multiple inputs recognized and the choice to have them toggle or hold allows players to play the way they are most comfortable.Starbreak on the other hand forces override.  Caught holding two buttons at once the game will punish you and in the modern sense is very counterintuitive with how our brains work.  Its like playing a drumset but having to hold back on the highhat every time you want to hit the snare.So in that sense sure it could be called oldschool but its the type of mechanic that has faded because players want more control and games such as CSGO have found ways to increase the skill gap while increasing player control.You say it would suck to see the controls changed?  Why there would still be skill and the game would still have all the other aspects that make it unique.  Decreased player control for the sake of personality is not something i would describe as unique.  It is an unnecessary barrier to entry and enjoyment.,Starbreak,d3ih1qt,1,t5_33z2i
7855730,0,t3_4mtulr,Im not sure I get your control over the environment complaint. Outside of GY TL and SC every boss environment is static.If youre bored from the difficulty then start soloing eFF or just skip FF altogether and go straight to Tier  dungeons. The difficulty is substantially increased in eFF and the adds actually do substantial damage to shells,Starbreak,d3z1zrg,1,t5_33z2i
11033542,0,t3_5wt89j,I think the main problem might actually be the harsh learning curve of the game. It took me weeks to learn how to semieffectively play and Im still really really bad. The only reason I can actually play Starbreak is because I picked up a bunch of tips from my Starbreaking friends at school.Basically we need a better way to educate people. Maybe a morestaffed wiki?,Starbreak,deimkuo,3,t5_33z2i
