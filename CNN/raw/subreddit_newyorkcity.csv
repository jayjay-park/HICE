2138340,0,t1_clbl6w6,Actually the picture did not originally show up was on mobile and not Alien Blue. So I will yield you that point. However just because OP didnt garner proof that  that man was snapping creep pics does not mean it did not occur. I guess there are one of two scenarios  OP is a terrible person for posting a pic with a fake story about a dude to reel in pity karma or  the man in the picture is a creep and OP is a good person for putting this creeps face online.Regardless I have to say I will withhold judgement either way unless OP can produce some sort of proof. I cant simply assume OP is an awful person though and I cant simply assume that dude is a creep. That said writing off OP as an awful person is just as bad as assuming this dude was not taking pictures of random women on the subway for weird creepy reasons.Also what proof do you have that OP definitely did not say anything? Since were being diligent and skeptical here.,newyorkcity,clbmp2y,1,t5_2qs1t
