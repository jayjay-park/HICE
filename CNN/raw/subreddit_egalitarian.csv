66106,1,t3_1uurn1,Perhaps because even though we want equality we are just whatever sex we are and as much as we can try to be empathetic we dont truly know what the other sex deals with unless theyre transexual etc in which theyve got a very unique stand point on it .Also I think unfortunately the name feminist has been ruined by a lot of stroppy teenagers who have no real understanding to what were fighting for.In the same light I feel that a lot of MRA people are extremely pro men anti women. So it could just be that both groups have very negative views of what the other is trying to achieve.,egalitarian,celyfcq,5,t5_2qjia
746630,0,t1_cgp4ori,gt Teachers cant force all the female students to take the course without making everyone take it.No but if its an extracurricular activity they can spend more time talking the girls into signing up than the boys.gt gt You can assign students to work on it during classtime or as homework as well as offer extra credit start an afterschool coding clubThese things can be pushed unequally by teachers because they are optional.gt How are they making female students a priority by assigning the course to everyone in the class?Teachers dont just assign a course and walk away.  A lot of kids need help.  This reward isnt granted when kids sign up its granted when they complete the course.  Teachers are busy.  If a teacher has a bunch of kids who need help and girls will earn money for the class if they pass and boys wont theres a strong push for the teacher to help the struggling girls first and the struggling boys if they dont run out of time.,egalitarian,cgp5ck3,9,t5_2qjia

1451623,0,t1_ciy7tu2,gtNonhuman animals are sentient beings with distinct personalities. They have fears and desires experience joy and suffering. Theyre people. Thats ridiculous. You say that as if its a universal truth and not just some definition you made up for yourself as to what constitutes a person. That doesnt make them people to society at large or even under the law and they do not identify themselves as people  other people do it for them. If they are people are they lesser people than us because they dont have the same mental capabilities? If they are people how do they express their desires opinions and feelings through a social construct? If they are people then how come they do not contribute to society? If they are people then how come they are bound to instinct and not free will or laws unlike us?This isnt an argument I want to have because its ridiculous and not my area of expertise but your justification makes no sense. Either way it has nothing to do with Egalitarianism.,egalitarian,ciy8ip4,2,t5_2qjia
