602141,0,t3_20x3tw,Public Works is my favorite club in SF by far. They bring in the acts that I love and the sound system is great  unfortunately it has quite a few dead spots but Ive learned to avoid them. Having no VIP or Bottle Service makes it even better in my opinion. I wish theyd do a no alcohol party but I know theyd make no money.Mighty is awesome but it can get a little too packed in there. Ive had my fair share of drunken standarounders on that dance floor too..Speaking of drunken standarounders I fucking love Monarchs sound system but I absolutely despise the clientele. Every show Ive gone to there includes Bottle Service sitting there on facebook and plenty of people standing around on their phone. No groove no dancing just... standing and drinking. Seriously what the fuck.Folsom  is cool but it has a weird vibe to it every time Ive been there.I havent been to any other clubs in the city... living in Sacramento makes it hard sometimes.

834453,0,t1_cgz3dm5,This track definitely isnt stale and played out. This track would kill it in a club as much now as it did when it was released. I wouldnt expect people to be unfamiliar with this in fact I would expect the opposite. I definitely keep up to date with new tracks and love it when I see a DJ play a set of new stuff I wouldnt have heard of before. However I also like when a track like this is played and everyone in the room would recognise and loves to hear. There isnt a decent club in the world where this track wouldnt get a great reception. Also people are always new to house just last week someone made a post asking for tunes to get started listening to and this is a great one. I do agree some tracks get played to death such as Au Seve but I wouldnt say this is one of them.,House,cgz4obz,4,t5_2qkb5

1057744,0,t1_chnzng1,No genres mean a lot to pedants and music historians.  One does not need to give a shit about the taxonomy of the music they like to be a true purveyor of music.  These genres and subgenres are poorly defined and constantly changing.  Beatports definition of progressive house is very different from Reddits definition of progressive house.  Expecting people to not only know all of the hundreds of musical genres but also define them exactly the same way you do is pretty ridiculous.In your Andrea Bocelli scenario I highly doubt hed be able to tell me what kind of music RL Grime makes.  No one is an expert in every musical genre.  Acting like people who use the umbrella term EDM are uneducated music casuals is incredibly pretentious and stupid.,House,choiqcn,1,t5_2qkb5

As far as going into debt give yourself a budget and stick to it I give myself  a week to spend on music and I dont go over that.I guess its not in a lot of ways however youre not paying any money to listen to it there so the artist isnt missing out on anything are they?

Ive seen them a couple of times since in Denver both of which were excellent sets though Im sure the scene in hometown Detroit is superior. Ive been super stoked to discover Golf Clap for mixes though. I cant tell you the number of hours I spent driving and skiing to their music this winter.
