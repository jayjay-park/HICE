698364,0,t1_cgjifvc,Dont forget the lap the Vettel did with the X in GT You would have to be a computer to get anywhere close to the most out of that thing. And even then I doubt the car would be on the limit. Way too far past the point of diminishing returns IMO.,F1Technical,cgjnn8h,4,t5_2ugxa

2752005,0,t1_cngvs0m,I think they definitely paid a lot of attention to the shaping of the airflow around the car for stability. That and center of gravity is where you develop stability. ,F1Technical,cngw3ya,1,t5_2ugxa

11527879,0,t3_64jttw,I like the idea but i dont think that carbon fibre is the right material for this use. Considering that thermal deformation is most noticeable in metals and that metals are mostly pretty heavy and arent used in f for chasi construction it doesnt seem very usefull. I think as already mentioned you might overestimate the dimension of thermal expansion and for using heat from the brakes you would again need a heat transfering system which only complicates the whole process.,F1Technical,dg2oqph,13,t5_2ugxa
