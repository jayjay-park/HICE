In the Salvation ending you jump down the well fall for awhile and the camera gradually shifts until you are swimming upwards and break the surface. If we interpret this literally it means that the entire island is literally upside down under the sea.

Spend time learning his first phase attack pattern. Then when you can get some hits in and get him to that last rd of this health do the learning thing again. He gets way more aggressive at that point. His buff time is open season for damage to his face abuse it. Phase  has a shorter buff window so be more careful here.

Plus once you progressed past the first few bosses you will likely have at least one of almost every common consumable sitting in your inventory or on your hotbar already meaning new additions will just go to the stack you already have.All in all doesnt bother me. And realistically it would be a waste of development time in the games current state to add a toggle option for it.

7070661,0,t3_4ce205,So they share a lot of similarities but they are still two different beasts.Ill say this if you have loved the punishment that SampS can deal out and you love the feeling of meeting that challenge and the accomplishment of taking down that tough boss after  tries then absolutely try out Bloodborne or Dark Souls.  They are great games and very much in the same vein just D.  Same idea with shortcuts unlocking as you progress losing souls when you die and very tough unforgiving bosses and other random foes.  Biggest difference besides DD to me is that leveling in Dark SoulsBloodborne is a good deal different.  In SampS I feel that leveling means more and does more for me in the Souls and Bloodborne leveling is important but doesnt feel like it has as much potential impact on the game.Good luck!,saltandsanctuary,d1htmdo,1,t5_33iqw

Sidenote A good creed idea for a dexdagger character to embrace would be the Stone Roots. Given that they have pretty strong poison tools available at higher ranks this would make a quick strike dagger user quite potent at higher levels. The Mossy Pessmud would be an excellent choice for melee combatants and the WraithFangs would definitely help with the ranged targets as well. One could also embrace bows for ranged.

So perhaps I can help.His projectiles Run to the furthest wall and double jump off it then back towards him and over the last projectile. Very reliable dodge.Your best bet is to bait out his attacks. Keep a distance  just out of his sword range  and he wont ever try to grab you. Wait for an attack then counter. You dont really have the room to be aggressive with a greatsword without getting hit.If he charges you can dodge through it and get in an attack. After the threefour swing combo which you can avoid simply by running out of range you have another opening. One swing is all you should be taking.His sword teleport slam is a good opening. You can run to him swing dodge immediately behind him since he will always follow up with a forward slash and you can get in a free second swing.You dont have reliable openings after his kick onetwo slash combos or failed grabs so dont attack there unless youre prepared to trade. Use those opportunities to reposition buff heal whatever.You should reanalyse the fight. You certainly dont have it down if youre trading hits and cant dodge certain moves. My SL run only took an hour of trying and that was my third run of the game. First playthrough I beat him my first go. Hes far from broken. Hes very beatable and I absolutely believe you can do this.Gods speed and good luck!SIDE NOTE You can hit his candlebra for full damage. If you get behind him and youre good at ranging your attacks youll create a lot more openings for yourself.,saltandsanctuary,d4plz0g,5,t5_33iqw

8603052,0,t1_d6enr2h,Yep definitely the third lamb. I find the battle to be epic with a sustained rythm.Most of all every single of his attacks can be identified early. Even if you need to react prompty its made so that you can identify the attack. Im not able to do that with all bosses and thats usually where I draw the frustration line.,saltandsanctuary,d6gz4pn,2,t5_33iqw

10007431,0,t3_5iyc8y,You need to make the spindles do more damage they just dont do enough to kill everyone not matter how much hp you have in one hit and I feel that isnt the way it should be just look at real life unicorns the closest things we have to them and they murder people in one hit every day why shouldnt spindle beasts.

10361806,0,t3_5obcz8,The system requirements are pretty light. Its getting ported to PS Vita.gt Where can i find good beginner tips either text or preferably video. Ive red the new player guide in this subreddit.Dunno about video but I can throw text wisdom at you all day. If youve got specific questions shoot. Otherwise best advice is that armor is overrated greatswords and greathammers are overpowered Dexterity builds arent as good as Strength builds but theyre a ton of fun to play. A little investment in Prayers goes a long way. Place a Stone Guide and use horns of recall to get around. Blunt weapons work better against heavily armored enemies while slashing weapons work better against squishy targets.gt Can i play it with mouse and keyboard or do i need a controller.Mouse and keyboard works fine. Youll have a harder time aiming ranged weapons and spells since youre restricted to  directions unless you enable mouse aiming which makes melee screwy and annoying. Its good enough for the most part though.,saltandsanctuary,dciklga,1,t5_33iqw
10368864,0,t1_dcj2nzd,Sword and board is indeed how Ive played SampS as well as the Souls games just the way you described too.Except Bloodborne for obvious reasons and DS because bosses do infinite stamina damage unless youre using the heaviest greatshield ever.,saltandsanctuary,dcjdfgo,1,t5_33iqw

11655284,0,t1_dgh2y4o,Its probably a redundancy just in case someone manages to bypass that area. One other way to look at it is that you originally were of that creed before arriving on the island but I think the first explanation makes more sense.,saltandsanctuary,dgh533t,7,t5_33iqw
