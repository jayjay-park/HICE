387222,0,t1_cfkmal8,gt I have had and gotten over my obsession with HarryDraco so here are some of my thoughts.gt I liked the pair because of the conflict it creates for the story. They are from completely different backgrounds and have been taught different values and ideals. Basically it has a kind of Romeo and Juliet type of feel to it and I love shakespearian drama. Sadly it is also a pairing full of clichs and about two years ago I stopped reading it altogether because of that.This is almost word for word how I feel about HarryDraco. I like maybe  HPDM fics at this point when  years ago I used to read them constantly. The funny thing is while the quality of other pairing fics has drastically improved over the years HPDM seems to have remained stagnant. I can only think of one high quality HPDM fic thats been written after  or so.It just seems like the ship has been completely explored with very little room for any real originality left. Just cliches and more cliches.,HPfanfiction,cfkwgi7,2,t5_2t100

661750,0,t1_cgfhj0n,I hated that dinner table. I felt claustrophobic just writing about it. I dont know why since I have real family dinners with that many people. Maybe because Im one of the older ones while Albus is pretty young and isolated I dont know. I had a really hard time handling that many characters at the table so Id rather not attempt to mess with that. Ill try a few different things though.Now about the epilogue. It seems many people interpret it as the first time Albus learns about his name the first time the cousins actually learn their famous but I dont like them not knowing anything about their past because I think its extremely unrealistic. So thats mostly just a different interpretation of that scene based on what I think would happen if it was real life. ,HPfanfiction,cgfhoee,1,t5_2t100

1158228,0,t1_chzu4w6, Weve probably read the same fics! Im hoping I can make a pretty logical explanation for magic more than simply swishandflick and say a word. I would say its more like a person with vision like the Hubble telescope looking at a petridish and saying theres some colours and stuff shouldnt be anything remotely impressive  at the start it will be like putting shapes into shape holes before we move on to more complex things. The MC will be trained  by different magical beings  specializing in a multitude of things but shes also lazy and learns only what she likes to Hermione would put her to shame almost everywhere etc... Hermione is more like a device to introduce complex ideas by studying  imo  it works well within the original story so Im not quite against it. In my own story as said before the MC is more complex thus why I wanted to add booster sessions of learning by having time being manipulated I have a decent idea of how to implement this. Magical sensitivity will become a device in both runeswards and travelling so I try and view that as some kind of individual tale of its own with the drama and whatnot thrown in to develop and snowball until some likely heroic action occurs... or some great misery is flung at our beloved MC.I am hoping the magical sensitivity will be seen as part of the MC much like Harrys connection with LV the travelling expands the plot and introduces newer ideas as well as expanding on those already briefly mentioned such as runes and wards etc.... Oh yeh  did I mention I wanted to have a more thorough look at Gringotts bank?... and Diagon Alley is getting a relatively huge makeover...

2147224,0,t1_clcqgnh,Ouch. Not sure what the obsession is with demagicing people. Not part of the trope. But sure. You remember nothing Voldemort does and therefore cant do magic because its so hard elevenyearolds need an entire week to start picking it up.On the other hand I do remember the incantation of every Unforgivable. And none of them have wand movements just a jab. So...exactly how much emotions do I need to cast them? And how angry am I at being suck as Voldemort? How much do I hate racist murdering bigots and want them to die?Thatll do pig. Thatll do.Regardless I think you still simply stop being evil...and run. It is clear that your soul whatever the fuck that is is not Voldemorts but you need to make sure the horcruxes dont get activated releasing a real copy of Voldemort onto the world  like the Diary almost did.This also means you likely arent immortal. Sorry.Have Bellatrix retrieve your locket horcrux from the nowdefenseless or mostly so Black family townhouse leave the cup horcrux in her vault which a password is now required to even be taken in a cart to access tell Lucius nothing and just scarper to South America. Or maybe Australia.Bellatrix worships you and will continue to do so even if you never cast a spell again.  Take her with. Just dom her some  christ you do know how to do that I hope? Not  Shades of Didnt Even Read the Wikipedia Article but real SampM stuff? Real dom isnt about displays of power or even pain even if Bellatrix is into that too it is about control and trust games. Do that or get some books to learn how buy some nice whips let her do a nightly rapisttrap walk through the docks to get some Muggles to torture who actually deserve it and shell keep purring like a demented little kitten forever.And if I really cant use magic why do I look like that if Im not magical? If I am actually magical and I just dont remember how...well Ive got a demented obsessed childless woman to teach me horrible dark magic. Sounds like a winwin to me. Ill be in So Paulo with crazypussy the Death Eaters will be collapsing in on themselves and Harry might actually get a decent year at Hogwarts for once with Scrimgeour in charge and not being murdered by me.With me gone there is no other plot.Now I wonder if I can work out a way to do this whole horcrux thing just without the human sacrifice. I hope Voldemort kept notes. Do brainstemless clones work magically aged with a canon potion? What about people on their deathbeds hooked up to machines and in horrible agony? If it is an emotional thing again what if I became hardcore vegan and made myself feel really really bad about killing a cow?Point is you still have volition and a powerbase to ransack before they figure out anything is wrong.

2523852,0,t1_cmnqj2w,gtFirstly theres the issue of explanation vs. description. While I love fics that describe magic in a lot of detail making it seem complex difficult and real Im not a fan of explanations of magic.This is what I meant by deconstruction. Nuts and bolts. I understand that this can take the well magic out of things. If all the criticisms of HPMOR leveled here were of this sort I would never rear my ugly head to defend it because I get the argment. Unfortunately most are character assassination or just factually incorrect below in the thread  leaves plot threads hanging or whatever ... why dont we let him finish the story first....To me on the other side of the coin the attempts to explore magical theory while being nearly entirely true to canon are the most fun part of HPMOR. The author has been handed a bunch of bizarre and often arbitrary rules foodanimals e.g. and has his protagonist deal with them learn them and rationalize them. Its unique. Others interpret it as trashing canon but I think its actually a really cool homage to canon. Instead of changing things that JKR came up with that dont make a whole lot of sense he attempts to reason out a way it could all be cohesive. Yeah thats less in the spirit of the original books. But fanfiction in the spirit of the original books has always been less fun for me because whoever writes it is invariably not as eloquent as Rowling.gtIn this sense I think that wizards involved in magical research are kinds of conceptual engineers and that their work should accordingly be like that of philosophers and literature critics rather than scientists. Magical theory is thus less about discovering and explaining how magic works and more an act of creating a narrative that describes magic so as to capture some essence of it.I agree and if I ever wrote a story this is how the Unspeakables and so on would operate in the background.

So her sisters probably had no clue and woke up one morning to find out there older sister ran away and married some muggleborn. I imagine they had to bare some heat from that At school with whispers from their parents now probably keeping an extra eye on them etc... I just couldnt imagine how abandoned I would feel as her sister. Not saying shes a bad person just a bad sister.Imagine if her actions had made it so neither of her sisters could be in that society anymore. Im sure it was questioned whether they were raised right etc. Especially because Sirius was also going against pureblooded beliefs. She was right to feel those beliefs wrong its just she could have been sacrificing her sisters to that society.

3305257,0,t1_cp4nldv,Thanks in fact i can add that the reason i like JKR is exactly that  she treats her characters as people she doesnt ignore their defects and put on light their strengths  in fact expecially at the end she does the opposite. We clearly see that she makes really clear that all the main characters are imperfect  from snape the most obvious to Dumbledore.Obviously she has authorial fiat so the plot is advanced via deuses ex machina but her writing flows well and the story has a good ballance of dark and humoros themes. That is her art and thats why i apreciate her work and still follow the hp universe.Its easy to critique plot holes and whatnot once the story is arleadly written  like the old saying everyone is a general after the battle . She doesnt care about how the plot is advanced  she follows the growth of inperfect people that fight a war caused by corrupted people that fell into an ideology led by a mad megalomaniac.Many think that her story was born as a childs tale  i disagree  she wrote it because she wanted to show to a generation that no matter the hardship they find themselves in they can grow and understand and maybe  with luck and persistenece  win.Harry potter is not a saga about magic  its a story about overcoming what seem unsurmontable odds and becoming in the end someone better.Now let me be clear  i dont completly agree with her belief system. I dislike the moral lesson that she repeats many time which is to accept mortality  Im a transhumanist and an immortalist my faith in umanity is almost endless and im firmly convinced that with enought time our race will be able to unhinge itself from the limits that biology puts on us  i believe and facts confirm that our finiteness is contingent on the fact that we are the faulty result of natural selection and by understanding how the universe work we will be able to perfect ourself in ways today uncomprehensible.Sorry for the rant  had to blow it off .

4082750,0,t1_crlmjkq,Fortunately character creation is simplified by the fact that theyre playing themselves. Theyre replacing canon characters minds with their own and then running with it. Example two of them are going to play Susan Bones and Hannah Abbott. They know everything that they players know but only get vague impressions of what Susan and Hannah knew. The challenge is to have no one twig to the fact that theyve pod peopled the characters. So in your example the Draco copy wouldnt be a Copy it would be one of them puppetting Dracos body around... but your caveat still stands. Draco being friends with Harry will generally be investigated by Lucius and by the transitive properties of gossip trigger the they lose if Voldemort finds out about them loss condition. ,HPfanfiction,crlnqla,2,t5_2t100

The canon characters apart from Harry are all in character the OCs well developed and interesting. Harry himself is interesting too very powerful but in a believable way. Thirdly because of its uniqueness. Durmstrang e.g.Then of course because of its plot which keeps me interested and always wanting to read more. I like dark!Harry stories and it is very hard to come across good ones with believable characterisations of Harry. I like his slow development into a dark wizard the changes he goes through and how they come to pass. Everything just makes sense and I like that about it too.

4302175,0,t3_3a87lv,Well there are two ways that story could goone Harry does actually descend into an academic tailspin. However there are two issues with that idea namely the degree of isolation Harry experiences with Ron as his only friend and the level of support hes likely to get from teachers once it becomes obvious that his studying discipline is as bad as Snape suggests it to be.The second direction is the one I would choose though especially after first year essentially Harry is discouraged from doing better than Dudley at school in most fanon stories cannot remember if its canon or not so Ill just put fanon there and is reprimanded when he does better than Dudley. When he gets reprimanded by the staff possibly by Dumbledore himself should he get more than one troll grade who know full well what he is capable of and cannot understand why he seems to be worse than Ron well I think that would change a few things.Basically he was never encouraged by his relatives to study so despite the fact that he hides in the school library before Hogwarts and probably as a result enjoys reading he does not see good grades as worth working towards. In canon Hermione becomes somewhat of a crutch allowing him to focus on topics of interest while the girl basically points out the bits he absolutely has to study. Without her he is not told what is and what isnt worthy study material and therefore ends up having to check it all out to figure it out. And given his parents smarts as well as the crazy insane level of curiosity the boy exhibits not to mention his Deus Ex Machinalevel eye for detail especially when noticing Chekhovs guns all over the place it wouldnt be long before boy wonder stumbles upon something of interest that gets him to study.Now then academia aside Hermione played a key role in the series. Without her Harry wouldnt have had a third opinion on whether to go Gryffindor or not Dumbledore went there indeed. He wouldnt have had to go after the troll. He would probably have been thrown off his broom during his first quidditch match. Ron would have been his only companion to Dracos duel meaning no alohomora spell and thus no Cerberus encounter. And even if he did the whole theres a trapdoor would have gone unsaidunnoticed. There would have been nobody to point out that Hagrid raising a dragon in a wooden house was a bad idea there would have been only two people dragging said dragon through the castle the search for who Nicky Flamel is would have either taken a lot longer or never happened and Neville wouldnt end up petrified on the floor. Oh and she wouldnt be there to set Snapes robes on fire either.More widely Harry would have had no direct emotional involvement in muggleborn rights houseelf rights pureblood discrimination general creature rights etc. There would have been no polyjuice potion in second year time travel in third year implicit support in fourth year DA in fifth year UST in sixth year and camping companions in seventh year.That is if Harry survived until seventh year which without either additional support or a very very thorough change in attitude when compared to canonvast majority of fanon is practically impossible. Basis for reasoning here Harrys the most passive wizard this side of Rincewind. Motherfucker spends the entire series reacting rather than trying to get ahead. Whats even more frustrating is that theres so much fanfiction trying to make him independenti.e. more activethat Sturgeons Law comes and bites us all in the ass on this one.Quite honestly I think Hermiones one of my favorite characters in the series simply by virtue of kicking Harry in the ass whenever he gets stuck in a rut. Without her prepare for canon to be derailed via nuclear detonation very quickly.,HPfanfiction,csakvdi,9,t5_2t100

4554320,0,t1_ct4noet,I think this is very much good advice  and it goes for more than just magic duelling. If youre writing combat of any kind then it should not be clean. If you get into a fight in real life youll notice afterwards your knuckles might be slightly raw or skinned youll be badly bruised  blood from cut lips swollen eyes and thats if you came out of a fight well. People throw against a wall will probably catch their skin on a nail rough surfaces will scratch you up. If you punch someone hard enough they might bite their tongue  replicate these dangers in duelling even the more minor spells could cause side effects. Get hit by a banishing spell or anything that knocks you down? You could hit your head on the fall dislocate your shoulder if you hit something at a bad angle bite off a chunk of your tongue. In the wizarding world people can take a lot more damage and recover in a few days so dont be afraid to actually have them take that kind of damage.,HPfanfiction,ct4oyp8,7,t5_2t100

Ive planned to convert one of my ficsbut in a total rewrite almost as if Im writing an AU of it keeping only the character shells and beats. Fics been a great outlet to go nuts with story lines its a very first drafty process for me. Some general questions When querying and submitting to presses those that dont look for fic authors specifically is there a particular way we should sell these manuscripts? Especially if the fic is popular with a sizable readership and what would they find sizable?. What about a social media presence? Ive gotten really lucky with building an audience and I wonder if its anything that can give an edge in proving my story has a market. Ive heard these convertedfic stories are a hot new thing but it still feels like theres a stigma attached to them. Whats the general feeling in the industry right now? Also all of the ones Ive heard of seem to be Twilight Shadesesque. Are they just scouting for that type specifically? In any case Im glad your imprint is looking specifically for offbeat titles.

I use a lot of subreddits and its quite annoying to aim for a link that should be there but isnt. I dont understand that design decision.I use night mode from RES permanently so hovering over a thread makes the font color almost identical to the highlight for the threads marked with a Request tag though other tabs seems to be okay And it positively ruins the comments section which are now a eyehurty white block with light grey text.

5503074,0,t1_cwex4dm,Sorry but HBP reads as if Rowling realized the characters werent growing together the way she wanted so she forced them. Which made for some uncomfortable reading regarding Harrys beast in his chest which came out of nowhere. When it came to Hermione however she decided to make her go against her established character in a big way as well as make her less mature than she had shown to be in previous books. I think people would have been a lot less upset if she had just made Ron mature instead.As for not necessarily right Hermione has shown to have a rather strong sense of morality she values above established rules. This is the case from book one on. She makes obvious mistakes with the polyjuice and with the bluebell flames on Snape but each time she breaks the rules she clearly has a reason to feel morally superior about it. The closest I can think of as a precedent is her punching Draco Malfoy. She was over two years younger then which is a lot for a teenager but it was the main other time she broke the rules based just on emotion. That was however at the end of an entire year of Draco and his father working to do things she was morally against even though his actions stayed within the rules. Mclaggen makes a few bad remarks and she nearly instantly loses composure to the point where she actually uses magic against him despite having two more years to mature? It doesnt fit even if she suddenly fancied Ron.PS since this is necessary on this sub I am not advocating harmony I never thought they would end up together in canon never hoped for it and its not one of the main pairings I read in fanfiction.PPS I really tried to keep this shorter... sorry,HPfanfiction,cwf2i07,1,t5_2t100

5765495,0,t3_3u2kqg,You know thats actually a really good question. I have no clue!Its a bit of a negative outlook but lately Ive been focusing almost exclusively on stories I dont want to readchief among which are stories which spend the majority of the time at Hogwarts.I think worldbuilding is really important to me so whether it be another country an ancient kingdom or a completely different world altogether I need new settings and I need them to be good. Preferably in a high fantasy kind of style.These are just rough guidelines but most stories that follow them would be good in my eyes. You could for example have a story where Voldemort opens up a portal to the Underworld unleashing whatever magic is to be found there and basically raising hell quite literally.Or as another example... you might have a story where Harry is a researcher who learns that Atlantis might actually exist and sets out to find it. Then when he does he gets stuck there and has to find a way out. You could take that one step further by linking Atlantis to another bigger world.Lore is super important to me. I need it. Im a very visually driven person so great descriptive quality of settings and history is essential. While there are infinitely many stories you could write that fit into these categories these are simply what I look for.I was thinking of reading the Hero Trilogy by joe. It would seem to fit on more than a few accounts. If youve read it could you confirm or deny?,HPfanfiction,cxbrgyq,2,t5_2t100

5813216,0,t3_3usze3,When it comes to fanfiction I find if they are going to use the movietype of uniform its fine. It makes more sense to me because I can actually picture it. But as long as they dont also have problems dressing in the muggle world. You can only have problems dressing in the muggle world if you are using the book version with just robes. But I do think the dressing funny to muggles bit from the book was used as a device to separate the worlds and scream magic. If it was a real world and not a book story wizards and witches would probably have fashion similar to muggles with only a few differences rather than the completely different fashion they have in the books. Ive always pictured Hogwarts uniforms with a school robe slacks underneath and a white colored shirt with a house tie. So... movie uniform. Students wear the robes to classes but when lounging about the common room they would probably just be in their trousers and collared shirt with their tie loosened. Or even just wearing sweatshirtsjackets particularly in the regular books era s. It makes the character seem more connectable and that always comforting to a reader. Regarding hats I find the pointed black hat to be another device to scream witches and wizards. In reality I never even pictured them wearing them as I read and I dont picture students wearing them in fanfiction. Again it goes to the ability of the reader to connect with the character. I feel like the pointed hats is the stereotypical magic thing that she put in the books in the beginning and then just kind of rolled with it. Funny enough I can picture Professor McGonagall wearing one but not really the students I think thats because of the movies though. But this is really a fanon vs canon argument. While canon is incredibly important fanon is probably the most important. Telling a story is all about perception to the readerlistener. If the reader sees it one way despite you constantly telling them otherwise it doesnt matter. The story that you have passed to them is now how they imagined it. My personal fanon is that the uniforms are a bit more normal which makes it easier for me to picture the characters as I readwrite. ,HPfanfiction,cxhomqa,13,t5_2t100

5995025,0,t1_cy5gz3f,In my own experience as someone who read primarily SnarryDrarry with a huge interest in creature fics a lot of it is like  okay we want RonHermione to reject Harry which will encourage him building stronger relationships with x other characters  and they will use some sort of prejudice or dislike towards magical creatures or sexuality or in Hermiones case even anger because Harry is associating himself with people who at one stage hated muggleborns and muggles. A lot of these were things not remotely explored in the books at that stage  who could say sexuality wasnt an issue in the HP universe when it was never addressed in the books? Pureblood prejudice existed is it that farfetched that magical creature heritage wouldnt be subject to prejudice as well?I read a couple where the Weasleys were literally paid off to befriend Harry  those get slippery very quickly I agree but its not always as simple as Ron is EVIL because Harry needs new friends or whatever or at least it wasnt back in the day PI dont know what you ship but unless its SnarryDrarry I am not sure if I could recommend anything off the top of my head.

6020998,0,t1_cy89weh,...I just found out about this last night because one of my BFFs was all I told you so! Hermione is black! I have pictured Hermione as many different women and I only ever thought about her being black when one of my friends pointed out that her race isnt really overtly stated quite a few years ago when having a discussion about white washing in popular culture. And all of these examples of her having a white face from fear or a red face from embarrassmentother emotions...that doesnt really negate black!Hermione as much as the fact that since JK specified Indian and Black for other characters why not for Hermione? If she really wanted the characters to be colorless they would have been colorless but theyre not and this whole issue seems like a big deal when really who the fuck cares? I mean...its a fucking play. I really dont give a shit. Has anyone here read any of her stuff that WASNT HP? I mean even book  sucked IMO and that adult book she wrote was a steaming pile of crap.

Things like Dracos callouses from Quiddich come off like youre trying very hard to give Draco a Manliness upgrade  even though in the movies at least the players wear fingerless gloves and for that matter all wizards and witches probably have the same callouses from wand practice Hermione more so than most. Along similar lines while Hermione has a bit more personality than she has in most such fics shes still nicified. Where are her vindictiveness and aggressiveness when Draco shoves Luciuss release on the train? Where are her ambition and drive and her plans to change the world when she arrives at Hogwarts?For that matter when Draco goes on his creepy rant about how bad he felt that Bellatrix was torturing his mudblood why is said mudblood who was actually the one being tortured suddenly comforting him rather than calling him out on his BS?,HPfanfiction,cyjrk32,5,t5_2t100

6127433,0,t1_cykyw8a,gt They do because there was a shift in demographic. Children who read the first books became young adults in the later installments. This is part of what made HP such a successful series. Its also ironically what creates major problems in the HP series. Childrens stories  especially the fairy tale type which HP clearly is think Cinderella  rely heavily on tools like exaggeration and cliches. Leaving a kid on a doorstep at night is a cliche. The Dursleys are an exaggeration.More mature stories dont rely on such tools on the contrary they can undermine a good story aimed at more mature audiences.But HP is stuck with them. So if youre going to analyze the characters and take them seriously you cant just ignore everything they did in the first two or three books  too much that happens later on depends on those books. You have to judge the characters in later books in light of their actions in the earlier books. Dumbledores insistence that he wanted to protect Harry for example has to be judged by the means he used to do so  leaving him with the Dursleys. That has to include how he did it when he did it what the Dursleys are really like etc.And so the character that comes off the worst is Dumbledore but thats avoidable given that hes doing so much and responsible for so much while all the other primary characters are still so young. When we take seriously his actions both explicit like leaving Harry with the Dursleys and implicit wheres Harrys mail? he cant come off looking very good. Even taking evil off the table entirely he cant come off looking very good.I know Ive tried. Ive tried very very hard in my story to give him the most plausible rational reasonable and justified reasons for explicit canon actions implicit actions plus a few more to fill things out. Hes an antagonist in my story so not the character youre supposed to cheer for but hes not evil. But even doing my best to spread out his actions across multiple nonevil explanations mistakes misunderstandings good decisions early on that shouldnt have been continued past some point etc. my readers still want him dead.Anyway judging Dumbledore by his actions across all the books doesnt require concluding that hes senile though that would explain a lot but it does require giving up on seeing him as perfectly purewhite good. He gets a lot of things wrong which he admits and ends up causing a lot of harm because of it. But he may also make decisions which he knows will cause harm because he expects an ultimately better outcome  sacrificing something smaller for the sake of something larger.For the Greater Good.Or the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Or the one.Or read up about Coventry and how that citys needs were weighed.Politicians do this all the time especially in war. Many seem to forget that Dumbledore wasnt just a teacher he was also a politician involved in multiple wars over his life. Of course he made unpleasant decisions. Of course he made moral compromises in order to achieve larger goals. Every politician does thats why we often dont like them especially when its our values or lives being compromised on.So its quite reasonable to treat Dumbledore as a morally ambiguous lessthanperfect politician who may be a good guy but who isnt always a very good guy. And thats probably the best most positive interpretation of him that can be made.,HPfanfiction,cym4j0u,5,t5_2t100

Neville is another character that doesnt show much jealousy see he doesnt resent Harry for being Ginnys obvious first choice at the Yule Ball and I think he would be interested if it was someone else suggested it.Tonks also doesnt have a jealous streak. I think everyone else with a firmly delineated character is too possessive over their crushes to be comfortable flaunting established monogamous traditions.

Hiding dragons and magical creatures hiding structures undoing accidental magic regulating objects modifying muggle memories etc. But I wonder about things like do wizards hook up to city water and sewer? The Weasleys seem to live way out in the country but we know some wizards live close to muggles like the blacks in London or potters in godrics hollow.

6501394,0,t3_44oxwy,I disagree with your assessment of this pairing being shoved aside.  I think its discussed so little because people dont really think about it until they start reading fanfiction.  I certainly didnt.  Additionally I think nothing would change in terms of highly rated fanfiction.  Most top fanfiction in terms of favorites in the Harry Potter fandom is utter tripe past the first page or two.  If anything I would be horrified by a sudden influx of more Harry Potter fans.  Just the very thought disgusts me.  Communities who receive a lot of new people quickly lose a lot of quality.

6511203,0,t1_czsqx9k,Yes. When two sentences are related but separate you can use a period to separate the two but this runs the risk of dissociating sentence two from sentence one. ExamplegtMy uncle has hairy knuckles he loves washing them.Both halves are independent clauses but while the link between the two clauses is obvious in this it does not always need to be so and the semicolon is then used to ensure that the reader knows that the second clause is connected to the first. Excellent for strengthening relationships between two sentences or highlighting contrasts.A second use is in sentences with internal punctuation or to separate items on a list that already have commas one site I know refers to it as a supercomma. An example in a sentence with internal punctuationgtWhen Mcguffins agree on something they highfive each other Mcguffins are all about the highfive.A barebones example of the supercomma gtMy travels led me through Denver Colorado Wichita Kansas and Washington DC. ,HPfanfiction,czst4b5,6,t5_2t100

6525050,0,t1_czu6dj8,You dont think the world would be different if magic wand waving breaking all laws of nature magic was real proven and common place? If James II could call openly on magic users would William III ever been able to invade England in the Glorious Revolution? If William III never reached power would the the more Parliamentcentred rule of England ever arisen and the Act of Settlement occur in ? What would England and therefore all its colonys look like now? Would Roman Catholics and pilgrims still have left England? If wizards shipped out with the pilgrims would the native Americans be wiped out in a magical war parallel to that waged by the colonizing forces? Or would they be welcomed as fellow but backwards to the Europeans magic users? Would American Revolution still occur if troops could be instantaneously transported as reenforcement? If the tea was stored in waterproof unbreakable magicked cases? Would there still be a strong slave trade if African shamans could curse the slave boats hex the invaders? Or would European magic users collect thousands more via portkeys? Would the Aztecs fall if their magics could call down their gods? Or would they be labelled dark and destroyed by magical and nonmagical forces combined? Would there be so much pressure to explore when land could be found for more crops via simple expansion charms? Would there be famine at all when food could be duplicated easily and transported instantaneously? Would World War one kill so many with magical healing charms to close wounds or potions to fix broken bones or would more fall under the wands then fell to guns and bombs? Would there even be a world war one if Archduke Franz Ferdinand had magical bodyguards? Would there be so much technological advancement to get to the moon if a witch could simply charm the rocket lighter and give the men bubblehead charms to breathe? Would there be as much prejudice against other races when other species existed and walked amongst us? Would religion be the same if thousands could walk on water and turn water into wine cure blindness and even fly? There are many many other events cultural ideas fashion attitudes not just in Europe but world wide which would be different if magic was widely known. Even if a story was set in Australia or Japan or even a tiny pacific island with no name I would still expect some major world building would need to be done. ,HPfanfiction,czu8q9c,3,t5_2t100

Well James and Lily too.gtJKR It depends how you take defying doesnt it. I mean if youre counting which I do anytime you arrested one of his henchmen anytime you escaped him anytime you thwarted him thats what hes looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting.            Also    gtI failed to see why their win was so outrageous.       Because Voldemort isnt someone you just beat. The only one who can conceivably face him in anything resembling a duel of skill is Dumbledore and even he cant beat him outright.       Aside from that the whole thing is terribly written. The Point of View shifts from Voldemort to James back to Voldemort and then does it again within a few paragraphs. The duel lacks proper descriptions that are needed for visualization and is far far too rambley. The action is mostly Voldemort doing a spell and James dodging or deflecting and so on  it reads like a summary of a duel rather than an actual duel. The only line of description is terrible and would have been better left out anyway.      gtTrue to his predictions the moment Lily entered the fraywand ablaze as she raced down the staircaseVoldemort resorted to using his more destructive spells causing holes to appear all over the house as explosions blasted them into creation.       holes all over the house... really? Instead of describing I dont know glass breaking or part of the roof falling in or something. Something that would a solid visual of whats going on.

6625445,0,t3_46evk1,I like it. It ties the world in with our own more which in urban fantasy is always good. In canon the only tie in to the muggle world is some leftover myths and fabels but a whole separate world that occupies the same territory as us would have more crossover than that even with something like the statute of secrecy.Its not that hard to imagine wizard having more freedom in both time and means to do what they want and discover things. And with artists the greater available audience completely justifies why good artists would also perform for muggles.I can also imagine a society that is so strongly focused on the individual as Magical Britain seems to be to produce more eccentric individuals that also have an impact on the muggle world.,HPfanfiction,d04mmb2,0,t5_2t100

7233093,0,t3_4ei8cb,Ive had my share of pretty harsh criticism. I hated it at first I wondered what the point of writing even was. I would get pettyId check out stories by whoever it was that had criticised me and think to myself that they werent any better.Its only when you start trying to use the criticism that I think it starts to make sense. I analyzed it I asked myself how I would write a story that would not be subject to that criticism while still being the story I wanted to tell. Im still far from great but Ive improved.Ultimately as you said were not getting paid. We or at least I write for our own enjoyment and theres some strange sense of joy in things that are just done really well. I could write out a hundred thousand words in a month but I would much rather write half of that and make sure that its done well that I can read it back and go I want to know what happens next. Of course its my story. I do know what happens next I keep writing.Edit of course this refers to constructive criticsm. The one I got was cut out at least half your adjectives. Nothing happens in this chapter its just useless description.

Plus Id assume and fanon tends to agree that there is a limit to how many people can be controlled at once. Also yes extremely powerful curse hence unforgivable. Harry manages to break into Gringotts because he uses it.I think you see my point though that muggles who have no defense against magic pose not threat to wizards on scale. A muggle can kill a wizard but if muggles try to organize against them theyll fall apart on first contact through a combination of veritaserum confundus legilimency imperious and anything else really. Which is why from my point of view any fic that tries to make muggles and technology a solution is muggle wank and I close the tab.,HPfanfiction,d262gvq,2,t5_2t100

7335398,0,t1_d2bxd49,I like it so far! Rav is vulnerable identifiable definitely someone worth following. Ive seen the idea of the Weasley twins pranks being not as innocent as perceived in the original story and I like where you could be going with it.And I love her interaction with Snape. Your Snape is a little toned down to how I typically think of him but it made me quick to remember that Snape was a quiet withdrawn student and he would have sympathy. Have you read A Difference in the Family A Snape Chronicles? It is a very good Snape and that story could provide you with some inspiration on how you wish to write your Snape although you did a good job in Chapter  so Im not sure you need help with that.Critiques? Im always much better at praising than criticism. Do you have a beta? Some grammar mistakes I noticed nothing to big but for instance you misspelled Filch some of your sentence structure with dialogue was off honestly though I get confused by that a lot. Dialogue is always a struggle for nearly every writer. Id just advise that when you write something always try to hear those words and if someone would really say that. Sometimes dialogue gets too wordy because authors try to tell the story through it when really thats not how someone would talk. Also Id love to see a little more backstory on Rav. I dont know if that will just come out as you go through your story but Id love it if Chapter  was just Rav being woken on the train because I like how you started the story with her already on her way but give us more of her thoughts instead of being shoved out and onto boats and getting sorted so instantaneously. Id love to read her remembering the day Sprout came to her and what she felt when she was told she was a witch her trip to Diagon Alley to get her wand and robes etc. Also weve never heard about how Hogwarts handles poor students so maybe hearing how it was explained to her would be an interesting insight.Okay just realized that was a lot of rambling about the story. Bottom line though I think your story shows a lot of promise as a good story. Your storytelling and attention to detail is pretty solid. Your OC main character is getting developed well although Id love to read more at the start. Keep writing keep updating and the favorites and follows will come.,HPfanfiction,d2bzfzc,2,t5_2t100

7625073,0,t3_4jfw1b,Alsogt The question of why a wizard would need a sword though often asked is easily answered. In the days before the International Statute of Secrecy when wizards mingled freely with Muggles they would use swords to defend themselves just as often as wands. Indeed it was considered unsporting to use a wand against a Muggle sword which is not to say it was never done. Many gifted wizards were also accomplished duellists in the conventional sense Gryffindor among them.gt gt There have been many enchanted swords in folklore. The Sword of Nuadu part of the four legendary treasures of Tuatha D Danann was invincible when drawn. Gryffindors sword owes something to the legend of Excalibur the sword of King Arthur which in some legends must be drawn from a stone by the rightful king. The idea of fitness to carry the sword is echoed in the sword of Gryffindors return to worthy members of its true owners house.So the use of firearms is just an evolution of a martial wizard. ,HPfanfiction,d38xhoh,1,t5_2t100

Though she isnt the Arturia Pendragon of the series for one thing her fathers not Uther and Camelots supposedly on Earth rather than Lion!Jesuss private Disneyland she proves herself equal to her forebearers legend though whether the two are related or not is ultimately up to the authorplausible circumstance says yes letsmakeshitinteresting wants no but maybe if you sneak a peek at it from outside the  known dimensionskinda and just as eager to correct the absolute disaster she thought her reign ended up being. Take note that in my mind shes actually a bit of a villain here if only because she prioritises her kingdoms safety over Aslans fuckery. Hes trying to use her to reestablish law amp order across the continent and shes basically saying no fuck that one kingdom is enough trouble as it is so hes pushing the other kingdoms to provoke her. This predictably ends about as badly as you think it does.Also Caliburn is the Sword of Kings and Excalibur is the Sword of Promised Victory. Caliburn was reforged by the fae before being stuck in a rock and dumped in Narnia and Excalibur is on loan from the Lady of The Lake and made by the fae too.

7964823,0,t3_4obsgy,I read a lot of slash and pretty much refuse to read this pairing  of the time. Im already really picky about Snarry fics because those are crossgen usually very OOC or AU and require a ton of Snape redemption. I feel like LV is in the same boat only worse because hes pretty much unredeemable. Diary age TR might be different though because hes not fully LV yet and is a complicated character who could be good to read  especially with time travel fics or a plot device like yours where the age gap isnt huge. I have never read a HPLV fic and doubtfully ever would. HPTR and Snarry are borderline but Ill read them if a nonslash reader or a DMHP or wolfstar shipper recommends it. Your plot does sound pretty intriguing though and if well described in the blurb I think you could definitely get some atypical readers. Also Id post that fic on Ao if you were not planning to already because I think thats where manymost? slash readers are these days. ,HPfanfiction,d4bblpx,12,t5_2t100

7997697,0,t1_d4e4e5f,Having grown up in both America and the U.K. and having retained accents from those periods of my life I was very concerned about fitting in to the point of ridiculousness and now people get confused about where Im from because of the way I pronounce certain words and having travelled across the countries for the sake of bonding and experience accents differ. In fact I find it quite incredible how diverse it is in the British Isles. Nevertheless when I read a British character say Mom Im immediately taken back to that period of living in America when Id hear my friends shout at their mothers in an embarrassed tone. And if every character in the fanfiction in Britain uses Mom then are they all Brummies? And even if its written as Mum and its a Birmingham native I will hear it in their accent. But I only reserve this nitpick for Mom. I couldnt care less if you use lemon drop over sherbet lemon or sidewalk over pavement.I couldnt care less if you used double quotation marks for speech apparently an Americanism over the single quotation marks. But I agree. If youre dedicating one word to a certain style of accent of the British Isles which I dont believe is the case for most fanfiction writers then you should try to do the same with all the words in that characters dialogue. ,HPfanfiction,d4f0n2f,1,t5_2t100

8076671,0,t1_d4nvjei,I agree that Snape was definitely a Dark wizard Sectumsempra for example but there isnt any exact evidence in canon that he torturedkilled muggleborns. In the Pensieve chapter in GoF Dumbledore is able to quickly brush off concerns that Snape is a real Death Eater. No one around him seems to point out any particular crimes Snape has done besides being a Death Eater.  Given his upbringing its definitely plausible that Snape is prejudiced against muggles but being the HalfBlood Prince I find it hard to believe that he hates muggleborns. ,HPfanfiction,d4nw69g,3,t5_2t100

Storing them would definitely take some time repeatedly. This is not a habit that Voldemort would simply give up.Voldemort would have needed to supply protections that his sixteenyearold self could get through. Hed need to store the memories in the same place for forty years.Theres no guarantee that  Tom Riddle would view Voldemorts memories up to  and then become the same as Voldemort.

It also handles most of it better than the vast majority of fics. Its full of really extensive worldbuilding. While Harry is powerful he cant just steamroll his enemies. Theyre powerful too and most of them are much much more knowledgeable.It also as much as I like a long epic fic probably doesnt need to be nearly as long as it is.

On ffn I select them as characters hit the pairing button if Im okay with skipping anything more than a couple years old and Ive got a bunch of fics with them as the primary or secondary pairing.

There would be shirtless gods of magic flying between solar systems while Queens Princes of the Universe plays in the background.

8973980,0,t1_d7qdtpv,The reason that I love that fic so much is because it isnt like other HP fic  it pulls from a place of such intense darkness which in my opinion is what was missing from JKRs final novel. War is messy and violent and terrifying and chaotic. The Fallout captures that perfectly. Not entirely sure what you mean when you say it doesnt feel like Harry Potter. Why? Every character is well written and fleshed out and developed and everything feels incredibly raw and real. Its happening in a magical setting so its not really AU its just the authors take on what a war in the wizarding world would really be like. Disturbing strategic devastating. In my opinion this author does it way better than JKR. Perhaps it doesnt follow Harrys horcrux hunt as closely and focuses more on the Dramione relationship and smaller missions on their side of the war effort but thats what makes it special. This to me is like the adult version of DH and is thus far more developed in ways DH couldnt be as it was intended for a much younger audience.,HPfanfiction,d7qjbyd,1,t5_2t100

9210222,0,t1_d8jgbkp,So would you read a fic where Harrys wand is only as powerful as he is knowledgeable or skillful or powerful in himself? But what you just said can apply to any wizard in reality. Was James Potter really that good at transfiguration? Or was it just the fact that his wand was meant for it? What about Dumbledore? Would he have been able to take on Voldemort in the ministry without the Elder Wand to aid him? Its a pretty onedimensional argument when you think about it people dont want it to be Harry either. When a powerful Harry story appears people bash it to all hell just because he is powerful.Harry still needs knowledge and power even with a super wand. If he didnt have the magic his wand wouldnt be able to shoot sparks or even choose him. If he didnt have the knowledge or skill how come in most Super Wand fics he is knowledgeable and is trained? People just want an excuse for why canon Harry is perfect the way he is they dont want him powerful or intelligent they want him naive that way they can look at the world with the same magic it has always had for them. Super Wands arent really the problem the writing however is. Cant tell you how many times Ive seen grammatical errors in Super Wand fics its disgusting.  ,HPfanfiction,d8jgq3l,-2,t5_2t100

9335797,0,t3_589w4x,Ill just list several recently completedupdated fics I like. Here are the completed ones sorted by date of completionJustice Justice Shall You Pursue linkffn finished last night is the best muggle wank fic Ive read so far.Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water linkffn is pretty much the only novellength HarryHermioneRon story. Its a great read for those interested in WW naval history. Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived is k words long. I have written a lengthy description of this fic.The Accidental Animagus linkffn is a k words long and the first part of a series that begins when Harry was . The second part The World of The Accidental Animagus is an interlude about worldwide reactions to the events at the end of Year . I especially like this series for its excellent world building smart characters both good and bad guys and logical plot developments. The good guys were significantly stronger than in canon Books but Voldemort and his Death Eaters had powerful allies too.The Dark Lord Never Died linkffn begins with Lucius Malfoy faking Voldemorts survival after the Halloween debacle and kicking Dumbledore out of Britain. Twenty years Voldemort got his body back and a three way war ensued between Lucius British Ministry exiled Order under Dumbledore and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were initially caught on opposing sides of the conflict. This fic has one of the best final battles Ive read.Now WIPsDivided and Entwined linkffn is by far the best Muggleborn resistanceuprising story IMO. Dumbledore was cool and Voldemort was cunning.The Stars Alone linkffn is a HPSG crossover and sequel to Broken Chains linkffn. I just binge read it and find it highly entertaining.Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches  Revenge is Best Served Raw linkffn contains lots of tropes I dislike but its so well written that it has become my favorite WIP at moment. Its the first time I actually enjoy Daphne Greengrass as the Ice Queen of Slytherin. Harry was extraordinarily powerful and yet he still faced an uphill battle. The Potters abandoned and mistreated Harry and yet they were not bad people and their actions believable. Dumbledore was evil but not stupidly evil as depicted in so many Dumbledore bash fics. All  girls are well characterized and interesting in their own ways.Animagus at War linkffn is the sequel to The Accidental Animagus and that war appears to be epic.Weasley Girl Secrets of the Past linkffn is the sequel to Weasley Girl linkffn where Ron is a girl. Her characterization is done so well that this new Ron has become my favorite OC. Needless to say the plot will also progress quite differently.,HPfanfiction,d8zdpi5,2,t5_2t100
9337003,0,t3_58diq4,Fair Lady linkffn. Very unique Harry Potter  Sandman crossover that perfectly captures the whimsical nature of both stories perhaps leaning a bit more towards Gaimans writing style. I also have to stress that Harrys interactions with Death are nothing short of amazing.,HPfanfiction,d8zj7nz,4,t5_2t100
9369523,0,t3_58vtyd,Im assuming you want to return to the discussion started in a different thread so Im reposting my original point.What were told is that Dumbledore believes that Tom Riddle killed his family and then Confunded his Uncle to take the blame for it. When I reread this section I became more frustrated than before because Dumbledores explanation is contradictory. Hed just finished saying that Tom had to cast in the Gaunt shack for his spellwork to be ignored by the Ministry then Albus goes off encouraging Harry to believe that Riddle did the murders and then implanted his own memory of them into Morfins mind.  An equally likely scenario that doesnt break the Trace but still fulfills the circumstances as Dumbledore related them Tom used the Imperius on Morfin while still in the Gaunts shack where the Trace wouldnt cite him since the Gaunts were regular spellusers Morfin went up the hill and killed the muggles then returned to the shack Riddle Obliviated Morfin of his own involvement and relied on Morfins accurate memory of murdering the muggles to implicate him.  What that says to me is that the Trace is on the child probably from the moment they get a wand but various locations around the country are safe zones since any underage spell use is assumed to be monitored and managed by responsible adults in the area.  This is also borne out by Dobby using magic at the Dursleys to get Harry in trouble Dobbys spell would activate Harrys Trace even though Harrys wand was never used.  The third example is when the Dementors attacked Harry and Dudley at the beginning of the fifth book. They were several blocks away from the Dursleys house so any alleged magic use sensors there wouldnt have been triggered. Harry was using his own wand so that supports the Trace on him or his wand but not specific to an area the usual argument for Dobbys trick.  The last part worth mentioning is when the Order shows up to bring Harry to Grimmauld. All sorts of spells are cast while they visit including Tonks Pack Disillusionment charms a reparo for the plate Tonks broke. This suggests that the Trace on the underaged is somehow nullified in the presence of an adult wizard. If so that might explain how Harry being transported to the graveyard in Little Hangleton was not cited for all sorts of spells not the least of which was the Killing Curse. His own wand cast the Disarming charm and a Summoning charm. ,HPfanfiction,d93njty,4,t5_2t100

As a result fandom mostly girls literally worshipped Draco and Snape.To be fair I remember both of these perceptions existing in the fan community long before the movies started coming out.  My opinion of Ron took a pretty steep nose dive when I read GoF  which came out before the first movie  and I know Im not the only one that happened to.  I also think Ginny is an extremely weak character in both the books and the movies and never really bought the HarryGinny romance.

9885977,0,t3_5gyrb6,There are two characters I very strongly dislike. Hermione Granger and Severus Snape. I tend to be on the fence about Remus Lupin and Professor McGonagall not because I dislike them more I get irritated with how simple it would have been for either of them to have a big positive influence on Harrys life. To understand my dislike of Hermione you must first understand that the Philosophers stone is by far my most read HP story probably by a factor of ten. I have this trivia board game about it so I reread it till I basically had it memorized. If you havent read this book in a while you will likely forget how insufferable Hermione is. From the moment she bursts into the cabin on the Hogwarts Express she is rude and demanding so arrogant and rude she doesnt get friends until the troll incident forces the trio together. Through out the series she is still rude presumptuous and painfully selfrighteous. While she probably grows up as a person Im rather judgemental and you know what they say about first impressions. Im also quite private so her relentless questioning would have driven me up the wall. Snape. Having a creepy obsession with another mans wife is not a redeeming feature its creepy. I dont really know why anyone thinks that such a petty hateful man is suddenly good when he died. Regardless of how he treated Harry even if somehow you inexplicably give him a free pass to bully and abuse based off what James did to him you have no defense for what he did to Neville. This man bullied the boy so much he became his boggart his worst fear more that being dropped out of windows more than BELLATRIX who tortured his parents. Think for a moment how bad he must have made Neville feel to be worse than the LeStranges. In my headcannon James can forgive Snape as Snape despite being a dick was looking out for his son but I despise the idea that loving caring compassionate Lily would ever be okay with the man that Snape has become. Regardless of how brave he was he was a dick of the highest order. I despise the idea of Snape traveling back in time and getting Lily denying her James a man who died to buy her more time to escape a man who she was happy with. Instead this hook nosed greasy barstard gets rewarded for being scum scraped off the bottom of the barrel of humanity. McGonagall in the things I have written almost always steps forwards and helps Harry. The whole speech she gives about a house being a family and all that. She knew Lily and James and would have been the perfect person for Harry to talk to about his parents but we never once see it. Harry was content to coast by whether you blame Rons lazyness or Hermiones pettyness its clear that Harry is performing worse than his parents academically. McGonagall would have been the perfect person to inspire him with tales of his parents and their brilliance it wouldnt take much for her to fill a grandmother role in Harrys life. In cannon other than when she swears that she will she Harry become an auror we barely see her stand behind him in any meaningful way. Lupin. Where was he? Where did he go after Harrys third year? The man drowned in his self pity and wallowed in his misery. He didnt want to be happy take a moment and think how different things would have been if he stepped up as James last remaining brother after they though Peter and James dead with Sirius imprisoned. The man who should have been an uncle a permanent fixture in Harrys life took months to reveal this to Harry so much for a Gryffindor. ,HPfanfiction,daw5znp,24,t5_2t100

The initial decision is completely understandable but no matter how busy you are if you took the responsibility of placing a child somewhere it is the least you could do to check up on it.Any social worker who places a child in an abusive household without vetting the new guardians would surely face legal repercussions and Dumbledore has a much larger responsibility here because of his personal involvement in all aspects than some faceless government employee. That a child has to live in a cupboard for  years and suffer all kinds of emotional and at least some level of physical abuse just because you are too fucking busy to do something about it is completely unforgivable I actually have a very visceral reaction every time I think about this especially when considering that some people find this acceptable.,HPfanfiction,dbug56h,5,t5_2t100

10328891,0,t1_dcdl51f,gt  Good and Evil are unaffected by popular opinionacceptance I just wanted to say that this is pretty far from being clearcut or at least is very arguable. Imo good and evil are heavily influenced by popular opinion and power dynamics. Or at least what people consider good and evil.Its been shown that when certain figures especially powerful ones make their opinions known the opinions of many people in a group actually change.For example before America invaded Vietnam about  of the country opposed getting involved. The day after the US publicly announced it was getting involved that number dropped to . This is from Lies my Teacher Told Me I forget the original primary source citation in the book though.What people think is heavily affected by authority figures above plus the Milgrand Shock Experiment as well as their peers forget the name but that experiement where people would all shout the wrong answer to an easy question and the subject would begin to believe that the wrong answer was correct. Whether or not there is some good and evil that arent affects by peoples opinions depends on your personal views I adamantly disagree but I think youd agree. But you cant deny that what people think good and evil mean is heavily based on society.You dont win wars by playing nice and at least in my opinion the victors have a huge say in deciding after the fact if they were evil or good.,HPfanfiction,dceu60a,1,t5_2t100

But I dont really want to get into an in depth discussion over Snape ive had far too many of those and they always end with both sides unwilling to change their minds.Does he play a big role or is the focus on Harry and Ginny?,HPfanfiction,dcncmxn,6,t5_2t100
10404576,0,t1_dcne2vl,I dont really know. But if I had to guess its so that Harry can be the one who the story is about the one who kills Voldemort and can also be sent to the Dursleys and discover magic aged eleven. Or maybe its so hes more of an underdog.I think I mainly read them for the other reasons. If there were any stories like that where the correct one was identified as the BWL I would probably like those as well. But since WBWL has become a thing I just enjoy reading those. ,HPfanfiction,dcnfc8z,5,t5_2t100

Hes a flawed but not awful person and you can really see how hes changed by the course of events. The show totally misses any depth of character  they all seem... one dimensional. Also I realize its a limitation of the medium and budget but the magic depicted in the show is just too amateurish and uninspired compared to what we see in the books.

Rowling made them do it.But if were going that route then yeah. Rowling does because PSCoS were childrens books and you needed a villain and some conflict at school and Slytherin was the easiest one. They stayed in the dungeons they had offensive passwords they had a snake as mascot.Rowling was pretty obviously biased when she made the houses. You dont even have to look past the house colors for that really.Gryffindor is Red and GoldSlytherin is Green and SilverRavenclaw is Purple and Bronze.Hufflepuff doesnt even get a useful metal theyre just Yellow and Black.But were not restricting ourselves to the strictest interpretation of canon. Its a subreddit for fanfiction after all. Although like I said the only actual villains we see from Slytherin are Draco and people directly related to him.

10953841,0,t3_5wf4s1,Probably HPMOR. It is one of the few fics that tries to teach the reader something.  Admittedly this is hampered by the jargon the jumbled messaging the dislikeable and smug protantagonist and by the sheer impermeability of paragraphs of author tracts.  But it tries. On top of that theres a mystery to solve!  This I feel was done better.  The ending was undeniably clever and clearly planned from the start. Youve got to give it credit for tidying up most of seven books worth of plot in first year.  That said its still saggy in places.Upon reflection HPMOR has a pretty solid concept and outline.  It just goes horribly wrong in execution.,HPfanfiction,de9t76m,29,t5_2t100

10999918,0,t3_5x24ca,Parvus Tondendas tiny shear initiate a tiny amount of nuclear fission in the air between you and your target and directing the resultant nuclear radiation at them. This curse will be completely without signs of being cast save for the wand movements and incantation. However the target will at the very least be sterilised and likely get cancer. Because wizards have no idea about fundamental forces theyd be at a loss of how to treat it and it would have no magical signature as the radiation does the damage not the magic itself so this is a good curse for causing longterm harm to an enemy. Just weave it into a spell combo in a duel and even if they do catch you casting it they probably wont link it to their metastasing liver cancer a year later. Theyd just feel a small wave of heat at most and probably assume it came from a failed incendio or something similar. An overpowered version of this curse would case nuclear burns all over their body destroy their genome and let them spend their final days in complete agony from extreme radiation poisoning. Theres a story out there about a nuclear engineer who was kept alive in such a state for months in extreme agony but I wont link it.,HPfanfiction,deet3e4,2,t5_2t100

11025295,0,t1_dehhar3,Grindelwald was much more dangerous. We are talking about a dude it took Dumbledore in his prime after at least a decade at the top of the ladder to even defeat. Dumbledore couldnt kill Grindelwald. Sure people claim oh he couldnt due to love but thats not clear. It is clear that their duel is stated in multiple sources as the most magnificent duel of all time. Let us look at Voldemort. Not only did he never conquer Britain he couldnt kill a group of four fresh out of school kids who didnt understand war until a traitor let him into their home at the dead of night. I cant help but thing that Grindelwald would have said fuck it fiendfyre the whole fucking village and AK anyone who runs out. Comparing Grindelwald and Voldemort is like comparing Hitler to the leader of the IRS. Sure Voldemort could do some massive damage... but he never shaped the world of wizardry. He may have been the Darkest Wizard of the age but that was because Grindelwald never stepped foot onto british soil after leaving. ,HPfanfiction,dehosbo,6,t5_2t100

Ive recently picked it back up but I have less time than I did  years ago to devote to it. I have a long prologue and a general arc but it needs bones before I can really start fleshing it out as a full fic. And jesus itll be long.Nutshell I wanted to explore the idea of Tom Riddle becoming the mentor he deserved in nurturing Harry. I also wanted to explore Dumbledores quite rigid outlook as a everyone deserves second chances except Voldemort because if Voldemort can change then it means Gellert could have but I wasnt good enough therefore Voldemort must be irredeemable. To do this in a canon compliant way required Riddle gaining some sanity and mental stability and developing a reluctant mentor relationship with Harry.

11281828,0,t1_dfaqlmu,I chose to discuss these two pairings since Ron is the canon pairing and Draco is the pairing I like reading. I could have chosen to talk about others.I make the argument that I dont ship her with Draco over Ron but that given how the fic is written and the instances of growth he has shown it is possible that Hermione could slowly like him. Because she would have grown and he would have grown both possibly to a point that complements each other. A good writer would address all of these issues. My thoughts mainly come from Rowlings writings on Pottermore. Not Cursed Child. But given that I said I like postHogwarts fics there will be a lack of true evidence because there isnt much canon at all for those years. So yes of course Id be lacking. Rowling did develop Ron and Hermiones relationship throughout the books. Hermione had a crush but it was not until Ron came around with his feelings did she act on it. She finally kissed him in that moment but they were clearly in some sort of relationship during DH. She may have initially like him just because she was young but I do think she found that she enjoyed her banter with him. Hermione could have liked Harry but I always saw them as siblings. Harry never really showed that he liked her company without Ron around and Hermione didnt have the same push and shove stimulus with Harry than she did with Ron. Harry even blew up at their little bickering. I think she likes the small arguments. I feel like your perception of Harry and Hermiones relationship is distorted by the movies. They dont hug that much. I did think Ron was sometimes callous in making fun of her and why I think it could present problems later on if his insecurities arise. However I think they would be a good first relationship to learn from one another. You can read more on other threads if youre interested in expanding your outlook on their relationship.  ,HPfanfiction,dfas1db,2,t5_2t100

11333326,0,t1_dfglvdd,Pretty much. A Gary Stu Mary Sue for females is a perfect character  they are smart good looking rich etc. They never make mistakes and therefore cant learn from their mistakes  reducing possibilities for character growth. Everything goes well for them. They rarely ever suffer during the story. Villains who may be portrayed as competent or powerful suddenly act like idiots the proverbial idiot ball when it comes to these characters. Things of that nature. In Harry Crow Dumbledore is shown as some big manipulator but acts like a total moron when it comes to Harry. Voldemort supposedly a powerful dark lord is no threat at all. Also Harry and Hermione are more or less perfect. They dont have any major character flaws.

It contains ridiculousness squibs action scenes and the godfather.Then there is Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer linkffn.

The Horcrux Lords are the result of a chain of events that led to all of Voldemorts soul shards to be incarnated like the Diary was in Chamber of Secrets on top of the real one coming back to life. As all Voldemorts are too egotistical to share the world with their other selves the equallypowerful Horcrux Lords are in constant battle for ultimate domination but can never kill each other off for good because they each serve as Horcruxes for the other.

11532420,0,t1_dg2qukr,gt Says who Says canon.gt Voldemort applied himself and was curious and powerhungryambitious thats IMHO the only difference between those two!Well Harrys not a psychopath in the clinical sense of the word and he isnt a prodigy since we  and other characters  would have noticed if he were. These are two very important differences. Another is that Harry shows up at Hogwarts already famous but not an heir to any particularly interesting legacy while Tom is a complete unknown when he shows up but he is the actual Heir of Slytherin.gt Harry was a freaking lazy underachiever without any sense of wounder without even TRYING he only applies himself if fucking forced or if his fun is interrupted the Patronus without the dementors interrupting quidditch I am sure he would not have learned it at all! he doesnt have a shred of ambition! Harry attends all his classes and does all his assigned homework. He likes quiddich and he likes being admired for his quiddich skills  as opposed to being admired for things he is forced into like BoyWhoLivedrelated aspects of his life. That he doesnt pursue magic over and above the curriculum unless motivated by external circumstances doesnt make him lazy or an underachiever but rather a typical human being. Its Hermione whos the unusual one reading nonfiction books for fun and we love her for it.gt I kind of agree with the OP hell I dont know why Hermione didnt smack it into his thick skull that he will most likely DIE and that he should NOT accept that and be fucking fine with it! if he doesnt learn more See grandparent post. More learning wouldnt help. If you disagree propose some feasible mechanism by which it would. Proposals in this post wouldnt for reasons given below.gt remember Voldemort was not on the clock so I bet he wasnt furiously learning all the time he surely spend time daydreaming about punishing his father and he also probably spent more time socializing than Harry does he needed to otherwise he couldnt manipulate people as effectively!Riddle was also a genius possibly greater than Dumbledore in raw talent. Also Riddles socializing would have been more focused on socializing that could get him something including influence and arcane knowledge.gt I mean he got Slughorn to tell him about Horcruxes and that guy is adept at manipulating people and recognizing talent etc. He was charming like a highfunctioning psychopath and brilliant and therefore promising for Slug Club. Slughorn was probably one of his easier conquests. gt like a person who has a freaking Darklord after them should be so he might not be able to fully bridge the gap between them not that he shouldnt try hell why not try to learn magic neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort know? How about some Voodoo or something like that? Voldemort has had decades to scour the world for obscure magics. Harry while still at Hogwarts being able to locate something useful that neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort could discover is not a very promising prospect.gt It doesnt necessarily have to be something extremely powerful  as long as very few wizards know how to counter it even a weak spell is a powerful weapon! Not necessarily. For example a Shield Charm deflects many different attack spells as does Not Being There i.e. dodging.gt but at least he might narrow it to highten his potential for survival  as is he survived all his Voldemort encounters through sheer dumb luck the ineptitude and need to gloat etc. of his enemies and the sacrifice of a lot of good people a with a little more training might have say summonded Surious before he fucking fell into the fucking veil  Bella only used a stunner on him after all...probably so she could play with him again later on!Forget magic. If Harry had actually listened to people with better judgment he wouldnt have gotten himself and others into that mess in the first place.gt Yes the pursuit of arcane knowledge theres stuff Voldemort does NOT know same for Dumbledore! and power would have helped!Again I ask what could he learn in his  years at Hogwarts that Dumbledore and Voldemort hadnt in their lifetimes? More likely he would invest a lot of time and come up with nothing useful.gt Pah power he knows not my ass  sorry but Harry survived through sheer dumb luck and because Dumbledore engineered it that way and it was a bloody fucking miracle that that even worked!The fact that Dumbledore was able to engineer things at all suggests that Dumbledore knew what he was doing  and he believed that that power was in fact love.gt and a lot of good people died because of his bumbling and ineptitude hell even if he only trusted one adult enough to get him or her to help with the Horcruxes...it would have been less of a debacle which led to fucking Ron as much as I hate him hes kind of loyal  after hes worked through his damned jealousy issues! almost abandoning him !That Harrys vaunted leadership skills arent all theyre cracked up to be is something we agree on but again its a separate issue from magical skill.,HPfanfiction,dg37a35,0,t5_2t100

Because well ... do forgive me if I am being too random here but I feel the latter would be a great thing to base a crack fic on.That said I will get to the actual request. I do remember a story called Magic as opposed to Magic which does have characters speak in different languages but for what its worth the problem is quickly enough resolved and the story is a crossover of sorts with one of the TES games via featuring characters from some other story based on one of the TES games so it might not be something you want. The Girl Who Loved does have that too but that fic is a weird thing I would put it in the same category as Make a Wish which I hope makes it clear enough how ... weird it is and it also is for better or worse crossed over with a bajilion and then some other series most if not all of them Japanese comics andor animated series.I dont think I have any more stories on my list of whatever Ive ever read or at least I do not recall any being there right now that fulfil your requirement so I will leave it at that.PS.
