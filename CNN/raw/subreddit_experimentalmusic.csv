Hella not Japanese but the drummer Zach Hill of Death Grips now used to drum with the Boredoms in their drummer format.And re Haino his recent work as a trio with Jim ORourke and Oren Ambarchi is great but varied. I just read an interview with Ambarchi about it in highway magazine there was also a piece in there about the Boredoms  show with  drummers.,experimentalmusic,cqo2abi,1,t5_2rpaq

4572466,0,t1_ct61his,Hey mod here...The weekly OC thread isnt meant to hide OC or discourage it. In many ways it makes OC more visible since before the rule change it was almost always immediately buried in downvotes and now it stays as the top of the page for the entire week and these threads are pretty active every week.The reason the rule was implemented is because before the sub was largely made up of spam. Please dont confuse sharing your music with what Im referring to as spam. It was ruining the sub in a few ways but the overall traffic to the sub has shot up since I started enforcing the new rule both in terms of pageviews and unique visitors per day. I had seen the weekly sticky idea work in a couple other subs so I implemented it here and it really does seem to be working. Check out the difference in post quality between the day before the rule change and today. June thTodayThe sub has gained a lot more steady activity and more importantly everything doesnt get immediately downvoted. The trend that seemed to be going on here and some other music subs is that when people come simply to promote their own music there are some who will also downvote every other submission on the front page in an attempt to get to the top and stand out. The sticky thread still gives everyone a visible place to post their own music without turning the entire sub into a competitive promotion space. I have also said in the past that if you are releasing a full new album I wont and havent remove it.,experimentalmusic,ct6ywlc,1,t5_2rpaq
4635048,0,t1_ctermbv,They used to be experimental but maybe the article hints at how loudness and slammed compression is nowadays overused. Especially when so much pop music sounds like EDM crossed with poprock. The pop box moved into Healths box. Also I dont know if I agree with you but I cant unhear Postal Service in that link hah. ,experimentalmusic,cteter7,1,t5_2rpaq

6119140,0,t1_cyl62w8,Wonderful I hope it goes well. I am an audiophile so original sounds and textures are one of my absolute favorite things about experimental music. And yeah I wouldnt particularly enjoy it off of an ipad. Also if you werent I definitely recommend listening on kbps mps or lossless as a lot of smaller nuances are lost in the compression...to me at least.,experimentalmusic,cyl6ldy,2,t5_2rpaq

Ive been following the labels activity for years now and its been really rewarding and pleasurable to watch the artists and the label itself evolve and become more polished. Innovative and unique. Their compilations such as this really solidify the labels values in music and always flow like a carefully crafted record this mix in particular being the most recent and my favorite by far. ,experimentalmusic,dfwlkas,3,t5_2rpaq
