1934752,0,t3_2grumb,I found myself in a similar position.  We live in West Michigan off the shores of Lake Michigan and laid down sod when we built our house two years ago.  That summer was the worst drought in something like  years and our sod was  destroyed.  I waited it out the last summer hoping some of it might come back.  All I that returned in the dead clumps of sod were thorny vines and a ton of broad leaf weed including loads of crabgrass.The lake shore area and my wife strongly urged against using synthetic herbicide so that was out immediately.  I looked into black plastic but our lawn is half an acre.  Time and materials would be been exhaustive.  I have never heard of removing the top layer of soil but I would strongly recommend against that.  Not only do I think that would be harmful I doubt youll see much if any change in the weeds.What we decided to do was till in our sod at the first break in frost this Spring to capitalize on the existing soil and decomposed thatch.  I rented a Kubota with a  tiller and box grader.  My sod left clumps of dried up pieces so I had to call in a landscaper with a harley rake to come do a final grade.  Even after that I had to hand rake most of the property to clean up.When the grading was complete I aggressively placed seed and watered the lawn heavily.  Rain followed my seeding and pooled up a lot of it but I left it alone after advice from Reddit.  Eventually my grass came in.  We did not do any form or preemergent so in June the weeds broad leaf weeds returned.  The young lawn was decently thick enough to contend with the weeds.I had a company out to put down organic fertilizer this summer that was impressed with what I had accomplished.  There were certainly weeds maybe  but the grass was certainly in place.  The gnarly vines were gone and all I had to deal with now was crabgrass.  Last week I finished power raking to get as much of the crabgrass as I could detatched and I overseeded.Herbicides will make life very easy but you can do it without.  I will certainly be a lot of effort and a couple of years in before my lawn looks more maintained and less in a fight with weeds but it is oddly more fun that I thought it would be.  In the long run I will end up with a resilient lawn and a bit of pride in it.A couple of things I would have considered doing differently   Our home is essentially on a dune with topsoil and is incredibly sandy.  The harley rake probably would have been fine for us and would have been less work overall.  I think I paid  for the harley rake work and disposal.  It was  for the tractor and attachment rental for the weekend. I choose a bluegrass lawn and planted a mix of  certified bluegrass and  fine fescuerye.  In retrospect I would have done the opposite.  The bluegrass took a long time to germinate and did not come in as easily as the fescue.  I am certain this contributed to more weeds this summer.  This wont affect you as youll be planting warm season grasses but for anyone else I hope this may be helpful.TLDR  Till your soil all in to capitalize on existing biology.  Seed heavily and water when seeding is optimal and weeds are as dormant as possible.  Watch the weeds grow in with your nice new grass and be patient.  An organic lawn from seed is a Ironman marathon not a Color RunWalk k.,landscaping,ckmboeh,2,t5_2qndi

It appears that everyone elses yard drains into yours and this can be the citys problem as it involves the overall drainage of the entire block.  The best solution would be to regrade your yard so that the excess water drains off into the municipal storm sewer out in the street which is why you get the city engineer involved because he needs to be aware that theres more storm runoff coming into the system.Also if the drainage construction will involve tying into the storm sewer the city has to be involved.A dry well can only deal with so much runoff and during a rain event such as the tail end of a hurricane or an unusually rainy spell it will be overwhelmed and youll be flooded anyway.gtadd soil and lots of it. This is what regrading your yard entails. You dont simply add more dirt on top of what you have there because that doesnt solve the overall problem of where the water comes from and where it is to go eventually.

They can work for some people while other people sit at their picture windows and watch the deer tiptoe past the array of deodorant sticks dangling from the bushes to eat their roses and daylilies anyway.What works is an foot tall fence.So deer are your major factor here. If its going to bother you that theyre eating your veg and your flowers you need to plan for a serious fence. Otherwise you can choose from a short list of things deer dont usually eat.  So its not what will make the color pop? its What can I plant that the deer wont consume down to the ground?That little hill has the capacity to be an outstanding floral showpiece if youre up to putting in some terracing and if you either put up a fence or else plant things the deer wont eat.  Otherwise with a hill that steep youre looking at erosioncontrol ground cover and again your priority is not What will make the color pop? but rather What can I plant to hold the soil?If masses of deer werent a factor and if I wasnt going to put in terracing Id go with a hill of naturalized mixed daylilies.

5360657,0,t3_3oeppj,First you should contact your extension office as they will have specific schedules for everything you need to do geared to your specific location. They will also be able to help you identify what species of grass and weeds you have in your lawn as Knowledge Is Power and knowing what you have is key to knowing how to take care of it. Your Tax Dollars At Work. The timing of crabgrass preemergent application is crucial as it begins to germinate when soil temperatures reach a certain degree of warmth. Where you are this usually happens in April or May. The preemergent needs to be in place before the crabgrass seeds begin to sprout because it works only on germinating seeds. If you wait until you see crabgrass growing in May its too late and youve missed the window of opportunity.Since the preemergent works on all germinating seeds this means that you need to coordinate any grass reseeding with your crabgrass preemergent. If you lay down preemergent in March and then reseed with grass in May aint nothin gonna happen because the preemergent will squelch your grass seed as well as the crabgrass. Most preemergents have a month window of effectiveness so usually this means you do preemergent in spring and reseeding in fall.Reseeding ideally should not be considered a normal or regular task. A wellmaintained fertilized and correctly mowed lawn is capable of filling in any occasional bare patches on its own and usually in a single season.  Grass is a weed remember. Youre always having to pull it out of garden beds. Given half a chance it will take over the world.The most optimal time for reseeding is May and September. In May its spring of course and the grass wants to grow. But September is an oftenoverlooked prime window for reseeding as the soil is still warm thus hastening germination but air temperatures have ameliorated so the seedlings dont scorch out as fast.  The grass will grow and establish itself all fall until the soil freezing solid shuts it down. Labor Day is a good benchmark for when to do fall reseeding.Your regular tasks are mowing weed control watering and fertilizing with occasional aerating and dethatching depending on your soil and yard.Mow your lawn at its highest setting as the longer grass will help to shade out crabgrass seedlings and other weeds at its base. Crabgrass requires light to germinate so if its dark down under the grass stems the crabgrass seeds just sit there. Scalped tooshort grass is stressed and leaves wideopen bare patches of dirt just begging for weed seeds to be blown into and grow Nature abhorring a vacuum and all.A wellgrown lawn can easily crowd out weeds such as dandelions or plantains. They just cant get a foothold in amongst all the grass stems.Be proactive about weeds. If you let them go it never gets better and it always gets worse. Simply walking over to a dandelion seedling and pulling it up with your fingers on your way to get in the car can make a big difference.  Walk your lawn look at whats growing there.  The best fertilizer is the farmers footsteps.If youre getting normal rainfall of at least  per week coolseason grasses in NJ shouldnt need supplemental watering at all. Some lawn grass species such as Kentucky bluegrass go dormant during the heat and relative drought of July and August and come back in September. So you get a brown crispy lawn for the summer. If you dont want your lawn to do this you have to keep supplying the equivalent of  of rainfall every week. As soon as you go on vacation and stop watering for  weeks your lawn will go ahead and shut down until September.So watering the lawn in the moist and humid Eastern Woodlands isnt really an issue for grass health its purely cosmetic.  Unless theres a drought and youre not getting normal rainfall you dont need to do anything by way of watering unless its going to bug you that it goes brown and crispy in July.And Kentucky bluegrass will come back even after historic drought. Ive lived through the  and the  droughts in Illinois here and my lawn has come back all by itself both times with no need for reseeding.So watering isnt really a thing unless you choose to make it so. One less thing to do.Fertilizing is done according to what your soil tests say your soil is low on.  See the extension office for this. Never simply pour fert on a lawn especially homemade concoctions like Epsom salts without first knowing what nutrients you need to supply.If youre going to spread something granular do it with a regular spreader the kind you push along and it whirls the granules out. Yes it means you need to buy a tool youre only going to use once and then its going to sit there in the garage but handscattering doesnt give you even coverage. Bite the bullet and buy the tool.Topdressing with compost should be a regular part of your fertilizing regimen. This can be applied as often as you like its not possible to apply too much compost to a lawn until youre actually piling it up into mud hills.  Excessive reliance on chemical fertilizers is not a good thing IMO. Give something back to the lawn occasionally it will reward you with better health overall. For starters organic matter in the soil feeds the soil biota that help keep your lawns ecosystem balanced and helps prevent disease organisms from getting out of control. It also helps retain moisture and helps prevent soil compaction.So starting a compost pile is a Good Thing. ,landscaping,cvwvuom,1,t5_2qndi

6401017,0,t3_4381w7,Ive been landscaping professionally for  years. Honestly experience goes a very long way. If you really want to run your own business work for a few others first. Learn firsthand how they do things compare different methods and results. Learn to recognize common garden plants pests and diseases. Get used to working with an assortment of tools on someone elses dime so that you really know exactly what you need when you are buying for yourself. Pay close attention to how your bosses manage clients and scheduling and how that affects their income and efficiency. Look for characteristics in your coworkers that you would want to see in an employee. Master the basics of pruning planting and plant identification. Try to work for an employer that encourages the pursuit of various licenses and certifications that increase your skill base. If they pay for it even better.If you want to run a mow and blow company thats feasible.

7116696,0,t3_4d1vb5,Where are you located? Zone only tells how cold your winters get it doesnt tell climate. Do  you want flowering shrubs or specifically evergreens?Your house is basically an American Country Farmhouse in terms of architectural style so you can go with any one of the following looks and have it be in harmony.Over on the right in that small bed between the front walk and the driveway I have included in all the pictures that you need to have something planted there preferably something flowering. Daylilies any other perennials another rose bush something like that.You have basically  different approaches you can take. You are blessed with an extremely attractive porch foundationthe flat stacked stones.  Since the purpose of foundation plantings is to conceal the foundation and soften its juncture with the house wall you can afford to make a more artistic decision here and not simply pop for whatever covers it up the most.Picture  Big roses or other small to medium flowering shrubs. Azaleas hydrangeas  etc. It depends on where youre located. Knockout floribunda or landscape roses are good as theyre more problemfree than hybrid teas and also give a bigger display. Downside they are deciduous so will not be present in the winter but you have an attractive porch so its not an issue. Spirea is too large for this IMO unless you cut it back every year which you shouldnt as it deserves better. Same with forsythia.  Left alone in front of a porch they will become massive and will make your house look like the house where GreatAunt Matilda lives who hasnt been able to get out of the house in  years to look after the yard. Branches full of dead leaves and Walmart bags.Option among the roses include one climbing rose going up a trellis attached to the porch. Picture  Big evergreens. In zone  boxwood will most likely not do so Id go with yew as I prefer its shade of green to junipers and its not as prickly.  You keep them clipped so theyre just below the porch railing and in front you keep them clipped so theyre not getting huge way out into the lawn. They dont need to be strictly geometric like topiary just clipped.  If you keep up with the trimming they will not get huge and overgrown and need major surgery. You can see examples of what not to do if  you drive through the s section of your city where nearly every Sears Roebuck bungalow has huge overgrown yews like Mirkwood and with just as many spiders in front of its big front porch.Ive put small perennials on both sides of the step as you need something on the left to soften it and ease the transition between the evergreens and the steps. Theres a hole there so put some daylilies in it or something.Picture  Perennials. Daylilies lilies blackeyed susans coneflowers gladiolus and dahlias if you roll that way perennial salvia there are tons of plants to choose from. Basically you want a perennial border. Downside it will be gone in the winter but nobody cares with the pretty porch.  You can include spring bulbs such as daffodils and tulips and the emerging perennials hide their dying foliage. These plants are going to be about as tall as the bottom of the porch railing. Picture  Small evergreens or nonflowering deciduous shrubs.  Yew is possible but there are other kinds of shrubs out there. If you use yews or junipers youll have to keep clipping them but something like potentilla which technically flowers but has such inconspicuous flowers that from the street it just looks like a green bush doesnt need to be pruned at all you allow it to keep its natural shape.So youve got some homework and some browsing and shopping to do. Visit nurseries and garden centers. Look at other peoples landscaping around town look at municipal zoo botanic garden university and corporate campus landscaping. Take pictures of things you like and get them identified.  Read up on perennial borders if you want flowers in front of the porch. When youre ready to buy plants Id strongly advise you to avoid the Big Box and go with a reputable local nursery or garden center. So many times someone comes into the gardening subreddit Hi I bought this picture of sadlooking halfdead plant off the Home Depot clearance rack is there anything I can do for it?  Clearance stuff is for people who know what theyre getting into.  ,landscaping,d1n2va0,9,t5_2qndi

7253003,0,t3_4er21h,Where are you located?What is the orientation of the garden? Is the overflow parking grass lawn? Because Id have it mulch or gravel if its not going to be paved. Cars can really mess up grass lawn during wet weather.You dont indicate fencing but I would have fencing like split rail or something decorative just to demarcate where the parking stops and the garden begins. Because people dont always take hints Oh look honeyhostas and ferns! Better not park on top of them.  Your elderberries blueberries and hydrangeas arent going to be big and massive enough at first to signal to someone unfamiliar with the parking lot on a dark and rainy Wednesday night where not to park and they can very easily simply drive over them. A picket or rail fence all along the side of the parking lot prevents that.Im assuming that the playground already has a chain link fence.I like the idea of the honeysuckle trellis but there are people out there with serious bee allergies and phobias and requiring them to walk through a beecrowded trellis to access the garden or else walk all the way around will mean that some people just wont access it. Flowers in public gardens should be placed where people can easily avoid them if possible and especially not in their face.When you have huge open drifts of hostas and ferns usually you have huge open drifts of hostas and ferns under trees because theyre woodland understory plants and they look well under the dappled shade of trees.  Im not seeing on your diagram the mature trees that would be providing the requisite shade. If there arent any then IMO you should rethink the huge open drifts of hostas and ferns out in the full sun because to me that says cemetery landscaping funeral home landscaping. This is a thing that funeral homes and Cremation Gardens tend to do with hostas in particular because theyre subdued in appearance petunias arent always thought appropriate for Cremation Gardens theyre tough as boot leather and dont require a lot of maintenance and you can get a variety of leaf shapes and colors so it looks not quite so monotonous.So if you dont have the mature trees that would provide the logical rationale for having a huge drift of shade plants such as hostas and ferns Id put in a wildflower meadow instead.Your woodland spring bulbs bluebells and hellebore similarly require the dappled shade under trees which Im also not seeing on the diagram.Same for the border beds on the left. Astilbe bleeding heart ferns these are all woodland shade garden plants. If the garden faces north and so theyre sheltered from hot afternoon sun by the hedge once it matures it would work.Beds of perennials require maintenanceweeding dividing cleaning out the dead stuff mulching. Does your church have a maintenance team who knows how to do something other than cut the grass once a week? No offense but a lot of churches dont. I want to say that personally I dislike boulder features. Nothing personal its just that a boulder feature in a garden says to me I couldnt think of anything else to put here.  If youre doing a Japanese Zen garden then boulder features are more appropriate because they stand in for mountains but in an ordinary garden I personally prefer a single boulder or large rock as visual punctuation but not a collection of them.Also a boulder feature will invariably be climbed on by kids waiting to get in the car and go home. Every time.  You can put up as many signs as you want Do Not Climb On The Rocks and there theyll be climbing on the rocks. And as they jump up and jump down theyre also trampling heedlessly on the plants. Kids dont understand that a drift of hostas and ferns isnt a play area.Is the memorial bench already in position? If not it needs to be facing either north or south so someone sitting there doesnt have to squint into the sun.  ,landscaping,d22m4uz,3,t5_2qndi

Arizona flagstone comes in a peach but its not always available and is sometimes just labelled as something one of the more common colors.  Peach is basically a combo of buckskin yellowish and rosa slight pinkish hues.  It has some nice subtleties in it.  I also think Arizona buckskin or buff looks good in a drought tolerant garden.  When you go to the stone yard theyll usually let you take samples home.  Grab a few that are significant size like x.  Also check out quartzite which is a bit flashier but has a lot of warm tones and can look great.

You dont want ivy climbing up your trees either or virginia creeper or honeysuckles. Ground covers may slow down the suckering from trees but not all so expect that. A good ground cover also does an excellent job shading out weeds. If you like the pachysandra  and vinca minor and it isnt a problem getting out of control in your area stick with those. You know them and like them. You have shade and you want something that will look nice all year so those will work and they are cheap.You can always find someone who has it growing and wouldnt mind sharing a bunch of plants. You will have to keep weeds in check until it all gets covered and that will take several years probably closer to five years to get what you want and are planning for.

The price would be less and the size and visual impact would be bigger. In my experience with rock collecting and for example  aquariums is that semiprecious stones need to be polished to show the most beauty  but that is also very unnatural. In a pond or aquarium  a semiprecious stone can look attractive    wet stones look polished! I think you really want to strike a balance between the natural materials and the manmade finishes.

Doing it right will take effort.So Id suggest going with PT wood. You dont have to worry about the sides or moving tons of stone amp its fast to install.

8877186,0,t3_51ta6l,Its not magic its just organic fertilizer Nitrogen potash iron zinc from natural sources plus liquid kelp and humic acid which is a This one weird trick! superfood for the folks who go in for that sort of thing sort of the equivalent of apple cider vinegar for plants.Also the humic acid is derived from subbituminous coal which makes it nonsustainable. Fertilizer will do nothing to aerate your soil. All the fertilizer does is encourage the grass to grow and healthy vigorous grass roots will aerate soil and as they grow they feed and shelter a soil ecosystem which includes beneficial microbes. I assume that thats his out when it comes to truth in advertising.Its also an extremely mild and dilute fertilizer which is why you can apply it every  days without incurring fertilizer burn.  So youre basically paying for water with a bit of organic fert added.There are other more efficient and cheaper ways to encourage your grass without needing to resort to magic. Talk to rlawncare or your extension office.Note that mechanical aeration isnt a standalone magic bullet itself but must be performed in conjunction with a methodical program of fertilizing watering topdressing weed control and mowing.,landscaping,d7ewv4p,2,t5_2qndi
