479162,0,t3_1zl8w4,Welcome!Ethnomusicology is an extremely broad discipline. That said it is a fundamentally academic one for the most part. Pursuing graduate studies in ethno is a great way to learn not only about music but also different ways of studying it. I think a lot of people go into ethno for exactly the reasons you are interested in it. I would urge you to do as much research into what ethnomusicologist actually do before you decide to apply to programs. The short answer is that if youre committed to traveling and recording training in ethno will at some institutions give you the skills and background knowledge to do so effectively and ethically. In reality though you might be better off interning at a record label and entering the industry on that end. No one says that pursuing a masters in ethno means committing to becoming an academic and you will certainly graduate with a skill set germane to your career interests but at most places you will be trained like being a professor is the end goal. That means LOTS of reading writing and difficult musical social critical etc. theory. It could be an extremely expensive masters programs are rarely free detour to your desired career. Look up articles from the last  years of the journal Ethnomusicology. Look up masters thesis titles from places like Indiana or Wesleyan or Berkley or UCLA respected masters programs with emphases on performance and see if they sound interesting to you. If you have any more specific questions feel free to ask away.TLDR Yes but not without the academic stuff in some capacity. ,ethnomusicology,cfuqfcv,5,t5_2u91h

An ethnomusicological approach to conflict would most likely involve living as the people in the conflict live and understanding how music changes these peoples understanding or how the music effects their world view.,ethnomusicology,czay8nq,1,t5_2u91h
