2954053,0,t1_co3gc1c,Thanks that helps concrete my plans.gt Expect to be paid extremely low wages and hate living in Ireland unless youre specifically only looking to live in DublinI am looking to worklive in Dublin though Im curious about the first part.Im expecting a significant pay cut the Bay Areas salary for tech workers is crazy inflated and foreign workers are usually paid less not to mention currency differences but what do you consider extremely low wages? And why would I hate living there? Id like to make sure my expectations match reality.Software jobs are usually on the higher end as far as wages go. But obviously Ive got no idea what the market is like in Ireland. ,IreJobs,co3w1vz,1,t5_2u3gy
8120853,0,t1_d4sfwcr,  I just finished my degree in IT. It was really hard for me to get it. Since high school I had a passion with computers mostly the operating systems the software stuff like that. I chose to go to IT school because of that but I found out that programming is not my interest it was too hard for me. I only liked the technical stuff like repairing something and technical assistance. So ideally Id like to work in technical support but for now Id do okay in food service hotels since I have some experience in that working  summers in USA with a workamptravel visa. Later if Ill gather myself a budget Im thinking of attending some courses and switch to technical support.  Is it hard to find some shared place to live? Im not very demanding in life conditions. I know it will be hard I have some harsh expectations Im ready for everything right now.,IreJobs,d4suung,1,t5_2u3gy
