I could have done justice of the peace or Notre Dame Cathedral and it would have been one and the same to me. I was getting what I wanted my bride. I was perfectly happy to help in any way. But it was her show so I figured she should get what she wanted.So one day she came in crying. I asked what what was wrong. Evidently the problem was that by not having a passionate opinion about teal vs aqua I was demonstrating that I didnt care.So I started pitching ideas desserts decorations whatever. And I was told No dear I didnt want to hear your opinion I just wanted you to have one. So I shut back up. I was happy. She was happy.

But I didnt really start cussing until th grade when we would be at the back of the playground just cussing for fun. I did get into trouble for calling a girl a slut for stepping on my fingers on the playground though. That being said I dont cuss around my  year old and never have. With the exception of an accidental slip up and I have the vocabulary of a sailor.

Fun facts about oilrigdad     Ive been there for me it was booze every time shit got too hard to deal with.     Ive got about the same amount of smarts as a bag of rocks and dont know much of anything about about writing.     Ive paid out of my own pocket for every gift Ive had the last  years!     Ive never let them go uncleaned unfed or undressed.     Ive said before and glad to see someone else finding it all the horror stories are by far not the norm.     Ive even drunk from the bottle and perfectly enjoyed it.     Ive always made sure they know that its not me cutting them out.     Ive suggestedsubtly tried to encourage my kid to join groups I also understand why she doesnt want to though.     Ive talked to on the Internet and basically this sub.     Ive suggested before she should join whatever lgbt groups at her school and she would ask me why?.

Like ever. Because no matter how many times I add zero to zero I get zero. Ill never get to  .... This means that the answer isnt  or even infinity the answer doesnt exist.So you cant divide by zero.

11749536,0,t1_dgridxj,I agree I am probably likely to use it for emphasis particularly when speaking or writing lyrics for symmetry or to keep the timing Thinking of a certain Green Day song as one example..In the written example I would typically write it fully if it has better flow.  That being said I typically write from a businessutilitarian perspective so I would absolutely violate rules if I thought it would help my audience get the message though you need to be careful with major grammar items as some people will judge you and discredit what you are saying.Bobs a painter author and the best lawyer on the planet. sounds awkward to me and while it is maybe not ambiguous if you take the time to fully dissect it it may stop some brains so I would likely write it out  Bobs a painter an author and the best lawyer on the planet. Getting back to the oxford comma I have to say that I have seen more people run into trouble omitting it than including it so I would likely include it by default.  Again in the business world if you are working with addresses and company names that contain andamp on a consistent basis it will just make the thought process automatic.,dadjokes,dgru83c,2,t5_2t0no
