Im currently reading CtrlAltDelete which is highly interesting for a variety of reasons  including writing marketing etc. Advice Pick a singular detailed niche and try to get some intern experience. Or just zero in on that niche reach out to them and tell them youll write their first few pieces for free. After that youre hired for the next few projects at your rate.

649938,0,t1_cge4sg9,Sort of like mentor but less formal and with no obligations. More just like make the coffee in return for being allowed to sit in on meetings ask questions and maybe help out with some mundane stuff maybe while youre there ask to look at their last few pieces of client work and do some tweets that link to their site and show off the work or something  its the sort of thing they might not have the time for and which you could do to show off your skills a little maybe enough to come back or even better get a recommendation from them you can use to get into another office and start meeting people.Dont suggest it for a week or anything just do it for two days or an afternoon if you do it for a week you might just end up being a gopher. If it works out reply with a nice handwritten letter to say how great it was and exciting and youd love to be considered for some work in the meantime heres a bunch of Facebook updates youve written for their client or some research youve done off your own bat for a project theyre working on  just in case it proves helpful and to thank them for their time.It can be a really nice way to get in the door with agencies too small to afford interns and so on. And its an approach you could try in a number of places. Of course this might not work at all but getting a job that actually offers you experience isnt just about standing out its about being reliable about being interesting and interested  someone they want to have around because you actually add value. And please note I say this not because I think books and guides and courses arent helpful. They are. But you need to consider your strategy BEYOND what your rivals and peers are offering in a very competitive space  and you have to show that you can help yourself. ,copywriting,cge5c6y,2,t5_2qq49

1280522,0,t3_28qcn8,gt Yes reading badly edited or stilted copy can be a bit tedious. But if it gets the message across then where is the harm?The harm in this case is that your blog post comes across as a poorlyveiled effort at saying blogging on your own sucks you should outsource your blog and pay us money to do it.In this post youve listed your three reasons as to why companies should not outsource their blogs and hence maintain blogs themselves. First you say anyone can write and immediately proceed to provide the worstcase scenario of badly edited or stilted copy that would have a presumably negative impact on the presentation of your entire company. Secondly you say finding the time to blog is easy which apparently depends on writing the most minimalworthless blog posts ever because research now apparently means reading Wikipedia and finding the time to write from boring meetings or sales calls.And lastly its apparently now fine not to post regular fresh content  as long as you dont mind potential customers going off to find rival companies that are able to present a more professional image.Just listen to your own tone of voice with a few select quotesBut sure anyone can write.Yep finding the time to blog is easy.They will likely quickly find a rivals to make them feel better.But it really doesnt matter if your own blog is a bit average. It might just be a bit awkward in the odd sales or pitch meeting.So your blog post supposedly focused on explaining why you shouldnt outsource your blog manages to paint the picture of you can maintain your own blog if you want to adversely affect your company and produce poor or mediocre content. Coming from a company that profits from outsourced copy this is slightly ridiculous to say the least.But what really really annoys me about this is that youve failed to provide any value at all through your own writing to anyone reading your blog  just scaremongering and a thinlyveiled sales effort. Its true that bloggingcontent marketing ultimately is to drive new leads and larger audiences but for goodness sake at least do your job right by providing value to your audience even if theyre not paying customers not by publishing the exact definition of a poor blog post thats staining the professionalism and image of your company.,copywriting,cidoc5g,2,t5_2qq49

Nice.As an additional formatting point centralised text is harder to read than standard left to right. Along with the colour scheme which isnt easy on the eyes this formatting combo is putting a barrier between yourself and the reader. As such you might put people off your product before theyve even read the copy.

Those can go a long way in securing new work. Consider the hourly jobs.

6666121,0,t3_46y4he,Its all about your book. If your work is good then the chances of someone hiring you is much better. Most people start out as interns as they break into the industry. Thats how I got in. I had a really mediocre book but showed a lot of drive and a CD saw that and brought me on. Fast forward a year and now Im fulltime at a different agency with some freelancing done in between my internship and fulltime job. Another thing to consider even if a job asks for X years experience just know that its more of a wish than a requirement. So if youre confident apply. If you have any other questions let me know.

9969772,0,t3_5ibkv1,Hey there Neville!First of all a huge thank you for taking the time to do this AMA and offering your invaluable insights and experience and another thank you for kindling some fire into copywriting!So Ill grab this unique opportunity and ask a few questions myself Would you advise for or against specializing in a specific niche? A lot of copywriters argue that you can make much more money this way since you have extended experience in a specific niche and businesses from that field would pay a premium. My personal reservation is that I like being able to work on different topics from time to time it adds some variety and versatility and I am afraid that I will get burnt writing just for one topic In your experience what would you say is the best way to network and acquire more clients? You already mentioned that your blog is the main channel from which your get new clients but for someone like me  whose blog gets the  the traffic yours gets  and it will take me years just to build such a valuable blog what would be the next best thing? aka how do I get clients if I am not Neville from Kopywritingkourse?If you could give just one advice to an aspiring copywriter what would that be?At the moment I work as a freelancer but I am contemplating joining an agency and then later on depending on the situation returning to freelancing again with much higher rates. Do you think that would be wise? Have you always worked as a freelancer or have you been an agencyinhouse copywriter as well?Lastly a personal one the general consensus supports the definition that Copywriting is salesmanship in print. the print part is irrelevant nowadays do you agree with that? Personally I consider copywriting as much science as it is art. I think of it as the perfect combination of these two elements  on the one hand you have the raw creativity and on the other hand the laws and the rules of copywriting that have to distil and filter said creativity in order to deliver something truly unique. What do you think?I am really sorry for the longmany questions but its a once in a lifetime opportunity having the chance to ask you anything so I couldnt resist!Thank you again for this AMA Neville! Oh and happy holidays! George,copywriting,db736k1,4,t5_2qq49

Tell them that if they wish they can use it all for free.Then say that you love what theyre doing and even though you understand they have their own copywriters in place at the moment youd love to write for them some time in the future.Presuming what you write for them isnt a load of crap this will at the minimum put you on their radar for the future...
