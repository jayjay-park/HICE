7782672,0,t1_d3qt876,Well that is a given. Nobody has an obligation to however there are logical reasons to such as reaching a wider install base longevity of the content more platforms less chance for being lost in time differences of platform also give more choice to the user with the choice now being about the merit of each platform as opposed to being forced into artificial thought traps.If it was just their desire to only make it for oculus then I would just say its rather silly of them as a business not to capture the rest of the market but go figure. However it seems to be the alternative in that Oculus is trying to boast their platforms strength by using money to sway devs into locking their content behind a pay wall... a several hundred  paywall which would negatively affect the consumer both monetarily buying the extra hardware and also potentially affect their gameplay the rift cant do  degree rotation for example without a seperate camera.Again I emphasise the point that this is the PC an open platform its not so relevant that sony keeps bloodborne on their system while as a consumer I can find it annoying Oculus are doing something different here and trying to impose artificial blockades onto a once open platform. This supposed exclusivity deal is but one part of a large problem people if they want the PC and future of VR to be healthy and open need to oppose.,superhot,d3qtplg,3,t5_2yhkx

7960748,0,t1_d4akd1x,Its a fair assessment of the business pressures on Oculus and I say this as someone who only buys games that provide Steam keys because I prefer a single unified library rather than trying to remember different account details for every digital distribution platform especially when I might only own a couple of games that i play every few months on UPlay or similar requiring me to reset my password everytime I wish to play FarCry after formatting perhaps if they opted to support OpenID authentication in some form it would be a less strong decision.The best we can hope for is that Oculus as a business reaches a threshold sooner rather than later whereby they can move away from timed exclusive access to games towards more accepted exclusives such as aesthetic items and similar. Segmenting a market only reduces the number of customers and this is truly harmful to multiplayer and mod driven games which often thrive or die on how active their communities are. Especially when one considers that applying multiplayer to games introduces additional development costs which will make developers even more susceptible to offers for funding.,superhot,d4av37h,1,t5_2yhkx
7968345,0,t1_d4bpjfl,Look man if youre capable of making a point without falling into shouty caps and ranting then Im happy to listen and respond. Get a grip.This shitty business practice has no place on PC and certainly no place on VR  artificially restricting access to content based on hardware in an industry still finding its feet is frankly shameful. If this dev is happy to be a part of that process while also simultaneously screwing over a large section of their supporter base for the sake of investment from the likes of Oculus  they should expect to hear disappointment from their fans and the community as a whole. ,superhot,d4bpudm,1,t5_2yhkx
