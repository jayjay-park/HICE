9548339,0,t1_d9pqvq5,I think this show is being more responsible than ever with its themes. Its still early in the season but how theyve treated Gregs character so far shows that theyre not simply playing everything for laughs. Rebeccas character is the most important character on the show so if they can service Gregs character as well as they have I have no doubt that Rebecca will have her turn as well. But the entire show Is about that were not going to have it happen in just one moment or one episode. I am not surprised if this spoiler about Josh and Rebecca getting married is true because this is being written as as four season show and at that point well be halfway through the show which is still PLENTY of time for Rebecca to understand that being with Josh wont solve her unhappiness. This show has a vision and to get Rebecca to see she needs to change she needs to come to that realization herself and through time. There was a bit of it last season Im The Villain In My Own Story but she lost that clarity after a little while in a relapselike fashion. Having her marry Josh and find herself even still unhappy will be what she needs to fully leave him behind.,crazyexgirlfriend,d9q132q,2,t5_38887

9708274,0,t3_5e4omn,I disagree. I think the breaking of the fourth wall is hilarious. The show doesnt take itself too seriously nor do the songs so it doesnt bother me at all. The songs are obviously imagined anyway so just so long as they only break it in the songs I dont have a problem. And I also think its a funny way of speaking to Rebeccas narcissism. She views herself as a star in a TV show which also ties into her musical theatre background and she technically is but it also plays on her characterization in general. Shes always the one who breaks the fourth wall which is fitting. ,crazyexgirlfriend,da9r4k6,30,t5_38887

10655632,0,t3_5sh4v3,So it seems like I have a paragraph or two to write about every character following the finale. Here what I have about Darryl and White JoshWhite Josh is the most grounded character in the show by far. Hes the only one who really has it together. Thats what caused his relationship with Darryl to be the most functional relationship we got to see. But its not enough that White Josh is so wholesome because well Darryl isnt. Like everyone on the show he is deeply flawed and his hamartia is his neediness. We obviously see it in regards to Paula and Rebecca so how could it not come into play with his boyfriend? Even before the finale I felt a bit uncomfortable with this relationship because it seemed to me that Darryl rushed into his next relationship very soon after a pretty difficult divorce. Dont get me wrong I absolutely love them together but I think Darryl couldve benefited from some alone time to reconcile with himself after his divorce. Its a recurring theme in the show the notion that if you cant be well alone a relationship wont save you and magically fix everything. So no matter how cute Darryl and White Josh are together that flaw that Darryl still has wont disappear. And it hurts their relationship because Darryl is so needy that he tries to rush this relationship and gets way ahead of himself. I dont think they will be a focus on the next season because they almost always served as the cplot but if we will get to delve into that I believe they will break up at least temporarily. I root for them theyre so lovely together but Darryl could use some time to develop and learn to be his own man. I really dont see him as manipulative. Its just that his thirst for love has no boundaries.,crazyexgirlfriend,ddf1oou,20,t5_38887
