475816,0,t1_cfuc8pr,Not gonna happen unless someone puts out the greatest marketing campaign of all time and people buy up the  worth of rabbitcoin it would take to get us just to  sato.And even then dumpers would move their sell walls and dump even more. Any coin with sell orders sitting at  is out for the count unless something miraculous happens.Why dont you come over to rmazacoin and get in on the firstever cryptocoin approved as legal tender within the sovereign Lakota indian reservation. This thing is so big its going to be on the news by the end of the week and you will be kicking yourself for not getting in sooner.Crypto moves WAY too fast for anyone to get attached to any altcoin. The only coin you should really be attached to is bitcoin.,rabbitcoin,cfucpvb,1,t5_30ax0
