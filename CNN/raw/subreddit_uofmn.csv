229368,0,t1_cf4iaqq,where the fuck do i say it shouldnt factor into it? youre so overobsessed with racism that it blinds you of any logic. youre attributing any action that has a single fucking shred of racial attributes as racism. and yes if history has led a certain group to bad credit then they should be denied. to do otherwise is racism itself. youre saying because of your history you dont need to do as well as other races to be approved for credit. do you not see how racist that kind of thinking is? youre not treating races equally. youre saying certain races should be given more leeway. that seems to basis of racism.my statement about thinking toward the future instead of worryign about the past doesnt mean you ignore the past. there a reason we spend fucking  of our schooling on history because you need to learn from the dumhbass mistakes of our ancestors. but its a mistake to fixate on it. instead you gotta look to the future to fix those mistakes. we need to figure out WHY certain races are have a higher propensity to bad credit and fix THAT. is it education? is it drive? if its education then we need to figure out a way to improve the education levels of underprivelaged kids. especially at a young age. if its drive then we need to figure out a way to help children that cant receive the proper parents to push them. whatever the case theres no fucking point in only worrying about the results of the problem. you have to fucking focus on the cause.im done here. youve pissed me off way too much with your shortsightedness. have a nice day.,uofmn,cf4ismr,1,t5_2s492

I have colleagues who got into Dental School and did undergrad in CLA  Chemistry and another doing Biology. Your transfer into CBS will be dependent on your first year GPA.

The fact that youre coming from another Minnesota school will help you and if you have a record as an athlete just make sure that its some how featured in your application. Id really recommend calling the CLA admissions office to make sure that they have all of your application materials. They misspelled my last name when I applied so my application and my student records were in two separate files. If I hadnt called I would probably still be in Chicago. So yeah take care of that and good luck!,uofmn,d0uijkk,2,t5_2s492

8724593,0,t3_4zh8t4,Calc II is a little bit weird. Looking back at Calc I I can remember exactly what I learned. Looking back at Calc II it seems like I learned a really odd mix of seemingly unrelated concepts.Youll learn a bunch of tricky moreadvanced integration techniques then spend a ton of time on sequences and series essentially studying the properties of some infinite lists of numbers and then the sum of said numbers. Then youll learn to use said infinite sum of numbers to approximate some function. Funky stuff.At the end of my class we also did a small array of things with vectors and polar graphs. Stuff that isnt exceptionally difficult but instead just requires a small shift in thinking to pick up.I actually did a little better in Calc II then Calc I possibly just because the problems were a little more straightforward. Seems that Calc I includes more wordproblems. It was also my second semester. My biggest advice would be to take strong notes and to write down not only example problems but also explanations of concepts in words. I found my notes to be really important to my studying and basic understanding of the concepts.,uofmn,d6w7s3u,2,t5_2s492

10143185,0,t3_5l6fvz,Not surprised at all. There is no where close to enough evidence for a criminal case. Its essentially her word which comes with her bad memory against theirs. I dont think this will have any impact on the EOAA issue though. Until an appeals court says otherwise the preponderance of evidence they used is perfectly fine and theres not enough evidence to swing things the other way. This is still going to be an ugly case that hurts the football team and school as a whole and could quite possibly become a Supreme Court case about how public universities can set up their rules. ,uofmn,dbtnt84,7,t5_2s492

Never took the online one so I cant comment on that but the professors werent readily able to answer questions during the lecture. I think if you are selfmotivated enough to read the book take the online version. If not probably better to take the inclass version.,uofmn,dcilvs7,1,t5_2s492
