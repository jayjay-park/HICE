688886,0,t3_221t3y,I would not personally go for a SL  the engines have a serious design flaw timing chain and are thirsty and underpowered.  The resale value is not good so even if the design flaw is not actually a big problem the perception matters.  Not sure about your location but its possible to find a nice but not concours SL for  so you can keep a  reserve to refresh it.    IMHO the k garage queen SLs are much worse value than a well used but solid daily driver for  to  the price.  They are exceptionally well built cars and can take the milage and use so long as they are maintained.    Also if you are so inclined a later SL is also easily in your price range.  Also well built but more complicated.  My experience with the R is that you will have less serious problem but more small annoying problems.  If you are handy with a soldering iron and multimeter the R is great value.,mercedes_benz,cgikta5,2,t5_2tglq

1052509,0,t1_chnuacc,Alright so I did some exploratory mechanic work and with the use of my handy dandy redneck stethoscope A jack crank handle.  Press the open end up against the valve cover and the closed end up against your ear.  Plug the other ear and you can hear whats going on in there without actually taking the valve cover off. it sounds like its either the furthest back second furthest back or both have bent pushrods.  If I had to venture a guess Id say the sleazebag that sold it to me lied about the last time it had an oil change saying hed just changed it that morning so three thousand miles later and about five hundred miles from home I had a mechanic change the oil and charge me an arm and a leg.  This mechanic was pretty clueless when it came to my car overall and I can pretty much guarantee he didnt do what you suggested.  My scientific wild ass guess as to what happened at this point is that the already existing lack of oil pressure before my first oil change with the vehicle put unnecessary stress on the lifters that combined with the increased clearance between them because of the failure to build oil pressure caused them to collapse.  Me being the idiot I am sometimes and trying to ignore my problem until it went away I drove with the tick for a couple weeks which gave the pushrods ample time to get themselves bent.The good news is that the part is only about  online and I can do the job myself.  Ill do a full oil change at the same time and nip the problem in the bud.,mercedes_benz,chnxb7r,1,t5_2tglq

Do a  synthetic oil change instead. The brake hold feature is really nice and often not mentioned by the dealer. Just press the brake pedal a little harder when at a stop and the brake will hold until you touch the gas.

3940327,0,t3_35l680,Holy fuck.  Never let the dealer do rotors and pads.  Its absolutely insane.MB recommends rotor changes at every brake job.  Ive not done it once in about k of driving.  I just follow the manufacturers driving directions engine braking on downgrade and drive gently for a bit after spirited motoring to let the rotors cool.  If you really want to be better than me and you should do rotors every other pad swap.If you can assemble IKEA furniture you can do your own brake pads.The c is a monster.  Displacement.  Theres no replacement for it.  But its a smallish car.Es are getting down into the price range where you can get a serious monster for k or less.  This is a car with so much torque you can literally pull a lawnmower on a trailer still beat most anything else on the road and fit  adults comfortably.  If its the difference between paying cash or taking a loan always pay cash.  Food for thought.  Es are easier to drive less torque so you dont need to be as precise on the throttle.Either way youre looking at a car that will serve you for many years and will have a place in any enthusiasts garage indefinitely.Edit for a quick comment on the wrx its an amazing car.  My friend had one and I borrowed it for a while.  Pure grin machine......... above k rpm.  Its a car that is absolutely amazing in very very specific conditions.  A torque monster is my personal preference because you will have power available to you at any time in your real world driving conditions.  On the track with a wrx one slightly mistimed shift will leave you basically stranded until the turbo spools up again.  The wrx is also going to have little to no long term garage appeal.

4233899,0,t3_39ehts,I owned and drove an  TD for many years and my father owned and drove it before me. After rebuilding the top end of the engine twice im somewhat of an expert on this engine and considering it was one of three W Wagons we have owned the chassis as well.This car is awesome. The diesel engine is my favorite but it does have its issues as all cars do. After looking at the Craigslist add I can tell this car has been exceptionally well cared for. It looks super straight and clean and the interior looks very nice with no dash cracks. Garaged most likelyHowever he doesnt post any pictures of the engine. Which always makes me wary but it is what it is. There is one point for this specific engine that you need to look at tomorrow when you look at the car and that is the Head Cast Number. When facing the front of the car with the hood open look on the right side of the head where the Injectors are. There should be a cast in set of numbers between Injector  and . If not there check between  and . The number will look something like this.The number format should be like this.    .Now in this series of numbes     the bold number is the casting run of the Head. It will be either the number    or . The number  heads are least desirable while  heads are most desirable.  heads are factory replacements the other three are original factory run heads.The reason I bring all this up is because the  heads can and will crack if the car is overheated regularly or even once if the engine temp gets very high. There was a coolant port that was designed in to close to the edge of the metal work where it was and it has a tendency to crack through at which point you will start consuming coolant. Now this issue isnt as serious as it sounds as long as the cooling system of the engine is maintained and functions as intended. Unfortunately for me my cars did not. My engine always ran hot and I cracked two  heads. Sold it with a third installed. So take this into consideration on you test drive. Make sure to do full throttle runs with the AC on and make sure the temp needle doesnt get anywhere close to the danger zone. If it does open the windows and turn on the heater.Now that that is said. You said the the  shift is a bit harder than the rest. This is fairly common among both the gas a diesel variants of the W Wagons and Sedans. Nothing to be to worried about unless its uncomfortably jarring. If it is slipping between gears that is something to take more seriously.Lastly the seller mentions this car is fast................ Well..... its not. I promise you that. It will do mph in  seconds if you are lucky. All of the cars with this engine that i have driven manage it somewhere between  seconds in ideal conditions. However it does rev to k so you will have passing power not as much as you are used to but its more than usable.Good luck tomorrow if I lived down where you are I would be buying that car.,mercedes_benz,cs2up28,8,t5_2tglq

The euro headlights are worth at least .

Youll benefit from the MCT transmission more up to date interiorexterior as well avoiding the headbolt issue.Im terms of options if you want more power I think about bhp and an LSD go for the performance package. I didnt do this as I wont be tracking it or putting my neck on the line going around corners on UK roads! Also recommend the Harmon kardon sound system and adjustable seats with lumbar support etc.Finally do it! I honestly couldnt find any other car for the money that ticks so many boxes and gives me an ear to ear grin every time I turn the ignition.

The C class is larger than the cla which feels really claustrophobic for a mercedes especially the back where even with  doors has headroom for a stuffed toy and the materials seems to have lower quality.Of course you are also getting  more cylinders and an extra century horsepower if you are concerned about whats under the hood. The C class also has the tried and tested rwd that pleasingly pushes you along while the cla has a novel fwd that feels odd on certain roads and starved of torque.

10878447,0,t1_de212w0,gtSomebody who wants a sporty luxurious convertible will get the S cabrioDepends on budget. The way Benz equips most of the Scoupe the average S cabriolet can cost almost x as much as a similarly equipped SL to say nothing of the AMG models averaging K. Though I agree the introduction of the S cabrio does eat into their space a little.I dont think the SL model is what they would make sportier though itd lose even more uniqueness given the AMGGT.That said I do think the R is the least inspiring the SL has been in a while. The new facelifted front end looks nice but it still seems too reminiscent of the facelifted previousgen cars like the facelifted W and the rest of the body never improved much from the R.Hell maybe Im starting to agree with you. The R would be fine and not redundant if not for the AMGGT. If anything I thought the AMGGT should have been called the SL going to be even more ferocious given the SL basically already exists in that price range and space. Seems like a halo car without halo car performance or price like the previous SLR and SLS and AMG makes versions of the regular Benz line that are faster so why not call the AMGGT the SL? Give it some gullwing doors andor a standard folding hardtop and you have a HUGE leap forward in design as previous SL redesigns have been except for the boring jump from the R to the R.,mercedes_benz,de21919,1,t5_2tglq
10887953,0,t1_de2xsvm,Thanks for the info. I did like the Porsche a lot  I have not driven the new one yet  I think they just did an update  refresh  redesign right? I could be wrong. The one I drove was a base model   so while it was fun to drive it didnt have the oomph that my CLS does. However I know if I do get the Panamera Ill be getting the Turbo. Do they share the same technology infotainment area as the Audis? Thats the big thing I loved about the S  it seemed to have the most intuitive technology and use of technology than the others. Im not a big fan of how Mercedes does it  although I do know they changed things up in  and I dont have the newer one with the tabletlike screen. And yes the S Class does look big  and I bet it feels bigger than the Panamera as well.
