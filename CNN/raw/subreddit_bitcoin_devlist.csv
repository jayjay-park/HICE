I personally think moving it away now would be seen as a gesture thatgtgt we do not consider their behavior to be acceptable.  There are also somegtgt benefits in being hosted elsewhere at an entity able to professionallygtgt maintain their infrastructure while also being neutral to the content.gtgtgtgtgtgt Proposal Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral Competent Entitygtgtgtgtgtgt Bitcoin is a global infrastructure development project where it would begtgt politically awkward for any of the existing Bitcoin companies or orgs togtgt host due to questions it would raise about perceived political control.gtgt For example consider a bizarro parallel universe where MtGox was thegtgt inventor of Bitcoin where they hosted its development infrastructure andgtgt dev list under their own name.  Even if what they published was gtgt technically and ideologically equivalent to the Bitcoin we know in ourgtgt dimension most people wouldnt have trusted it merely due to appearancesgtgt and it would have easily gone nowhere.gtgtgtgtgtgt I had a similar thought process last week when sidechains code wasgtgt approaching release. Sidechains like Bitcoin itself are intended to be agtgt generic piece of infrastructure like ethernet? that anyone can build upongtgt and use.  We thought about Google Groups or existing orgs that already hostgtgt various open source infrastructure discussion lists like the IETF or thegtgt Linux Foundation.  Google is too controversial in this community and thegtgt IETF is seen as possibly too politically fractured.  The Linux Foundationgtgt hosts a bunch of infrastructure lists and it seems that nobody in the Opengtgt Source industry considers them to be particularly objectionable.  I talkedgtgt with LF about the idea of hosting generic Bitcoinrelated infrastructuregtgt development lists.  They agreed as OSS infrastructure dev is already withingtgt their charter so early this week sidechainsdev list began hosting there.gtgtgtgtgtgt From the perspective of our community for bitcoindev it seems like a greatgtgt fit.  Why?  While they are interested in supporting general open sourcegtgt development the LF has literally zero stake in this.  In addition togtgt neutrality they seem to be suitable as a competent host.  They havegtgt fulltime sysadmins maintaining their infrastructure including the Mailmangtgt server. They are soon upgrading to Mailman  which means mailing listsgtgt would benefit from the improved archive browser.  I am not personallygtgt familiar with HyperKitty but the point here is they are a stable nonprofitgtgt entity who will competently maintain and improve things like their Mailmangtgt deployment a huge improvement over the stagnant Sourceforge.  It seemsgtgt that LF would be competent neutral place to host dev lists for thegtgt longterm.gtgtgtgtgtgt To be clear this proposal is only about hosting the discussion list.  Thegtgt LF would have no control over the Bitcoin Project as no single entitygtgt should.gtgtgtgtgtgt Proposed Action Plangtgtgtgtgtgt Discuss this openly within this community.

From theusers perspective it would be somewhat upsetting and confusing to seeyour balance slowly draining every time you open your wallet app. It wouldalso tie up outputs every time you open up your wallet. You may go to payfor something in a coffee shop only to find that you cant spend yourbitcoin because the wallet had to create a transaction to pay to sync withthe network.Also users of centralized wallet services like Coinbase would not have topay that fee but users of native wallets like breadwallet would have nosuch option.

I see many claims on this list that suchandsuch action will increase or decrease centralization and sometimes people talk in absolutes such as something being decentralized or centralized.   Some of the arguments seem to make claims without providing any kind of analysis or explanation.Nothing is truly decentralized and decentralization is just an approximation of having a collection of centralized systems interact in some way.

But to be clear what Im trying to solve is basically thisWho makes highlevel Bitcoin decisions? Miners client devs merchants orusers? Lets set up a system where everyone has a say and clear acceptancecan be reached.My motivation for writing this proposal is stated right at the startgt The current process for accepting a BIP is not clearly defined. WhileBIP defines the process for writing and submitting a BitcoinImprovement Proposal to the community it does not specify the precisemethod for which BIPs are considered accepted or rejected.BIPs are considered accepted right now based on an undefined systemquite honestly. Btc Drak Whats the system for accepting a BIP? Words likeconsensus come up but they arent defined. My goal is to define a systemthat makes finding consensus I like the word acceptance better in aclear and fair way.I.e. whats broken? Being sure that a proposal is widely accepted or rejected Preventing deadlock i.e. one persons weak objections preventingacceptance Receiving feedback from important segments like user groupsmerchantsexchanges etc. in a systematic and clear way instead of goingand forth or having oracles on technical advisory boards.gt Yes the process is loose but is it broken?YesNo. Work gets done with the current process. Work can get done withthis process. The goal is for this process is to be saferclearerbetterdefined way.gt There have been a flood ofgt BIPs added recently with zero bureaucracy or friction.As we move forward we want to balance the powers in such a way that we maywant to pause a bit before we accept each proposal.  weeks for comments  weeks for opinions will slow things down but it shouldnt stallmeaningful work. I used  weeks for the process with the understanding thatmost proposals are clear and easily acceptable. Controversial proposalswill likely need more time and thus will likely have be submitted at leasttwice to discover a clear response.Accepting a BIP means just that Its accepted. Whats acceptance mean?This proposal provides an answer.Client implementations users miners and merchants can feel safeimplementing and using a feature that has clear acceptance. This processisnt meant to force anything on client implementors users miners ormerchants.On Fri Sep   at  PM Btc Drak ltbtcdrak at gmail.comgt wrotegt Im rather perplexed about this proposal. What exactly is wrong withgt the existing BIPs process? I mean it seems to me anyone can publish agt BIP pretty easily in the BIPs repository. There doesnt seems to be anygt real barrier to entry whatsoever. I know there have been all manner ofgt aspersions but having just written two BIPs there was no friction atgt all.gtgt Whether the ecosystem adopts a BIP is another question of course butgt thats out of scope of the BIPs project anyhow. Take BIPgt controversial as it gets but its there. Whether Bitcoin implementersgt implement it is another kettle of fish and a matter for each projectgt to decide. Its absolutely NOT the realm of the BIPs project itself.gt Bitcoin Core does not make any consensus critical changes with a BIP.gt Where one seeks to establish certain standards say for privacy a BIPgt would be appropriate so the ecosystem can harmonise methodology acrossgt the board.gtgt The status of a BIP is not really determined by anyone its bygt adoption  thats where consensus happens. Theres a little legroomgt around this but Im not entirely sure what you are trying to solve.gt Yes the process is loose but is it broken? There have been a flood ofgt BIPs added recently with zero bureaucracy or friction.gtgt BIP is the BIP that defines the BIP process. Interestingly enoughgt the only BIP that might be controversial is in fact a BIP to changegt the way BIPs are handled!gtgt So Id really prefer to start this conversation with a breakdown ofgt what you think is broken first before tackling what may or may notgt need fixing. I would be very cautious bringing administrativegt burdens to the process or evicting common sense from the proceedings.gt Much of the debates around consensus building seem to negate thegt importance of common sense and the simple fact that its obvious whengt you see it.gtgt Im sure there can be improvements but for me personally I need togt see what is broken before I can make any judgement on a potential waygt forward and if its not broken we should leave it alone.gtgtgt On Fri Sep   at  AM Andy Chase via bitcoindevgt ltbitcoindev at lists.linuxfoundation.orggt wrotegt gt As postedgt gtgt gt EnforcementOrganization I agree with your comments.

With softforks the result of a SPV wallet following thegt highest work chain is the same eventually invalid blocks are reorgedgt out.gtgt However because softforks make it less likely that a long invalidgt chain will be generated an attacker sybil attacking your SPV wallet hasgt a much harder time tricking it into accepting a transaction. they mightgt get one or two confirmations rather than dozensgtgt Whats the scenario where softforks are worse than hardforks from agt SPV wallets perspective?I dont think this was addressed clearly so heres my attempt.With a soft fork miners who have not upgraded append their blocks to the longest block chain. To SPV clients and to old fullyvalidating clients it appears to be a valid block that inevitably gets orphaned. SPV clients will be tricked to follow these blocks every time they appear since every time they appear they will have a PoW advantage for a few minutes. SPV clients will appear to behave normally and will continue to show new transactions and get confirmations in a timely fashion. However they will be systematically susceptible to attack from doublespends that attempt to spend funds in a way that the upgraded nodes will reject. These transactions will appear to get  confirmation then regress to zero conf every single time. These attacks can be performed for as long as someone mines with the old version. If an attacker thinks he could get more than  BTC of doublespends per block he might even choose to mine with the obsolete version in order to get predictable orphans and to trick SPV clients and fully verifying wallets on the old version.With a hard fork miners who have not upgraded will append their blocks on the shorter fork. SPV clients will ignore this fork unless Sybil attacked. If an SPV node only connects to one full node server thats equivalent to a Sybil attack.  In that case transactions on the long chain will often not be present on the short chain due to its shortness. Confirmations will be slow and will be shown to be very different from whats shown on block explorers. Displayed transaction dates and times will be off when they show up at all. Any transactions that have been contaminated by recent mining revenue will not show up at all. SPV client users will probably notice something is wrong. If the SPV client connects to several full nodes then this should rarely happen. For example if  of full nodes are still on the old version and an SPV wallet connects to  nodes at a time there is a .  . chance. If the SPV client has headers cached on disk from a previous connection to the longer chain then that chance effectively drops to zero. As a further benefit to hard forks anybody who is ideologically opposed to the change can continue to use the old version successfully as long as there are enough miners to keep the fork alive.In short soft forks mean frequent predictable and manipulable orphan blocks that SPV clients will always follow with transactions that get confirmed once and then permaorphaned. Hard forks mean that SPV clients will almost always work flawlessly and will occasionally give very strange and noticeably wrong results. For fullyverifying nodes soft forks make old versions insecure but hard forks allow new and old versions to operate in parallel. next part A nontext attachment was scrubbed...Name signature.ascType applicationpgpsignatureSize  bytesDesc Message signed with OpenPGP using GPGMailURL ltoriginal ,bitcoin_devlist,cxx0xeb,1,t5_38w3t

In effectit is reinstating a legacy limitation.The message size limit is to minimize the storage required per peer.  If aMB block size is required then each network input buffer must be atleast MB. This makes it harder for a node to support a large number ofpeers.There is no reason why a single message is used for each block.  Using themerkleblock message or a different dedicated message it would bepossible to send messages which only contain part of a block and have alimited maximum size.This would allow receiving parts of a block from multiple sources.This is a separate issue but should be considered if moving past MB blocksizes or maybe as a later protocol change.gtgt    .

That gt means that if a miner was using an older presegwit version of gt Bitcoin Core to produce blocks after segwit activates that blocks gt they find will be valid to all nodes.IOW Bitcoin Core has been implemented so that it will not see validblocks announced by certain of its peers. Forcing it to see suchblocks requires the pp network work around its implementation. Iagree that this is not inherent in the specifications for segwit butit reads more like a bug than an implementation detail to me.eBEGIN PGP SIGNATUREVersion GnuPG v..

The advantage of verycustom unit tests is that they run almost instantly at the cost ofrequiring painstaking maintenance and missing more stuff.
