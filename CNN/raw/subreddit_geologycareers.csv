2825703,0,t1_cnp9jii,Well for those things you are going to need a degrees. Probably more than one to get into archaeology. It does go well with geology though Everybody that studies geology likes to be outside. I have never met anyone who went into the field planning to spend their time indoors. Except maybe some people who just wanted to be lab rats Archaeology sites are very interesting and many people would like to do them so theyre quite competitive to get. You are unlikely to pull that off without earning at least a BS probably a MSc maybe even a PhD in archaeology. I suppose you could get a job as a laborer but youre not going to be doing the interesting stuff.For environmental work you will have to have a degree. There are people who work at those sites as laborers who do not have degrees like the guys who suit up in the levelA think of those giant yellow suits the ebola doctors wear stuff and open drums of whoknowswhat. Or perhaps an equipment operator I dont know the qualifications for that probably some kind of trade school or at least a driving class of some kind? I have a friend who drives a truck for the oil fields and hes getting trained all the time in stuff like operating cranes. But he just drives the trucks  no decision making really.Point is if you want to just literally be working at the location you could probably pull it off without a degree but to have any kind of impact or be involved in any kind of decision making etc you have to show that you can pass a university program.

3638793,0,t3_321kne,You covered a ton of content in your post. Im gonna try to follow along. gt I came to the decision that I wasnt quite ready to abandon my geo degree BSc. Geology General  UTAUT Austin? If so as an alumni you have access to the Jackson School Career Services center I used to work with the Director there and she is a really good resource. There is also pretty incredible alumni networking ability within JSG. I count myself amongst those if you want to drop me a PM. I graduated in ... I wonder if we know each other?Just as a general thought you kind of bemoan office politics. That shit happens everywhere so its just kind of a crap shoot as to whether it happens to you. gt If it means more stable scheduling and better sense of professional development Im for it.Depending on your area and especially at the beginning of your environmental career it is very likely that you will be cursed with a very hectic very fieldheavy schedule. You cant learn the ropes and manage projects if you havent been the field slave. gt One thing I fret over is if my work experience carries over any relevance into the new field. I get the foreboding sense that the nearly  years I worked in microseismic would be worthless compared to some fresh graduate with the relevant courses undergraduate research and internships. However Ive been told by some that this isnt necessarily true and that any experience trumps no experience.I can play both sides of this but it largely depends on role. If i need someone to turn wrenches Im probably going to pick the fresh college grad. Not everyone is going to end up managing projects and I want their billing rate as low as possible for as long as possible. Its a shitty reality but its reality. If I saw a resume like yours heres what I know you can interpret data extremely important youre worth something stuck with the same company for  years youre an experienced worker. Id peg your more as someone with potential to move up the project management ladder. That said the learning curve in environmental is enormous. It will take years for you to be comfortable with the subject matter.gt One thing I regret not having done immediately after graduating was taking the ASBOG FG. Having that done with out of the way would have been a good first step for any direction but now Im hitting the books to review my learning so I can take it within the year. If I can land a job in enviro and hang on enough to take and pass the PG I feel that would be a significant milestone. Yeah its a hard test for sure. Plan on studying for a few months. Take the reg review course. Brush up hard on hydro as there is a ton of hydro content. I did it with an infant in the house and extreme sleep deprivation. You can do it too. gt Also many job listings put HAZWOPER  as a requirement but that can usually happen in the beginning after hiring for most companies right?It can happen sure. I did it that way. However as someone who is kind of missing the environmentalhydro schooling part of the equation that consultants find desirable you may want to take the onus to do it yourself as a credential. gt Some seem to ask for  years experience with well samples and using the tools of the trade. Im not sure where one would have learned that unless one specifically studied hydro in college and interned for a bit during. How open are consulting companies with onthejob training?Even the jump from hydro in college to workplace is enormous. Training takes years and is omnipresent. Technologies change regulatory requirements change. Ask around I bet there might be a consultant in your area who might let you come in and check out their inhouse equipment. Alternatively maybe check out a place like pine environmental equipment rental and tell them what you have going on. They might love to show you around if theyre not too busy and think they might get your business in the future. gt Another path to take is to apply for grad school as most jobs in geosciences and most of STEM in general pretty much require an M.S. to get started into the industry.Not necessary for environmental at all. Its a relative rarity IMO. gt Of course theres also Professional Masters degrees depending on what area I want to work on and that could also be a decent intermediate level to further strengthen my foundations.Wouldnt recommend this at all. Theyre pricey and a MSc with no thesis is kinda just like why?gtEven now Im still iffy on the idea because I am still petrified of the process of figuring out what school would make sense what advisor and specialty I should pursue and being creative enough to figure out a subject to base a thesis on when theres so much in the body of knowledge I risk retreading old ground. Of course theres also Professional Masters degrees depending on what area I want to work on and that could also be a decent intermediate level to further strengthen my foundations.I was in the same boat as you last year. It took pulling every string I had to get my application to a place where I had a dice roll chance at getting in. gt Is there anything else I should know to better prepare myself for getting into enviro geo work and how are the prospects in general in light of the oil downturn and mass layoffs?   Find ways to talk to people in the industry. Chat them up. Prospects for environmental are almost always good. People will always spill stuff and always buy property that is contaminated.  gtAm I expecting to be jockeying with other former energy geos for a spot in the door?Yeah HOLY SHIT IM ABOUT TO PASS OUT. ,geologycareers,cq71suj,9,t5_2x755

6896088,0,t1_d0r18dk,Well resource development involves quite a few things. On one side you have the work of exploration geos who go through making cross sections on vulcan and on paper trying to figure the type and shape of the deposit based on drill hole data. The general goal is to find potential controlling factors structure sedimentological etc. that they can use as an exploration tool. This is where I sorta disagree with Maverick in that a strong geologic science background can be really useful coming up with models of your deposit. You gotta be well versed in lots of different facets of geology to be really effective. Then you have mine geos who update the models and make sure everyone is digging at the right place. Combination of logging core makingupdating vulcan models and mapping pitunderground faces.Then you have resource definition people basically they use lots of statistics like krieging to figure out how much ore you have based on your assay results so you can report that to investors.

Why arent they reporting the median salaries to avoid the skew of people making k a year versus those making k a year? Even if they insisted on using the average they could at least include a confidence interval so we know if its likely the reported figures contain the true population mean or if theyre at the imbalance of accuracy and precision. Its just not nearly enough info at all. That said if youre doing anything just for big money then of course its setting yourself up for disappointment.

My understanding is that tenure track positions are very challenging to get and that teaching at community colleges non tenure is stressful pays poorly and you often have to drive from college to college to make enough money to live. For me getting a PhD would be good for government research jobs and at its worst would not take me out of the game for an OampG job. At this point I am not sure I would stick with OampG either way but in this economy I will take what I can get. I have a second interview with an environmental consultant company this week but its definitely not in the bag so to speak so I am thinking about if I should just take that if offered.I also understand that some consulting companies like PhDs in related fields Ive heard Jacobs has hired a few. I think my largest concern is closing more doors than I open.

9257071,0,t3_576j34,Please check out the AMAs sidebar gt to see the different career paths related to geology.The major industries that hire geology grads are  environmental consulting  mining and  oil and gas. pays the least generally starting around  but is the most stable. Usually requires lotsa  unglamorous fieldwork starting out e.g. sampling soil andor groundwater around industrial or toxic sites. A lot of people say that keeping track of billable hours is a pain. Requires a BS to start but I have heard that companies are raising the education bar due to the recent glut of grad degree holders looking for jobs. Arguably the most boom and bust of the three. The closest thing to the rural rock hunting type of career you are imagining. Work schedules are generally something like x days on y days off. Can pay pretty well but can be harsh on relationships. Mining as a sector has been in a slump since around  due to low commodities prices but some say that things are starting to pick up recently. Requires a BS to start. Also boom and bust. Pays the most. MSPhD holders can expect sixfigure salaries starting out. Petroleum geoscientists are generally desk jockeys who spend a lot of time in front of computers doing interpretation and exploration stuff unless you are a well site geologist. BS holders mostly go into mudlogging which is a pretty shit lifestyle. Currently in the biggest bust of the industrys  yr history.  professionals have been laid off globally since mid so there are lotsa veterans fighting for very few new jobs and the majority of the recent graduates are not getting hired. Things might pick up a few years but not one knows. If you are in LA then  remember Bakersfield is a major oampg hub but its hit pretty hard and do you really want to go there...?And there are government jobs and research jobs but there are relatively few of them.Expect  years in school  grad school if you have no transferable coursework.Hate to burst your bubble but you are most likely not going to do the type of meadowskipping geology for a career as you might be imagining unless you are in the academia and are capable of getting grants to do exotic fieldwork.,geologycareers,d8pefb0,13,t5_2x755

9477316,0,t1_d9fyyzq,Hi therockhoundI can mainly speak about work in the private sector related to earthquake hazards. After the  San Fernando earthquake the AlquistPriolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was passed in CA. Basically this act says that you cant build buildings across active faults. One of the results of this is that there is a lot of private sector paleoseismic work being done around California to ensure that new construction doesnt occur on active fault traces. This work is primarily done to inform potential builders about the possibility of new construction areas but the data collected can also be used to help inform seismic hazard studies. Additionally there are a lot of opportunities in the geologic consulting field that are related to assessing sites and structures for hazards like landslides surface rupture lateral spreading liquefaction etc. These groups hire geologists and are particularly interested in people that have experience with technologies like ArcGIS and lidar.

10906101,0,t3_5vt1ed,You will not be able to work for a big firm with company vehicles.  So look at the locals...the small companies and talk to them.  The problem is that if you have a wreck resulting in an injury to another party their lawyers will chew you and the company out for hiring a person with a convicted dui.It isnt impossible but difficult.  Mostly because of the insurance that the company will have to pay for you to drive.  Hope this helps best of luck. ,geologycareers,de4vxy4,2,t5_2x755

11074356,0,t1_den8gwi,I have limited information on your interests and motivations other than your interest in hydrology. I would say Environmental Engineering is the best degree for you in terms of a BS because you will be competitive for hydrology positions but you will also be very competitive for a broad spectrum of positions varying through several consulting and remediation disciplines. The way I have seen things at my office an Environmental Engineer can perform the same work as an Environmental Geologist for the most part but an Environmental Geologist often doesnt have the skill set to perform the same work as the Engineer. Some Geologists with a lot of experience have the skills to perform the Engineers work but these Geos typically have their PG and are the few that have not become burnt out from the consulting industry. ,geologycareers,den9o2f,1,t5_2x755

With only a bachelors Ive got friends that work in OampG mining metals and industrial minerals hydrology a huge variety of geotechnical work etc.  If you have a decent GPA  you can get internships after your sophomore year and if youre exceptional after freshman year. Knowing that you can become a licensed engineer AND a licensed geologist would open a lot of doors regardless of what you decide to do.

11240982,0,t1_df4rtlf,gt  but Id say that theres a thin line between being stupid and being smart. Its about applying yourself and hard work that separates the stupid from the smart.Applying ones self and hard work dont cut it alone. After teaching and working in the real world I can tell you that there are plenty of people that do both and plenty of people come up short of smart. Sure they can be relied on to fill a role but if youre talking about allocating all resources innovating and attaining a material goal the majority of people cant do that. Ive had bossessupervisoresclients with MScs before I even had my BSc and I could tell within a few days that they arent particularly capable of highlevel functioning theyll generally make it halfway up and stay at that level based purely on their faculty. If they make it beyond that its either luck or luck.,geologycareers,df65ddy,2,t5_2x755

Im not sure about with the environmental sector but I will say that generally internships can only help unless they set you timewise. I work with people with both bachelors and masters degrees. Many people suggest skipping grad school if your end goal is to stay in environmental as it doesnt seem to add too much to career progression.
