1493793,0,t1_cg622np,He didnt score that one though Klaus Badelt did. Zimmer produced it. And was probably in the studio more often than not while it was being recorded but Klaus Badelt was the the main guy there,soundtracks,cj3ispa,2,t5_2rkiv
1580611,0,t3_2boqzf,The Last Samurai is pretty good. The latter tracks get more speedy. not incredibly violiny but nice and quietrelaxingId also recommend Princess Mononoke Lady in the Water Also by James Newton Howard to did the Village and Angels and Demons by Hans Zimmer. Its got some tracks with really great fast violins mixed with a great deal of synth and percussion. ,soundtracks,cjeeqij,1,t5_2rkiv
1655533,0,t3_2dag1m,I really like the concept and it was really well made. I found the vocal distortion a bit much and the tickingbeat seemed a bit forced and jarring. Overall not bad.,soundtracks,cjnuddg,2,t5_2rkiv
2060865,0,t1_cl1qx5t,Hey man happy you enjoy them! If you have any trouble finding the downloads just let me know and I can send you my files. Heck if you want I have an entire playlist of over  songs on my iTunes that fits into this realm of music some of it youve heard before the more well known Thomas Newman and Hans Zimmer stuff but others I can almost guarantee you havent lol. It will keep you busy for a long time haha. The trick is figuring out how to send that many files to you through the internet if you can figure out a simple and safe way let me know. I wasnt a fan of the Guild Wars Soundtrack that stuff is a little too intense for me and I wouldnt really classify it as peaceful or uplifting its more of the epic genre with all the loud and intense hornsstringsdrums. Wasnt really a fan of the Harry Potter stuff Arcade Fire stuff or the Adrian Johnson song. Its weird I only like certain types of piano sounds. If you like piano you will love Goldmund if you dont already know of him. Imo his best songs is Finding it There Threnody is good too. No words for the American Beauty soundtrack of course. I loved that song The Car Chase by James Horner! It gave me chills and its kind of haunting! If you like those kinds of haunting songs let me know Ive got a bunch Hand Covers Bruise by Atticus Ross amp Trent Reznor is the first one that comes to mind if you havent heard it yet. I have A Kaleidoscope of Mathematics from that James Horner album not sure how I missed The Car Chase. Downloading now. The Chronicles of Narnia song didnt really vibe with me for whatever reason it was a little too magical for me. Im not a fan of those magical Disney type soundtracks except for a few random songs here and there such as Define Dancing by Thomas Newman.Two Steps from Hell is good but most of their stuff is a little too epic for me. Ive only got two of their songs Moving Mountains and Freedom Fighters. I like Opening Titles by Cinematic Orchestra I will have to download that. Of course Ive heard Arrival of the Birds thats a great one. Arrival of the Birds always reminds me of Whisper of a Thrill by Thomas Newman if you havent heard it yet youll love it. Newman is a genius isnt he!?I like that song from The Dutchess soundtrack not enough to download it yet but I think it will grow on me.As you can tell Im obsessed with this kind of music. Its tough for me to find people in person that can appreciate the depth and beauty of this stuff. Theres no words to describe how they make me feel sometimes. Lets keep this thread goin!,soundtracks,cl1s46d,1,t5_2rkiv
2083837,0,t3_2irbyd,I couldnt link directly to Soundcloud as Varese had made the first  tracks private for some reason.Its a lot closer to Gravity than I imagined it would be but its growing on me the more I listen to it.,soundtracks,cl4p9as,1,t5_2rkiv
3622784,0,t3_31u6yg,I dont think theres anything wrong with posting trailer music as long as its presented as trailer music and not a films score which it clearly isnt. Even the image of a helmet in the banner is from a trailer music album.,soundtracks,cq582qp,3,t5_2rkiv
4221666,0,t1_cs1ckaa,Yeah I can understand that. But despite all the embellishments and historical inaccuracies I still think the movie was fantastic and that it brought a lot of attention to Alan Turings legacy. Before the movie I had no clue who he was or what he was known for. It doesnt bother me too much that the movie liedmade up a few details because most films do that. Im not saying its right Im just saying that a lot of other movies do that to spice up the story.,soundtracks,cs1g882,1,t5_2rkiv
4537357,0,t3_3d7odm,Its a slow moody cover of I Started A Joke by the Bee Gees. Pretty relevant in the recent trailer trends of using slower more ominous covers of older songs.,soundtracks,ct2kcif,2,t5_2rkiv

7251649,0,t3_4eqphk,The piano riff sounds exactly like Gary Jules cover of Mad World by Tears for Fears. This was featured in a Gears of War commercial years ago. As for your guess for Skyrim its possible but I dont recall that in any particular place although I do love the soundtrack and there are a couple piano pieces.,soundtracks,d22glae,3,t5_2rkiv

9957860,0,t1_db5d10v,Have to agree on all points. Best soundtrack of my year I hope it wins some awards. Both for the original music and the use of licensed tracks. I think my preferred track would be Violent Delights Have Violent Ends for how well it fits the unsettling tone of the show beautiful sad and uncertain.,soundtracks,db5j9a6,5,t5_2rkiv

I wouldnt call it synthwave but if you like that kind of music youll probably enjoy this too.Soundtrack playlistDemon dance is probably my favorite track.  ,soundtracks,dcb4h0i,3,t5_2rkiv

11056848,0,t3_5xu1yr,Even when I was  I thought this music was incredible. I remember rewinding this scene over and over rewatching it. I dont have many memories from when I was so young but for some reason this music really stuck with me. Then I grew up and fell in love with the soundtracks of Pirates of the Caribbean Gladiator Inception and The Dark Knight. When I found out Hans Zimmer did this song too it felt a bit special. He had affected me in such a cool way with one song  years earlier. Hes a great composer.,soundtracks,del9x63,4,t5_2rkiv
