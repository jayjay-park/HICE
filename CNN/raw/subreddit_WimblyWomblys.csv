61639,0,t3_1usz07,I really hope between this the TFiOS movie and the  million other things going on in the Greeniverse John gets invited onto Top Gear to be the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car. ,WimblyWomblys,celg4jw,9,t5_2yznt
134058,0,t3_1vizoq,Swindon vs. AFC Wimbledon are going to be  interesting episodes and they certainly will be strange as I myself was a devout follower of the Swoodilypoopers but that was in FIFA . In this version of FIFA they are a whole new team minus Green Eggs and Foderingham and a few other players so I think John will be able to overcome his nostalgia and play a good match against our former team. With much respect for Swindon they just arent the team they used to be and I am totally confident in our ability to win against them so long as John does not develop a Gatsbyesque persona  and screw us over in the off season. ,WimblyWomblys,cetp63q,1,t5_2yznt
4603582,0,t3_3e08ph,I realize calling this our Annus mirabilis was part of the narrative for John but I actually think that the team had quite a bit of luckpulled out results more often than they should have. A combination of regression toward the mean the loss of one of the John Greens and playing harder competition should lead to a return to earth for the team.Part of me misses the higher chance of a loss but I have IRL sports teams that I can watch lose they lose a lot. I like that the Wimbly Womblys can be consistently good. Its cathartic for me to watch the team Im rooting for win and even if it doesnt mean quite as much with the team winning so consistently watching still feels good for my mental health ,WimblyWomblys,ctav9rx,2,t5_2yznt
