116266,0,t1_ceq33ir,gt And if youre an ally you need to try to make those social bonds youre the one requiring a litmus test on friendship and if you need friends who arent bigoted put in the effort.As someone who has struggled feeling left out socially of leftist circles even though politically I work with them frequently I resonate with this. Sometimes allies come from genuine shitlord communities where they want to leave everything behind and suddenly feel really alone for instance if you grew up in a really racist family and then left that behind when you went to college. Or maybe you just came from a soso community or generally liberal but not really antiracist and you feel like you cant talk to your old friends about this stuff. So suddenly you think everyone needs to be your friend. Which is weird. No one owes you their friendship or respect or anything else simply for showing up. There are lots of people I work with on SJ organizing that I know I will never be friends with and over the past year I have stopped trying. Sometimes its because Im not part of their subculture so we dont have much in common outside of the politics. Usually its just because we didnt really click. So they flake on social plans when I try to make them. That doesnt make them mean or hateful because Im an ally...it just means they dont really want to get close to me which could be for a million different reasons. Thats how life is. In some ways this frustration about being an ally is kind of the logical next steps of friend zoning. Im a nice guy why wont they hang out with me! Because thats how it goes sometimes. Being nice is not really enough and even if it were no one has an obligation to spend their free time with everyone. I think people struggle walking away from very emotional settings which is a guarantee when you go past SJ theory and into SJ action and then feel like you cant actually talk to those people from those actions honestly. This is why I stopped trying to get the groups I am allied with to make me feel better and turned to the friends I have had for years mostly white men to educate them on the topics. My boyfriend cares about politics in a way reads the news we agree on most things but he wouldnt go to protests unless I took him along. He may never join these groups on his own accord. But hes always there for me. My friends wouldnt know shit about Palestine for example unless I blabbed about it all the time. Actually by not hanging out with SJ folks all the time I have educated a lot more people in casual settings and built up a larger support network for a better less ist society.,SRSDiscussion,cero518,7,t5_2t5sa

Have black people in England lived in a utopia? No but compared to early s America they sure did. There was no KKK equivalent that ever wielded any significant political power.Technically correct but very misleading. Sure the US has had much more oppression of black people than the UK has but the UK oppressed Catholics. The idea that the UK was some sort of equality wonderland through out history. Even up until the s Catholics in one minority part of the UK were being denied voting rights and the UK army was violently putting down civil rights marches. Everyone forgets about Northern Ireland. Why do you think the main part of the UK that was Catholic staged a violent uprising and managed to break away Ireland?And yes this can be viewed through the lens of nationalityethnicity which can also be heavily influenced by religion and its vague and not as clear cut as the USA with its racial classification rules but it was still racism! And it wasis wrong! And this is an example of how Things Are Different in Europe or more likely how Things Are Different in USA.

471864,0,t1_cfs1ca5,Perhaps this is a topic for another thread but Id be interested...gtOn the other hand we have the view that there is no gender binary and that gender is unrelated to anything besides personal identity. I guess I have a hard time seeing how this claim can be supported when interpreted strictly. I think we have a gender binary but there are multiple gender identities which relate to that binary in various ways sometimes antagonistically.  gt I think all these questions are red herrings. The concepts shouldnt be intermingled. The idea that gender is purely a matter of identity is a complete deconstruction of societys traditional essentialist view on gender whereas acceptance of homosexuality is merely a rejection of traditional moral standards regarding sex and relationships within the confines of this traditional view of gender.And this is what I object to. To me this seems like an evasivelyindirectly worded argument to the effect that certain queer identities objectively supercede and render obsolete older LGBT principally LG identities. It also seems to implicitly toss out a whole bunch of labels including mine that hinge on sexuality rather than gender. Perhaps Im misreading?   I mean lets ask where this argument leaves bisexuality or for that matter pansexuality. To me its hard to miss the irony in that its an updated queer definition of the problem which does exactly the same thing as the old Gay and Lesbian definition of the problem. I mean I like reading this kind of theory and its not as if Im personally offended but it kind of seems like youve structured the argument around avoiding the existence of bisexuality.  ,SRSDiscussion,cftwj24,1,t5_2t5sa

790678,0,t1_cgs69kr,I would suggest that while there may in fact be differences between cultures in the difference in strength between men and woman the largest contributing factor for the variance in these differences is likely nutrition. Youll find that in more devoloped countries that have better nutrution the people that live there are typically larger in size then other countries. I would think that the more both sexes were fed nutritionally the more the differences in their gender would stand out. So in a country like the U.S. the men are bigger and stronger and the woman are more curvacious and taller then in some other countries. I cant really prove this but this is how I see it from my observations. That being said I still think that even if the nutrition were equal men were made evolution wise to have stronger upper bodies. Likely because they were placed in the hunter roll typically. Reguardless. Men are stronger in general physically even if not to such a degree as seen in the Western world.

Planting seeds of doubt and seeing how a person reacts to them over time is really the only way to get to people that are really far in. In many cases the mere fact that someone wants to debate them reinforces their worldview especially if that worldview includes the notion that the world is generally against them and that they are simply being righteous in the very act of defending their view whatever it may be.Stormfront fosters a worldview that people who think like them are the true victims of persecution.

2095435,0,t1_cl5v3wy,Ive had this conversation offline a lot. Usually in response to a person who is making a claim that people from one race are inherently inferiorsuperiordifferent from people of another race. But I try to use the phrase race is a social construct instead of race isnt real to explain why their statements arent correct. I also like to refer people to the American Anthropological Associations Statement on Race which explains the history of the hierarchy of the races and where our modern concept of race comes from in the first place. It also points out that there is very little genetic variation among the races. Actually two chimpanzees from the same troupe can have more genetic differences than two unrelated humans from different continents Thats because humans have a relatively low genetic diversity compared with other species which suggests that our population was very low at one point in human history. There is a concept of race within biology but it has to do with taxonomic rank and not to do with peoples ethnicities. Actually I had an interesting conversation with an archaeologist I volunteer for and he told me about a theory that Neanderthals werent a different species of human but a different race in the biologicaltaxonomical sense. But the concept of race we have in regards to humans of different skin tonesethiccultural backgrounds? Not something thats based in biology. And I think that is important to point out in a lot of situations. But thats not the same as saying race dont real because it very much does real within the context of peoples everyday lives. Edit to add I really like the comparison the AAA statement on race draws between race differences and familial differences. People from one race have similar features to each other in the same way that people from one family will look similar. It has more to do with interbreeding and sharing inherited physical traits than it does with any major biological differences. And you can also see a ton of diversity within a single race. And when races mix the lines between the races become increasingly blurred. Because genetically were very similar. So if someone says that people from race A are all like x and people from race B are all like y theyre being ridiculous. Yes there are cultural influences on peoples behavior and culture is often tied to race because of how our society is organized. But cultural differences are very different from physical differences. People can change their cultures and they do all the time.,SRSDiscussion,cl66cl7,1,t5_2t5sa

Probably the main purpose of social justice is to encourage acceptance and fair treatment for people who are labeled as different which to me seems directly rooted to empathy. And Ive always seen it as just the natural extrapolation of kindness. If these are the case then it seems we have the responsibility to not only foster these qualities in ourselves but also in others. I do wonder why social justice hasnt come out and fully embraced this by vocally encouraging things like meditation therapy and emotional openness for all people therapy is most certainly not just for the mentally ill  also is ill here a pejorative?. One argument Ive found that seems to point to kindness and empathy if not borderline tone policing is that intersectionality teaches us that many disadvantages are invisible.

Or theyll make up a flimsy reason to sue the competitor to cripple them seen this happen to. Or if powerful enough theyll get language in bills that favors their productplaces absurd legal restrictions on the competitor. Or...Also yes workers arent doing more work thats the point of using machines after all. Whats happening though is that the increase in productivity while making some of the work easier is still financially benefiting the owners of business almost exclusively. Capitalism demands this company executives are legally obligated to maximize shareholder profit not to give two shits about their employees. Its a completely imbalanced and exploitative relationship and no amount of reform can change that.gtAt any rate Id probably guess that RampampampampampampD comprises a greater portion of private business expenditures than government expenditures.Ive worked in govt and private RampampampD theyre very different beasts.

4288043,0,t3_3a2zjl,Homeauto insurance. A really interesting field for a social justiceminded person. Im in work involving actuarial pricing so we work with the rating factors that the insurance company obtains from you in order to give you a price.Theres a ton of discussion about what factors are ethical to rate somebodys insurance on. Mind you rating comes from extensive statistical modelling and data analytics not stereotypes. Questions in the industry  Can you rate a policy based on a persons gender? Unmarried women receive noticeable discounts for being in a very riskaverse pool. Trans people are still lumped in male or female not out of discrimination but statistical significance  the model needs specific gender identities and malefemale are the only identifiable samples large enough to model with. The gender identity used in the model is entirely dependent on what gender the policyholder tells their agent so the insurance company cant go Youre not REALLY a woman it would have to be dealt with at the individual agent level. Are credit scores a valid rating factor? On one hand credit score is a strong predictor of ability to pay premiums and is also a statistically significant identifier for driving risk. On the other hand some accuse insurance of using credit score as a proxy for race since we are not allowed to rate policies based on race. The accusation is untrue the insurer is only interested in risk behaviors and what factors best predict them. Race is conflated with all kinds of confounding variables economic status being one of them so it would be illogical to use even by objective statistical standards. However there is the ongoing question on whether credit score is disproportionately affecting people based on race. Health insurance is plagued with all kinds of questions which I wont try to answer because its not my field. Preexisting conditions etc.Remember that the goal of an insurance provider is to offer someone a price based on the risk they pose to the company. If they are not priced adequately they are essentially given a discount for their risk behaviors and everyone else pays the difference regardless of privilege status. If folks are interested I can talk more about potential solutions to insurance pricing in order to replace identity with behavior and truly be equitable.Its a really really interesting field for a social justice mind because we have to look at policies and factors to determine what is ethical.,SRSDiscussion,cs8zf82,11,t5_2t5sa

The complaints about white feminism are frustrated shouts against intersectional privilege.To put it from a nongendered perspective its like telling victims of economic discrimination police brutality and unequal schooling that they should stop bringing up race because white people dont care about that shit while everyone hates income inequality so they should just team up.

She is nearly identical to Obama in policy positions. They both have the same faults that they hate Clinton for like having a super pac her main one is actually Obamas old one. And yet we have never seen the hatred for Obama.Of course tensions get higher when there is an election but I have a difficult time believing that there would be the same level of hatred for Hillary if she wasnt a woman.But of course we also see plenty of casual racism from subreddits like rSandersForPresident. Most obviously in how they dont seem to understand why the majority of Black people might disagree with them and their immediate response to label them as low information voters which they only did in the southern states.

7137987,0,t3_4d8rfe,The US in particular elects roughly  positions between federal state county city and district level government. In a typical ballot you are personally voting for anywhere from  to  different people. No one has the time to research every single person. And in a legislature one of the most important votes someone can make is who is going to be speakerleader of the chamber. Knowing who they are going to vote for in that particular vote is very important and that comes down to political party. From that one piece of information you can also generally assume their positions on a host of issues and be correct  of the time.Political parties are a shortcut to inform voters of what a candidate usually stands for and how they would generally like government to work. They are an informative tool.Beyond that benefit to informing voters they also act as a support system for candidates. If youre wanting to run for a local city council if you put a D by your name the state Democratic party will help you run. They will provide you with experts lawyers if needed voter information databases occasionally money or office space all because it is in their interest that you succeed. I have a friend whose mother ran for state legislature in New York even though she had only done local school board of a very small Long Island exurb before. As soon as she won the primary the party helped her tremendously to get her campaign up and running smoothly. She did not know how to run a campaign that size and if she tried to run as an independent without a support system she would have had a much harder time. She also got the support of local politicians because they were of the same party with the implicit assumption that in years to come she would be expected to help whoever is the newcomer later.Now does that mean everything parties do is great? No. Does it mean parties are a net positive? I believe so but that point can be debated. However its hard to argue they have no benefit.Whats wrong with the US right now is not the existence of political parties its polarization. That can happen with or without parties.

7573364,0,t3_4iwkot,Reading this thread....The answers are all over the place with some people just saying I dont know. The lack of a clear coherent concrete set of traits that would comprise a legit answer to the question what are some examples of NONtoxic masculinity is extremely telling. In other words if people who identify as male want to inhabit a masculinity that isnt toxic or harmful for other people and themselves theyve got to start creating the paradigms carving out new modes of behavior and setting new standards. Were going to have to create a list of nontoxic masculine traits from whole cloth. The menu of traits that we traditionally identify as masculine is going to have to change and were gonna have our work cut out for us.Because theres just no old model we can fall back on unfortunately history society EVERYTHING exists today because of toxic masculinity. Modern life has been brought to you on its back. For good and bad yes we have these amazing technological advancements that have been brought to humanity by competitive cutthroat white men with access to resources that minorities didnt have but we also have things like a interstate highway system that portends nothing but societal and environmental collapse...all these ideas about how to shape and advance human society were brought to us in an age when there was no such thing as toxic masculinity it was all just men doing manly things for the betterment of all. And it harmed a lot of people in the process. Men were in charge and we made the decisions that affected everyone bad and good mostly bad as it turns out. In fact that very callousness to the effects of ones behavior was gendered as masculine. In just the last fifteentwenty years or so that masculine worldview has become to seem barbaric and outdated and destructive and men everywhere are having to come to terms with that. Its only now that we recognize the omnipresence of a competitive feelnopain beaman mightmakesright masculinity as a problem and seek an alternative. Trouble is we have to MAKE that alternative. I dont expect anyone to empathize or sympathize with the struggle that people who identify as male now have to face because of this  it would be nice for other people who identify as male to acknowledge it all as a social group however.This is one reason for the frustration that wellmeaning cis straight men can often feel when getting into discussions about gender amp feminism these days its not just that men feel blamed and rightly so for making the world the way it is  younger males who had nothing to do with the creating of this dysfunctional system feel unfairly targeted and made to feel like the enemy for merely being born into it. And for a lot of people who identify as male we legitimately genuinely want to be better we just have no idea what better would look like. Like...I dunno dont rape harm or kill anyone? Dont make anyone feel bad if you can help it? Is that enough? Can that make up for the past? But again those answers dont specifically address how people who identify as male can still express or perform their individual and group masculine identities and not present a problem for others.

I think the cleavage has historically been much clearer.gtAre you saying that the US in its attitude to immigrants and to ethnicity is more similiar to Pakistan or Fiji than to the United Kingdom.I dont know enough about Pakistan and Fiji to really give you an answer and like I noted the UK is more of a mixed case. However Pakistan is actually a multiethnic country with a common identity based on what I would call a religious version of civic nationalism. So yes their attitude towards ethnicity might actually indeed be closer in some ways to the US than to say Japan. I dont think the comparison you intended really fits. Also I think the problem might be that you seem to be focusing mainly on immigration while Im talking more about broader national identity.gtwhat Im questioning is this idea that you and others seemed to be expounding that there is some deep fundamental cleavage at least between nations of the first world. I think that both concepts are at play simultaneously in most of these countriesWell Im not really claiming otherwise. Like most things in social science its more of a continuum than anything else. Im not sure how we can objectively determine the required level of difference for it to be fundamental.gtI do think there is a fundamental distinction in forms of nationalism but I think this exists between the colonising nations and the colonised nations who use national identity to assert a right to selfdetermination that has been denied to them by the former I consider the countries of the anglosphere to belong to the former group.I agree that there is a difference though Im not sure Id call it a difference in form more a difference in goals.

And you can get even more in depth in our society people accept women in nurturing roles but are worried about men doing those same things for example because they might hold traditional views on it being womens work or because they think men that like working with children are potentially pedophiles.

Youre putting words in my mouth big time. If we follow the traditional leftist critique of identity politics it tends to be that wasting time advocating for anything other than class tends to advance only that group specifically and doesnt actually make a larger difference in terms of oppression. Im saying that intersectionality means its all bundled into one and that humans arent so simple as to only have room for one issue at a time.

8967414,0,t1_d7ox81o,gt Its within my body. Therefore I have the right to decide what happens to it.How so? It doesnt effect your body in any way and this isnt an exercise in your own body autonomy. gt But I would have the right under bodily autonomy to inject poison into whatever organ your violinists neck is hooked up to and kill him that way.Right but its going through your system first. Saline injections dont go through your system at all because you know youd die. Injecting into the fetus is bypassing your bodys system entirely as your system and the fetus are separate. The uterus is by medical definition an external anatomical system as is your digestive  and intestinal tracts. Something passing through those systems doesnt actually enter your body until its absorbed into the bloodstream something that does not occur in your scenario. Now if you wanted to poison your uterus and thus kill the fetus then sure thats youre right. What you propose is injecting poison directly into the violinists veins instead of your own.,SRSDiscussion,d7pqxg0,4,t5_2t5sa

9048019,0,t1_d7yugof,gtRight now while youre arguing for the elevation of dogs youre talking about them in terms of how useful they are to humans. I hope youd never talk about people in those terms.This is likely an unpopular opinion but I would. People are useful to themselves. Its beneficial to a person to be alive and well etc. The following isnt terribly relevant to the rest. Ignore if you please And to be clear yeah if it were actually of a net benefit to humans Id be down with things that seem unconscionable on their face. I would be extremely skeptical of the utility of these things but if it was clear that they were going to be a net benefit materially and in terms of culture precedence etc I would condone them. To be honest I dont know how secular people believe in moral systems that appeal to transcendent moral principles. Utility is the system that admits that theres no right thing to do regardless of circumstance. It forces people to actually consider the comprehensive consequences of their actions rather than telling them this is the right thing to do and you can feel good about it regardless of what can be expected to happen. As Ive acknowledged I expect this is not the prevailing opinion here so downvote at your leisure. End irrelevant rantgtUsefulness only really comes up at least in any society Ive lived in when extreme circumstances are concernedReally? Nobody youve known has ever decided to do something despite ethical hurdles because it was helpful to them? I work for a company whose business practices I dont entirely ethically agree with. I as I said before eat cheap unethically produced food and clothes etc because I am poor and hungrycold. I have a pet because I enjoy his company and caring for him but buy food for him made of factory farmed animals and a leash made by an exploited Chinese factory worker. According to at least some mainstream abstract ethical systems these things are all wrong. You know nobody who does these things? Or perhaps we disagree that these things are considered morally wrong by many people?gtIts not abstract ethics to ignore use when talking about humans.When did I say it was? I said people ignore abstract ethics in favour of use when making decisions. Not the same thing. Edit trying hard to be selfcritical. You mean that conventional ethics are not abstract? Okay. Ill agree to disagree on that I think I see where youre coming from but I do not think ethics are physical in nature.gt such as many South KoreansgtDogs in the Western context,SRSDiscussion,d7zfe5b,1,t5_2t5sa

9116244,0,t3_554zjj,gtIs that a justifiable way to handle disagreement on any issue whatsoever? If so is there a heuristic for determining whether someone disagrees or is simply wrong? Pretty simple. People disagree when the subject is something subjectivehow good a particular movieshowbookwhatever is for instance.People are simply wrong when their beliefs are absolutely contradictory to objective reality I know I sound like a fedoralord here but hear me out. To use an extreme example Flat Earthers do not disagree with the rest of us they are simply wrong because their tenets are objectively false and impossible to prove correct. Likewise there are mountains of literature studies and POC experiences showcasing that whites are privileged in society. Anyone arguing against this is wrong much in the same way anyone arguing against evolution is. This isnt applicable  Id assume few things are in reality but I think it works pretty well.Note that I said objective reality and not scientific consensus or something like that. Science can be wrong but empirical data isntgtCan a thinking person legitimately disagree with the existence of white privilege in the United States or are they simply wrong and their viewpoints should be disregarded?Disagreeing with the concept of white privilege requires someone to blatantly throw out objective facts and observations about reality so yes I would say that theyre wrong.

Essentially you cant let it be subjective.To answer your question you should expand it to if you can save  of society and the other  die. What are the qualifications that would give people a better score for making it into the surviving ? If you cant objectively determine characteristics to score some people over others then you must use a random selection because in a practical situation you will have to answer for the people who die.And I say practical because this type of thing happens during most disasters and there is sometimes disagreement after the fact on whether the doctors or leaders made the right call.

Those words were literally said so much that they lost all their meaning. After calling someone every ist word out there for months and months they eventually begin to embrace the title. Trump supporters came out in huge number because of spite towards the media and spite towards everyone who had ever called them backwards or a ist of any sort. Thats why this election was lost. Its because trump supporters were so angry and ready to retaliate against years of social justice A movement which to them only means the erosion of their assets and against what they see to be a liberaldynastic political hegemony led squarely by Hilary Clinton herself. The democrats could not have picked a worse candidate or a worse narrative for this campaign. This is what happens when you label everyone who disagrees with you or holds bigoted views as subhuman.
