As you explore your newfound powers you uncover clues that suggest that this isnt the first time youve found out.In a strange place called Nowhere a boy named Heaven sat on the white floors of nothingness. He stared around wondering where everyone was. Wait whos everyone? Where am I? He noticed a shadow in the corner of his eye and turned his head finding another boy dressed in black pacing back and forth muttering to himself.It happened again. It always happens. Over and over and over and over never ending. He wont stop. He cant stop! And he just sits there staring like an imbeci The boy in black stopped and glared at Heaven. Back in the land of the living yet you dullwitted zombie?Heaven blinked and the boy shook his head with a scowl and resumed pacing. Heaven stood up and spun around searching for any sign of a place to go. Everything was blank neither light nor dark only an endless sea of white. Would going anywhere do anything? Was that spot over there not the same as that other spot? Heaven walked looking back to the other boy as he shrunk away. When he turned there he was again no further or closer. Heaven frowned.So you can walk again the boy said. Thats good. Thats progress. Progress towards doing this charade all over again I guess but... no itll end the same again. It always ends the same with you.This is a sad place Heaven said. There should be something happy here.Oh you dont say? By all means make your stupid flower.Heaven looked at the boy confusedly then couldnt help but laugh when tripped over a bush of white roses that suddenly appeared in his path. Heaven walked to pluck one out and twirled it in his hands. I like flowers.The boy grunted. I despise flowers.Where did they come from?Where do you think numbskull?Did I make them?The boy rolled his eyes and stood back up. Dada give the birdbrain a prize! Say where are those lame friends of yours? I thought theyd be he A fist smashed into his cheek.Suddenly standing over him was a girl with long brown hair and a wolfish grin. Thatll teach you to call us lame.The boy massaged his cheek and glared at her. Sure youre the first one to get here.The girl sniffed. Yeah and you better beat it before I beat you some more.The boy scowled and got back to his feet then began running off. Somehow he managed to disappear.Catch the girl said throwing a rubber ball to Heaven.He caught it and looked at her curiously. Do I know you?Of course you know me she said playfully punching his shoulder. Im Elysium your friend. Dont tell me you forgot me because if you did I know where Zions halberd is.Heaven blinked. Zion?Yeah and Valhalla and Paradise. Man you really did forget. Well we cant just stand around here all day. You still remember what the world looks like right?Heaven shrugged. I think so. Whats the world called?Earth duh. Youre the one who named it. Do you remember? Valleys rivers forests deserts cities. I know you really liked the mountains. Hey why not start with our meadow and oak? You remember the Great Oak dont you? That was our favorite place to chill.Heaven nodded slowly. I remember... The surrounding blankness seemed to squeeze tight and then a rumble came from above. Gray clouds began raining the droplets ignoring Heaven and Elysium. Where they landed grass grew and in the distance mountains began to take shape. Lightning struck behind Heaven and suddenly standing there was a giant oak tree. The skies cleared away for the sun to appear rising on the horizon.About time a voice said from above. Heaven looked up to find another boy hanging upsidedown from a branch his glistening white hair a stark contrast to his tan skin. I was beginning to think you were never going to show up he continued. Glad you did.There were two others leaning against the oak another girl with blond hair that hung around her neck and another boy with short brownishred hair. Heaven looked between them and mouthed their names. Valhalla Paradise Zion.So is it time for another adventure? Paradise asked.Yeah Im dying to explore some caves Zion said.Valhalla jumped down from the tree holding a tiny black box towards Heaven. You left this behind by the way.Heaven took the box and blinked. This is all so familiar. Am I... dead?They all laughed. No stupid Elysium said. You died but youre not dead.Heaven gaped. Am I...?A voice came from behind. A God? Hah no.Heaven turned finding the boy in black again. Who are you?The boy laughed. Your friends didnt tell you yet? Im Hell.
