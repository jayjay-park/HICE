5507134,0,t3_3qiklr,Thats not as clear as you make it to be. The fact is american and canadian right has gone more and more extreme right lately seriously look at the Rep primaries having that getting more than  nationally would have been seen as crazy y ago and toriesukip is actually less votes. This is kinda similar to the rise of FN etc ...Meanwhile current candidates like Clinton would have been called a moderate republican not so long ago. Even Sanders is not that left when you look historically quite like Corbynn but Im still happy they are here.So I wouldnt call it a shift to the left in america and a shift to the right in eu but a general rightwing translation in both zones.The difference would then be how well moderates not left resist in each country and it varies a lot within europe depending on electoral system and local specificities eastern eu is pretty right wing.Edit I wrote that on phone while waking up so I forgot something crucial. The new left that start to appears to replace the emptiness left by the liberalisation of historic moderate left especially in latin countries. But basically it would have been standard socdem  years ago.,europes,cwfl55w,17,t5_39twl

Its interesting to compare with MoDem in France with Rutelli and Bayrou being close and having suffered similar fate.And then of course the FDP in Germany and the LibDems in the UK just crashed.The most successfully right now is probably D in the Netherlands.,europes,cy2ecme,4,t5_39twl

Afterwards they can be controlled by ankle monitors even though they are not able to prevent things like this from happening a  but its still a lot better than them running around freely if they are deemed dangerous. Putting them into closed camps bears bad associations with the past and I am somewhat convinced that it would also not be legal to store people in a prisonlike environment without proper sentencing. ,europes,cyuhz5m,2,t5_39twl

6635693,0,t1_d05ojg1,The EU is at least through its internal organs such as the parliament progressive. You have to remember that there is more than  MEPs from a large range of countries and from different political parties. The most recent treaties also improve the democratic representation but it is sometimes hard to reach a common decision. What makes me particularly cringe here is the high involvment of the UK in the elaboration of the EU legislation sometimes being the only country that blocks some legal pieces. They have a strong influence but still totally disregard the EU and yell at any decision taken against their direct interests. If you want proper information about the EU try newspapers in english from other countries of the EU as they generally offer a more objective view of the EU. Source  worked for a MEP.
