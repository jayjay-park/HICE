Youd plug your device into that and the device would connect to an always hot wire in your car and monitor the battery voltage. Once the battery voltage hits a certain level it will cut the power to the dashcam. There are also devices out there that have the option for motion detection so it will only keep recordings if anything moves across its view.

11539629,0,t3_64fypc,I used to have Yokohama Geolandar ATS in R on stock wheels. Its a perfect tire for the adventurous who want their allterrain tire to be as close to stocksize as possible. Unfortunately the ATS is getting phased out so grab them while you can find them. My current setup is with the Goodyear Eagle Sport in R as I wanted a more pavementoriented sporty tire that still had the MS designation to retain some light offroad competency. I think Ill switch to the Goodyear Eagle RSA for a more offroad friendly sporty tire once I wear out my Eagle Sport tires.,XVcrosstrek,dg40p1s,2,t5_33v8y
11585412,0,t1_dg58lto,Whoa that is such a pain. Better results though. I just used the Subaru paint pen. Took  minutes of effort. Looks pretty ghetto but gets the job done lol. ,XVcrosstrek,dg97p4u,1,t5_33v8y
11617533,0,t3_656m1b,The small battery packcharger things actually work.  Costco has them or Amazon.   Just in case you need a jump start.  Carry a couple quarts of oil and check your periodically.   I would bring a small amount of gas with me in a sealed container like you would use for white gas for a camp stove  or if you have a top rack in a regular  gallon gas can.   And a good funnel.,XVcrosstrek,dgcuvxo,1,t5_33v8y

11750275,0,t1_dgrx0gf,Do it smart. Youll be fine.  Make sure your fluids are correct and present. Allow the vehicle to warm up  seconds before before departing. Read the manual for the Crosstrek as well as the trailer and jetski. Assure trailer weight  Dry weight  Fuel weight of Jetski is within the Crosstrek tow guidelines and the guidelines of your hitch. Drive accordingly. Youre towing a pendulum. Be smart and make your actions smoothly and well in advance.I hope this helps. I dont mean to sound too lecturey ,XVcrosstrek,dgrx8rn,5,t5_33v8y
