I believe there is a godlike system above but to believe in a singular god in this age is to have your minds instinctual subconscious hinder its frame of thinking beyond. And with all the knowledge weve been able to work with these most recent centuries lets not let that go by any means unnoticed.,exatheist,ch8e9ld,2,t5_2rull

10690269,0,t3_5sp4cy,Yeah my dad used to watch Richard Dawkins documentaries and would take his ideas on religion from people as illinformed as Ricky Gervais. When I was younger and I discovered the internet I was really into all those edgy youtubers from the skeptic communityTM and I used to circle jerk on atheist forums the internet over. I sorta cringe thinking back to it because I was the type that called religious people mentally ill and used to apply words like logical and reason to myself. Grew up with irreligious friends in an irreligious place with an irreligious family. I came to Christ about two years ago after studying theology for a while and looking into the history of Christianity. After taking into account the meta physical and theological implications of what we know and what we can reason it became irrational to continue being an atheist.,exatheist,ddimf01,9,t5_2rull
