380630,0,t3_1yfqa6,I believe in namecoin. I think we have to be patient in regard to development but if it were easier to visit .bit sites that would be huge.I would also love to see more work on a decentralized domain authority going beyond the .bit domain. Why not do stuff like .myAwesomeTld so everyone can actually own a top level? ,Namecoin,cfk7udz,0,t5_2shfb
416031,0,t3_1yth2t,Namecoin is not just about DNS god I wish more people would read before posting.  DNS is only one part of nmc storage of arbitrary data in a blockchain is very useful.,Namecoin,cfnvyim,3,t5_2shfb
583284,0,t1_cg698yk,gt Bitshares PoS being better than Namecoins PoW is a strawman argument as no extra energy whatsoever is spent mining namecoins. Mining namecoins is virtually free so long as the Bitcoin network exists.Your share is diluted to pay miners. Thats the only point. Sure there is no extra marginal cost  then why are you paying miners?!gt it is not set in stone that namecoin domain purchase transactions will be eaten by the network miners may receive them at a later date after registration in the future namecoin is still in its infancy.That would be worse for NMC holders not better,Namecoin,cg6knuj,-1,t5_2shfb

2096863,0,t3_2iwt3l,Two possible reasonsbecause they dont know how to setup it orthey tried a outdated version and had some crash problem.I dont think the NMC devs are miners so it may be difficult to troubleshoot performance problems on large scale mining operations if the miners themselves dont get involved on coding.no other reason to lose free money!Other option could be BTC miners to be released by default with merge mining for NMC.,Namecoin,cl6cw5l,3,t5_2shfb
2176947,0,t1_clemeuu,This blank box on step  is where you have to put information about where is the domain hosted. Usually this is your regular hosting be it a hosting company there are some free but only a handful offer free cpanel or your own server. This is where most of the newbies give upfail. If most of the people dont know what is an A record the couldnt be bothered to read about the simplified formatting that namecoin uses to substitute this A record or to forwards to a dns server. Unless they already have experience with normal domains. ,Namecoin,clgjjv6,6,t5_2shfb

2737022,0,t3_2rdxz4,Sounds like there is some interest here and I will accept the challenge to make this Wallet.I have already had some success with making namecoinj and it can download the blockchain successfully which means that the difficulty and merge mining code works so far.I will post source code on github rather soon.,Namecoin,cnf6rcu,9,t5_2shfb
2799078,0,t3_2ry6sd,gt This particular SPV client does not store the blockchain but rather downloads the headers only. It is able to get relevant transactions other peers for coin transactions.Please note that the security issues for SPV in Namecoin differ somewhat from Bitcoin  a malicious server could deny existence of a name censorship or serve old data e.g. a compromised certificate or ip address. Receiving full blocks and tracking what the latest transaction id for each name is could mitigate this at least partially.gt Since the naming service functions are also in transactions with a different transaction version to mark them off I am wondering if it is possible to add the namenew namefirstupdate and nameupdate transaction functionality to the Namecoin Wallet which is forked from the Bitcoin Wallet for android.Youd just need to support the new script formats track the random blinding parameter and set the transaction version appropriately.gt Theoretically we could design a UI for creating a domain name. The app would send out the first transaction newname then wait the  blocks before sending out the namefirstupdate transaction. The app would know when these transactions are confirmed in the blockchain in the same way it knows about simple coin transactions send or receive.gtgt The desktop client generates a Name Index database from parsing the blockchain block by block which it first queries to see if a name already exists. Can this functionality be left out? That file is  MB currently.No you cannot leave that out though you could prune expired names and the data associated with active names and just track the transaction ID. See below for why.gt What foreseeable problems would there be with doing an SPV namecoin client? Does it really need to see the entire blockchain to create and update names?The network would accept a NAMENEW transaction for an already existing domain by design this transaction blinds the name to prevent front running attacks  the fees transaction fee and registration fee would be lost.There are some notes on thin client security up on githubIf youd like to try to build something that can be accomplished without namecoin itself requiring protocol changes please drop by IRC or post in the forum. Currently to avoid censorshipstale data issues and support creating NMC transactions the client will need all the block headers and for the last k blocks need to download but not store a name gt last transaction that updated it database would suffice the full blocks.,Namecoin,cnm8tpa,4,t5_2shfb
3952585,0,t1_cr6tkxl,Factoids are used to buy Entry Credits.  Entry Credits are used to write entries into Factom and will be pegged to a  value keeping the cost to use of the Protocol stable.   But as the use of the protocol goes up the Factoid price will reflect the added volume.   Some people will hold Factoids to speculate certainly.  Just like people  purchase Namecoin to speculate.  The simulations I have run show that the incentives paid to the Federated Servers and Audit Servers of Factom will settle to the value of the protocol independent of constant percentages of speculation.   I believe this is as good as a distributed and autonomous project can hope for.,Namecoin,cr6ttyx,1,t5_2shfb
