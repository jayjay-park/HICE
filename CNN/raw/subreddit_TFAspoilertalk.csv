5971146,0,t3_3x7qtb,I got the feeling that they did exactly this so they could do something new in the comming movies. Now they have gotten the nostalgia kinda vowen into the new characters. They tried to make everything new in the prequels and recived much hate because of it.But this movie FELT alot more star wars then the prequels and thats far more important then the overuse of references even though i kinda like that too ,TFAspoilertalk,cy2cjo2,12,t5_3bcz7

5989720,0,t3_3xd9xg,While I didnt like the lightsaber is calling you angle the darkside cave on Dagobah attracted Luke to enter it.  I like the idea that this lightsaber was echoing the evil that it had committed however Luke never mentioned it and surely Ben Kenobi in the  years would have noticed it.However this then leads into the reason that Yoda was never found by the Empire was that his powerful lightside ability was masked by living next to the darkside cave.  Maybe the reason Ben was never found was because the lightsaber was basically an item of evil fused with the darkside power from the Jedi Temple assault.,TFAspoilertalk,cy4s7jz,1,t5_3bcz7
