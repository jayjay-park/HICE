103814,0,t1_ceq3vkm,You picked a good person to ask! My bf is actually a brewer and so I have a decent understanding about loads of beer stuff! I was just starting to get into craft beer when I was diagnosed so I definitely feel the pain on that one. From my understanding your BF actually came along at a really good time for gf beer as there is a process that is starting to be used that actually removes the gluten from beer. So you still get all the flavour of delicious gluteny beer without all the gluten. Although Im not sure how widely this process is being used yet there is a light at the end of the tunnel! Most beer that I have had that is gf is made from sorghum or sometimes quinoa. The only downside to that is that sometimes they can be a little sweeter and maybe not to the craft beer nerds liking. But if your making your own gluten free beer from these ingredients it might be easier to tweek them to your personal tastes. We havent tried brewing gf beer at home yet but I know other people who have had success doing it. My favourite gf beers and I think they actually use the new gluten removal method I was talking about are from a brewery called Wold Top in the UK. I think they make two one is called Against the Grain not super duper awesome but better than a lot of other gf beers and the other is called Scarborough Fair IPA which is AMAZING even my bf agrees both of which I think are pretty widely available. Now to the vegetarian thing! I dont find it hard at all! The only thing I find difficult is eating out at restaurants and really I think the only reason for that is that I live in the middle of the Canadian prairies aka. the middle of no where so if you live in a larger urban area you will probably be fine. The biggest thing I would say you have to start doing is making your own bread and bread products. Sounds daunting I know but Its really a whole lot easier than you think I promise. If you have a bread maker especially one with a gf setting then it will be mega simple but if not its really not too hard either. This is my favourite recipe right now and its actually made without the aid of a bread maker and is even yeast free which means no rise times yay! I also make my own pizza crust as I said above and I use this recipe which has been really good to me. With two dietary restrictions it can seem hard sometimes but honestly I think the biggest thing is learning to be creative. I troll the internet for interesting gf veggie recipes all the time and there is a startlingly large amount of gf veggie and vegan blogs out there to find great stuff on. I also subscribe to a weekly gf veggie news letter here which helps a lot too if you dont feel like spending a lot of time looking for gf recipes by yourself. Also try not to waste too much money on buying expensive premade gf stuff at the grocery store you can make it MUCH better at home. I will admit that once in awhile when Im feeling lazy I end up spending a stupid amount of money and getting some crappy gf bread at the store but honestly dont do it all the time your taste buds and wallet will thank you! You can always make it in a large quantity at home and freeze it too. I hope all of this has been helpful If you have any and I mean ANY other questions PM me and I will help you out. Im sure my bf would be willing to help with any beer questions you bf has as well so dont hesitate to ask!,Celiac,ceq914y,1,t5_2tnai
103871,0,t1_ceq3vkm,OH and I forgot to mention cider! Its becoming a really big thing and there loads of varieties! I know its not exactly the same as beer but its very readily available. Its also apparently really easy to make at home as its really just fruit and yeast we havent tried making it yet but its our next task and Im actually really excited about it.  ,Celiac,ceq99jx,1,t5_2tnai
143137,0,t3_1vpp2h,It could definitely be cross contamination but I was  gf and still having issues too. Are you eating gluten free grains? Processed foods? Have you tried cutting out dairy? Have you looked into fructose malabsorption? I went to a doctor several times with no results until I read something on the internet and realized all grains were an issue for me. Refractory celiac affects  or more of people with celiac. I now eat a very low carb diet keto but paleo primal GAPS or SCD would all be diets to try. GAPS is the ultimate in healing your intestines. I believe that celiac is triggered by leaky gut syndrome where inflammation caused by modern processed foods causes your intestines to swell and leak tiny bits of food into your body. Your immune system sees these as invaders and begins to attack. This is becoming more accepted by some doctors but is still not accepted in the medical community. Ive been  years gluten free and grain free for a year or two I can eat gf grains about once a week and feel fine and I feel fantastic. You can figure this out. ,Celiac,ceuqfe3,3,t5_2tnai

2104680,0,t3_2j0wm5,Is this a problem because of split ends?  If so the only solution is literally to cut them off.  You CANNOT repair them.  Now if it is just damaged hair not due to split ends you can do a variety of things.  I would start with baking soda and vinegar washes to strip all the crap out of your hair.  Then try some sort of keratin or oil treatment.  You can find some at any big box or pharmacy store or even maybe ask for a sample in a salon.  When my hair is dry on the ends it usually means its time to switch to a different shampoocondition combination.  I have a couple I switch between now both gluten free and have seen an improvement in hair softness.  There are a lot of options but I would start by cleansing vinegarbaking soda then either switching to a different shampoo for a while or finding a nice oil treatment.  I have ironing oil I use for my hair that minimizes damage and does the trick and it wasnt too pricey considering a drop is all I need for shoulder length but very thick hair. I do not have the name with me since I forgot to pack it fall break .  I can get it if youre interested. Good luck!,Celiac,cl7cmkb,5,t5_2tnai
2105501,0,t3_2ix5tr,The answer to this isnt really known since we understand so little of the very complicated system that is our immune system. Rest assured studies show that a constant and lifelong adherence to a GF diet if you are a Celiac WILL greatly reduce your risk of small intestines cancer and greatly increase your longevity.

Vitamin D is pretty much the only supplement I would recommend because anything else can be had cheaper and more effectively from diet.But there are a lot of good probiotic foods to choose from  yogurt kefir miso some have wheat be careful! saurkraut if it is imported  not the American preservativefilled stuff.There is a little bit of research coming out here and there on general probiotic treatments and one of the interesting facts that came up was that the quantity and quality of prebiotic foods was just as important as the quantity of probiotic strains consumed.  That is the prebiotics are the foods that these microorganisms eat  and thats mostly fiber.  So... have some yogurt and glutenfree granola.  ,Celiac,cla28zt,1,t5_2tnai

And older patient will usually take longer to recover.  There are also issues likeHaving Celiac for months or years before dx and omission of gluten can cause your system to adapt in odd ways.  Your intestinal lining may harden your immune system may give up on producing certain antibodies some of your symptoms may just go away or you may get so used to them you dont notice them anymore.

4762427,0,t1_ctur85y,Highland Park  is easily one of the best single malts available and very affordable  or less. Laphroaig has a very distinct taste and aroma and is what got me started on scotch in the first place you better like smokey campfires though. bunnahabhain is more expensive not as strong on the peat smoke and iodine but worth every extra penny. And tomatin which is very inexpensive and excellent and a great starter scotch. Oh I almost forgot old pulteney. Man that is a good one. Opening that bottle on a crisp fall day and nosing the mist that comes out is almost magical. And I havent met a person that didnt like old pulteney it seems to be especially popular with ladies especially those who dont like super peat bog islay scotches. There are of course the big names like McAllan glenmorangie talisker glenfiddich glenlivet and the big one lagavulin. None of those are bad although I personally dont like lagavulin too much iodine and I think laphroaig is the better from Islay. But its all subjective. I usually have a bottle of drambuie and a jug of famous grouse to mix for a rusty nail as well.  parts scotch one part drambuie.Obviously this can get quite expensive so if there is a bar with a large selection of scotch I would start there to find out what you like.

6148936,0,t1_cyofuvi,Yes thats right. Nutritional deficiencies are one of the major side effects of untreated celiac disease in my case I tried to donate blood at the Red Cross and they turned me down because my iron levels were extremely low. So knowing this as well as the fact that celiac has a strong genetic component and that both my mom and sister had already been confirmed via biopsy I went to my doctor and requested the antibody bloodwork. After that came back positive I was referred to a GI doctor for the biopsy.In hindsight I did have other symptoms in the six months or so before my diagnosis. In my case it was clinical depression and uncharacteristically frequent illnessescolds. Never had any of the classic gastric distress reactions. Thats the weird thing about autoimmune diseases like this the symptoms arent always predictable.Now if I accidentally get glutened I do sometimes have to spend an evening in the bathroom.

Therefore I am personally baffled that anyone without a legitimate medical need to be glutenfree would choose to be glutenfree. Its your life though.

Given that youre asking this question though youre probably a really cool person who wouldnt do thisb delegitimize the needs of Celiacs. The hardest thing for me is that waiters in restaurants dont take my requests seriously and I am often served regukar glutenfilled foods or made ill from crosscontamination as a result.

Its unknown what the upper range portends since this problem hasnt been adequately studied. It depends on how long you had active disease as to whether your stores of B were fully depleted while your celiac antibodies were active. Unfortunately nobody can answer that about themselves as they may or may not have had active disease long before they showed symptoms.There are a bunch of steps that B taken orally by food must go through. It has to be cleaved by your stomach acid from the protein then intrinsic factor IF made in your stomach must attach to it in order for it to travel into the ileum safely. It is then severed from the IF and absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have been taking antacids or acid reducing drugs for instance you wont likely have enough stomach acid to cleave it from the protein in the first place. Also a common autoimmune disease called pernicious anemia will keep you from producing enough IF. Pernicious anemia appears to be the most common cause of B deficiency.It would be worthwhile to check your test yourself to see where on the normal range you landed.

11330768,0,t3_61p5zx,Generally right away but the initial symptoms I think tend to be mild and its not until a bit later maybe a couple hours that I can say for sure that Ive been glutened. There was one instance though where it wasnt for a day or two that symptoms came up,Celiac,dfgbnt6,2,t5_2tnai
11336923,0,t3_61siaz,I have.  But I think it may be common for people to develop or lose allergies throughout thier lives.  Celiac or not.,Celiac,dfh0r0w,5,t5_2tnai

11475146,0,t1_dfw9hiy,If I had to guess Id say the same thing.  Im reading Eat Dirt right now and it seems to all go hand and hand. Im getting ready to start following the eat dirt protocol which is essentially paleo.  Leaky gut sounds made up to me but on the contrary increased intestinal permeability sounds completely legit   I think thats my problem.  Even though Im militantly and strictly GF I think Im caught in this cyclical leaky gut thing.,Celiac,dfwpbvq,1,t5_2tnai
11476750,0,t3_63t2aq,This sounds very much like a bad reaction I had last year when I was a few months into being diagnosed celiac. I risked eating at a restaurant with a friend he ate the same thing as me and about a half hour later the reaction started. My friend was perfectly fine but I was laid out for  days with intestinal distress non stop trips to the washroom kidney swelling massive fever. I would have went to the hospital if it wasnt for my dependency on a close by washroom. This reaction cemented my decision to take this disease serious I dont ever want to experience that again. Your situation sounds like it was a reaction. In many cases it only takes molecular amounts of gluten to initiate a Celiac reaction. Im not a doctor but this is my offering of advice as a fellow Celiac. I wish you and your family all the best. ,Celiac,dfwvvrl,5,t5_2tnai

Wow! you think Its like the chef truly understands my pallette! Minimal risk some planning involved  otherwise no anger or stress for anyone.  Winning!

11623025,0,t3_65umsq,gt Now on occasion I consume gluten in small amountsIm confused are you saying you have occasionally eaten small amounts of gluten for the entire  years since your apparently somewhat tentative diagnosis? How often is occasionally?,Celiac,dgdhbs4,2,t5_2tnai
11638988,0,t1_dgfa1kz,Thank you  yes Im being referred and Ill ask for an endoscopy  it will mean they can check for the gastritis etc as well. My dad got diagnosed coeliac at age  so Im aware it can remain hidden for years.Edit A biopsy was mentioned so I assume this will be done via endoscopy,Celiac,dgfajgv,3,t5_2tnai
11689626,0,t3_66s21n,I use it all the time. My daughter celiac is tested regularly so Im pretty sure you are good to go. ,Celiac,dgl1cdk,1,t5_2tnai
11735713,0,t1_dgpq7yj,It worries me when a parent doesnt know what their Celiac child cancant eat.  My exs brother and father were Celiac.  Im celiac too and when I came over for dinner once I assumed it would be just as safe as my own house.  After dinner she offered us Lindt chocolate truffles.  Those were one of the first things I figured out I couldnt eat because theres barley malt in them.  THEY DIDNT EVEN KNOW!!  How do you buy something as a celiac without checking the label???They also went to church and had communion every Sunday and ate the wafer gluten.  They had stomaches for a couple days or so but its worth it for the Lord!  Yeah sorry but Im not eating gluten every week.  I think God understands!  My ex tried telling me that it mattered more to take communion and risk get sick than it was to stay healthy and take care of my body.  I had a real problem with that conversation.,Celiac,dgq9tv8,6,t5_2tnai
11751949,0,t1_dgrfuuw,Because we dont know what questions to ask when we eat something. Very condescending. ,Celiac,dgs42q0,2,t5_2tnai
