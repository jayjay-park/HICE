9413420,0,t1_d996ym7,. I dont think you heal the Adjutant.. From the one of the bases in the middle of the map or back at your home base. just go up to the flag and hit E.Up to you but not needed..Lots of people new so were all learning with one another. Not too much just dont spend your gold coins right awayand save your gold starsfree XP. and Im sure other people may have some advice to toss your way.And a big tip the best way to fight if you can is out numbering someone v is the best way to go most of the time.,TigerKnight,d997tc8,2,t5_3h7k7
9450733,0,t3_5a4op8,Managed to pull back from  to  on the fire ships yesterday. Me and a friend were fighting a v on the left flank while the main fight happened in the centre killing one general and the other fleeing back to his base. We sprinted to the main fight to help but the enemies had wiped the rest of our team unfortunately for them theyd also lost all their troops and we arrived in time to fight it out and kill another  of them.Now me and my mate are down to no health no troops and the guy that ran at our first fight is coming back with reinforcements. We run back to base to get some troops but still have no health so have to go the long way round to the health flag to heal back up. In the meantime hes sat in the centre just grabbing more and more troops as they replenish at the flag there and as we head to him he starts charging at our marshal. Cue a big brawl where we manage to hack a path through his troops to him and cut him down before they can finish our marshal off.,TigerKnight,d9dy3rq,3,t5_3h7k7
9638348,0,t1_d9xgpbh,Yeah i found it but that key cant be changed,TigerKnight,da14ie6,1,t5_3h7k7
9643051,0,t1_da1of30,I completely agree we find  people to be ideal  people can be manageable but when I have queued with more than that  of the time the entire enemy team seems to be a whole tier higher than us and that just ruins any hope of winning,TigerKnight,da1pe47,1,t5_3h7k7
9650629,0,t1_d9zz2gw,Does the arrows fired with F does more damage than the regular ones?,TigerKnight,da2n1rq,1,t5_3h7k7
9940096,0,t1_dazp1bs,you can do combo on all the directions if you only use one direction. When using  you use eather left  right or with some weapons top  bottom,TigerKnight,db37wwz,1,t5_3h7k7
9949985,0,t1_db4gtrj,I did my first t in a day maybe?The day after the patch they introduced T I got my heavy cav to T.But that was one day of tryharding I usually dont play that much or play the same trooptype that much.,TigerKnight,db4ibsl,1,t5_3h7k7
10089433,0,t3_5ka92h,Might have been what they were shooting at. Different units have different defense values against ranged attacks and some might not be fully equipped.... They might have been nerfed though. I dont actually know.,TigerKnight,dbmo4qw,3,t5_3h7k7
10428864,0,t1_dcpz56q,next time i need lower the game volume,TigerKnight,dcq6ieo,1,t5_3h7k7
10936045,0,t1_de7eyv8,So for me to enjoy my tier  roman unit I have to first unlock at least  other unrelated units I dont enjoy from a tree I have no reason to upgrade? Does that seem sensible to you?,TigerKnight,de7z5hr,1,t5_3h7k7
11149103,0,t1_devq9yc,Nope its not mentioned anywhere. It really isnt a stat that matters. Used to be you could only get Roman gear by starting as them but thats not true anymore.,TigerKnight,devqltq,1,t5_3h7k7
11413920,0,t3_5ytaan,Good luck the NA server is being over run with Chinese language character users and it breaks the game.,TigerKnight,dfpr95v,1,t5_3h7k7
11447948,0,t3_63evfp,Huh. Ive never seen that issue before... But I also made my account a long time ago when the tutorials were run differently and you had to play through them all before the game started properly.The play button on top of the screen doesnt work? What does your interface look like when you click on any of the others? Thats mostly for Training though. For Tutorial... Hm.It may be better to ask on the Steam forums or Official Forums which the devs check often. They dont really use here.,TigerKnight,dftm5id,1,t5_3h7k7
