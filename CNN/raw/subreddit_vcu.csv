1359232,0,t1_cimnrg0,VCU is expensive for a public school like most VA public schools. VA is th highest for instate tuition fees at a public school.So for four years youre putting yourself in the hole about  a year while a high school grad is making around  grand a year for those four years. Youve lost  grand and theyve earned  putting you  behind them at graduation. This alone accounts for the majority of the discrepancy.If you and the high school grad get that same rate for  years youll still be  grand behind him. Also consider that he will most likely get substantial raises as he gets experience while teachers will usually only get the  cost of living adjustment yearly.EDITKeep in mind You will be working  less than he will and the benefit package you receive will most likely be worth far far far more than the additional earnings he makes over the  year period.,vcu,cimo4hb,2,t5_2qr81

I read the responses and Ive tried all of them and they are not the best. These however areAlladins While this may look like a hukkah bar from the outside it is actually a pizza miracle in disguise. If you like your pizza with tasteful cheese and robust sauce this is the place for you. Thier cheese is tvcommercial level stringy with the right amount of taste. Most of the pizza places have yet to hit that middle point where the cheese has a distinct flavour but does not overpower the tastebuds. Alladins does exactly that. Their sauce is always well proportioned and somewhat sweet which counteracts the flavour of the dough. All in all a great tasting pizza with a hint of grease not that olive oil vinnegrette shit either to take the edge off that hangover. Christians Your one stop shop for well cooked pizza with the right amount of crisp. Christians is about as traditional as you can get around these parts. They opt for a tomato sauce while many other places choose a marinara sauce which I think sets Christians apart both in taste and feel. Christians also has AMAZING specialty pizza which Ive found is unmatched. In conclusion I wouldnt wipe my gandmas ass with piccolas pizza. Their carboard base topped with cardboard sauce and cardboard cheese brings shame to pizza everywhere. If you do go Piccolas eat thier subs. They somehow make fantastic subs which I will not get into here.  Edit I have not tried Mary Angels,vcu,daxl4ta,1,t5_2qr81
