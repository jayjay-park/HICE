4347163,0,t3_3am83l,In the liver of GMfed mice we demonstrated significantchanges in the expression of  spots as indicated by labelson two representative gels obtained from controland GMfed animals. In particular  proteinsappeared significantly more expressed in GMfed micewhereas  proteins were significantly decreased....Protein distribution into functional categories indicatesthat the majority of diferentially expressed proteinsidentified by MS belong to hepatocyte metabolism namelynitrogen carbohydrate and lipid metabolism stressresponse and calcium signalling pathways as well as tomitochondria....Hepatocyte nuclei from GMfed mice differed fromcontrols because of more regular contour large clumps ofcondensed chromatin high number of PGperichromatin granules and smaller andcompact nucleoli rich in GCgranular components . Interestingly manyPG were observed inside the condensed chromatin areas.,GMOFacts,csfnogx,-1,t5_2vt0r
