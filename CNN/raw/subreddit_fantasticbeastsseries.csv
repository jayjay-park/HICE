3712993,0,t1_cqfi8eh,ampampamp Demiguise from Harrypotter wikia sfw gtgtThe Demiguise is a peaceful herbivorous creature that can make itself invisible. It is found in the Far East but only wizards and witches trained in their capture can even see them. It resembles an ape with large black eyes and long silky hair. Demiguise pelts are highly sought after as the hair can be woven into Invisibility cloaks.   Cloaks made from their hair eventually turn opaque losing their invisibility effects as time passes.gtThe Demiguises ability to make itself invisible is used to symbolise the number zero in the runic alphabet.  gtInteresting Demiguise Derby Derby | Far East East | Ug the Unreliable the Unreliable | Invisibility cloak cloak Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqfiu oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecqfiu.

10043167,0,t1_dbfiau2,Yes for the potion to work he needs to be alive. Though the technique played no role in the film no visible sipping from a suspicious bottle etc and the real Graves will probably not play any role in future films. They will play in other regions of the world so the MACUSA will also not play a role anymore. ,fantasticbeastsseries,dbgnffy,2,t5_34968
