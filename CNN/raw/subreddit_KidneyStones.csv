1139049,0,t1_chuh468,Such an interesting answer. I have a crazy metabolism hyperthyroid. I dont process anything right and after these kidney stones popped up which docs thought were everything but kidney stones so I had months of tests before diagnosis I cannot WAIT to have my thyroid ablated. Id put off that solution but so many things have gone wrong since I was diagnosed  months ago. Cdiff then pain we thought was cdiff recovery and then ovarian and then even colon when it moved to my back  it all turned out to be kidney stones.I was trying to figure out HOW I got stones because Im just not a candidate didnt even know girls could get kidney stones.I backed off stomach meds hoping that would help. Not sure if it did but ACV sure helped until last week when my doctor freaked about vinegar tearing up my stomach lining and she said to take Vit. C instead until they could do the imaging. Id cancelled that because the ACV helped so much I thought it was over.FAIL! The Vit. C pills made my stomach burn like crazy the ACV really didnt esp diluted and within days something happened where everything came back with a vengeance! First the peeing problems started then PAIN and today Im back on ACV and just suffering.Not blaming the Vit. C or even the stomach drugs anymore or foods... nope. I agree with you and think if somethings weird with your metabolism youve just got to get that right for me fry my thyroid to make the stones stop forming.,KidneyStones,chxr5gy,1,t5_2viuq
1976379,0,t3_2hc2oo,I actually worked for three full weeks not even realizing my stone was lodged in my ureter. The initial pain of the atone leaving my kidney was the worst for a few days the only time Ive ever had to call out of work. I work as a CNAmedtech so Im constantly on my feet moving around transferring people etc. I think youll be fine especially if the stone has broken up into several piece. Do you know what the initial size of the stone was when you first went into the ER? Mine was mm and I ended up having to have it removed via uteroscopy when it wasnt even causing me much pain. I could still feel that something was in my side though people kept telling me your body just went through something its never been through before. Its going to be sore. I definitely recommend going back to work and at least just trying it. Besides if I were you Id save all my sick days for days when I actually needed them. You never know when another stone might come out and you might need to leave earlybe out of work. Best of luck!,KidneyStones,ckrcqna,3,t5_2viuq

5025836,0,t1_curm432,She was in for about  hours. They gave her a prescription for morphine and an antispasm medication. The doctor thinks she may have an infection from the trauma the stone caused because her white blood cell count is elevated too. I hope this ends soon for her I hate seeing her in so much pain.,KidneyStones,cursz0o,1,t5_2viuq
5686563,0,t1_cx1yxss,Yes there is a lot of formal proof that citrate helps prevent stone formation. Ive actually discussed this with my urologist. I personally find it helps my pain quite a bit I suspect there are  reasons for this. First it alkalizes your urine. Second it coats the stone a bit so it gets a bit smoother. Its those spiky bits that hurt so much.Citric acid and kidney stones ,KidneyStones,cx1z1rg,1,t5_2viuq

6239326,0,t1_cyxw7ms,Ive never had ESWL but I have a coworker whos had hundreds of stones and he told me ESWL was painful and could damage your kidneys. I dont know that much about ESWL though. I had read a lot of people complaining about the pain of ureterscopy but I just havent experienced that. The needle pee is gone  day later and I feel pretty good. I get the stent out next week and then I wait for the results on how to change my diet.,KidneyStones,cyyue7m,1,t5_2viuq

6477403,0,t3_447mkc,I had my first mm stone back in  I think?  It passed but there was no follow up from the urologist.  Last October I developed a mm stone on the same side left side.  Back to the ER the CT scan found itplus an mm beast in my right kidney !!!  The one that passed was a calcium oxalate stone.They had to do a percutaneous ie with a scope removal.  They made similar dietary suggestions as ufingersphil cut my animal protein in half reduce sodium drink . liters  oz of water a day put lemon juice in the water a couple of times a day No dark leafies no tea no nuts or chocolate I ate a lot of nuts and chocolate every week Come back in  mos for a followup.He didnt suggest it but I decided to go lowoxalate in those three months.  My first shock was how many things are high in oxalates!  I swear to God whats left is VERY restricted.  Check out this listOK.  Cant eat a lot of meat...guess Ill stock up on beans.  Yeah well guess what?  Beans are high in oxalates!  The only two I could find that werent were blackeyed peas and butter beans.I can be pretty disciplined if I need to and was very good about sticking to the plan.I just had my first follow up exam a couple of weeks ago and all my numbers were perfect except twoToo high in calcium and too high in oxalates.DAMMIT!  Where is that coming from?   I dont do dairy where is all the calcium coming from?  Lowoxalate diet but my numbers were still high??And have you guys gone online and tried to look up advice on what to eatsupplement with?   Good luck sorting all THAT out!  Ive seen all kinds of advice that contradicts all the other advice Ive seen.  Its maddening!  I was completely stone free based on the xray but he could not explain why those two numbers where over the recommended levels.He admited he knew almost zero about the nutritional side of this just that those were the recommended changes. He confessed that I probably knew more about the dietary side than he did.It seems like an almost possible experiment to conduct  There are so many variables.  Hydration protein oxalate intake.  You cant really change only one and then retest in  months.  Im going to have to doubledown on my diet.  I got a food scale and Im going to have to try and track more precisely what I eat each day and compare it to the list.   I tend to eat like the same  veggies every day the only ones I could find that were low on the list! a paltry amount of meat  egg  oz of chicken or beefits pathetic no dairy a little rice no potatoeshigh in oxalates! no grains...In my personal opinion I strongly suspect my stones were do to underhydration and a waytoofondofnutsampchocolate diet.  I like crunchy!  What can I say?!I suspectbut not sure how I would safely testthat I could return to a normal diet as long as I continued to avoid the nuts amp choc and stuck to my  oz of water every day.Also regarding this oxalate intake thing  Im willing to bet that there are plenty of people with high oxalate numbers in their urine that never get stones.  I think the oxalate thing is probably a correlation and not proven as a causation...,KidneyStones,czpb6tl,2,t5_2viuq

8098893,0,t3_4q4pis,It is total idiocy that they didnt give you pain meds! I get that addiction to pain meds is a problem in our society but that is taking the concern too far. Find a new doctor and talk to him about this if you are looking at future stones. My doc actually gave me a scrip for pain meds that I can use whenif the two stones still in my kidney drop. ,KidneyStones,d4qdzsq,5,t5_2viuq
8122524,0,t1_d4sy2wg,urine citrate helps prevent crystalization. If your urine citrate is low then an increase of citrate in your diet might help bring it to normal levels which can help prevent calcium oxolate stones from forming. However if the source of your stones is something other than dietary citrate uptake in the cells due to dietary protien then it may not help.In the case of uric acid stones the stones are actually dissolved by the pH change in the urine as you consume more citrate rather than preventing crystallization by increasing urine citrate.  In any case its worth having the discussion with a urologist who will be able to analyze the stones and prescribe any medication.,KidneyStones,d4t1m4g,1,t5_2viuq
8254378,0,t3_4sfkak,Okay I woke up this morning and the urge to pee was even worse so I took another hot bath. When I got out my kidney started to hurt so I decided I would to the urgent care next door. As soon as I got to my car the pain started rising rapidly. By the time I got to the urgent care I was shaking badly holding back vomit trying not to pass out while filling out paper work and getting my blood pressure done. Like . out of  on the pain scale. Then they told me to go wait in exam room  so I hobbled in the exam room and suddenly the all the pain vanished! Im almost certain that was a renal colic episode.The doctor prescribed me flomax tylenol with codein and some antibiotics. Said to try to pass it in a week. If I dont they will xray or CT scan to see the size and location of the stone and go from there.,KidneyStones,d59cqsa,2,t5_2viuq
8304855,0,t3_4t9lil,I have had several for about  years usually  or  a year. If you can afford it get them to give you a prescription for flomax. It will help relax your ureter and allow it to pass. Felt one coming about two weeks ago and took it and was able to pass one that was .mm. Still hurt some but not as bad if I didnt have the flomax. ,KidneyStones,d5fnwth,1,t5_2viuq

9348731,0,t1_d8oteo8,gt I wonder why evolution put those pain receptors there?Yeah. Ive wondered about this as well.However kidney stone surgery did happen before modern medicine. Kidney stone removal was already done in a fast and efficient but still quite dangerous way in the th century and the first recorded kidney stone removal in the kidney was in the Renaissance. Even in Ancient Greece there were treatments for stones.,KidneyStones,d910peh,2,t5_2viuq
9717435,0,t3_5e5fa0,I think its nonsense. Drinking water is probably what got those stones to move.You had lithotripsy? It can take weeks to pass the fragments and usually the post op pain is due to bruising of the kidney not the stones.,KidneyStones,daavuza,1,t5_2viuq
9961461,0,t1_db35p2j,Agreed. My pain came out of nowhere at about a  and ramped up over the next  hours to the most pain I have ever felt. Its not something that can be ignored.,KidneyStones,db605xm,1,t5_2viuq
10370219,0,t3_5o89v3,Its quite possible. A small stone may not produce a lot of pain. When I look back over the decades I realize that a lot of the pain Ive had could have been stones but was often put down to something else period pain UTIs but no infection IBS but no lab test to confirm gas pain appendix but no appendicitis lower GI issues. It was only after having the identical type of pain and having the stone confirmed by a scan that I realized that a lot of this stuff was probably stones.Flank pain and blood in the urine says its likely a stone but only an xray or ct scan can confirm. Ct scan is the best way to confirm this. Drink a glass of water every  hours to flush that sucker out. Not to scare you or anything but you can go from minor pain to OMG I WANT TO DIE pain very quickly. If the pain becomes severe go to an ER. Urgent care wont be able to do much for you you will need to be on IV painkillers saline and Flomax. If theyre really nice theyll give you some anti nausea drugs as well because puking is another symptom that comes with the pain.Having said that the intense pain is often short lived as in hours not days.,KidneyStones,dcjiyh6,1,t5_2viuq
11027562,0,t3_5xgnmp,mm may be very difficult to pass. It sounds like the stone is down in the ureter which is the narrowest part of the journey. How did they determine you had a mm stone? You dont really need to get a CT scan if they already know that.Tramadol is useless for severe stone pain. You really need Percocets or similar and more like s than s. I dont recommend popping  Tramadols I think you can take Tramadol with acetaminophen so you could take  dose of Tramadol and  dose of extra strength acetaminophen. You might want to double check that with an online drug interaction checker. They should have prescribed Flomax for you as well it relaxes the ureters so the stone can move more easily.OK if the pain is really bad you might want to go to the ER. You will get better pain meds for sure. If you dont get bad enough to go to the ER find a urologist and make an appointment. If you tell them you have a stone they often can get you in right away. The urologist can and will do a lot more for you than a regular doc.Drink lots of water it helps move the stone. A full glass of water every  hours is a good target to shoot for. More liquids are okay too.,KidneyStones,dehy6i0,2,t5_2viuq
11526567,0,t1_dg2j4v6,I make calcium oxalate stones so I try to watch my oxalates. But my urine tests have shown that I dont excrete much oxalate. I also try to make sure I have calcium from food since the calcium tends to bind with oxalate in the intestine instead of the oxalate making it to the kidneys. But my calcium levels are also normal.I was already avoiding very high oxalate items but I tried cutting out medium items and it didnt really help. So the big thing for me is water consumption. I drink by the time on the clock every  hours. Its noon? Time for  ounces of water. Its  PM?  PM?Time for another glass.  Thats the minimum. You want to produce  to . liters of urine a day. This way I dont have to keep track of anything other than the time. I was going to start having a light beer a day because thats been shown to correlate to fewer stones but I was just diagnosed with a hiatal hernia as the cause of my major heartburn so alcohol is no longer allowed on my anti reflux diet.,KidneyStones,dg2jdu7,2,t5_2viuq
