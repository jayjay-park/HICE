They are aloud to go anywhere except for parks and any private business that denies them entry. They are aloud to work on the docks and anywhere that will hire them. This law is not in place in the Karoo province. About population the estimated population is based on people that have been seen by WesKappen officials.

Apples are pressed for cider fermented into an apple wine and then placed in buckets outside during the winter. As the beverage drops in temperature ice made of mostly pure water comes out of solution and floats to the top the remaining water now with a higher concentration of alcohol collects at the bottom. The ice is regularly removed through the winter resulting in an  ABV drink with a distinct apple flavor.Thanks to the surplus harvest in autumn  ACE a copious amount of applejack was produced with the intention of hosting an Applejack Festival in the spring.On March st thousands flocked to Revolution to partake in the festivities celebrating the survival of another winter.

2298341,0,t3_2ljrjr,The nature of our world or Gujarat desires Kushans provincesFrom the outset preserving any token of goodwill in the relations between Kushan and Gujarat has proven difficult. Our efforts have been consistently sabotaged by the leadership of the Gujarat government through the unrelenting force of its coldwar lens and its weaponised paranoia  the antithesis of what our nation stands for. To claim that we have aggressive ambitions against peaceloving nations after refusing all attempts to deescalate the border question in favour of revanchism is a vitriol work of propaganda to drum up support for the dismantlement of states which are systematically isolated. The very creation of our nation two years ago was founded upon the premise of compromise of acceptance and most of all  of tolerance. Tolerance of every individual every Punjab Kashmiri or Gujarati every Indian and Pakistani every Sikh every Muslim this was the foundation to our reconstruction. For without this ideal there would be no Unity or Discipline no Faith to push onward. Tolerance to every people no matter what borders they live within is a matter of sovereignty a value so often ignored by the powers which brought about the apocalypse  such as the Republics of India and Pakistan. The former being a government which Ms. Naoroji of Gujarat seeks to emulate in the democratic tradition  the failed insistence of imperialism. While many peoples across Asia have formed their own democratic governments none of them use it as a hammer which to batter opposing peoples in none of them as a pen on the map for blood marked parallels. To use it as a wedge to contain and bar off other peoples from their world  from their brothers in faith and heritage  is sickening. Only the A.D. governments perpetrated the abuse of democracy as a casus belli. A.D. governments have no place in our Common Era. This dying corpse will force no diktat on Kushan.To our brothers in heritage and faith in the West of Asia we ask that you consider the nature of which our world will settle into. Is war and death which we will now feel the consequences of something which should be reintroduced into our fragile state of humanity? Is this the way forward? To blindly follow the ideals of Gujarat would have dangerous consequences. To forego cooperation and compromise in the name of peace would be to award the State of Gujarat and its faithful ally Sri India the right to all of Hindustan  a superpower over the development of the Islamic World and Asia which cannot be negotiated with under the justification of paranoid delusions of territorial designs and duplicity. As nations irresistibly grow their roots further into the heritage and spirit of the collective we can only hope that they also find their hearts and that it listens to the voices of the people who unanimously call for peace for rebuilding!Defence details The Kushan government has made no formal detailing of the size of its military for security reasons but it is evident that the size of the entire mobilised forces total in the many hundreds of thousands and is somewhat equitable in size to those sent by Gujarat and her ally with the ability to provide a formidable barrier even on the largely defenceless plain which has only rivers as a check to Gujarat expansion.gtPopulation Calculator,WastelandPowers,clvshc2,2,t5_33we4

I hope that our two nations can be bound by friendship and by the shared cause of peace! Do the teachings of the Buddha exist in your land? It seems in many parts of the world they have been forgotten but if you would allow we would send monks to spread the light of Dharma to the Alai Beylik! Of course these monks would also provide food and care for the sick and poor regardless of their beliefs. In ancient times our civilizations were connected by a trade route through Tibet. If you would be willing we would once again establish a caravan and begin trading knowledge and resources ensuring prosperity for both of our kingdoms!

4153447,0,t1_crtofgo,Ramble all you wish fear and excitement is exactly what I wanted to hear. This is Dragon Fire made from the waste products of fire and poisonous ores from the earth. The Alchemists cook it up mix it correctly and suddenly it learns to breathe fire. But you are absolutely right it is dangerous. The elephants are smart enough to be afraid horses are dumb enough and even hunters shy away from such a display.I have been informed that Elephants can be trained like horses not to be afraid of such explosions around them. If they can why cannot the horse and why cannot the hunters? Ensure the distant blast is felt everyday and all animals will realise they have nothing to fear so long as they are not close.She gives a wry smile. Of course we dont bet on that. At the moment its just fire on a stick were trying to find ways of making it sing towards an enemy. Arrows seem to be the way but making the fire leap out at the end of the arc instead of at the top is a problem. But imagine dozens of these a hundred falling upon the ranks of an enemy. An army routed before it could even approach.Now she points over towards the distant mountain in the background their Earthmother That is what those gods taught my husband and everyone here. War is an art and perfectionism is the ultimate goal of any pursuit. Dragon Fire perfects the art of destroying morale as there is nothing more frightening than fire erupting from above. Winning a battle with not a single casualty. Thats a gift more valuable than hundreds of those elephants.The guard coughs pointedly and the Bergum gives her an annoyed look.

First you need to make sure that you have a Google account so that you can use Google Drive which is what the subreddit uses for the various calculators and documents that we have.Then click the link to the Resource Calculator and click File gt Make a copy in the top left corner.So now you have your own calculator now you just have to fill it in. Make sure that youre on the first page titled Frontpage. It should have a list of all the resources along the top with the amount underneath them and along the left side a series of boxes that interpret the data you input.Now go to the next page titled Regions. In this page there will be a series of duplicated sections with A written in the top left of each and again a list of all the resources.So along the left of each section you should have this The A is the region that you owns code European ones start with E North America has A and in South America youve got B.Below that in the blank box is where you put in the amount of provinces in the region that you control which it uses to give you the amount of resources youd get from your share of the region. For example if you owned the whole of a region the number would be  if you owned only half itd be . and if you only had a quarter itd be . and so on.To get the region numbers you look at this map which you can find in the Region Key link in the sidebar. In your case you own territory in B B B and B. In B you have  of  provinces so the number youd have is .. In B you have all of the provinces so the number is . In B you have  of  provinces so the number is .. Finally in B you have  of  provinces so the number is ..If you fill in these numbers you should end up with your first four boxes looking something like this If you go back to the Frontpage now it will tell you how much population you have and how much of each resource you have under each of the resources listed along the top.To improve a resource go back to the Regions pagetab. In this case as youre trying to improve a food resource the most common being maize youd look for which province gives you the most maize already.In this case it is B. To bring the improvement into effect you fill in the Region Improvements row under the Maize column on B with  as youve just given Maize in B one improvement. If you were to make another post tomorrow improving it again youd write  as youd have then given it two improvements.If you did the improvement correctly it should now look something like this.If you have any more questions or I didnt explain something fully just ask.,WastelandPowers,ct9nf9a,1,t5_33we4

The lore reason behind it is that the King wished for everyone to speak secretively so as to ensure that secrecy could be maintained and that other civilisations or outsiders could not understand what he said. Theres going to be different forms of it with a low middle and high class version of the language with each distant enough to be unintelligible to speakers of other dialects. Foreigners are only permitted to learn the low version of the language and only nobles on the Royal Council Imperial Family   most powerful dukes in the kingdom are permitted and taught to speak the high class version of the language. The language is going to be known as Astravian named after the country and the King Astrav II with the three forms being Common Astravian Low new Astravian Middle and Imperial Astravian High. Additionally Imperial Astravian in lore will be a secretly kept language that even the general public does not know exists. Rumours exist but thats about it. Old Astravian is an older dialect that was created by Astrav II though it fell out of use and was replaced with the  dialect system. People who speak Imperial Astravian are able to completely understand those that speak New and Common Astravian though the other way is not possible. ,WastelandPowers,cw70jf1,1,t5_33we4

The current system of one eventtechexpansion and numerous lorenews post in a day has worked well in the past and I can see it continuing to work.As for the map I still feel that . did it right. The map was just the right size for  players. It did feel empty towards the end of .s lifetime and for your sake SA was always empty but that is to be expected. I highly agree that a cohesive lore needs to be implemented though. I thought it was just lazy that . just did not bother to have one it made every nations stories seem somewhat detached. Tech is a sticky situation. I dont feel that I have a good solution for the problems faced.
