However my work is entirely transformed in that my purpose and perception are entirely different. I think my paintings are critically transformed but it would be difficult to prove it by any rational line of argument.

238216,0,t1_cf4y5x2,I know about the story of Apollo and Daphne and my point isnt that people shouldnt be naked. Thats fine by me. And although I personally think that the ApolloDaphne story is a horrible one it has the somewhat valid excuse of being very old. This painting isnt. Id also like to point out a few differences between the older paintings and this one . Daphne is the only one undressed. . We cant see her face which is a great way to dehumanize somebody.. In the older painting Daphne is running and capable of action but in Millers shes just passively falling into Apollos arms.But yes this is a beautiful painting. It would just be nice if people thought a bit more about how we portray other people and if were maybe contributing to establish limiting gender roles and harmful stereotypes. ,Art,cf5fwf4,0,t5_2qh7a

Very interesting stuff. I am not a fan of his or of destroying antiques but the last bit made Caminero sound like kind of a twat.

434115,1,t1_cfpr22n,I think thats the point... The audience for something like this isnt an art connesiuer the intended audience is veterans. The artist had a choice of burying his lead and hiding the meaning beneath symbolism or choosing to get the message across to those who are most likely to identify with the piece. Im glad he chose the latter. The painting conveys a you are not alone message to everyone who can identify with the subject. Why limit his audience to only those who can work through the symbolism when the connection between audience and artist is clearly what is sought here?We live in a society that is only now coming to grips with the horrible realities of PTSD and the painting is getting flack for not hiding its message. For a disorder that has been hidden for so long Im glad Im being clubbed over the head with the message.,Art,cfpregw,1,t5_2qh7a
437080,0,t3_1z31y7,Untitled?I like the brush treatment for the water but for the sky I feel like it isnt very applicable. The piece is occupying a place between realism and abstraction but isnt close enough to either to really feel resolved at least for me. It is very obviously supposed to be a silhouetted sunset scene over the ocean but there are a few inclusions that are inaccurate or confusing namely the colours present in the sky. The sun and the silhouettes are too bright and your overall palette is very primary a lot of these colours could have been more carefully selected. For next time try narrowing your palette mixing large globs of four or five colours and keeping a white and a black at hand for lightening or darkening. You can also adulterate your white and your black so they dont seem so stark as the silhouette in your painting currently does I use yellow for my whites and a purpleblue for my blacks and I rarely use pure black in figuration I tend to add a smidgen of white to push it more towards a neutral.All in all my critique amounts to suggesting you try mixing colours and being more selective with the colours you use.,Art,cfq2h4l,5,t5_2qh7a

495056,0,t3_1zseyz,actually yes. Robert Ryman was a american artist who restricted himself to the simple square painting to portray a sense of complexity. He would build all the canvases himself and created the supports using different forms of media so the final results were always different. Now what you cant see is the subtle work in the brush strokes and the simple essence of the white painting is to heighten the viewers sensitivity to the brush strokes. Seemingly lazy Ryman was actually very meticulous in his craft. ,Art,cfwjiga,18,t5_2qh7a

790353,0,t1_cgu39hh,Youre a fucking moron. The fact that you think that level of talent can be taught shows that youre a moron. My point was it isnt impressive because shes  its impressive because its an amazing drawing and the fact that you guys feel the need to belittle her talent by throwing her age into the mix is a slap in the face. ,Art,cgu485h,-7,t5_2qh7a
791056,0,t1_cgu6el8,God you are so laughably bad at arguing its farcical. Your arguments were why arent there millions of great artists my answer is because not everyone is going to dedicate thirty years to drawing. If everybody did do that we would have millions of great artists. The dame applies to musicians jugglers polyglots etc. People have priorities and passions and art is not a priority or a passion for every person on earth.I do not have an example for you because the example that was worth the time to get to prove some idiot wrong on the internet i.e. Next to none has been taken down further proving my point that artists that do practice do not post their earlier drawings everywhere. Lastly this. Is. Common. Sense. The fact that you ignore a basic principal of human nature i.e. That practicing enough will make you very good at something for  of those attempting it is akin to denying that humans grow their vocabulary with time.Seriously I shouldnt need a shred of proof when anybody who hasnt lived under a rock their entire life knows this to be true. Youre a parody of your own self at this point. Take the tube of oil paint out of your ass and calm the fuck down Picasso idk why youre even this butt hurt in the first place. ,Art,cgu73ly,5,t5_2qh7a

Ever since I got out of school Ive wanted to turn my stuff into merchandizes. I finally got my first try! I hope you guys like it and I would love to have some support.The concept was to take the famous Chinese mythology The Monkey King and give it twist to it. So what I did was taking the original main cast and turn them into modern day bank robbing criminals. I was inspired by the bank heist movie Heat and also the recently popular game Hotline Miami.

Youve likely noticed that there is a lot of content to go through especially now that were a default subreddit. Its impossible for us to get to everything immediately so we have a strict Automoderator that removes most of the spam you dont end up seeing and title breaking posts and us moderators tend to remove the most egregious posts immediately. But we also rely on you guys to help us by reporting posts you see that slip by and break the rules so we can get to them faster. ,Art,cixmewi,2,t5_2qh7a

1460286,0,t3_2aw1q0,A book cover I designed for a penguin book cover competition a few years a go. My intention was to create something old from the forest and with a touch of trickery that many of the Grimms fairy tales contained.It was created using adobe illustrator and the laser cut into wood and then the wood was photographed. each letter depicts when of the stories from Grimms fairy tales. The F contains the story of the  snake leaves The A contains the frog prince the I contains sleeping beauty the R contains the bremen town musicians and the Y contains the BIg Bad Wolf. But what about the rest of the letters well this is where the trickery comes in. The word tales is the word fairy upside down its an ambigram so it reads the same upside down. On the back cover is a twisted tree but turn the book upside down and see if you can find the two creatures that I believe were the polar opposites in the Grimm fairy tales the wolf and the frog. ,Art,cizbm2d,1,t5_2qh7a

I love to doodle as well and this looks like it could be the beginnings of an interesting tattoo design. I do want to let you know that youre post could also be at risk of removal from one of the other moderators as we have another rule  gtDo not submit work that is a sketch a doodle or an unfinished work unless it is a discussion looking for help on how to finish. You can post those to other subreddits like rIDAP rsketches rdoodles instead.I personally will let it go and if its properly flaired then it tends not to be removed but I just wanted to let you know in case another moderator goes decide to remove it for that reason. ,Art,cj5icx8,1,t5_2qh7a

1627811,0,t1_cjkbjxk,gtYou cannot simple say someone is talking to God God is too loaded a title. Well I think we all know well that the Idea of God is theory laden. It goes without saying. Nevertheless for our discussion I really am sure a very loose definition could suffice as it only infringes marginally upon the argument. We dont have to even discuss God per se but instead discuss the idea of God that is the image of the sacred or the theophanic.A theophanic experience is very much human. Some philosophers Roger Scruton I think claim that we first experience the image of god when we first experience the presence of an other.Think about it. Imagine youre a lonely solipsist whose never encountered any object that has a soul or life. Just rocks trees sand air. You go about your day every day flittering about in the throes of your spacetime momentum interacting with all the physical objects borken bottles inert pebbles dry twigs wet leaves all of which passinandout of being in front of you crisscrossing in and out back and forth from voidspace outside of your phenomenological horizon.And then you see a face. Youre out for a walk in the forest and you see her a woman standing in front of you. and for some reason you see something in that face that you dont see in anything else. In fact it is more apt to describe it as a presence. is more of presence. It is presence that is much heavier than the what might be found in the simple observation that something is alive. Like a pillbug or a fly.The face is just a mass of objects. Eyes. Nose. Ears. Foreheads. Hair. Eyebrows. Teeth.Yet we recognize in it something more.Some people claim that our perception of the Other is where genealogically speakingthe notion of the theophanic arises. Now why am I telling you this? Well I thought you just might think its a neat concept. I do. If you were inclined to read more about it Google Roger Scrutons work on the concept of the sacred.The other reason I am telling you this is to show you how even the most profound concepts such as God can arise in the more natural sphere of human experience the experience unaided by psychedelics or trauma.gtwhen I take a certain dosage of magic mushrooms or any other strong psychedelic I have an experience of oneness.. with reality.. with the universe.. this experience leaves me with an impression that I am and have always been here and am somehow part of the whole infinite process.Let me begin by saying that this experience of oneness or cosmological transcendental unity  is not uncommon in many pictures of the godimage i.e. the notion of God.And many have reached this conclusion without psychedelic aid.You should understand that it is important for your argument that is if you are still arguing that Psychedelics are designed to lead us toward expanded notions of the Divine then you must at least provide some example where this design can lead or import to us knowledge that our mundane and ordinary experiences have no access.I dont think you can do that. Many conceptions of God arrived at by the psychedelic community can be easily traced out from our normal experiences just with far less intuition. gtPerhaps this is just a chemical reaction in the brainNot at all at least in my opinion. Obviously a controversial issue. I would think youre conflating selfconsciousness with the instrument that provided for it. You can point to touch poke or prod the chemicals and matter that subsist together as your brain. But you can not poke point to touch poke or prod your conscious self.Well I think this is a loaded question.  These are two different things.Not as far as we can empirically report in my experience of both the report is the same. Both are experiencing altered states of consciousness both are having experiences of something supernatural.If you are going to say that they are different you need to show what it is that is added to the experience of the man on DMT and absent in the schizophrenic homeless man.But entertaining this example is even a bit unnecessary. If we return to the proposition that psychedelic experiences produce spiritual experiences you must explain by what method. The usual answer provided is that psychedelics alter expand or transform consciousness.But this raises the question  why does expanding altering or transforming consciousness produceprovide interactions with God? By expanding the consciousness... you might reply but that is begging the question.gtThe feeling of oneness is a THING its not a one off thought its an intense feeling in which the brain tries to understand and explain using language and somehow many people report the same experience... oneness.. Not to be cruel but this reads like someone just smacked you upside the heady with Wittgensteins Tractatus and you got all woozy while you typed it out. If language is an oddity to you I can assure you many people have been down that road and have planted those gardens and cultivated the fruit of those observations.gtYou are trying to draw a parallel between the shared experience of sane people using psychedelics to the ramblings of an insane person who contributes very little to societynot trying to belittle the insane person with this fact. I mention the fact that these insane people rarely contribute to society but many people who have had a mystical experience have contributed to society and many drug users have helped create the world we currently live in. You are comparing a person who probably cant even take care of themselves who can hardly speak any logical or coherent sentence  to sane educated and logical people.This is an offensive and fallacious argument. First of all not all homeless schizophrenics are worthless parasites. Second of all not all Schizophrenics are insane especially not in the sense you are using the word insane. Schizophrenia is a debilitating disease but many schizophrenics very sane people whose schizophrenia usually manifests itself in emotional and behavioral disorders but also shocking intelligence and alarming creativity. They can live well and can cope in society. Try and research schizophrenia before you start making assumptions about schizophrenics.Second of all it matters not whether either the mystics or the schizophrenics are contributors to society that has no bearing on whether or not their experiences of the divine or transcendental are authentic. I have no idea why you presented this point into your argument.,Art,cjkcmn4,2,t5_2qh7a

But honestly even his use of color and composition is just kind boring.  Its polished but you can only do so much with a polished turd.  The long deep descriptions for each work and oldschool giant digital signature on everything just really rubs it in.Sorry I dont usually even comment but this piece and his other work on deviantart just pissed me off.

1736653,0,t3_2ec3ot,     Your brothers work is not bad for someone who thinks they do not draw well.     Im an art educator and I wish I had students with this kind of natural ability at times.     I can commend his use of contrast most notably his use of juxtaposition of shape his use of shape rhythm repetition and line.              The composition itself though is lacking in direction from first glance however it is entirely possible that it may be more relevant to him. The piece gives the impression that it is an abstract representation of his thoughts while working and if that is the case I can not fault your brothers choices but I will say that he could benefit from some creative guidance and instruction to take his strengths and help him to spread his wings so to speak. Tell him to think about what he wants others to see and remind him that everyone sees things a little differently and some of the most successful artists find a way to convey their message in a way where it is understood by most all people.TLDR Not bad but could be better.,Art,cjy2igp,7,t5_2qh7a

You plenty of time to make it an abstract piece if youre not happy with the realism. You got this brah. Oil would be nice especially with those colors...but it takes so long to dry. Im impatient personally so I normally paint with acrylic. Its up to you really. Id get a wide variety of brushes and paints for this its true you can mix any color you want but sometimes newer painters find it better to keep mixing simple. Id sketch out the whole piece lightly with pencil on canvas first. That way you can make sure proportions and perspectives and everything is to your liking. Its easier to erase graphite then to cover up paint. I look forward to seeing the final project. ,Art,ck20tth,1,t5_2qh7a

1868550,0,t3_2g05ry,Id love to hear some of your opinions critique and criticism!Its based on this  I started this in my final year of studying fine art at college its painted on a x ft sheet of plywood. I used acrylic paint throughout. Originally this was a bit of a statement about wealth extravagance and elitism  hence the picture of Bond looking a bit cocky with some money in his hand. There was actually a lot more on the canvas but a couple of days ago I felt that I wasnt happy with it so took it out into the garden and used a spade to literally scrape off the paint It also had some bits of canvas glued to it so I ripped those off. Then to add some depth and texture to the painting I dripped a load of white paint in the corner. I quite like the look that scraping off the paint left.,Art,ckecqyf,1,t5_2qh7a

Technically they were supposed to be onetimeuse so wasteful! but you could open them up and extract the files with a usb cable. Pretty much any digital camera has an infrared filter to help the images look natural to us. So if you find an old cheap digital camera that you dont care about give it a try. You end up getting exposures with both humanvisible light and nonvisible light combined which can sometimes look quite strange.Edit These are the OnetimeUse cameras that I referenced LinK,Art,cksuxdr,1,t5_2qh7a

2357706,0,t1_cm318hi,Whoa. Im not sure if you are exaggerating but if not it blows my mind how bad public transort is where you live. I mean three to four times as long to get anywhere its no wonder you dont even consider it as an alternative because thats ridiculous and the spotty coverage and little comfort only hammer the point.Here where I live taking the bus is usually a little slower five to fifteen minutes depending on the distance than a car and if you count parking the car in a city the buses can at times even be slightly faster trams and especially the metro beat cars all the time. The stops are frequent enough to get pretty much everywhere you want within five minutes of walking and the comfortability isnt bad either usually better than a car aside from the privacy. the intercity buses even serve you a drink of your choice and allow you to watch movies listen to music or read newspapers all included in the cost of the ticketAbandoning cars is a silly prospect of course but public transport can be competitive especially if there are some further incentives for it. It would make the situation better for everyone  less congestion for car users more affordable and still comfortable public transit for the rest.,Art,cm34g0w,3,t5_2qh7a

I ultimately would like to see if there is any market for his work. I have a couple pictures to show. I know that if I could show him that his passion for art could be profitable it would once again spark his creative mind.

2740447,0,t1_cnfjtce,Just a thought because I have similar issues to those that you described keep a piece of sketch paper next to you while you draw. This is your I dont effing care page. Use this to test the depth of your depth curves etc. but try to let yourself relax. Just scribble on the thing if you have to. Paper is cheap. Try drawing with varying pressure different shading styles etc. More importantly look at the linework of your favorite artists. Try finding someone who attains the depth you want and try to imitate it. Its not plagiarism if you are using it for study. How did they get the curve of an eye with one line? How did they shade that without crosshatching? It seems like you are working with a H or so try burning through some Bs and let your OCD TAKE A VACATION...then get back to the meticulous stuff. Let your style come out by allowing some wildness and perfect your pieces after those sketches. Dynamic Figure Drawing would be a good book for you IMHO. It really shows one method of approaching depth without hours and hours of wasted fine line work. Save the delicate stuff for the end. Ultimately master all of the implements without relying on too many at one time. See what you can do with one pencil see its limits. Add  more and a good eraser and draw the same thing...sorrybif Im babbling. I just like supporting artists. Hope I see more someday!,Art,cnfkskf,1,t5_2qh7a

Digital has been in a way a bit of an equalizer for some folks because you can generate a lot of volume quicker so if you have a strong traditional background it gives you a means to create what you see in your mind even faster I used to draw almost exclusively in pencil and while I still looooooove drawing in pencil I know that its almost an order of magnitude slower than if I want to push something out digitally... different mediums though ,Art,cnqfmhp,3,t5_2qh7a

2910295,0,t1_cny5o9k,Sure in practice they both dispense ink via the same ballpoint mechanism or maybe not per what uJJRousseau has said but when you talk about a piece of art you list the various media used so that people can know how you created the artwork. Acrylic paints and watercolor paints can be applied to a canvas in the same way using paintbrushes but the paints themselves differ from each other and produce wildly different textures and characteristics. Also for this reason when you look at pens online at like Staples or whatever gel pens are considered a different category than ballpoint pensbecause the ink is different so they yield different results as a writing implement. I say this only as a weirdo who has read various pens blogs for years and who collects pens for fun. ,Art,cnywp53,2,t5_2qh7a

2938810,0,t3_2tqo9q,I paint with acrylics and normally I will paint a highlighted are in four steps. I do a base of skin tone or the basic cloth color..whatever then put in shadowing and contrast using a succession of browns and greys..very rarely black. Once these two layers are mostly dry to the touch I go back with white or cream or whatever light highlight color will be used and apply it sparingly on the areas of highest contrast. Then as this layer dries I rinse out my brush and normally switch to a broader softer bristle that is normally flat with a slightly angled edge. I will lightly wet this brush and slowly blend the layers together adding dark or light pigments as required until I achieve the look I want... Idk.. thats what I do..,Art,co25m7q,1,t5_2qh7a

Some of them are done completely by my hand and some are partly done by a pet painter  somebody that makes money by painting pets  that I commissioned and I painted on top of. Some are collages of childrens books and images that Ive taken and painted on.This leads me to believe that the paintings done of animals were done by a commissioned painter and the rest i.e. Im proud of you he did himself.

3409369,0,t1_cpgomp3,The thing is the art world thrives on authenticity. Whether its real or not an audience who perceives a creator to be authentic will be more loyal to them. You have been tagged as inauthentic due to your stealing. Like a politician who holds a press conference when hes been found sexting interns a full immediate public apology after being caught is mandatory across all platforms. Unfortunately that didnt happen in your situation so people still think your art and your apologies are inauthentic. Youve now been lumped in with the likes of Rob Granito and Chantella Viala and the internet doesnt easily forget. Fan art is great for practicing technique with but isnt really much beyond gimmicky stuff. You wont win people back by doing it especially since it is so easily faked. Explore your creativity more by creating original works of art! That way it is completely your own. And maybe not try to push your stuff on social media so much. Build up a portfolio maybe get some postsecondary education in artdesign discover your own unique style see where it takes you. Let your work and reliability for commissions build up a reputation for you. You cant just restart and get a second chance in your situation you need to earn it and prove it which could honestly take years to do so. But really staying off social media with work like this will help you. If you are struggling with feelings of depression loneliness or hungry for acceptance perhaps counselling might help. Stealing others artwork comes from a place of deep low selfesteem. ,Art,cpgw64y,4,t5_2qh7a

3449385,0,t3_2y3rjd,it is a bad idea to try and learn programming and art for gaming unless you want to do d indie gaming for a living.  Game Studios hiring people who specialize in specific skills not jack of all trades.  Even in art I am working to being a game artist and I specialize in D game characters.  programmers have specialities also. you trying to get  degrees will actually hurt you in some ways because the companies dont look at your degree but your portfolio work and if you have alot of random things and not enough high quality work that they need in a specific area than they will hire someone else. Degree matters so that they know what your doing but that wont get you the job it will just get them to look beyond your resume. portfolio is key in all gaming jobs Especially AAA and big game app companies like Zynga.,Art,cplgfq0,1,t5_2qh7a

3472021,0,t1_cpo07m0,I dont really care very much about emotions as they are typically irrelevant. Emotions dont solve problems. Being emotional doesnt fix anything. You cant help someone who  despite being told you are attracted to them  still CHOOSES to pick apart every little aspect of their body and feel self conscious about it. At that point they are beyond help  there is nothing I can do for them. Theyll keep thinking they have a billion things wrong with their body and Ill keep not caring about all the stuff they think is wrong with their body. They can go on and on about their cellulite and that scar on their ass or their poofy stomach and create massive amounts of inner turmoil and a constant imnotgoodenough mentality and whip themselves into a frenzy about it  and they can do that shit on their own time. I cant fix it so the only thing I can do is chalk it up to personality differences and get on with my life in the relationship. These are issues Ive seen most of the women Ive been with have. I cant change it just like I cant change their taste in movies or music  so I just have to live with it. Want to sit there and watch Keeping up with the Kardashians after you just told me how much you hate dramatic women yesterday? Fine  I dont get it but thats your thing. Want to go on and on about how your body isnt good enough despite the fact that Im obviously  vocally and physically  attracted to you? Whatever  I dont get it but thats your problem. ,Art,cpo1aim,0,t5_2qh7a

3838908,0,t1_cqtqrat,Its important to note that most hyperrealphotoreal painters work at largerthanlife sometimes much larger scales.  It makes a huge difference.  They remove a ton of limitations and give up on painterly expression to accomplish their aims.  These paintings look very different in person and up close.  How they get to their degree of realism becomes more apparent.Its not my cup of teain fact I pretty much hate itbut I recognize it is a skill set that can be focused on and improved over classical training.  For instance Boston School painters are often very realistic but they produce paintings with classical limits and generally visible though often not distracting brush work.  To me excess realism just feels like painting masturbation but it impresses the hell out of people.  I think my biggest dislike is how it generally limits the use of edge control to guide the viewers eye.  It takes a great deal of the artistry out of painting and composing and makes it a tedious technical exercise. In the end theres room for everybody and theres certainly a market for it. ,Art,cqtvagw,1,t5_2qh7a

4064226,0,t1_crjjnxh,Of course! Its actually quite easy and fun once you get the hang of it.  Take a big jar of paint colors you are going to use. Jars not tubes. I use red yellow blue black and white... dilute it some in water if its too thick.  Pour large amounts into a shallow dish like something you would pick up a salad in from a fast food place. Do something like RedYellowSwirl some white and black on there. Dont mix it and dont make it uniform. Think Blob here blob here drizzle...blob. With reckless abandon pour onto canvas. I start at the center and move towards the edges so it covers the whole canvas better with less paint loss. Makes it easier if its more covered for the next step. Pick up the canvas and start to tilt it let it hang shake it dance with it make sweet passionate notouch love with it... watch the paint drizzle to one side try to get to the edges twist to another side do the same thing just work it eventually youll be able to tell how the paint flows and how to make it crisper. If the paint starts to thicken and not move you can spritz with water or you can kick the back of the canvas to encourage flow. OH MY GAWD SHE SAID KICK IT!  Set on its back and let it dry.

I see myself as a newer style Christian who wants people to make their own decision like being a gay couple and is open to your beliefs I have a lot of friends of many different religions and just want inspirational people like you to at least help me and others to better others lives while believing In a higher power. Even if it sounds dumb to you I just want you to know you still have an influence and I want to help people no matter what which is why I want to major in marine biology towards global warming. Of course Im towards conservative I couldnt be overwhelmingly liberal could I? I respect your views and just need a new science hero who doesnt have to be too biased I can take some criticism so just please guide me in to helping others that arent entirely based on religion.

Maybe you will prefer your version anyway so it saves you the trouble.To me it looks like the tiger notices something on the left from you so he stops in his movement and looks upwards cautiously. The difficult part there is to make him not look like he is worried shocked or simply on drugs. Its amazing how much the pupils change the expressions which also shows how important they are. Yes the head would need to be in a different angle to look at his own reflection but I think it is much better the way it turned out makes you feel more a part of it and thus more alive the picture not you D.,Art,ctiwopg,2,t5_2qh7a

4775796,0,t3_3g90pr,the art is great  its very well done and clearly well thought out...however is it intentional that aside from the queenking of hearts that it isnt immediately apparent what suit the other cards are in? For instance you would not intuitively place the artwork for king of diamonds or king of spades as king of diamonds or king of spades respectively. Wouldnt it be better for the purpose of actually playing with these playing cards if cards were immediately identifiable? ,Art,ctwj595,1,t5_2qh7a
4780330,0,t3_3gcy16,Hello candidekun. Ive seen many homages to this famous picture but never one like yours and its looking great to me. Trying to be constructive the only thing I personally would point out are the characters. The woman seems too big and a little out of place to me. I wouldve either changed the man or woman to fit better together. The expression could be a bit more fierce and looking more into the direction of this big wave like a challenge right now she looks a little seasick .Also the water could be slightly more blueish.Anyway these are just my two cents nice work! ,Art,ctx3nn9,1,t5_2qh7a

4977394,0,t3_3j2h39,I studied graphics at uni and transferred after a year. So many young graphic designers I met the majority of which are now in advertising saw graphic design as the next coming of jesus. To get your work shown on itsnicethat or creative review or to win a yellow pencil award from dampad was the greatest acheivement in their eyes. My teacher raved endlessly about an advert for Hovis bread which won awards. I began to realize over the year how unfullfilling the subject and potential jobs at the end of it were. Speak to anybody outside of graphics and nobody cares about creative review or similar outlets. Graphic design and advertising the two were mutual at my uni are subjects where the employees within the bubble are totally immersed in their own egos. Thats such a great idea!!! Thats such a great tagline Youll definitely win an award for that. Speak to anybody outside the bubble nobody cares. In fact if the public had it their way your work would never be shown because it is actually a nuisance that ads exist yet arguably a necessity. Well done thats some really impressive work youve done on photoshopaftereffects there and thats a brilliant idea behind it all summed up perfectly in that last tagline. Now how many bottles of toilet cleaner do you think this ad will help shift?Its amazing actually how much time and effort and brainstorming goes into making ads so much pride too. The result?

Once you have the lines as you desire you can open in Photoshop for any coloringshading you want to do.Again Im a novice in both programs.

5136579,0,t3_3l4sk6,Personally I feel complete and utter freedom when I am drawing. I grew up in a oppressive environment where everyone had their place and you followed the rules or else. As someone who is extremely free spirited I felt like I was dying everyday. When I grabbed my charcoal and paper I had some semblance of control and freedom from others control if that makes sense. I think there is freedom in these other industries as well just not near as much. In D art if you want to splash red on your canvas you do it and its done instantly.

5144902,0,t1_cv5w868,All your points are very validI agree with you that framing it as good exposure or experience building is b.s.. This isnt my first bookI crowdfunded and paid nicely an incredibly talented illustrator to draw and layout my first book if youre curious you can check out the results at www.shineyourlightbooks.com. I wouldnt dream of asking an artist who is making their living creating art to work for anything less than a paycheck. Since this is a project mainly focused on childrens art art that still can have incredible value but is not nearly as labor intensive as a professional artists work I agree that I need to find the right level of compensation for the work I end up using. I have some groupsart teachers working on the project simply because they want to be involved but I think that in order to garner work from teens there needs to be more to it. Thanks for helping me work out how to be more in integrity as I move forward. ,Art,cv65jaa,1,t5_2qh7a

No shit?gtIf the image makes you question whether the bevels are real or not I suppose its a job well done if that was the designers purpose.Its a photo of real bevels you have no depth perception. There is no illusion here Its as bare as it can be.  Id be more impressed if he had painted the bevels to match the amount of light they get as to appear that there were no bevels at all.Mind you not saying that this isnt art.

This eventually caused the animals phenotype to change significantly.gtA mutant pig of this type known as a Flesh among stalkers is one of the clearest examples of the Zones perversion of nature. The pigs have developed a protective layer of scales and bones their regeneration potential grew significantly and their nervous system became more complex. A side benefit of this mutation is their enlarged eye which can see in a greater spectrum of light and has olfactory receptors within in laymans terms the flesh can smell with its eyes. gtThey are familial creatures and usually travel the Zone in packs numbering five or six Fleshes.

5378428,0,t3_3oniyp,Youtube is a good place to start and I actually do learn a lot just by googling stuff I need to know like realistic shading or body proportions for artists or artistic composition. Watching videos is very helpful but if you dont know some of the basic concepts that apply to all art it can be difficult to find what you need when you want to know. Something like this might even be helpful for a refresher  .As far as being told what to draw I understand the feeling. However I have to say my art quality really reached a ceiling when I was about  I got in kind of a style rut and stopped improving too noticeably. I took a beginning drawing class one semester in college and it seriously changed everything. It didnt restrict my ability to draw what i wanted or infringe on my freedom it just gave me the skills i needed to draw MORE of what I want. Even if you have to stick to a subject or draw what the teacher tells you for a few weeks the skills you learn doing it will be immensely helpful. ,Art,cvz5ks3,2,t5_2qh7a

Your faces seem to not mesh with everything else they stick out too much both in value your faces tend to be way brighter than everything else and line. I see a lot of hard black lines on one side of a lot of faces that youve drawn I think your drawings would look better without those. This work you did shows how you could do away with lines although youre still attached to the hard outline it looks way more cohesive than other works youve madeI think you should experiment with taking out the lines.

Maybe youre not that intelligent and emotionally mature after all trying to correct someone while being wrong yourself.And secondly I can advise you to read up on this matter because Ive never heard such a naive statement before.Youre implying white people are racist towards other skin colours by default? Like I said I can criticise practices from different cultures  that dont have the same skin colour as I have  as much as I like. If Id refrain from doing so because people might think Im racist Id conform to the belief that people their behaviour is determined by their race. You know what people that have those beliefs are called? Racists.Edit Also skin colour or the false concept race as you rather call it is just one of the cultural identity markers people have. So if you hastily generalise scarification is a practice thats prevalent among all black people because you see a photo of a black woman with scars on reddit and thus conclude all criticism is racist it shows your own massive ignorance quite clearly.,Art,cwiu1i2,1,t5_2qh7a

The western world has come to the understanding that their way is the high way and that most other cultures need teaching so they can follow them on their way. This is essentially racist. Why? Because you are unable to see the bigger picture you are unable to see the individual in this eastern mass of countries and you are therefore also unable to show compassion for people that grow up in countries that are war ridden  something they did not choose nor want. gt Syria are disgusting backwards nationsThis one especially. How arrogant and absolutely generalizing can you be with about zero knowledge about the current situation? Something which is shown in the next sentencegt where the local population CHOOSES to live in the dark ages and spend all their time murdering each other.I would say everyone should educate themself on these topics before forming such aggressive and hateful opinions about an entire nation.

5968824,0,t3_3x3afa,Im just going to cut the pleasantries and give you some critique. Your work is at best hit and miss. Your first painting in the album was beautiful. It showed depth it showed scale it showed all sorts of color and complexity but never muddled the silhouette of the character. There was perspective foreshortening and more. Then nearly a year later you did the new Bedford playing board. It looks terrible. The colors are awful the perspective is very off and overall its just a boring composition. Youve gotta do three things. First just do more thumbnails. You have the ability to make really interesting compositions. The painting of Drew shows this very well its a strong landscape painting which also has a well defined figure. Sure the color could use a little bit of shifting but thats something you can work out a little later. In contrast to this we have Flames Fury which sure pushes the character but does so in a way that is unappealing. The clash of the green and red are almost sickly one of them is just far too saturated.Second you need to realize when things arent working. Going back to the Bedford playing board the perspective is totally off. THIS is what the perspective should have looked like. What you did on the other hand was definitely not up to industry standards. Either you should have fixed the perspective or you should have scrapped the piece. Not just because the piece will look bad in the game but also that this will reflect upon your poorly as an artist. Potential future job offers may go away because they think you either didnt carerushedjust didnt know well enough to fix this piece so theyre going to look elsewhere for a more well though out artist.Finally dont work so much from your imagination. It is perfectly normal to use reference and you can do wonders when you do. That third to last portrait from your month of portraits is amazing but the problem is that you didnt learn from it. Its clear that you were learning how to proportion things out over the first few paintings and after that you worked more on technique like hard v. soft lines or shading and highlights but you didnt really transfer that over to your paintings as exemplified in your pirate themed painting. Its a cool concept maybe a little too much camera tilt though and subpar background items but the dudes in the painting are just eugh. You tried some warmcool shading and that was an interesting idea but it doesnt make sense how you painted it. The left arms of the central character and the leftmost character are placed in a very similar position relatively close to each other but theyre inconsistent. The rest of the painting has similar problems with consistency in the lighting. Then onto their faces they look like a beginners. You clearly understand at least the anatomyproportioningetc of the face as seen in your master studies but all of the faces look the same and underdeveloped.You just need to keep painting with purpose man. Do more painting just for funsies or do more master studies. Those definitely turned out well for you. If you keep workin hard and look for more critique youll be doing a lot more consistently a year or so down the line.,Art,cy21laa,3,t5_2qh7a

6327207,0,t3_429zbk,Well you can always go with The Flight of a Bee because its most talkative if that word exists. Dali had a lot identity issues his parents saw his dead brother through him. When his infant brother died his parents chose to replace him right away with Dali they didnt mourn they just made another child and I think he always felt it. He had a drive to exist to give himself an identity to feel like his existence was justified and so he did through his art. He made everything big as a yang to his ying his art reflects his deep fear of being nobody and to compensate he chose the extravagance. He didnt have a moustache he had a huge and extravagant moustache that you couldnt possibly miss. His paintings show us  things this idea of grandeur and fear caused by strong emotions. Its always big scary things moving in a desert. The desert is the empty space in his heart and so he filled it with his emotions even if these emotions were too intense its always better than having this huge never ending empty space within himself. And The Flight of a Bee perfectly reflects the whole thematic behind his art. The tiny sting from the bee being projected into the dream and the bee becomes a tiger. Hope that helps.Ho I should also add that this feeling of lost identity made him very shameful so shameful that he hid his poop behind furnitures when he was a child. So that certainly was something that he fought by giving importance to himself and through his work.,Art,cz8u1p1,1,t5_2qh7a

6375980,0,t3_42y3ux,Hes right about the whole intellectual superiority bit. Hes wrong about the need for objective standards.Why? Because there are so many different styles in the visual arts. The reason you dont see ice skaters falling down and expecting high scores is because that is not in the realm of their competition. With art you have hyper realism stylized abstract classical sculpture video installments. There are too many crafts to lay down universal and objective standards for the whole of art. Clearly one of the current sub divisions of art is one where most limitations are taken away...to then try to put limitations on that style would defeat the entire purpose of the style. And theres nothing wrong with that style by itself . Its just one of the many areas of visual art. The problem lies with the intellectual superiority and claiming that a work is something that it clearly isnt.The intelluctual superiority comes only when we take something that simply looks goodcool and try to make it some kind of deep statement that only certain people will be able to perceive like the example with the studio apron suggested to be a Pollock painting. Pollocks works looks super dope. Ive loved seeing stuff like his in person but Im not going to sit here and say that it has this super powerful meaning. Meaning is primarily attributed by the artist...if Pollock wanted his paintings to have a meaning in them hed have to tell me and anyone else who sees his work. Anyone who claims they can naturally discern the meanings behind random paintings like his are whats causing the problem. Theres nothing inherently wrong with his simply executed style that yes literally anyone with functioning arms can do. Looks awesome! The problem is with the attitude people sometimes even the artists themselves approach the work with.We dont need universal standards to apply to the whole of art we just need to approach art the right way.gt Do you see musicians playing random notes and chords  . . . and demanding they be taken seriously?Just to play the devils advocate here.

6382384,0,t3_432v16,have an Idea about Artistic Style and MediumTransfigurations dimensions are  inches by  inches. Raphael preferred painting on canvas but this painting was done with oil paints on wood as chosen mediums. Raphael actually showed advanced indications of Mannerism and Baroque period techniques in this painting.The stylized contorted poses of the lower half figures indicate Mannerism. The dramatic tension within these figures and the liberal use of light to dark or chiaroscuro contrasts represent the Baroque period of exaggerated motion to produce drama tension exuberance or enlightenment. Transfiguration was ahead of its time just as Raphaels death came too soon.,Art,czf3wzx,2,t5_2qh7a

The painting represents the three main stages of a womans life starting with the birth the motherhood and ending with old age. Infancy and motherhood are carefully represented as a symbiosis. The infant is held by a loving mother showing an overwhelming affection and close bonding between the two.In the left side of the painting the old woman is withering away worn out and alone. Hiding her face with the hand indicates a difficult life but also suggests that the woman feels the need to hide.,Art,czotb66,4,t5_2qh7a

6648244,0,t3_46pwp9,This is my first watercolour painting in over  years! Im entering a much larger piece into a prestigious competition that focuses on natural science. I decided to splurge on a tonne of watercolour materials and do a few different studies to practice before I tackle the big guy. This is the first study a marine gastropod Cancellaria reticulata that was referenced from a photo here.I didnt want to be too meticulous in making it as photo realistic as possible. Essentially I just wanted to get a feel for watercolours again. Not too difficult although blending colours and working with the transparency of the layers is a bit tricky. I didnt nail it in my early washes so overall the image falls quite flat that and I removed the rest of the paper texture as I tend to smudge paint everywhere. Or a shadow could have helped.Overall Im happy with my result. More practice is needed however so all feedback is welcome.

6819461,0,t1_d0p6whv,there is a documentary called Tims Vermeer on netflix. Its about a dude that studied photography and other stuff and he really liked Vermeer because he could see that the paintings have a photography quality so there were some investigations and ended proving that Vermeer was probably using that technique. And there was even a kickstarter of something similar. I personally dont think this is a technique for painting the art meaning of painting I think this should be called manual photography and not counted as an artistic painting it might still be art.,Art,d0pa9b6,6,t5_2qh7a

7083625,0,t1_d1j9mwc,Great art speaks for itself and needs no explanation.  It does not take a quantum leap in aesthetic judgment or a fabulously detailed explanation to convince as a lot of art in modern art museums does I am often infinitely more impressed by the incredible lengthy descriptions next to these sorts of installations than I am by the installations themselves.I was lucky enough to see one of Van Goghs Cypress paintings when it was being toured through Houston and have never been more impressed by a painting than I was with that one.  The wicked intense brush strokes the vibrant blues and yellows the warped perspective...  The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I am pretty sure I gasped.  I knew I was in the presence of greatness.  It simply could not be denied.  And this is coming from a very cynical old man.People come from throughout the world to see his museum in Amsterdam maybe out of curiosity more than anything but his reputation as a master is deserved and has been vetted in the centuries that have passed since his death by decades of evolving criticism and the millions yes millions of artists that he has inspired.

7240900,0,t3_4ekusi,I like what you have here it is indeed very whimsical  but I almost feel like because it is so messyhectic you should have perhaps implemented more whitespace. The whitespace could help with bringing out the finer details and focus more on the characters instead of to the eye that doesnt focus a blob of paint and lines. Also I would recommend that when you take a picture of your painting you pay more attention to framing. The way that the painting is to the right is a little off putting. Keep in mind where the eye focuses. ,Art,d218kbc,1,t5_2qh7a

7293622,0,t1_d276uvs,It doesnt matter what size trumps dick is. What matters is what a reasonable person probably believes and proving why they believe it. In this case they would have to show that a person would believe the painting to be accurate because they think he posed for the painting or a picture that the painting is an accurate portrayal of. Unlikely. As with the original court case Falwell would have had to show that a reasonable person would truely believe he slept with his mother because it was written in a porno magazine. Equally unlikely. Trump would also have to prove to the court that the painting is inaccurate which would require some expert to testify about the actual size of his dick and I dont think that would happen either. This is an original piece of art and a bad example of slander. His legal team is only trying to intimidate and prevent further bad publicity like this.,Art,d278hwo,18,t5_2qh7a

7310397,0,t3_4fe5jb,To understand abstract art you need to understand historical context. The overarching purpose of abstract art was to analyze the very notion of beauty by removing symbolism and leaving only the bare minimum. This continued for quite a while with artworks becoming gradually more minimal in line with the aesthetic of the time as well as the philosophical zeitgeist of the people.   This was also a rebellion against the age of mechanical reproduction traditional realist art was widely seen as pointless because of the ever increasing technology of photography and photographic manipulation. Artists needed something new to explore because formal ideals were becoming obsolete in their work.  You might find it interesting to know that abstract art was taken even further where it became taboo to give your artworks titles regarding the things that they were referencing or inspired by to the point that many pieces are simply named Abstract composition  etc. Most people argue that this was an attempt to take the philosophy even further away from symbolism which allowed it to become an exploration of things like form colour or even size. This is known as Pure Abstraction.  In art there is also the notion of the Avante Garde. To put it simply the art world has a zeitgeist of its own and there are entire periods in some artists careers where they try to poke and pull at this zeitgeist to further the question of what is and isnt art. A lot of abstract artwork that people dont get at all falls into this category because it isnt meant to be appreciated from any of the traditional perspectives but rather as a giant middle finger to the established doctrine.There is no such thing as real art. ,Art,d2954z9,2,t5_2qh7a

I think what people often forget is that unless you have a superstrict teacher directing your every movements study and practice are directed by your own artistic judgement and unless you have enough judgement to know when youre actually improving practicing is going to be a waste of your time.Its good not to be deterred from pursuing a skill but I think its also important to recognise that its not a simple effortimprovement equation you cant just throw effort into something mindlessly and expect the results to be worthwhile and speaking partially from experience I think this can save people a lot of pain.    ,Art,d2wmlcn,3,t5_2qh7a

7540159,0,t1_d2yhjln,It absolutely should.  It requires faith which many people have no use for but it would be wise to at least consider the possibility of your end state before a Holy God.  The great thing about it is that God made a way in Jesus Christ for each and every one of us to freely have salvation and completely escape any wrath.  Because he loves us and desires that none perish.The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.   Peter ,Art,d2za2pv,3,t5_2qh7a

7647313,0,t1_d3bef9b,Satan the Devil and Lucifer are easier to undestand as completely different yet the same character. Satan is the Old Testament Adversary who tests the faith of men in God. The Devil is the MiddleAges and early Early Modern Era leader of the host of Hell who commands his minions to torment man and eventually comes to use the witches as dupes in his attempt to win the battle or not if he actually is still part of Gods plan. Then comes protestantism and Dante and Milton who start to give the Devil a personality and turn him back into the enemy of the Soul and not the body someone who has the power and charisma to lure people away from the true Churchwhichever that might be by deceit and not demonic possession and evil magic essentially creating the quite popular image of Luciferand King James Bible doing the translation.Doesnt help that for example Lucifer can also apply to Nebuchadnezzar II in the biblical context. And that he might also be Helel or Satan depending on the edition and book. Or that Lucifer can be seen as the angel that fell and became Satan so being just a tad different. There is a lesser demon lord Sathanus in some demonological lore. Mephistopheles is a completely fabrication and can in some instances of Faust be Satan himself and in others an independent entity subservient to Satan. And then we get all the artists renditions of him that took influence from essentially everything.,Art,d3bghkp,5,t5_2qh7a

8093908,0,t3_4q3dbv,Two things  First you gotta get out of this mindset that you cant do art and that other people are just so talented.  Theyre not.  The only thing theyve got that you dont is a head start and a ton of practice.  How long ago did they start drawing?  Youre just now starting its perfectly normal if you cant sneeze a portrait on the page yet.  Theres probably lots of things YOURE good at that is completely bewildering to them.  Second the idea of failure.  Gotta get rid of it.  Okay you know how when you see art you think Oh my god that is so good it looks so fantastic its so pretty I could never do that I just drew a stick figure and augh?  Yeah?  Nonono dont do that.  I can pretty much guarantee you that those pretty gorgeous finished pieces you love to look at make up at most  of the artists total finishedcompleted pieces.  What you dont see are the piles and piles of paper scribbles the abandoned works in progress etc.  When you dont see those things  and when you only see the polished bits  its much harder to remember that even great artists suck sometimes.  So getting started with digital art.  I highly recommend following a huge variety of artist youtube channels and blogs.  You need variety.  Find an art program you like I personally like Krita its free and pretty fun.  Pick a tutorial or a walkthrough a simple one like a shaded sphere and just try to follow along.  Its cool if you cant its cool if you can.  No big either way.  Practice!Since youre starting from a childs level expect its gonna be a bit before you start to get happy with your results but you can absolutely get there!  Draw some things for fun and draw others to get better.  If were at the kindergarten level metaphor we need to play with the building blocks first before we graduate to toothpick bridges and marshmallow catapults.    Learn about shapes shadows anatomy focus line color and so on.  In between learning those mess around.  Draw a monster.  Draw your foot.  Draw your foot holding a can of soup.  Draw a monster holding a foot.  Throw a bunch of household objects in a pile and draw it.  Now draw it again from a different angle using only a bluecolored pen.  Now shade it with a red pen.  Woo!  Have fun with it mostly.  D  You can do it!  ,Art,d4pttmb,2,t5_2qh7a

8324328,0,t1_d5hg21q,gt Smile even though it hurts! Dont let them see the truth.This part is closer to my depressive intentions but I love how empowering your viewpoint was. Its positive and full of determination I wish I had thought of incorporating that into my character. If youre curious heres my original concept and intentionsgtMy topic was masks I didnt want to paint a tangible disguise so I opted to use a metaphor for domestic abuse as my focus.In my portrayal I wanted her expression to work as the mask with her physical injuries on show. Her eyes have a cheerful appearance but could alternatively display fear they are beaten and sparkling with tears. Eyes have typically been viewed as the windows to the soul so despite the cheery shape I made the fear and sadness clearly visible.The plasters on her face represent a meagre attempt to cover up injuries they are large and arranged in a juvenile manner which could hint to the childish nature of the character.The patches sewn onto her skin are reminiscent of fabric used in the past to mend teddy bears or dolls worn with time or torn open this could further hint to childish innocence or a remnant of her past.The stitches on her lips represent forced silence since usually adults were responsible for mending ruined toys it could be hinted that an adult too was responsible for sewing her mouth closed.Also her hair is in disarray which could point to a physical altercation further suggesting some kind of abuse.In conclusion I wanted to use her smile and cheerful expression as a mask that hid the undertones of domestic abuse reversing the idea and concept of a disguise. ,Art,d5i3gvg,1,t5_2qh7a

He also addresses this mans criticism of his art which I respect. Now I do agree with laughing here a bit. Its just a matter of opinion so dont get too upset with me. I do find this subject of art very new age amp vulgar. I understand that the emotion it brings me is just part of the piece amp I should take value from it but I feel the need to despise it due to its cheap appeal of sexuality. But then again it is done very well amp on a interesting medium. Its very obvious this artist has talent but I must say Id rather see is talent spent on something else.

The basics of traditional and digital art are the same and its actually easier at first I think  because you have direct control of your medium and see the line you draw etc. You also dont have to learn handling the programme yet and can concentrate on your drawing. And its basically free because everyone has probably paper pencil and eraser at home.And if you like it and decide that art is something you want to pursue you can still buy a nice tablet.,Art,d6not2e,1,t5_2qh7a

The way our voting system is set up you have to vote against who you dont want in.If you vote for any one of those  candidates youre helping the party that doesnt have to worry about your vote hurting them anymore.Ideally? Youd vote for who you like and if they dont get elected your vote goes to the next person youd support.

As someone that grew up drawing animemanga style pictures I feel like it really hindered the foundation I built my work upon and as a thirty year old man Im still paying for it. I think its very wise to learn realism for the sake of proportion shadows perspective and three dimensional space. Once you learn that you can apply it to your more stylized work and it will be even better for it!Or dont!

8917911,0,t1_d7j9cic,For me I can only call something art if I can visibly see all the care and   craftsmanship that went into it.If I cant tell the difference between someone spending  minute randomly adding paint to the canvas and someone who spent  hours doing it then I dont consider it art. If you were to interlace random paintings from people in this sub into this collection I dont think anyone would be able to tell which was his and which were not.The guys background is apparently architecture and I would say that if he were to show some of his architectural drawings then to me those would be art because you can admire the pure skill that went into it.I dont see an evolution or growth of ideas from looking through his Instagram page. As you mentioned earlier in your other post Picasso started off as a traditional artist and evolved into the style we know him for today.Im all for experimentation but I just dont skill or craftsmanship in producing the same work over and over.Art to me doesnt have to be beautiful or thought provoking. I just have to look at it and be able to admire the persons skill that went into it. Having it be beautiful and thought provoking would be a bonus of course!EDIT I just want to say that if we were to decide that art is something that doesnt take skill and it is merely something that provokes emotions and discussion then were lumping memes into the category of art.

8981662,0,t1_d7qlw6h,Yeah those paintings will crack and big chunks of encaustic will fall off after only a few years because thats not how you paint with encaustic. It not supposed to be applied that thickly. You can do impasto but this guy isnt doing that. Hes just slathering wax on top of wax. There are technical rules in painting one is fat over lean you can paint a fat waxy or oily layer over a lean layer with less wax or oil in the paint. But this guy is just piling fat over fat. That means your painting at best is going to crackle as the paint ages and at worst chunks will fall off as the cracks go right down underneath a layer.Encaustic is best applied thin IMHO. I once talked to Brice Marden I told him I told him I particularly liked his thin monochrome encaustic panel paintings like Red Yellow Blue but the ones I always saw at at LACMA all had cracks in the corners. He laughed and said yeah sometimes he wished hed never worked in encaustic its too fragile. Museums are constantly sending his paintings back to him for repair so he gets out an iron and melts the wax and smooths it out. Brice said he tells the museums the paintings are just flat bars of color their conservators should feel free to iron out the cracks themselves. But no they wont do it his paintings are worth millions and since he is willing to repair them the insurance companies insist that he fixes them himself. So he fixes the painting and returns it with instructions that they should handle this painting better in the future since hes not going to be around forever to fix them.,Art,d7rgiif,3,t5_2qh7a

9174150,0,t1_d8er4c9,This is an odd question. I dont really understand what you mean by bad value judgments on art dont make much sense. You could view this painting in a number of different ways look at how it works what its influenced by what techniques are used why he drew it and even the execution of the concept from a technical POV though that then becomes a discussion about skill not artistry etc. But to make a moral judgement on it? Thats weird. Youre certainly free to dislike it. But the work doesnt care if you dislike it thats not why it was created. Lots of people dislike Picassos work without angering the mob. The issue here is youre asking for to two categories. The good art and the bad art. Its sadly more complex than that. There is plenty of art that doesnt really work meaning that it doesnt achieve what it hoped to do. But its odd to call it bad and unhelpful too. Art doesnt exists to be good or bad or to be liked. I dont personally like the word art I think its problematic and causes people to start comparing when it should just be judged on its own merits. That said entertainment that attracts the masses is not art in my book it lacks any kind of originality or creativity and exists to please as large a passive audience as it possibly can lowest common denominator stuff. There are no questions no expressions no commentary nothing offends. Bland and lifeless and lacking any kind of spirit. Thats not art in my book.

Should oil paintings not be accepted here because the artist could use multiple layers to create different color effects?

9409394,0,t1_d98nckx,Ill go through the whole process as well as the lighting in case anyone else is interested. Make sure the picture is vertical so either use an easel or some way of fixing it to something. Use a tripod and make the height of the camera match the centre of the canvas. Then move the camera back or forward enough so when the entire picture fulls the viewfinder youre not fully zoomed out or fully zoomed in for some reason a camera gives better detail when its not fully zoomed in or out. Now for the actual lighting it needs to be a diffused light source Im sure you can get bulbs for that sort of thing but daylight is fine. You want to do it on either a cloudy day or if you have a room that gets a lot of light I use my conservatory then pull the blinds down enough that lights not glaring off everything but the room is still lit up enough.If you check my submissions on reddit then all those within the past couple of years have been taken that way and as you can see there are very little if any reflections or shadows. ,Art,d98pg62,2,t5_2qh7a

Oh right it was completely edited and once the full video came out it was clearly bullshit. Wheres the whole video? For someone who claims to be into the truth you can really consume some garbage. Honestly its just disappointing the comparisons between trump and Clinton that cast them as bad apples. Really Clinton is a bad apple and trump is one that has turned into alcoholic mush. People complain that Clinton has a cushy relationship with the Media and its true. But then Trump literally has a news source that is run by one of his biggest donors and people use that for as a trust worthy source. People complain that Hilary was irresponsible and borderline neglectful with sensitive information which is true. But then Trump goes around running his mouth saying idiotic things advocating brinkmanship and somehow we trust him with this information more. I trust a smart person who has made a nearly if not actually criminal mistake and hopefully learned from it over the guy who has done everything he can to prove he has no control over the infromation he throws out there. Like you think she at least has a chance to improve. People complain that Clinton is a warhawk and they are right. But then Trump literally put Nukes on the table fucking Nukes. The things so bad they have been used for real only twice during the largest conflict in the history of the world and even then there use was agonized over. Clinton might taste like shit but she wont kill you and make you delusional like Trump,Art,d9qhylm,15,t5_2qh7a

9585478,0,t1_d9uge4q,Second reply because of your edit are you saying the def says it has to feature doom and gloom to be dystopia? Because I quite like the idea of this pic displaying awe and wonder despite the fact that the society is negative. I just wouldnt have thought dystopia until you said it is all. Maybe its the messed up car or the fact that such a sentinel seems oppressive. Maybe its the vague idea that this photo represents an entire future rather than just one location in said future?,Art,d9ultf9,2,t5_2qh7a

9587534,0,t1_d9urauu,You are too deluded for your mind to be changed. There are over  billion people who are proclaimed as Muslim... and you are lumping all of that into a violent minority. Also stop this wave of racism? The most fervent Trump supporters are xenophobic racist and homophobic so I find it surprising that you think electing Trump would bring an end to institutional and societal racism. All youre doing is bandwagoning on the voice of every other Trump supporter with the same vague criticisms that are baseless and driven really by some misguided sense of intuition rather than actual data and concrete evidence. Do you think Obama is responsible for bank corruption that ultimately ended up precipitating the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression? No that was Wall Street and reckless practices that allowed the housing market to crash which has sent ripples throughout the global economy that are still reverberating today. Honestly you are such a pawn so uninformed. Your just regurgitating the same bullshit that every other naive citizen is spouting. ,Art,d9uuy4d,1,t5_2qh7a

I think its safe to say its imagining some kind of post apocalyptic scenario and if there is one things humans are good at its living through most anything in any environment. Along with that would come some domesticated animals and other things that would help with survival if taken care of by a human. Its unfair to criticize the art for telling a story as that isnt the purpose of most art. Art can convey an idea or an aesthetic among other things. Criticising it for not telling enough of a story is close minded to the other possible abilities art has.

When its patterned across an entire landscape however it lends a sense of artificiality and uniformity which does not exist in nature. Most trees are vaguely uniform but a significant minority are odd or broken or misshapen and leaning and those are the ones that ground the scene and keep the eye moving.Add a few more in this vein to your next piece and it will lend a counter intuitive sense of balance.,Art,dbnrr7m,4,t5_2qh7a

10111081,0,t3_5kl50u,Not sure about websites I dont believe you can properly learn to draw the figure by studying a website but what I would do is look up a few schools to get you going down the right path. Schools like the Grand Central Atelier Florence Academy of art U.S. Florence and Sweden and possibly Barcelona Academy and the Center for Academic Study in Utah will introduce you to a rich heritage of academic study rooted in rigorous figure drawing cast drawing and Barque copys. Some of the best artists when it comes to drawing and painting the human form are Colleen Barry Jordan Sokol David Gluck Will St. John not a lot of work online and Nick Alm to name a few. Check them out see how they approach the figure. One common theme with all of them is their knowledge of anatomy. Get to know every bone and muscle in the body and what influence they have on the surface.  If you have an atelier near you that has a teacher who has attended one of these Id say attend and take courses asap. ,Art,dbphfga,2,t5_2qh7a

10118167,0,t1_dbqe92i,....reading this gave me anxiety. That dog needs an owner that will help him and work for him not one that just expects him to magically be a good dog from day .Right now I have a foster dog the rd foster dog in the last  years that came into the shelter as a stray with no manners or obedience.  In  days hes learned sit down shake high  and is working on stay and wait.  Hes also almost completely housebroken after  days and is close to being crate trained. He doesnt enjoy the crate but he will quiet down after a few minutes of whining when I have him go crate up.  My return rate on foster dogs that have been adopted out so far is  because I get them started on the right path and stress to the adoptive families that they need to continue training himher if they want the dog to stay responsive and obedient.Seriously why cant people spend  minute with their dog training it? What else are you going to do for  minutes watch Netflix? Oh no we cant give up  minutes of TV....,Art,dbqekzn,4,t5_2qh7a

Im not very familiar with american copyright laws except the work made for hire system and this  registering your photograph thing is very weird to me. If i understand your comment and the article correctly artists are advised to register their work especially photographs to be able to sue for statutory damages instead of actual damages which they need to prove?! Also a single register of a photograph costs  dollars?!? I learned that since artists are structurally disadvantaged their work should be the subject of strong copyright protection as soon as they create it. This procedure looks like the opposite In order to ensure a strong copyright claim artists need to take preventive measures and spend money. Is this a controversial procedure in the US and if not am i missing something?,Art,dbtt36h,3,t5_2qh7a

How can I be? Im a random working class guy.In my experience of living there too Americans can be super quick to take criticism of the US the wrong way if it comes from a foreigner. Even if its uncontroversial. Then the classic response is to criticise the whatever country theyre from as if thats come kind of rebuttal. I think it must be the strong and inbuilt patriotism a lot of you guys have.I guess the curve ball is  criticising a country can be patriotic and you should certainly criticise and examine countries you love. Thats the start of the process that means they can get better right?P.S I really think the snootyuppity Brit thing is an American cliche mainly caused by film TV our politicians and  of course the Queen.

The composition would benefit from some added context. How big is this figure? Where are they? Also disembodiment refers to the lack of a physical body.

Right maybe you should do some research into what he has already followed through with. Dont be a sheep.I do not appreciate his lies at all or the way he is careless in some senses such as the disabled person reference you use which may I add is completely blown out of proportion but everything is blown completely out of proportion I think. I am sure you have done the same thing.

10435363,0,t1_dcqfipb,Using the United States flag as a decoration in your living room or as an article of clothing such as a bandana or swim trunks doesnt mean that people like the country more than others who dont display it materialistically. Maybe the lefts form of patriotism is through action by using their given right to protest as a way to show discontentedness and incite change. I dont necessarily connect displaying displeasure at others as traitorous.

Instead of just putting the title of the painting the name of the artist and what type of paint. I wrote that long title and I was accused of trying to get upvotes by writing about it not getting into an art show. I could see how you could look at it like that I guess even though that wasnt my goal.!the mod said even tho it was popular rules are rules and they dont make exceptions.,Art,debqdzf,1,t5_2qh7a

11107442,0,t1_der0iie,Honestly I call it like I see it. Theres plenty of art I dont get but I dont feel the need to waste my time telling the artist that what theyre doing isnt art just because its not to my taste and Im a firm believer in calling out people on that sort of behavior. It doesnt particularly get under my skin and I dont care if there are people who dont like it I just call people out on that kind of childish behavior. Call it a personality flaw or whatever youd like but I dont think its wise to just allow people to act like that and expect not to be called on it. As for larger pieces Id like to experiment with that but it didnt turn out so thatll take more experimenting to figure out the logistics of that. Ill definitely consider making a YouTube video.

11217283,0,t1_df1v1dt,I posted the original comment and i will always be amazed at how negative a slant the internet can turn a simple compliment into. I flame typos and illogical statements  super fun!  But to attack the complimenter not even to negate the compliment just to be negative  is lame. Lame! Its like a stranger walking up to a stranger and saying i dont really understand your domain and expertise but your actions are standing out as badass. Then you walk up third stranger in the scenario and say you dont understand? You must suck at  life...how could you be so blind...ypu just gloss your eyes over....all thats going on around you....paraphrased above responses...blah. So fucking Lame kids. Yes capital L. Kids. Fucking Lame. Kids. Downvote if you shit on positive things. Dont vote if you like positive things. We could gather data on how many people think Im a shit for sticking up for constructive discourse. Oh and for myselfbut whatever. I just like getting an opening to say people that do thatsuck!But i dunno maybe i should just get over myself.Probably. Coming to the same arena and flouting a sword that I say is more honed then the other guy is fairly petty and doesnt have much merit as the basis of an argument. However still furthermore lest ye not forget in addition to firstly secondly and lastly.........It was just a compliment. In fact expressing my ignorance and disinterest for the medium was meant to deepen the compliment for the artist as his work obviously made it out of the realm of enthusiasm while still having an effect on someone. To all the naysayers you dont mean a thing. Excepting my appreciation for this opening. Thats meaningful for me. So keep it up i guess! We are valuable assets to the shaming communityEnd of line.

11431599,0,t3_634hko,I think some of the most important things to think about when looking into colleges are. Financial aid if money is no issue ignore this. This isnt something you generally think too much about before you go to college but you really think about it after youve graduated and are in thousands of dollars of debt. So Id weigh the cost of each school vs scholarships vs loans. Another thing to think about is cost of flying back and forth for holidays if you go out of state vs a hour drive. . Location this is one of the most important aspects aside from academics of choosing a school. This will be your life for the next  years. Weigh the pros and cons of the locations. Also a lot of people tend to stay in the area in which they went to school after they graduate. So it could be a lifelong location. As far as spreading your wings that could be done through studying abroad for a semester or a year so Id look into that.. Opportunities offered by the school are there job placements? Do they have internships lined up? Do they have partnerships with any companies? Also what kind of clubs and sports and other activities do they have? What is the student body like? Do you feel at ease in the student environment?. Program do they offer the exact major you want with the exact concentration? What about potential minors? Do they accept your AP credits etc?Bonus tip call each schools financial aid office and ask how they can give you more money. Tell them youre trying to decide between two schools. You wouldnt believe how few people know that they have leverage to do this.My qualifications I was an admissions counselorfinancial aid advisor for a university for years.Edit Id like to add that parents often have decent advice especially if theyve gone through the same experience but this is your life. Not theirs. So please dont base this decision on what your parents want for you. ,Art,dfrrd73,2,t5_2qh7a

I dont understand why youre not willing to put in the effort to be as healthy as you can be. GERD sounds awful id imagine any possible reduction in symptoms would be well worth it.Youre getting very aggressive fam. Extra adipose leads to hormone imbalances which can make your mood fluctuate. Maybe if you lost some weight youd be able to stop being unnecessarily rude to someone on the internet.I might not be a medical genius but at least I have to foresight to realize that  extra lbs is gonna cause many more problems for you as you get older. Even if you dont see the benefit now your future self would thank you for getting your weight under control.Scratch that.

11491943,0,t1_dfyj0az,I suppose the question of psychedelics is understandable but also boring and repetitive. Its a bit of an insult to imply one can only be creative by using drugs! Perhaps a premade mini FAQ would help? What your art means to you is as interesting as what it means to the viewer though and I like to encourage people to discuss meaning as well as technical aspects of creation because I kind of hate the pretentious blow off answers that make art sound unachievable to the lay person. Digging in to the processes and ideas of creation lessen the mystique in one sense but also increase the understanding that it isnt just a magical thing that springs fully formed from the creators brow like some sort of Greek deity origin story. I doubt Ill make anything worth posting tbh. Im just a dabbler. The prismacolor markers are alcohol based and so they work with other brands just fine but the nibs are a little dry and I only have a few blendable colors in my set. Its ok for playing around and getting a better feel for them I think but Id like to upgrade when possible. I had to replace the clear blender so I got a shin han touch with the brush nib and that is a lot smoother. I like the way the copics have their colornumbering system though and Im not sure if thats copied by shin han or touchfive so I have some more research to do when I can afford to add more colors ,Art,dfylzqd,1,t5_2qh7a

It kind of seems your implying that because photoshop or similar software makes photorealistic art easier to produce its somehow less art or the person created it using new and advanced tools are less of an artist. Does it matter really how something is made? Its the end result you should care about. I say because of computers we have indeed seen a influx of super talented artists not the other way around.

11693746,0,t3_66v117,Im not an artist in anyway but I appreciate everything about it. A Pair of Shoes is brilliant to me. The experts say Van Gogh bought them at a flea market and couldnt use them because they did not fit. Others say he wore them in the rain until they looked the way they were for his painting. And yet others go further and say its the theme of the common man or Van Goghs personal status. What if they were all right or all wrong. What if he purchased them just to paint them. What if he saw beauty in their worn soles.. If you have any thoughts  please say them thank you. ,Art,dgli61j,121,t5_2qh7a

He wouldnt come home with one of these stories once a week or even once a month or anything but it seemed like I heard about something terrifying happening to one of his coworkers at least every couple of years maybe twice a year sometimes.

The idea is to do a portrait of the master in my style with surrounding artwork in theirs. In this painting of Van Gogh the Asylum foyer to the right is actually my version of his painting of the same area. I incorporated that with the view I felt it might look like to see him in his room at the window. Im learning more than I thought just by making the jump to do this series and loved attempting to put Van Goghs theory of color contrasts to work. ,Art,dgt8eu0,5,t5_2qh7a
