391686,0,t3_1ykmpl,Use Policy based Routing in OpenVPN client to tell the router which IPs to route through the VPN. Syntax is IPnetmask. You need to calculate netmask depending on your LAN setup. For example use ... and all your IPs from . to . will go via VPN others via ISP. DNSmasq usually forwards requests to ISP if you use DHCP for WAN. Disable it for good its crap. Use hardcoded ... on WANDHCPPCs.  Alright maybe Im kind in a hurry to read your DNS concerns twice so excuse me. Ill check again later. But the policy based stuff should work fine.  From DDWRT helpgt OpenVPN Clientgt Policy based Routinggt Add IPsNETs in the form ... to force clients to use the tunnel as default gateway.

499952,0,t3_1zt6cv,gt I find it odd that there isnt any mention of SSH or the use of it as a VPN.Because SSH or Secure Shell is not a Virtual Private network. SSH is a onetoone connection with a remote server. You can tunnel through it by having it route your traffic through it. But its not a VPN in that you cant connect to it and have a different routing table set up.What I think you mean VPN is really its use not its nature. Youre using a VPN to obfuscate your source address by using a proxy as in a node that will reroute your data and make it seem like its coming from it. That said SSH requires you actually have a login to a shell on a server. Sure you can probably set it up so that you have a jailed shell with another authentication module to handle thousands of users easily. But even if thats set up you still arent completely covered as with a VPN. Your traffic will route over the local gateway if its not proxied. As far as for in a pitch tunneling your best bet is a SOCKS proxy which a lot of the VPNs offer anyways. Look it up.,VPN,cfx3jf0,2,t5_2qxhk

811192,0,t3_22zmyf,Proxies and VPNs are both used to protect your security and data online. The way they do this however is the difference between the two services. A proxy service does not offer encryption of your data. Encryption options like bit and bit use complex algorithms to scramble your data and make it indecipherable to wouldbe hackers or threats.Although nothing in this world is ever absolutely  secureVPN is superior in almost every way to proxies. It provides vastly improved online anonymity and protects your entire online life. In addition to this because ISPs cannot monitor your online activity it is an effective means of bypassing ISP throttling.,VPN,cgwhj5f,1,t5_2qxhk

By not running TOR client side but using NordVPN then you encrypt info to NordVPN server they decrypt it and encrypt it for TOR. By using the double VPN and then running TOR you get added VPN security by using  hops but you encrypted everything for TOR yourself. So the VPN cant read your TOR traffic.

2982420,0,t1_co5z7ea,Your VPN has been hiding your IP address. WebRTC isnt about your external IP but much rather your internal IP your LAN eg. .... So if you connect to a German VPN all website still think you are German. But they can tell minimal information about your internal set up. Like distinguish between your laptop and cell phone even if both are connected to the same IP and share same external IP they can see one is ... and the other is .... It can serve as a unique identifier but still many other people may very will have  the same LAN addresses as you. So its minimal threat. Edit Unless its different on Windows as article claims. I didnt test on Windows to see if it lets you ISPs IP be known. Edit  Yep it effects Windows on newer Web browsers just did some tests and on Windows it exposes your ISPs IP in addition to the LAN.

Either you bring up real verifiable facts or your statements are just assumptions. Thats it. If you think a vpn based in any other country is safer then you are wrong. It is just a placebo effect. That is a good question though how does PIA proxy.sh Airvpn mullvad Vikingvpn and so on have U.S servers where they allow torrenting while some dont.

4795684,0,t1_ctyogay,By disabling the peerconnection in Firefox you have taken care of the webRTC issue. Like I said it all depends on what your understanding of privacy is. If you enable privacy.trackingprotection.enabled in Firefox and use uBlock Origin comes with Disconnect filter lists preapplied you will not need Disconnect anymore. If you want more privacy you should use Firefox addons  and selfdestructing cookies. If you want to be more radical you can use NoScript to have JavaScript disabled by default and only whitelisting pages that you want to give that permission to. Having JavaScript disabled by default will break some pages until you turn it back on but it will drastically improve security. I also like PrivacyBadger as it will try to learn automatically which connections are trackers without relying on filter lists.However none of these addons will negate your personal actions. If you use the internet in a way that exposes you to leaking your information all of the above might be rendered completely useless. Things in the internet are way more connected than it might seem at first for example Google trackers or even just embedded YouTube videos are on pretty much any site you visit  you will see this if you start using NoScript  Privacy Badger. You might not care about Google because you trust them as they are a big company but they will sell your data and you do not know which parts of it exactly or to whom and what happens with this data from there on out. There is a reason they are hosting free photo uploads mail service map service and so on. It is all perfectly in line with their business model of knowing and selling everything about you. Google is just one example albeit a big one. They will track your every move and if you use their services perhaps even with your real name they WILL know who and where you are no matter the VPN youre using or other precautions youre taking. Use addons but also try to be smart about how you use the internet in general and you will make it a lot harder for people or companies to track you.,VPN,ctz19j6,1,t5_2qxhk

5555169,0,t3_3r73ta,It is true that everyone on the intranet has an IP in a known range and that VPN users also have IPs in predetermined ranges. Network admins could use the logging provided by webservers such as IIS and Apache because those logs include the source IP of all requests but that might require a little effort. Its more likely that they would use an IDS like this this or this to flag requests from unapproved IPs because the network admin just has to sit there drinking coffee until some red line pops up in their monitoring application. On the other hand they could take another approach which is to configure the webserver to ignore requests from unapproved IP ranges by making a configuration change like this in IIS or this in Apache. That strategy is effective at stopping nonintranet and nonVPN traffic and lets the network admins to focus on other issues. Many ways to address the issue.,VPN,cwlo447,1,t5_2qxhk

6298033,0,t1_cz5hei9,It is all about having a budget and paying attention to where your money goes.  If you are in charge of directing where your money goes and not the other way around then it becomes much easier to manage costs and you will actually find yourself saving.That being said yr is a midhigher price to pay.  I pay yr for VPN service but again it is more expensive if I were to go month to month.Look at it this wayMany people have Digital TV DirectTV Dish whatever and pay at the minimum  dollars a month but most are more in the month range.  That is  a year.  Couple that with broadband at around month.  There is another  and month would be considered basic internet.We are up over  a year now.  And I still havent counted in your cell phone service.We made a choice years ago to get rid of highcost tv that we only watched  of the  channels of on any regular basis.  That TV was month.It made much more sense to buy the followingNewsgroup serviceVPNAmazon PrimeInstead of close to year going out for phone internet tv we have cut our costs to year.  And really the Free TV we get with Amazon Prime is just that.  We get the Prime subscription because of how much we order and have shipped to the doorstep yearly.  It was much more costeffective to pay for Prime for the free shipping and it was just a bonus that we got Prime TV.Yea I dont necessarily get to watch The Show on the night it airs but I could also give a good two shits.  I am not the kind of person who needs to stand around the water cooler and talk about a TV show.  And again between Amazon Prime and Newsgroup services we have more media available to us to consume than we could ever get through.Anyway long diatribe....TLDR year for VPN is a little pricey.

My comment is  If you are using the VPN correctly this isnt happening unless the VPN is running a hostile DNS server.  I suppose there could be some hostile downstream DNSproxy or something but thats going to be the problem coming out of the VPN endpoint.  It shouldnt be resolving requests already coming in IP address format.  It may log the IPs being accessed but there wouldnt be a reason that would cause MITM issues.,VPN,dbij6kj,1,t5_2qxhk

10576690,0,t3_5rexrj,I just recently purchased NordVPN hope it was worth it.Anyways I was having a similar issue with NordVPN so I might be able to help you.Go to File Explorer CUsersltUsernamegtAppdataIf you do not have hidden filesfolders enabled do that and then you can see the Appdata folder.Every time I reinstalled Nord I would be already logged in so it was clear to me that settings were saved elsewhere and not removed when uninstalling. So if you open that Appdata folder there are a couple options. You can search to find the folders but basically theres a NordVPN folder in Local and also in Roaming I believe. If you delete the one in local it will remove your user preferenceslogin. Tried a couple times and no luck.Then I found the folder in Roaming it didnt seem to have much inside it really but I deleted this folder and the one in local and then I was able to connect with no problems.I hope this helps you.,VPN,dd6winu,1,t5_2qxhk

11038428,0,t3_5xl0jn,Well lets say that the adversary is monitoring some website. Or maybe its a honeypot. But at least they have traffic logs from the sites ISP and can figure out source IPs for logins and posts. So that gives them the VPN server IP address. Now they need logs from the VPN servers ISP. Then they can look for traffic that correlates with traffic to the website. And finally they get your identity from your ISP.Nothings perfect of course so they probably have several leads to work on. But still thats a long way from NOT be able to find me. And thats how they get to what rTheSonOfMyWife says.Basically adversaries monitoring network edges can find anything. The only defense is adding hops. The more hops and the more latency and jitter the more uncertainty in correlations and the more false positives. If there are enough false positives they wont have enough resources to check them all out.Of course most LE doesnt have the resources for that. However if you attract enough attention maybe GCHQ gets busy and then drops a hint to someone.,VPN,dej6pz5,1,t5_2qxhk

Not only could they see which sites we were visiting because the sites came through the proxy they stood out like beacons. They had known all along we were using it but didnt really care because they knew we werent looking at bad content and it was only a few of us.Then an idiot in one of our classes figured out how to use it by watching us without our permission then started showing his friends.

I do not mind that I was emailed about a VPN service which works and protects my security.  Plex has developers internally that marketed to us as far as I can see and it seems odd to me that you would claim anyone did anything unethical considering that Plex sent the email using their very own Mail Chimp account based on what MailChimp says.  Sorry my friend but I am not fighting for or against the company i just left the feedback and you can take it for what it is.

11538313,0,t1_dg35i6t,gt how much we have recently discovered the governments of the world have been spying on their peopleThe problem isnt that theyre spying on people its the methods they will take to know what you are doing.  End to end encryption is incredibly difficult to capture traffic from and through since theyd require a way into your network.  Which goes well beyond what a VPN will offer you.If you are already followed by an organization that intends on finding things out about you Internet browsing history is only one of several methods of identifying who you are what you do when you do it.If you are a mostly average person going about your day but dont want your porn history to show up on an ISPs or anyones radar then you configure yourself with an offsite VPN connection.Any administrator behind the scenes of network traffic can find illicit VPN connections but unless they know the current IP on the other end of that line then it is virtually impossible for any current technology to do so.
