Obviously online stores do checking they have warranties and return policies as well  at least any one Ive ever dealt with does. Almost. All. Glasses. Come from China. Almost all bulk manufactured items come from China. This includes lenses  almost every lab buys surfaced blanks in bulk from China. The quality is high and theyre incredibly cheap.

You should see a faint reflection of the light source in a color usually green or blue but can be others like gold. ARs can be very sensitive to being dirty make sure youre keeping them clean with a lens cleaner not Windex and a clean cloth not paper or tissue.

2334435,0,t3_2lyfya,My first suggestion is to go for lightweight. Especially if you will be wearing them often or allthetime. This matters later.. Trust me. Other suggestions. . If you have a wide face you will have problems finding a good frame. Its a fact of life  I dont usually suggest a brand but I have had good luck with Nikon and Oakley yeah I know Sorry! . . Try on EVERYTHING!!!! It is worth it to spend the time to see if it works for you or if it pinches your temple. If it feels like its pinching the temple or is tight on the ears.. You will know what I mean after  minutes it is not the frame for you. I have spent an entire day going to every glasses store in town and the next one over just to find the right one. . If you find one you think you like. Walk around the store wearing it for  minutes however long it takes for you to notlikeit. . Ears Temple Nose. Hows it feel? Most glasses can be adjusted on the nose. If your set cannot... And you hate it. Dont buy them. There is nothing you will ever be able to do to make it fit better. If its adjustable? Get the person in the shop to adjust them for you It makes a big difference. same goes for the ears... as long as they are long enough If they feel like they are squishing your head they cant fix that. Good luck. Finding a good pair of glasses takes time and kind of sucks. I have taken weeks to find something that I liked. Just dont worry about taking your time. ,glasses,cm08ytm,2,t5_2r75x

2665437,0,t3_2qi6wb,Many people and this is no joke forget to blink while on the computer. Especially when concentrating one tends to forget it.    Also the new contacts could be inappropiate for your eyes. The various contacts of the many producers have different properties. Some are good for dry eyes some are good for we eyes and so on.    The optimal contact lens for your eye is isotonic to your tear film in your eyes. Read Tonicity  gt EDIT The wiki bot has a nice picture of blood cells with Hypertonicity Isotonicity and Hypotonicity. The firstis the one I described. The contact is the blood cell it dries out because the contact is hypertonic to your tear film.  If your contact has a different value than your tear film then your contact either works as sponge pulling the water out of your eyes into the lens or your eyes are the sponge drying out the contacts.    Now imagine it is the latter combined with concentrating at the computer. You are at the computer concentrating you forget to blink so your eye dries out. Your eyes pull the liquids out of the contacts and it dries out. A dry contact lens is not flexible anymore. It hardens and falls out.    Another reason for this is you pinching your eyes. Certain eye defficiencies can be minimally corrected by pinching ones eyes. Maybe your new contacts are to weak or to strong for your eyes or if you have astigmatism a second and third value on your prescription for each eye like cyl  | Ax  the lens isnt able to turn itself in your eyes right. In that case your body tries to better your vision by pinching which loosens your contacts.    Also the diameter of the contacts could be wrong maybe your eyes changed. You should go to an optometrist  ophthalmologist  optician and make him examine your eyes in order to fit you new lenses. Describe your problem to him and he should be able to find contacts that fit your needs.,glasses,cn6hy57,2,t5_2r75x

6154047,0,t3_3zs316,If you go for a plastic frame without nose pads make sure it fits properly on the bridge of your nose.  If the weight is unevenly distributed along your bridge it will leave red marks and cause irritation.  Something like that isnt really adjustable.I dont like recommending rimless or semirimless frames to clients who will be taking them onoff a lot as they tend to be subjected to more handling which in turn makes chippingbreakage more of an issue due to the way that they are mounted.  If they are onoff a lot a full frame will offer more structuresupport.If you are sensitive and prone to headaches go for a light weight material.  Also dont think that lightweight  flimsy.  Some of the best sturdiest frames out there are the ones you think youll break if you breathe on them too hard.Most frames come in different colors although most opticals dont carry one of every color in stock.  Try frames on for shape and style and worry about color afterward.  On a similar note...  Larger frames in dark colors particularly blacks are really popular.  This is a harsh look on a lot of people though...  If you dont have the featurescomplexion to pull it off ask if there is something in a matte finish.  Matte paints and plastics are a great way of getting to wear those super dark colors without them being too harsh.Glasses may feel great at first but not so great after youve had them on for awhile.  Like after wearing them for a few hours you might notice that they suddenly feel loose or tight or pinchy...  It is normal for people to need another adjustment after theyve had the chance to wear them for awhile.  Also it is normal for frames to become misaligned with regular everyday use.  This doesnt mean you picked a bad frame you just need a tune up.  Dont ever be shy about stopping by to see your optician for an adjustment.Most importantly  Listen to your friend let your optician help you...  BUT LOVE WHATEVER YOU PICK.  They dont have to wear your glasses you do.  This is probably one of the most common mistakes I see Ive done it myself too and it always ends in regret.
