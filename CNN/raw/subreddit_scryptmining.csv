208132,0,t3_1whf5z,I havent formed much opinion on which coins have longevity but I will say that i have been very disappointed to see promising coins with huge revamps on the technical backend Quark for example fall to the wayside to coins like DOGE that ride a sensationalism more than anything.Also slightly off topic but I find it difficult to keep up with new coins but some sort of centralized tracker calendar or maintained list besides the altcoin subforum on bitcointalk of upcoming coin releases is something Ive always dreamed of.Even better if I were to make a multipool one of its features would be to automatically switch to newly released coins on release mine and hold them out of speculation. Sure itd ramp up difficulty but at the same time a slew of people would be holding and speculating on a coin they cant yet sell by nature the coins popularity would be boosted by the fact that people own it.,scryptmining,cf25e62,3,t5_2x0ab
212968,0,t3_1waxjj,GPUs will not die. Where these is a demand for a market a market will emergeIf anything I see ASICs killing LTC and other Scrypt coins without fail in favor of BitCoin. The coins will shift into the control of the rich and centralized mining factories while the GPU miners leave en masse in favor of far greener prospects of scryptn scryptjane and many other upcoming algos.And when the GPU miners leave that will take the value of scrypt with it as people lose confidence in currencies controlled by the few rather than the many. ASICs as they exist now for scrypt will see little if any return and the cycle will repeat until they give up.Sure the same thing could happen with BTC too but Id doubt it for at least a few more years. BTC has the spark that started it all and ASICs that literally print money for a very small but very vocal minority.,scryptmining,cf2p9zw,2,t5_2x0ab
280699,0,t1_cf9u3pr,Im out of my element with Win. I havent had any time on it other than a couple minutes being annoyed at trying to find the control panel for another guy at work. Hahaha.Is there possibly an issue with those drivers and Win? I know were have a metric fuck tons of drivers that just dont work properly in Win. And AMD doesnt exactly have a good track record for producing quality drivers.....,scryptmining,cf9uvh5,1,t5_2x0ab
531533,0,t3_2088ic,Early miners those who were mining before late  mined in hopes of litecoin increasing in value. I think the same scenario will play put soon Huoboi and Coinbase are likely to adopt LTC soon making mining profitable. ,scryptmining,cg0oxl6,1,t5_2x0ab

1104312,0,t1_chttcj3,. is maybe khs better than . on X for vanilla scrypt it was maybe khs better.  So basically no nothing really noticeable.  . will give you huge performance increases on X but its useless because it will only give you hardware errors.,scryptmining,chttf46,1,t5_2x0ab
1380591,0,t3_29vstx,Im not sure a single blizzard would make much but you wont be out a lot of money and learning to setup a miner can be a lot of fun.Good research so far but something you might what to consider as well is what computer and operating system your planning on using as well as what mining software.If youre going to have it run  you might not want to have it connected to a laptop expensive computer. A good and relatively inexpensive solution is to get a Rasberry Pi w rasbian  mining software or something like MinepeonTo my knowledge arent a whole lot of companies shipping ASIC scrypt miners at the moment. I do own  zeusminers so I can tell you that they are legit. Ive heard of multipool.us but I havent actually used them.I did just find this site for comparing pools not entirely sure accurate it is yet as I just found it today.,scryptmining,cipcb3s,2,t5_2x0ab

1794143,0,t3_2f0q81,I have my doubts... photographs are of a computer case available from here Company is a few weeks old and Ive found nothing on previous sales demonstrations or technical specifications. Highly likely another scam.,scryptmining,ck5aus2,0,t5_2x0ab
