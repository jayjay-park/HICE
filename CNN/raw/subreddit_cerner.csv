8880764,0,t1_d7f6jmt,I think this was discussed when the law was first passed some months ago...unless that was another minimum wage law.  The consensus was that most companies Cerner included would crunch the numbers and find the cheapest solution.  For some positionspeople that would be paying overtime for others it would be giving them a raise to push them above the line so they dont have to pay overtime.  Is it morally the best route probably not.  Is it the route that makes the most business sense yes.,cerner,d7fcckn,1,t5_2syeb
