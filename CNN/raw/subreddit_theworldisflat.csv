4298524,1,t3_3a85wq,Theres an event that happens every so often called a selenelion. This is when the moon rises eclipsed while the sun is still out. Its claimed that this is the product of refraction but for me this makes no sense.I preface my answer with that because I have to say we dont know. Its possible that there is a nonluminary in the firmament eclipsing the moon. The phases of the moon are too consistent to be the result of the earths shadow on it and the new moon doesnt show up as a black object in the sky during the day which it should... so the most we can say is that it cant be the earths shadow.I believe the scripture that the moon is its own light source and not reflecting the sunlight. How it works? God knows.,theworldisflat,csa60y3,-1,t5_38q32

Many years ago I used to participate in some fairly rowdy debates with a collection of internet flat earth believers. They were at least honest in the sense that they would attempt to explain a particular phenomenon in the context of the model that they were defending. They were convoluted and easily debunkable explanations but at least they made an effort.It seems that the goto response of the FE defenders here is to simply deny that the phenomenon exists at all. My post from yesterday is a perfect example. Instead of attempting to explain how the Etvs effect happens in a flat earth our dear friend Square simply denied that it happened at all.

4350116,0,t1_csfz7ce,gt If the moon is only about  miles away why does it take light shined from earth . seconds to get there or rather . seconds to be reflected back?I remember watching a video where a woman engineer of some sort was discussing bouncing light off of the moon. The conclusion was that the light particles received back were consistent with nothing being received back at all.I dont have a good answer for you on this at this time. I will look into this again and try to find the video.gt And if its being shined through an atmosphere the whole time why isnt there more distortion of that light when it returns?This is easy. Either way whether you consider the ball or flat model the light has to travel through the atmosphere twice anyways.This is all of course assuming you can actually get light back from bouncing it off of a star lol.,theworldisflat,csfznsz,0,t5_38q32

4533671,0,t1_ct1vtzk,Fresnel equations are used for light passing through surfaces not through volumes.  The atmosphere is not a planar interface.  Did you get that from Dubay?  As weve seen before that guy is not at all reliable.And you are correct that Mr. Young did not plug in the refractive indices but he certainly accounted for them.  And as you say they dont matter much anyway.Although the details of the mirages in this huge blank strip would depend on the density structure of the flat atmosphere Newtons proof mentioned above guarantees that all sunsets in the flatEarth model must have exactly this bizarre appearance. In particular the enormous elevation of the false horizon depends only on the refractive index of air at the observer  a quantity known to many decimal places from laboratory measurements.Here is his approximation of the refraction on a flat Earthr     n   tan z . Its just proportional to the refractivity at the observer and the tangent of the apparent refracted zenith distance.Because refractivity at the observer will vary according to temperature moisture and other factors his equation is left with only this variable left to define.  But regardless the effect that would be seen would always be some amount miraged area between a false horizon and the astronomical horizon and a flattened sun.So as you can see he did account for the refraction and provided only an approximate amount of miraged area that would be seen since the actual amount of miraged area would depend on conditions at the observer.  You are correct that refraction is not particularly noticeable  in this case the Flat Earth sunset observed nowhere on Earth will demonstrate a false apparent horizon flattened sun and miraged area regardless of the amount of refraction.  Solid proof that the Earth is not flat.  Unless you can prove Newtons Opticks were incorrect.,theworldisflat,ct23pe6,3,t5_38q32

4964903,0,t3_3i85o6,Ok so here is my understanding on this subject.According to the accounts of creation all the lights we see in the sky are called luminaries. They were created same as everything and everyone else. All follow pathway that were  assigned by the creator. I do not recall getting any sense of the firmament itself revolving. The luminaries are entities that move in specified paths around the interior of the firmament just as the sun and moon do. One exception is the one we call Polaris. It doesnt appear to move at all as a multitude of photos have shown.In the book of Enoch Enoch is shown many things concerning the creation life the  nature of the universe and the afterlife. In one of the areas of the afterlife where disobedient creations are confined until judgment day Enoch witnessed some luminaries and upon inquiring about them was told that these had disobeyed the creator and were sent here to await judgment day same as any and all creations of God.This is extremely interesting to me as I wonder at what other creatures that HE created defied his commands regarding their purpose. For instance are there say rocks that disobeyed? Maybe trees or insects? In a way this has me interested in what I may learn after I pass on. I look at death now as nothing more than a change of scene per say. Dont take that to say I wanna die sooner than later. I still have tons of things I need to do before then.Shalom,theworldisflat,cukd50w,-10,t5_38q32

5963945,0,t1_cwoactf,Think about how many of the scientific facts you mentioned is only a theory and assumption. Earth is spinning around its axis moon spins around the Earth and its axis in a perfect way that makes us always see the same side of it. And were in a perfect distance from sun so its not to hot not to cold so life can form and flourish. And its all being held together by gravity. The problem with these facts is that mathematics can form equations proving validity of these theories because heliocentric model is still a theory only IF..... And here it gets very interesting. If masses and composition of objects is within a particular range. You dont know how heavy the Earth is but knowing assumed gravitational pull of the sun and our assumed speed on the orbit and other data you can calculate estimated Earths mass. Its all assumed shrunk or stretched and read it loud TO FIT THE MODEL. Globular model is not overall consistent especially when it comes to experiments conducted on Earth like the flagship Eratosthenes two stick thing which works for far sunround Earth as well as close sun flat Earth.Heliocentric model is  years old since Copernicus picked up some old theory and without any proof formed this model based on assumptions. There was no balloons or planes and the fastest transport was a horse. One given  years to figure it out would learn math and justify every aspect and address all the flaws to make it work in the lab. Now why the deception. If you make yourself think that you are not a divine creation but a coincidence an accident and believe that every perfectly fitting part of our world is an effect of a cosmic bang completely random you loose purpose. You stop being special and outstanding. You live on one of many planets one of many races a grey noone. That translates into your everyday life which becomes the highest value. You will do everything to save your life and become prone to manipulation. Youre being told that your life will be better through possessions money. Youre being pulled away from who you really are and turned into a taxpaying slave. Look at what happened with freedom in the last  years. This hole is deep. ,theworldisflat,cy1ek17,1,t5_38q32
