37177,0,t3_1twzwj,Lack of money and it seems somewhat complicated. I could probably figure it out if I tried though. When I first heard of ip I had the browser set up and it worked there just wasnt much to do this was probably a year ago. It was super slow then too.,themarketplace,ceinwy9,1,t5_2yrso
81243,0,t3_1uu6mt,Just a thought instead of us taking stabs in the dark at the design lets come up with a design spec.Lets list out what colors we think it should what the idea of the logo should convey what kind of size restraints it should live in... What do you guys think about doing this first?,themarketplace,cenofo4,3,t5_2yrso

383948,0,t1_cfkiwvx,gtAlso personally Ive left our listings visible so that prospective buyers can still see our listings and read our page even though we have no stock. I understand that can be confusingannoying but Id rather it be that way than have buyers not know we exist.TranslationgtI care more about marketing than customer service. Sorry for the inconvenience.If I knew who you were on the site I would go out of my way never to purchase from you knowing this.,themarketplace,cfkk7xp,-1,t5_2yrso

1895649,0,t3_2gby09,Dont fucking use igolder. What makes you think that they dont keep every single message thats endecrypted to turn over to a government entity? Using an online pgp app completely defeats the purpose of sending encrypted communications. But to answer your question it sounds like you either are putting your private key in the wrong field or whoever encrypted the message fucked up your public key. Are you sure youre not using your public key to try to decrypt it?,themarketplace,ckhm6tk,1,t5_2yrso
