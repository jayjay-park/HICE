1882948,0,t1_ckg2vtv,Well you have to be clear are you talking about something that was launched from the air the earth or something sitting on a satellite in orbit? What I think when I hear space based is well satellites armed with missiles floating in space  hours a day  days a week. All signs point to that not being something that has ever happened.  Shooting down a reentry vehicle which is the warhead falling from space is quite difficult. Your target window is about  seconds but thats what AEGIS BMD is designed to do and has done successfully. Obviously not enemy missiles but our own ballistic missiles.,war,ckg362d,2,t5_2qhk8
