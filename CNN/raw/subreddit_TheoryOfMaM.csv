8042904,0,t1_d4jy5uj,I agree with you on the DNA. I will not pretend I can understand how it all works. In one moment SC breaths on a test and contaminates it with her own dna yet many other test lack any dna where you would expect to find it. It is all very confusing. The lack of dna makes me wonder if it was not a spare rarely used and what dna there might have been was simply too old and deteriorated. My thoughts too are simply speculation. That is all any of us can do without either being experts as an example in dna or having actually been there when TH was murdered. Steven had already left for the cabin before they found the car. So he would have had to choose to not get rid of it at all. I find that odd. Your theory seems to imply he was just too lazy? Not sure I understood that. He could have gone late at night early morning as I stated before because he had no one to answer to. If he got from the garage to across the yard why not keep going? THe crusher does seem like too much work IMO. I think his father was only gone one day a week and his brother Chuck would have always been around as his sister mom and sisters then boyfriend. Not to mention the kids I suggest looking at the blood in all the areas it was found on the car. I or possibly you may not be blood drip experts but we are not ignorant either. We have been alive long enough to know what something looks like when it has been smudged vs fell and drippedrun. I agree blood can seep through many materials what I argue is that it would actually drip unless the bleeding was much heavier than a sliced finger. Especially if was an older reopened wound. This is where I get gross but offer my expertise as a woman. I have bled so much that I passed out a few months after child birth and rushed to the hospital. I had clothes on. While the blood traveled and soaked my entirety of my jeans and part of my shirt It did not drip anywhere while I was walking prior to passing out. I lost over half my blood. Some of that was on the way to the hospital but a lot of it was before I passed out. No drips.  As far as your theory I think its all possible. Just offering my own thought on yours. Most of us just want the truth. I just want the truth with an explanation of some of the things that dont make sense to me. Whatever that truth is. I saw a show the other day nothing to do with this case but there were no fingerprints in the car. No one wiped it down. There just were none by the owner or the killer. Just happened that way. Things happen sometimes that are hard to explain. When there are a lot of things I just think as humans we become a little more demanding in the explanation of them all. ,TheoryOfMaM,d4k3jp9,2,t5_3co6y
