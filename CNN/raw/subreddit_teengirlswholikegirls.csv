572135,0,t3_20onmy,Im still mostly in but only because it rarely just comes up in conversation. My close friends know because theyre who I talk to most. But seriously... I dont want to just be like Hello everybody Im gay! but it never comes up any other way. Ill probably just wait until Im in a relationship or something. Idk...,teengirlswholikegirls,cg5b1re,3,t5_2vwxs

3609107,0,t3_31mr1t,I was in a similar situation to yours a few months ago I dated my ex for  and a half years. I never felt anything for guys before him and even with him I felt like something was missing or out of place. I fell for my best friend and it took me six months before I could actually admit it to myself that I had to break up with him. It was a terrible breakup and we are not on speaking terms and honestly I have no intentions of even trying to continue a friendship with him. Despite all this Im the most happy Ive ever been since coming out. However having been in that situation Im very proud of you! Its definitely not easy.,teengirlswholikegirls,cq3nxhi,2,t5_2vwxs

4234611,0,t3_2u7ny2,Hey!  Im Destiny and I will be a junior in high school in less than two months.  I just moved from South Carolina to a small town in Southern California where I lived when I was little.I like creepy things and music.  My music taste seems to be stuck between s glam metal and rock and midlate s poppunk.I identify as bisexual but pansexualitys definition fits as well.  Im not out in real life but I dont try to hide anything and am a little stereotypical so I wouldnt be surprised if my parents know already.  My mom has definitely hinted at the possibility but who knows if she was serious or not.,teengirlswholikegirls,cs2xn1n,5,t5_2vwxs

5797678,0,t1_cxfqm81,She was really controlling during the relationship and for the short period of time after we broke up and were still friends she made jokes at my offense around our other friends and they really hurt. She also told me I wasnt REALLY bisexual which hurt because it took me a long time to be okay with it. So I just stopped talking to her. I still see her around a lot because were both in color guard but its easy to ignore her. I havent talked to her in about a year.,teengirlswholikegirls,cxfr9bu,2,t5_2vwxs
