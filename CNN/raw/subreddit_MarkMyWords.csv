131254,0,t1_cetckct,Think of it like the Toy Story movies. Its CGI animation but the toys in those movies look like toys. They clearly appear to have realistically rendered plastic joints and such. What Im talking about is a movie sometime in the future will be released that pays tremendous homage to E.T. Star Wars Original Trilogy Jurassic Park Alien etc. Like how Tarantino constantly pays homage to grindhouse and Hong Kong Cinema. It will feel like youre watching one of those classics with stop motion animation and animatronics but like Toy Story its only done to evoke that nostalgia for people who grew up with Lucas amp Spielberg movies. Part of this hypothetical filmmakers point will be See how I have painstakingly recreated that look by using modern animating technology? See??,MarkMyWords,cetdn8q,7,t5_2xezv

760682,0,t3_22uliu,I consider Up to be the last true Pixar movie.. It was being made I beleive preproduction before Disney bought Pixar. It is so very original Toy story  is a second sequal and a brilliant movie however I dont class it as original in the same way as I do other Pixar movies. It is not a cashgrab and had the chance to fail.. It does not follow a generic formula that is common in CGI movies. Its heart yes other later Pixar movies still had heart but there is something about Toystory Nemo Monsters WallE and Up that just pushes them higher Toy story three was a brilliant movie and I am sure many pixar movies to come will be considered good. However I beleive that the golden age and the flame or origionality that was present in in my opinion the best pixar movies has now passed.If you want to feel anything close to it again I suggest you watch the lego movie. seriously that movie was amazing and I am sure that it gives children watching it the same feeling that a  year old me got from Toy story,MarkMyWords,cgqquv5,20,t5_2xezv

I have only ever heard this argument from YECs and the contradicting results they reference are always objects that are too old or too young to be dated by carbon dating methods. Also carbon dating is only one of the many radiometric clocks that geochronologists use. The nuclear reactions and rates of radioactive decay are well understood by modern chemists through decades of experimentation and analysis. gt the fossil record which doesnt exist in the real world and only in textbooksThis is also obviously false. Just visit any natural history museum or find institutions who provide online pictures of fossils. All you need is a working pair of eyes hell even just one eye will do.gt genetics which is found to be so infinitely complex no honest geneticist would say it arose by chanceSeems like youre talking about abiogenesis here which is not part of the of theory of evolution. The theory of evolution only attempts to explain the diversity of life from a common ancestor which was likely a some type of primitive bacterial cell. The question of where the cell came from is a separate issue thats currently one of the frontiers of scientific discovery. Still though abiogenesis involves selective mechanisms that are a part of chemical evolution processis and there are literally teams of scientists including geneticists from top universities around the world that are working on various abiogenesis research projects as we speak. There is still tons of research to be done on the subject but scientific discoveries for plausible models of the formation of our primitive common ancestor are constantly made every year and these discoveries are only being made at an increasing rate. Again this has virtually no influence on the viability of the theory of evolution.gt etc.Please do go on about all this faulty evidence that so many scientific experts are wrong about.  ,MarkMyWords,ch3yt46,5,t5_2xezv

2961974,0,t1_co4rcpi,gt As such you make it sound like a bad thing. I think tax exemption is a bad thing when the business uses its money not for purely altruistic means. I do not feel the actions of the CoS have been nonprofit or notforprofit since they charge a flat fee and a person is unable to partake in all church services unless they pay. As opposed to Catholicism where you can partake in every service the church offers religious service not including education services or other non religious services without ever donating a dime. Same goes for almost all religions the only other religion I know of which sets requirements to partake in certain aspects of the religion is Mormonism another new religion which ex members also accuse of being  a cult. I have no problem with religious institutions nor do I have a problem with a business set up to cater to peoples mentalspiritual needs. For instance MANY people set up businesses as psychics telling peoples futures and giving advice. There is nothing wrong with offering a service and finding people willing to pay for that service whether it is real or not is an entirely different debate. However I would fight against any legislative action designed to give psychics tax exemptions for being religious in nature. I feel this is where Scientology crosses the line between religion and business. If they stopped requiring donations and auditing was done for free though reging would still be allowed and parishoners would be free to donate if they choose but would not be required to do so in order to be audited by a church approved auditor like catholic Confessionals or Buddhist meditation in temples then they would be a religion but as long as they charge a minimum fee to be involved they are a business. This is why I say Scientology is a religion and the Church of Scientology is a business. Also the rest of your argument is a straw man. I never said we should ban Scientology nor did I ever say it should be illegal. I did not imply that Scientology should not be allowed to function within the exact same bounds as any other organiztion. It should simply not be granted tax exemption and should be classified as a business under its current model. This has nothing to do with the articles you linked to nor does it have anything to with society as a general concept. It is purely a matter of why we grant tax exemption to religious organizations and why we do NOT grant tax exemptions to business organizations. The fact that you need organization does not mean you need to charge a flat fee for your services again look at catholicism it has structure it has the same organizational structure as some businesses but it does not charge a flat fee for any of its services. Organization is needed in ANY group activity and Scientology needs organization to function I never said it should not have organization. I simply said that its current model of charging for services should classify it as a business and not a religion.,MarkMyWords,co4sho6,1,t5_2xezv

3241769,0,t3_2x89in,Id probably say Alan Alda has a good shot at getting a supporting nomination for St. James Place just because hes a beloved actor who hasnt done much work recently and is getting up there age wise. The academy might want to give him at least another nomination while they still can.Also possibly a supporting nomination for Tom Hardy for The Revenant. Getting an acting nomination for acting in an Innaritu film is fishing with dynamite and hes starting to pick up a lot of positive press making him a perfect candidate for a nomination though probably not a win. ,MarkMyWords,coy0m2t,3,t5_2xezv

Almost everything concerning the Dem campaign is about how Hillary has the experience and has a more loyalimportant voter base even though Bern has the lead in all their polls and has a higher turnout at his rallies. Theyre also reporting heavily on Bloombergs threat to run Third Party if Bernie wins the nomination which is obviously an attempt to get people to vote for Hillary as to not fracture the party and lose democrat votes to a third party. If Bernie wins Iowa or even polls too close to Hillary they and MSNBC along with a bunch of other prints will no doubt try and discourage voters by way of smear articles threats from other candidates and mindless proClinton shilling. ,MarkMyWords,cz9hr1s,2,t5_2xezv

He started out pretty good in the s making a chunk of cash in the beginning of the career. Then when he got a good name for himself he churned out tons of mediocre to just plain stupid shit with Brate actors or actors that through his films became bigger stars. Because of all of his movies he has a high royalty income. He also has tons of loyal fans waiting to eat up his movies and because most of them are so bad theyre cheap on DVDBluRay release allowing lowincome fans to enjoy his movies perpetuating his fame. He wears cheap clothes making a lot of people adore him because he seems like a regular guy. He has shit figured out.

They have grants and scholarships just for them magazines groups rallies etc. People are terrified of being called a racist and having their careers ruined over nothing. Thats not oppression.  Every race has physical and cultural attributes that set them apart. Black skin and also white skin define these characteristics. This is just a definition of culture and everyones got one. So now white people dont have a sense of belonging or solidarity? What? Thats also not a minority thing. Im a German and proud of it. So minority groups determine who does and doesnt belong... Also what? This is like the black community shitting on someone because theyre too white and taking away their minority status. That makes no sense. ALL races are more likely to marry in their race. Wtf? Thats obvious. Its genetics evolution. You dont get the continuation of a species if for example a fish tries to fuck a bear and reproduce. All in all academics dont believe this garbage. African studies and gender studies majors do. Downvote away if you want but these statements are absolute bullshit. Besides you think white people are in power with a black president mandatory diversity requirements racist as fuck... a less qualified person gets a job because theyre a minority? and extreme over representation of minorities in media. Have a good one.PS. Your example of slave owners Really? You would go with that example. Is terrible. Those couple hundred slave owners were NOT the entire population so of course blacks were still the minority. In fact only . of people even owned slaves the richest of society. Much like our oligarchy today. Also the first American slave owner was black. Look it up EDIT Spacing is tough on mobile.EDIT Typical of SJWs.

7350601,0,t1_d2dnazs,Okay let me ELYYou said more people were INVOLVED in the moon landing than know about .  Involved means directly associated with the project not just aware of the fact and Im pretty sure more people are aware of  at this very moment than have ever been employed or contracted by NASA so there is absolutely no way more people were working on the Apollo project than have heard of .  If you said something along the lines of more people are aware that we landed on the moon than are aware of this obscure American subcultural tradition then I wouldnt have pushed it.But that doesnt matter because your first argument is flawed anyway.  Yes  million people watched the moon landing on their TVs but thats not the same as being a part of it like youre saying.  Same thing applies to anybody that heard the news breaking about the holocaust and had a shadow of doubt about the authenticity.  They were not involved in the actual event itself so theres room for conspiracies to start flying because so few people were there to legitimately confirm or deny the truth. is not the same kind of situation.  Its not a singular event with a handful of witnesses but a cultural tradition going back decades where almost everyone involved today can physically recall a time when smoking pot was illegal across the board and therefore we know that it has nothing to do with any sort of corporate moneygrab because their hands werent part of that bowl until the past decade.  In time as those of us who partook prelegalization die off there may be a sentiment like OP predicts but its going to be a while until that happens.  It might become a corporate moneygrab within the next few decades but well know that its not the source of the holiday.,MarkMyWords,d2dpoky,2,t5_2xezv

As for if an impeachment does somehow manage to happen I do believe Trump University will act as the catalyst. It seems like widespread fraud and could potentially be regarded to as a high crime if spun the right way.Do you have an alternative opinion?,MarkMyWords,d9upfa9,3,t5_2xezv

9873798,0,t1_daukema,I dont think we have seen any incredibly compelling evidence that Sherri herself is lying.  Shes been missing this whole time.. allegedly.  Perhaps she did only interact with two Hispanic Spanish speaking women but its still possible and probably likely there are more people involved and more to the story.  There seem to be serious holes in her story but not necessarily contradictions.  We have to remebember Keith has done on the talking for her.  We havent seen her on T.V. reasoning for us to believe why it makes sense she would be so easily abducted by two women rather than two men.Unless everyone involved is corrupt she definitely had a bruised face a broken nose cut hair and a brand.  It was all likely documented and the severity of her torture will perhaps come to light.  Im not convinced shes telling the truth just because Bosenko does.  He did say.. for now we are investigsting it as an abduction... Bosenko has still not made any statements tieing the crime to a cartle or human trafficking like Papini PI or Laura Ingraham.  Experts say its not likely.I am curious if Sherri could have been intimidated or coerced into saying it was two Hispanic women.  She could still be in fear of her life.Tbh though I am really curious how she could be released from the hospital so quickly in the condition they describe her to be in.  A spine like gears in a clock her husband thinks hes a poet.  But maybe there is more to the night of her release than we know including her presented injuries and treatment.,MarkMyWords,daukv7p,5,t5_2xezv
