525676,0,t1_cg00rio,But think of all the exposure youll get when you have ufemtobrewer personally recommending your book in rhomebrewing! I get double digit upvotes on a daily basis! That means at least ten! In all seriousness Im excited about your book though hopefully less excited than you are and will be putting a preorder in as soon as I buy a house in the next month or two.,schoolofhomebrew,cg00x81,3,t5_2wzln
2998617,0,t3_2ug9cp,I would suggest a  gallon round style cooler for you. This would create less dead space to surface area ratio for your mashes. Not to mention you will be surprised how little dead space you may actually have! I am assuming you will do full volume or no sparge mashes as you currently do BIAB. You can batch sparge later on if you want to make  gallon batches.Have you tried heating your water to a certain temp and insulting your kettle? You could see how much temperature you lose after mins. Insulate with sweaters insulation wraps sleeping bags etc... This way you wont have to heat much if at all. Please remove insulation prior to heating if you do. Please.You may find you dont have to invest in new equipment at all by doing this. Use software to estimate your strike water temperature based on your  min heat loss as I suggested above and loss from grains. Beer smith is solid but my beer co. looks promising and is completely free.,schoolofhomebrew,co8sz3n,1,t5_2wzln
