If youre not in the inner circle get in it or back in it as quickly as possible for the previous reasons stated.Similarly Snyder even if he hated the demands of the job has foreknowledge and some control over what happens next and that is worth it to him.,colony,d14g6or,7,t5_2swj1

10955484,0,t1_de9v9xj,Right the spreadsheet type report screen and the population graph make no sense as I explained in my review The report adds population decrease to birthrate to get total. Uh total what? That makes no sense. It would make sense if they subtracted deaths from births to get population change but thats not what it said. Then the graph makes even less sense. The whiz kids say they are plotting census data but they have data points right up until zero population. I think each and every one of you will understand that the graph is B.S. if you look at it. Also Ryan Condal has a degree in Accountancy so this isnt the sort of thing he would accidentally mess up.,colony,de9zaq7,3,t5_2swj1

10991169,0,t1_dedjqps,because they can only take the young ones or a minor fraction of the population. If they came with the truth with no hope for anyone else people wouldnt take it so well.

11023871,0,t3_5x8a8d,That was an intense episode. The reveal that Karen Brun Frankies mom was the head of the Red Hand cell was unexpected to me but seems pretty guessable in retrospect. Most of the episode was relatively lowkey until Snyder has a few prisoners shot to make sure Brams telling the truth though it feels like hed be more likely to lie and say nobody else was involved when the people he accused are shot right next to him... And then things really kick off.Helena Goldwin shows up at the labor camp to save Snyders life since the Raps have already decided to destroy it from orbit and Snyder honors his promise to Bram by saving him too. Meanwhile the Red Hand shows up at the Bowmans house and shoots Lindsey in the chest and there is an awesome action sequence with Will and Katie working together to take out the attackers and Charlie bravely protects Gracie. And that reunion scene of Bram hugging Charlie was heartwarming Honorable mention to Morgan for pretending to go along with Simons plan to betray Broussard and then knocking him over the head when he realized his gun was empty. Simon did not have much of a plan and it got him killed easily by Broussard. At least it seems Morgans committed and willing to be smart about things...All in all a great episode.,colony,dehixv1,4,t5_2swj1

11314106,0,t1_dfdru3h,gt Im getting the feeling this is written one episode at at a time with very little over all thought for where its goingIt fucking is. From his AMAgtHi Im a huge fan of Colony. Do you have a set plan for the number of seasons youd like to tell the Colony story over?and his answer?gtHey thanks. That makes me a huge fan of you. I do have a pretty good plan for the future of the show and Ive always known what the last season was going to be. The only question is how many seasons worth of stories do we need to get there? I think lengthwise the series would be on par with a Breaking Bad or a Mad Men.So basically duhhhh i dunno i like money and if they air more season that means more money but if the show goes down the shitter then ill have to wrap it up sooner than later so im not making any specific promises but i will say I hope it takes forever to tell the story cus i like money.This guy has zero gameplay except for how is probably going to shittily and quickly wrap it up so at least when he is presenting another show to another company he can look them in the eyes and say yeah I have completed my past works!Ill admit as much as anyone Ive really enjoyed this show so far but you can start to see some of the shit seep through the seems in the pipe if you pay attention. This guy is walking a fine line between having a pretty good series or a really shitty series that goes the route of Falling Skies,colony,dfefpg8,3,t5_2swj1

11445023,0,t1_dft8lev,I think HBO has kind of figured this out.  They have been doing more miniseries style shows  The Night Of and then the standalone seasons of True Detective.  Season  of Westworld pulled this off brilliantly too  Nolan amp Joy werent promised more than  season so they managed to tell a story that both was narrative complete and had space to go someplace.If I was a writerproducer I would totally making this kind of thinking part of my writing and my pitch.  Make my show and if it gets enough eyeballs for more seasons great this is how the story can continue if it doesnt you still end up with a solid short story that doesnt end with a WTF its over? moment.The old days of openended commitments for series cranking out filler episodes that reference some general idea and then not caring once it ended because nobody would watch it again are over.,colony,dfta7bv,1,t5_2swj1

11490934,0,t3_640rsh,gtThe aliens have a million drones up in the sky but the Bowman Family and Broussard amp Co can walk on the streets without getting detected.Thats partly because for reasons we dont understand yet the drones are not targeting Will and Broussard.gtHomeland Security is still intact and works harder than before the invasion.Yeah but theyre also pretty useless. Torn apart by internal distrust and constant changeover. Think of all the people weve seen come and go since x. Theres no reason to believe theyd be any more efficient than they are currently irl and people slip through the cracks all the time and theres good reason to believe that in some ways theyre less functional. The system is probably also riddled with people like Will and Jennifer or even Synder who either have a conscience or who prioritize selfinterest and therefore dont police as effectively as they could.gtResistance characters use cellphones landlines public phones internet access even radio without a worry.No they dont do any of this without a worry. It has repeatedly caused them problems as when Maddie used a phonecall to a public phonebox to trap Katie.I think youre overestimating the quantity and quality of tech that would be effective. For all that stuff to work you need a highly organised infrastructure numerous and loyal employees and plenty of money. Theyre acting like Cold War spies because the situation is in many ways like the Cold War.If you want a show that pushes the envelope with the st century tech stuff Person of Interest is a good watch.,colony,dfyhv8g,20,t5_2swj1
