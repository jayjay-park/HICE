9164,0,t1_cefehrw,Hi JoeThanks for the response.With regards to the point about discharging the pack less isnt it a highly inverse logarithmic relationship?  Like going from  daily discharge to  daily discharge will save a whole lot of the batterys life but going from  will save less and  will save less still? Im not denying that  kWh worth of discharge will affect a  kWh more than an  kWh pack but perhaps overall the difference might not be as pronounced as a linear degradation schedule would suggest and maybe not enough to justify the cost difference?Regarding your second point You break even if you pay x as much for a battery that will last x as long this ignores the near universally agreed upon assumption that battery prices will fall over time.  Why would I prebuy x the capacity that I need at  prices when I could buy only the capacity that I need then when it wears out replace it at cheaper  prices and then again at likely far far cheaper  prices?  And no argument that an ICE is a very complex beast but allow me to highlight one upside that Im enjoying right now the ICEs biggest wartits inefficiency at turning gasoline into motionbecomes a happy asset when its  degrees out.  Tomorrow its supposed to be  degrees here and an EV will expend far more energy into trying to keep myself and my kids warm than it will moving us down the road.  With my Volts onboard ICE on the other hand I can flip that on for three minutes and generate more than enough heat to keep us warm then cycle it off for the next five then back on for  seconds or so just to keep things toasty all while feeding charge into my pack as well. Not saying it justifies the entire ICE but boy am I gonna love that waste heat tomorrow! One other thing we didnt mention the bigger Tesla pack allows more power to be fed to a bigger motor resulting in the facemelting acceleration that the P can do.  Now thats a reason for a bigger pack!,electricvehicles,cefh946,2,t5_2qwzm

832454,0,t1_cgxuln9,Power is equivalent to the rate at which energy is consumed. A watthour is a unit of energy and is defined as one watt for one hour. Given a LCD screen is not an energy storage device it is inappropriate to assign it an energy rating. A LCD screen is not a battery. The only time it would be appropriate to use energy to describe an LCD screen is if you given some qualification for that by for example denoting over what timeperiod it will use that amount of energy or if it will use that amount of energy over a full charge. Watts is about right for a LCD screen so it seems like you confused power and energy. Given this I dont see how you can possibly make a statement about what Tesla should and should not include in their car when you dont understand the physics. As TMTM showed the change in range to the car is rather small.As for the reasoning behind the screengt A number of the interior design solutions need more polish. However all judges were impressed with the Teslas unique user interface courtesy of the giant touch screen in the center of the car that controls everything from the airconditioning to the nav system to the sound system to the cars steering suspension and brake regeneration settings. The system means the Model S interior is virtually buttonfree and the car has been effectively futureproofed More functionality is only a software update away.Read more gt An absolutely enormous seventeeninch touchscreen dominates the dashboard and features the controls for everything from the radio to the steering effort. That sounds like a recipe for disaster but here it works wonderfully. Oh yeah and you can surf the Web on it as well. We turned a lot of preconceived notions on their head and said Why does it have to be that way? says Tesla lead designer Franz von Holzhausen. Of course practically every new car claims to be revolutionary. But this one actually feels like it is to the point that many of us were reaching outside the automotive lexicon to describe it.

1131888,0,t3_27184w,The RavEV is the best deal out there for EVs right now and it will be discontinued by the end of the year. However the best deal on it is the  month lease with  lease cash and out of state buyers are ineligible for that. Unfortunately youre a little late to the game here when I got my Rav last year Toyota offered k off on purchases but after lots of nonCalifornians starting snatching them up they put an end to that.If you purchase a Rav new you only get  off plus the  fed credit that you wont get with a lease so youre effectively paying  more to purchase. So as others have said the best way to get a Rav for outofstaters is to buy used. However if CO EV incentives only apply to new purchases maybe they can help ameliorate some of that extra cost.Id say go for the Rav anyway however you have to make it work. Aside from the Rav there are really only two kinds of EVs out there right now There are superexpensive and superawesome Teslas or theres a Leafclass car. Despite all the noise about the i and other compliance car EVs theyre basically all the same with their puny  usable kwh batteries.The Rav stands alone as the sole outlier in this bimodal distribution. Its effectively a  kwh Model S for about  the cost of Teslas cheapest car. And its the only EV with an SUV form factor. Sure its a lowproduction run with a few quirks and sure theres a little bit of risk with the outofstate servicing but you cant say enough about getting a battery twice as big as a Leafclass for hardly any more cost.,electricvehicles,chwy3s7,1,t5_2qwzm

Otherwise Im a pretty firm believer in paid charging.  If youre on the hook financially for each hour youre plugged in its a pretty huge disincentive to stay any longer than you absolutely need.

Leaving EV drivers to fight among themselves over the limited number of options makes us all look like assholesnot a stereotype I want to reinforce any more than I already do by simply trying to get off the jihad juice.  Heres another idea  for the plugin hybrid users give them a V outlet and let them use their own wires that came with the vehicle.  All day is more than enough time to get a full charge that way.  People with pure EVs wont want to waste their time on those.  The simple V outlets are cheaper and you can afford to install more of them.  In fact why not just drop an outlet at almost every parking space?  I would much rather we THINK our way out of this rather than fight our way out.

4297804,0,t3_3a7d69,Congratulations on the Leaf! Im going to assume your car has the .kW charger and so can use a charge rate of up to .A. Id recommend getting an EVSE with at least that much capacity so you car can charge itself at the fastest possible rate. One thing Id want to clarify is if GP requires a A circuit supplying the EVSE or a A capable EVSE. The difference is important because continious loads like cars charging are only allowed to use  of the circuits rating. So a A EVSE would require a A circuit. Either way I would recommend a A capable EVSE on a A circuit. You can have an electrician install a NEMA  outlet and get an EVSE with a plug on it instead of hardwiring one then just plug it in. Your Leaf will be happy to have the .A available that it wants and if you have a future EV that can charge faster you have a A circuit available for that. Some models which have a good reputation A charge rate A charge rate check if meets GA requirementAs far as installation goes Atlanta should have some electricians with history doing EV installs but some people have found that its better to just tell the electrician you want XYZ type plug in ABC location and dont mention the EV.

4378095,0,t1_csj0nik, Oompa ravs explanation rocks!However that flexible term energy is muddying up the works. The power company tries to operate the main generators at a constant speed which generates a constant amount of energy regardless of load. Here I would think of energy as taking the place of constant voltage and frequency. At a constant voltage and frequency you can generate power or even consume power depending on the generators capability.Base load generators such as nuclear coal and oil run exactly as ravevdriver says. They often have contracts to run a specific amount of power to ensure they can run their equipment at efficiency. But then there are real time market generators spinning reserve capacity agreements and it just becomes really complex because in any given system there are hundreds of generators with any of five fuels. Counting the whole renewables group as one diverse fuel for no other reason beyond I am tired. Anyhow hope that helps.

If a manufacturer makes a hp version of an engine then does some tweaks to the intake exhaust and cal to make a hp version they have to certify them separately. That all goes back to crank power so thats generally the most important power metric.gtThe difference is while that doesnt exist at the wheels that shaft power does exist in the car. Its not theoretical its measured. This whole theoretical EV power can never actually be achieved by the car due to other limitations. Its disingenuous.

Thankfully reddit is becoming a platform where only the most politically correct opinions are permitted so we should all be in agreement on everything before long.I agree with you that big EVs like Model S wont solve the worlds problems but they represent progress over commuting in huge  MPG SUVs.

6320384,0,t1_cyw8nnl,Remember that the install costs for a  kW CCS station right now is somewhere in the  to  range.In aggregate a hotel can put in x  amp J for a single CCS plug. That means  travelers can fill up a  kWh overnight  hours on J. On the CCS side? If everyone waited for the morning each charge session is  hours  kW actual on a  kWh pack well... that doesnt go well. Ok lets say  kW CCS charging  kWh pack thats about an hour of charging.  vehicles thats  hours. How is this going to work? Oh yeah it doesnt.Gas station model does not work for electric vehicles. Full stop.Electric vehicles work best when charged at super off peak hours where the grid use is the lowest and wind power is the highest. High speed DC charging only when absolutely necessary.If you are pulling into a Supercharger near empty... and you are staying at a hotel  miles away at your next stop with a bevy of Js... you only need to charge enough to make it there  a buffer. So you charge  or  miles of range not . You stay maybe  minutes and let your car charge overnight while you are sleeping for a full charge to go another  miles the next day. You dont hang out at the Supercharger for  minutes or an hour and then go to your hotel if you can help it.All BEVs will have to have onboard chargers capable of an overnight charge or they really dont work well for making trips. Therefore it makes sense to put in A minimum Js today ideally up to A that can take  kWh packs.,electricvehicles,cz823pj,1,t5_2qwzm

Replacing a high mileage car is a good idea for the environment. Choosing an EV to replace your next car that is dying is a good idea. Getting solar panels on your roof to charge your EV is a good idea. If youre moving the Prius down the line by trading it in or selling it to someone doing the above its a good idea. But if youre buying one realize it might take a while to make a positive impact. Environmental impact is an important factor but it shouldnt be the only factor.

How often do you travel for  weeks at a time?If you want to drive yourself and you live in area with poor public transportation and would prefer your own car and this is a sunny outdoor airport lot without charging stations many of them do have them for long term travelers now thats already a lot of specific assumptions to make your scenario plausible.  So lets assume the absolute worst case which is your car is parked in a lot with no access to charging for weeks.According to Tesla and some quick napkin math you lose about  of capacity a day unplugged long term should lose at most about  miles or so off a full charge. Do you also live hundreds of miles from any charging station?  Taking the car to the nearest supercharger covers that entire vacations loss in  minutes.

Also their more groundbreaking work is effectively paid for by implementing it in highend vehicles and then charging for the privilege before moving it down to the main consumer market.gt Legacy car makers try to retrofit their ICE vehicles with electric motors and people complain that they are just doing it as a regulations vehicle and its gimpedBecause its such a lazy way of creating a true EV. It wouldnt take that much more effort to truly modify an existing platform to be more capable but instead they just whack in the EV components.gt They announce entire new platforms that are dedicated to EV and people complain that its not fast enough and its just a bad faith effortBecause these car manufacturers are absolutely massive and absolutely have the ability to create a Teslaesk EV but instead theyve halfassed it because its not where the big money is. gt Tesla has been working on their cars for years and still havent made a profitThats their endgoal like any company but it was started with an aim to force the larger manufacturers to at least attempt to get on the EV train rather than for pure profit. The established manufacturers could easily absorb the cost Id call it an investment of true EV engineering but again why bother when ICE vehicles are making them the most money and there was no true EV competition?gt EV enthusiasts should be excited about all EVs entering the market.Its definitely a positive thing that more EVs are being released but its hard to get excited about very poor cost vs. performance EVs when the Model S has been around for so long. Fair enough its far from being affordable for most but it allowed the public to see what as possible years ago and no one wants to move backward  which is what many current releases feel like in comparison. ,electricvehicles,dgfvw7d,4,t5_2qwzm
