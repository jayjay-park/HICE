Sorry Administrative professional Even so lots of people dont have their mothers any more and lots of mothers dont have their children anymore so take the opportunity to at least call her and tell her you love her. Especially if its been a while since you talked!,unremovable,cr4xtvo,1,t5_32dce
5434128,0,t3_3pfdqc,Discredited memo but not a discredited story...The Air Force Times states Killians former secretary Marian Carr Knox  of Houston has said she believed the memos were fake but their content accurately reflected Killians opinions.I know that I didnt type them she said in an interview with CBS. However the information in those is correct.While the authenticity of the memos is disputed what is not is the fact that From most accounts Bush appears to have received preferential treatment to get into the Air National Guard and avoid the draft after he graduated from Yale University in . He was initially regarded as a good pilot but his performance faded over his final two years in the Guard and he was suspended from flight status. He did not fly for the remaining  months he served in the Guard though he was obligated to do so.And for significant chunks of time Bush did not report for duty at all. His superiors took no action and he was honorably discharged in  six months before he should have been. .,unremovable,cw69iy9,1,t5_32dce
