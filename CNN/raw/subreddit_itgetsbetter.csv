Im only  now but I noticed in college and now as an adultish people start to value different opinions. Its what keeps things interesting. So dont sacrifice who you are to fit in with people. It does get better.Feeling disposable like you described continues to be one of my biggest insecurities but ultimately that feeling comes down to you not others. Its a self esteem thing. Do you have access to a school counselor or someone you feel comfortable talking with? Learning to have more self confidence will help with that feeling and you can start to notice how other people are just as afraid of not belonging.,itgetsbetter,dfq5glk,3,t5_2s5ge
