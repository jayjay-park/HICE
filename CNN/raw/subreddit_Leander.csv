3683963,0,t3_32ixti,I agree that I would generally choose suddenlink. I hear people complaining about every ISP but when I had Suddenlink I had the least downtime of every provider Ive ever used. I currently live in a neighborhood Vista Ridge off of Bagdad and weve got Uverse Gigapower so I went with that. Its crazy fast and Ive only had a handful of issues most of which were solved in a few hours.,Leander,cqc72ot,1,t5_2ulsm
