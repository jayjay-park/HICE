238850,0,t3_1wu0pd,Dick Grayson got the best character development in that series. Thats why Im generally disappointed in Dixons Nightwing while it was certainly an improvement over the later New Teen Titans I.e New Titans it was a far cry from the WolfmanPerez era.,Nightwing,cf5iagb,6,t5_2rmrb

1394955,0,t3_2a0rg5,I love Black Mirror but I also love his run of Batman amp Robin with Damian. They had a great chemistry to me. We were the best  Reborn Batman vs. Robin and Batman and Robin must die,Nightwing,cir4zv4,3,t5_2rmrb
1821398,0,t1_ck8nvr7,Yeah I did like the reverse storyline but thought it just butchered who Dick really is. Especially calling batgirl barbara shudders,Nightwing,ck8nz0q,3,t5_2rmrb

2145064,0,t3_2jgumh,Nightwing could work as a guest star as something of a contemporary and foil to Oliver. Whereas Oliver is broody and has a tendency to push people away Nightwing could represent what a welladjusted crimefighter could look like. He could make a few vague references to a mentor and maybe a meta joke about broody playboy billionaires who dress up as vigilantes. He could also bring in Oracle to mentor Felicity. Or he could just be a rival love interest because its the CW.,Nightwing,clchig0,4,t5_2rmrb
2173998,0,t3_2jxgtk,That is a really cool design I would buy that in a heartbeat!,Nightwing,clg61k4,3,t5_2rmrb
2539995,0,t3_2orjb2,Grayson is my favorite DC ongoing. The art is great and the character is intact. Sure hes not Nightwing right now and Id love for him to go back to that eventually but Seely and King are telling Dick Grayson stories that you couldnt really tell if he was a street level hero. As long as they still have more stories like this to tell and their quality stays up Im totally fine pushing off the inevitable return to fingerstripes.,Nightwing,cmq43ql,4,t5_2rmrb

3421090,0,t3_2zc4p1,Is that where this whole Grayson title thing came from whenever people talk about a Nightwing show? I didnt know that they changed Nightwings name to simply Grayson in the comics,Nightwing,cpi89fv,1,t5_2rmrb

4813830,0,t3_3295y2,I love the character design for Nightwing  in these movies. More visual than dialogue though. His attitude towards Damian is spot on though. The animation and outfit just make me oogle during fight scenes. That being said I could do without the cheap dialouge he deserves better. No way in hell would he lose to Damian Im sorry but Im tired of the Damian hype.,Nightwing,cu1bnf2,1,t5_2rmrb

8420005,0,t3_4uywde,Just finished reading it. Dont like the art that much but its nice to see Dick in the bat cave again for sure! And it seems like Bruce is pretty harsh on Dick for some reasons ha but I like where it is going with the Raptor guy.On the other hand the art on the new Red Hood is awesome! Never been a fan of Red Hood but the rebirth issue was pretty neat and did a pretty good job on retelling the background story of Jason and Batman. I wish they could do more of that to Nightwing. ,Nightwing,d5u1kyl,2,t5_2rmrb
8720755,0,t1_d6vq73x,Freefall! Its really good. Im not a huuuge fan of the art but its definitely not bad or anything. Its the characterization that makes it so good in my opinion. Its always one of the ones I recommend when someone isnt familiar with Nightwing at all.,Nightwing,d6vqh50,6,t5_2rmrb
9282450,0,t1_d8se9pj,I love this so much Rocksteady have proven time and time again that they really understand the mythos. When Bruce lost Jason it destroyed his spirit if he were to ever lose Dick it would destroy everything he is and has worked for. ,Nightwing,d8sm959,6,t5_2rmrb
