436086,0,t1_cfpyj94,Dont worry about your doctor not getting back to you immediately scoliosis is not an emergency! I had scoliosis severe enough for surgery on most of my back and I still waited about  months from diagnosis to surgery. If he does think you may need surgery youre going to be referred to a specialist which will take at least a few weeks. In the meantime all you can do is take care of yourself. If youre looking for something constructive to do to help deal with back pain while you wait many people benefit from swimming and yoga. Both are easy on joints and help strengthen muscles and improve flexibility. Dont worry about the possibility of surgery too much scoliosis is relatively common and the need for surgery to fix it is pretty rare. ,scoliosis,cfpyrdt,1,t5_2suva

2317035,0,t3_2ldtbq,Go to a mall. Its nice because there are places to sit down if you need to and it gets you out of the house for a bit. I was kind of a hermit after my surgery and I think my recovery would have been more pleasant if I had done that. ,scoliosis,cly3ml2,2,t5_2suva
2753804,0,t1_cngmwq2,Hey thanks a bunch. This looks like it would do wonders.i might look Into getting one. I miss my old physio who would really get into the areas like no one else. I actually bought a foam roller off her which can be a big help. Thanks again for commenting. Much appreciated. ,scoliosis,cnh3gs2,2,t5_2suva
2762209,0,t1_cnhwf83,So if I understand idk why this is so confusing for me every time haha but you are side planking with the curved out the side with the hump side down and the weaker side up? I understood from the articles that it should be the weaker side down but Im so confused!! I want to strengthen the weaker side because the muscles on my left where the curve bows out are much much stronger than the right!  And also I wish I knew what my curve was! I havent had Xrays since I was like  and my parents dont know what they did with them after several moves all I know is that it wasnt bad enough for me to have to have surgery but bad enough that I should have a brace. I know im lucky that its only in my hips and not obvious in my shoulderrib cage but of course I notice it a lot on myself and it stresses me out.. Whats your curve?? Do you have photos to share?,scoliosis,cni1wnh,2,t5_2suva

3702108,0,t1_cqdnjnd,My curves while considered moderate to severe presented with minimal cosmetic signs. My sister has a very small cobb curve like  degrees and presented with more significant cosmetic signs. It really is often hard to tell just by looking at your back. Even if your back shows no signs of a curve and no pain it still can be significant. I was diagnosed at  and Im in my early s now and just starting to experience back pain from my curves. ,scoliosis,cqe9jpy,1,t5_2suva
3981902,0,t3_362b4y,Hey!! I dont think its ever really too late  at least thats what my doctors have told me. My Spinecor therapist says he has a client who wears the brace and is nearly !Im also really against surgery I cant imagine myself ever getting it and have had two braces Boston and Spinecor and am going to get a corset made in about two weeks. Im not expecting it to correct my spine but I think wearing them does help at least it puts my mind to ease.With the Spinecor brace I think youre fine as long as you get it adjusted when needed. I know that I start feeling uncomfortable in it when the straps are too loose.. Do you have the child or adult version?,scoliosis,cra66rp,1,t5_2suva
4586310,0,t1_ct8p7g6,Trust me its been a joint effort between me and her parents to avoid her googling. She did it once back when she was first told she had to get surgery and nearly had a panic attack so were trying to avoid that.And yeah I just hope it all goes well. Shes only supposed to be in the hospital for  to  days so hopefully its not too extensive.Thanks for all your help. ,scoliosis,ct8pc56,2,t5_2suva
4755952,0,t1_ctt7p2m,I know right....another excuse theyve given me for putting it off is that I dont continue with my exercises now how will they be sure I will do the post surgery exercises.....like really people? ,scoliosis,ctu17cj,1,t5_2suva

6452236,0,t3_43zd3i,We know where our own scoliosis is so are a lot more aware of itselfconscious. Recently asked a friend about a dress as I thought accentuated my scoliosis. She had zero idea. Have also had to point it out to people before. Generally people dont see what they arent looking for. Try not to worry about it!,scoliosis,czmpb25,1,t5_2suva
6817919,0,t1_d0mlevv,I had a couple people look at it and they said they couldnt really tell about the curvature. My doctor could tell right away. Im at the point now that im in pain every day to some extent.  Is the pain reversible with exercisephysical therapy?,scoliosis,d0p3y5d,2,t5_2suva

7160254,0,t3_4dleip,I wouldnt take that as fact. If you want to exercise and help your back then start swimming.With your username hopefully you already like to swim but its seriously the best option that I know of for rehabilitation. ,scoliosis,d1s1v9g,3,t5_2suva

9089608,0,t3_54rv9w,Hey dude same boat my scoliosis is in the bottom of the spine though. Many people recommend doing yoga several poses stretch the back in positive ways as well as back shoulder workouts since its usually a lack of muscles that caused the condition in the first place. Ive been doing pushups and pull ups as well as YRG yoga a few times a week for the last  months and its helped wonderfully!,scoliosis,d84fa5t,1,t5_2suva

9504323,0,t1_d9jmkzn,I know this article sometimes talks about  scoliosis prefusion but as someone whos gone through it I feel like this encapsulates some of the emotions quite well particularly the bits about living with pain and zoning out of conversations. Ive lost count of the amount of times I have zoned out of conversations because of pain and discomfort!,scoliosis,d9klzce,1,t5_2suva

10528573,0,t3_5pv1tp,I dont believe it has been mentioned yet but there is an alternative surgery that doesnt include fusion. It is called VBT Vertebral Body Tethering where they place a mobile tether along the spine instead of a solid titanium rod. Beyond the initial correction it also corrects over time as the patient grows. It is relatively limited to younger individuals.If I knew I had scoliosis at  this wouldve been the best option. The limitation on mobility is limited and recovery time is significantly less since fusion is not needed. Please look into this!,scoliosis,dd1j15v,1,t5_2suva
10595299,0,t1_dd8214d,I am horrible at reading body language.  It is like having a disability.  But I will ease off for a few days and check back with another tactic along the lines of I imagine that doing this day in and day out is frustrating.  Lets take a  week holiday and talk about how we should go forward with it after that. Then see if she can find a way to share the issues with me during her break.,scoliosis,dd8tnkp,1,t5_2suva
11208357,0,t1_df2chzy,Theres still a chance for surgery to help all of that it would probably be a bit different from mine because I was young and my bones were still flexible. You should go ask a doctor if he can at least refer you to the xray department of your hospital your spine could be pushing on organs and whatnot if its gotten worse. ,scoliosis,df2gdlo,1,t5_2suva
