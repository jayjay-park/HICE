10231506,0,t1_dc3ka4o,I have never used hacks for bad reasons. In fact I play on a server where the admins are rarely ever seen so I put myself in duty to find and kill hackers myself. I have experienced kill aura and know how it works. All I did was refer to it so that I could easily explain my point.,MCAbnormalities,dc3sr90,1,t5_3i1rp
10349271,0,t3_5o636j,This weapon should only be able to be used in the Sky Dimension  eh uSendineisTheParadox?,MCAbnormalities,dch5ei2,1,t5_3i1rp
10353749,0,t3_5o636j,For anyone saying that this is overpowered it is not.This weapon may have an extremely fast swing rate but you only deal damage every half a second so it is basically an iron sword with a shorter cooldown and a special ability.The problem is though this requires very little skill to use because of its tiny cooldown and this recharges faster than the average person can click on a mouse so most people would prefer it over a diamond sword making diamond swords useless for them.In my opinion diamond swords should always be the superior weapon in Minecraft.Still a good concept so you have my upvote maybe I can use some of this idea for a future suggestion ,MCAbnormalities,dchnp3s,2,t5_3i1rp

10656570,0,t1_ddemsav,I was just making a joke about the trebuchet. I know that the trebuchet was used to launch everything from rocks to corpses and burning lime. Maybe the siege engine you are proposing could launch entities like TNT minecarts.,MCAbnormalities,ddf569p,1,t5_3i1rp
