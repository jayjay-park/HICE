540769,0,t1_cg1iom8,Possibly. I used fresh raspberries pured and cooked down with a little sugar. I then added chambord which gave it a little more flavor. I added all that to a chocolate ganache but I think the chocolate was just too overpowering. I think next time I will try and make just a raspberry cream filling. ,CandyMakers,cg1qq0o,1,t5_2wj3j
3487705,0,t1_cppt73a,I have a few of those older style JVC machines I use. I do a lot of firstdipping as Im tempering so I dont waste machine time. When I see its setting up nicely I start the finish dipping. I use a few different blends so using a thermometer isnt always accurate. They all seem to like different temperatures. Working with chocolate is the real Montezumas revenge lol,CandyMakers,cpptnru,1,t5_2wj3j
