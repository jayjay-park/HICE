It depends on what you think your character can guess and what not. She is obviously caucasian and have a Seattle accent which is perdominant but the other two mix in with it.,roll4it,d5ida11,1,t5_3eyqt
8347683,0,t3_4teatn,uPawelECieslak If you hit up that information broker or spend a couple hours searching the guy on the Matrix youll find out about the  Olympics and his  medals  gold  silver  bronze in shooting.  If you talk to anyone with UCAS Military knowledge they might know that he was Admiral aboard the USS Lee and if they have a lot of UCAS knowledge it could reveal that he also designed the Lee.  Any cursory investigation into the Lee would reveal the origin of Augustus also as the Lee was named for Admiral Willis Augustus Lee.  If you get a lot of info on him VADM Fusco is a renowned marksman. tactician and shiphandler and Bubblegum would tell you that to this day he wears his Admirals uniform everywhere even on the job but no one has any proper evidence on him except a handful of witness reports that a man in a military uniform was there and usually those witnesses report that he saved them or saved someone else or that he generally disarmed the situation.  There are even a couple of reports of him sticking around after a run went south and making use of his police contacts and firearms license to keep the trail of his fellow runners clean.,roll4it,d5l0hre,1,t5_3eyqt
8350994,0,t3_4tpvyv,Yeah Ive already dug in there twice but havent had the capacity to pull out more than a couple of fragments. Ive seen videofiles accounting records and blueprints for all kinds of tech in there. Ive just not had the capacity to pull it out of there. I can show you the loophole in ther security but I recommend getting seriously kitted out first go to whatever safe house you manage and gather anything you think you might need for this.Nuyens a non issue for me currently. Besides Im sure I can rewire some of caliphers funding without them knowing it.,roll4it,d5lfe9e,1,t5_3eyqt
8370184,0,t3_4teatn, Banshee groans softly as she steps back into Nowhere pulling the braid out and letting her hair fall around her shoulders. It had been a long dreking day. It seemed it was got a lot busier then it had been yesterday. She glanced at the new arrivals. The black furred troll from yesterday was still sat at his booth like he never even moved. She wouldnt lie. The new arrivals at least looked like they were interesting. A african man wearing chainmail and a monoblade. Street Samuri...or more likely Street Knight. Standing beside him was another elf nothing too interesting about him just that he was shorter then her by maybe a inch or two. The silver belt buckle caught her eye before anything else. But upon seeing the varitable mountain of muscle she frowned as sighed as she recognized the man. Brick Thunderface. A famous action hero. She had made her way back towards her previous spot seeming as how she was the first to arrive. She would send them their cut but she didnt get their commcodes. Her eyes eventually settle on the dwarf with a weird pack on his back something you would see in horrible scifi trids. There was something wrong with him though she could just feel it...She closes her eyes for a moment and opens them seeing the bright beautiful lights of the Astral Plain.SchoolofRightLiving  What does she astraly precieve?,roll4it,d5ntn53,2,t5_3eyqt

8515003,0,t3_4upuim,In moments Augustus is up and his pistol is out of his holster in his hand.  He arrives at th and Pine in under  minutes and it is clear that the place is nominally empty.  uKenyanKrusader has however managed to arrive even faster.  Theres so much gunfire in New York heck in the  minutes between here and Nowhere Augustus heard everything from pistol fire to a heavy machine gun  shot doesnt even get a Lone Star Response usually.  This is no exception.  Im gonna grab that character so uBanshee can do whatever theyre gonna do with Breach and I decided that since I gave the Kondo fight to Kenyan Im gonna need a proper rival especially someone who likes to shoot.  A Dwarf with a revolver seems to fit the deal so unless Banshee or uSchoolOfRightLiving objects to this Ill make this dwarf a different assassin completely.  If you do have an objection well just retcon this postDuchess pings Augustus with an unrelated RAC warrant which suddenly seems a lot less unrelated.  A Dwarf marksman from Aztlan Because who doesnt love a cigarsmoking Mexican gunman who is suspected by the UCAS Government of acting as an assassin for Aztech and being associated with a number of major international incidents including the death of the Imperial Japanese Crown Prince in .  Hes got a hefty bounty on his head and it increases for every one of the hits that can be proved.  Augustus turns to Kenyan.  I am very grateful for your help with Kondo now its my turn to repay the favor.  youre hurt and a marksman is more my skill than yours.A glint catches his eye and he shoves Kenyan behind a nearby car as sniper shots ring out.,roll4it,d65xn0k,2,t5_3eyqt
8546452,0,t3_4upuim,Winter is comingIt was a brisk afternoon with an overcast sky but for Brick the chilliest part of the day had been Toms shoulder after the well televised disaster that was the fight with Paingiver. As a lone wolf for so long Brick really knew how to put the I in team and wasnt used to even considering the position of others working towards the same goal. He was the Fist one dragon army and soldier of lust. Toms tersely worded reprimands were only made stronger for being completely deserved. Brick wasnt sure how to respond and they didnt exactly make Sorry I FUBARed the mission probably? Hallmark cards.They hit the street in relative silence Tom twirling the keys to a black chrystler around his finger when the sniper finally extended an olive branch So this Paingiver he going to be any help?Maybe. Brick replied But I wouldnt count on it.Didnt he pledge to help Leons cause?Yea.Not a lot of honor among porn stars?Brick laughed Herchu isnt in the business. When I said wed worked together I meant something else. We both answer to a higher authority. In his case though Brick shrugged Paingiver is a sledgehammer in a world full of really small nails. I cant think of a good reason for him to be outside and away from the Sanctuary. And I cant guarantee his help wouldnt make things worse.Tom looked down the road towards the sound of distant gunfire like a menacing fireworks show was going on from the direction Augustus called from. A gentle tremor went through the street and rocked the car as they reached it I dunno Tom said looking across the roof at Brick Sounds like we could use a sledgehammer about now. He got a comm request just as he opened the drivers side door.Need us to hurry? Brick asked. Another tremor.No. Tom said frowning at the comm The call is coming from you it must be Leon. he clicked the screen on Whats up?You need to see this! the young elf pushed images from Toms scope onto the display That thing is headed right this way!The sniper does a doubletake and squints at the video feed in disbelief Ok he says New plan.What is it? Brick asks. Tom shows him the comm over the car where a livestream from his scope shows an impossibly large impossible monster peeking over several roof tops in its doublequick march towards them. Ohhhh. he says slowly Shit.Plan BA breeze thats simply biting at street level is a gnawing banshees wail on the unfinished upper floors of a partially constructed building. Patches of gray tarp whip and snap fitfully at the mercy of the frigid wind. Not far from the waters edge the air here had an extra crispness to it. The scramble up all those floors using routes made for a quick escape left Tom almost winded as he entered his snipers perch his breath escaping in puffs of white steam. He crouched by his rifle commlink in hand to enjoy his commanding view of the street. The buildings were lower at the south edge of the city and while he couldnt see every street Tom could look out across the roofs of most buildings from the seaport further south clear to chinatown up north. Passed that point the skyscrapers closed ranks rising up like walls of metal and glass to block his view of the rest of the city. But Tom didnt need a scope or perfect sight lines to see what lumbered his way Alright Scrabble. he says What the hell am I looking at?Wellll the eidomancer groans on the other end. Tome can hear gunfire and Augustus calling out enemy positions in the background Its a really simple magic construct.You made that with a simple spell?There was like a LOT of magic involved. But not really a lot of um time? Its not my best work. he confesses.How do we stop it? We dont have the firepower to take something like that down.Oh thats easy! Scrabble says excitedly sucking in a painful gasp of air as a result See the only command I gave it was to chase down that assassin its uh chasing.So if we kill the assassin the monster disappears?Well No. Theres way too much magic in there it will have to burn itself out on its own. BUT if you drop the assassin it will stop heading your way. Tom can almost feel Scrabble giving him a thumbs up on the other end I think. Oh yea remember its not all caps a burst of gunfire swallows up the rest and Tom hears and awkward Oh nuuuu! from Scrabble as he fumbles for the comm and then an abrupt splash. With a short circuiting crackle the line goes dark.To the naked eye at this range the assassin is little more than an annoying fly zigzagging in front of the rampaging letter. Tom takes up his position and looks down the scope of his high powered swatter.Cracks and tremors race across the asphalt. Buildings shudder and groan from even the slightest graze and rain glass and rubble on to the ground below. Cars crush and flip with its every step in a show of destruction not seen outside of monster truck rallies. High above the road the mercenary known as Searchlight sprints along the face of a building. He leaps fires a burst from the thrusters in his boots and hurtles the gap to reach a building across the street and continue his run unbroken. Mindlessly the giant A stomps after him.Keep up ya big basttid. Searchlight yells without looking back Almost there. As he races down James Place the skyscrappers begin to thin out and the assassin gets his first really clear view of the target area marked by the skeletal frame of a building still under construction nearby. The tiniest glint of light catches his eye from the construction site and the assassin kills his thrust midjump jerking his head to the side as a bullet shaves off some of the hair by his temple. Thats a hundred meters passed where anyone should take that shot! He tumbles in the air before he can save himself with another burst scant yards from the ground.Through Toms scope it looks like he caught his target right out of the air but a professional doesnt celebrate a kill he cant confirm. The assassin leaps back into view above a rooftop half a block closer in a pose that reminded Tom way too much of Kondos quickdraw slash.At street level at the foot of the construction site Brick paces back and forth literally kicking rocks as he waits for word. Its Toms fight right now and if the sniper cant do it they have to go with plan B. The crack of thunder signals Toms answer to the assassins thrown gauntlet and Brick looks up at the snipers position for the signal. Instead the assassin offers his rebuttal.A white beam sweeps across the sky overhead and slashes through the construction site just below Toms perch with an odd WHUM sound and disappears just as quickly. The heavy metal beams flash white then orange then sort of growl and groan all at once. Ponderously slow the top floors start to slide sideways as the building belatedly realizes its been cut in half.Tom! Brick calls into his comm only to hear his voice echoed just above with the sniper rapidly rappelling down. High above loose beams are tipping over the side and falling after them.Plan B! Tom yells to him Move move move!Brick turns and runs to clear the destruction but he looks back realizing Tom will NOT make it. The sniper still only halfway down seems to sense his urgency and glances up for the first time to see the giant metal spears falling right at him. Staring up Tom stops for a second as if accepting his fate and then he moves. He flips around plants his feet on the wall and eases his grip on the rope. The rope practically whistles as it feeds through his hands while he runs a crazed crisscross path jukes and spins and leaps over gaps of unfinished wall. Gravity machineguns  ton death all around him and misses every time. Beams scream by so close that the air tugs his clothes like they were near passing cars. It seemed in that one moment Tom had memorized the trajectory of every metal rod.In his awe Brick hadnt realized hed slowed down to admire and when an unscathed Tom reaches the ground and catches up he says I thought I told you to move.Yea but Brick raises his hand High five though am I right? Tom shakes his head and runs to the street with a laugh Hey!,roll4it,d69vlyj,2,t5_3eyqt
