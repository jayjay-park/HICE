1553625,0,t1_cjajpjw,I wish I could provide an answer but Im basically clueless here. Ive heard there are issues getting injection drivers to work work with OpenGL which I think would mean someone would really need to integrate the oculus SDK to get it to work. Ive also seen that the engine is limited to fps and the DK is designed to work best at fps though I think it would still be worth it even at fps. Id love to do something to help but unfortunately Im more of an enthusiast than a developer.,TheDarkMod,cjb0qsq,2,t5_2uvct
