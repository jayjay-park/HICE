Also some people think that if they point the laser on someones chest it will deter the criminal from whatever they were going to do.

10194687,0,t1_dbzg9p8,How often do you dry fire?You can try having a friend load your magazine with a mix of live rounds and snap caps. If you flinch on a snap cap it will be extremely obvious and youll force yourself to make your trigger pull consistent.Another trick is to pull the trigger sloooowly so that you dont anticipate. The trigger break should almost come as a surprise. As long as you pull steadily and keep your sight picture aligned your shot will go where you point it even if you didnt feel mentally preparedsteel yourself for the shot.It may feel lame to slow down but slow will help fix your habits. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.With this slow pull method weve borrowed friends and strangers guns  everything from a crisp Ruger Mark to a long heavy tiny SampampW Bodyguard to a mushy HiPoint  and demonstrated how accurate their guns can be. So many people develop bad habits early and blame the quality or barrel length of the gun.

10471312,0,t1_dcv0srm,I dont like the mag disconnect or the external safety on the lcs and lc.  Thats why I went with pro model.   ,handguns,dcv14dz,1,t5_2rj7r
10683766,0,t1_ddhvkdn,Ok but I still like the feel of a full size way more anyways.Plus in another thread that I asked some purchase advice in the top rated comment was that making a decision would be a lot easier when I accepted I was going to buy more than one over time.,handguns,ddhy739,3,t5_2rj7r
10915345,0,t1_de5lynk,The p was just picked up by the US Army so hopefully that means the gun is rugged reliable BC and not too picky with ammo.,handguns,de5u9t2,3,t5_2rj7r
11027147,0,t3_5xgmey,you dont buy an attachment you just buy a threaded barrel in that caliber for that gun. they typically run  to  for the barrel. Also the barrels typically font have manufacturer logos etc. on them so the for show part may or may not be worth it for ex. I have an hk vp and I love seeing the hk stamp on my barrel and would lose that with a third party threaded barrel.,handguns,dehwhmz,4,t5_2rj7r

11150301,0,t3_5y9cns,Might be a little late but if youre looking for something that is decently priced for what it is  I got a Bersa Thunder  Pro high capacity mm for  a little under a year ago send to my FFL from Buds Gun Shop. Ive been meaning to post a picture on here.  round capacity doublesingle action and comes with an extra mag. It has a decocker that also acts as a manual safety although in the holster with the long double action trigger pull youd be fine to keep the safety off however I find it very easy to take out of safety its just a drop of the thumb. Field stripping it is as easy as just flipping a lever on the frame. Ive put  rounds through it and have not had a single failure to feed or failure to eject Ive shot every ball ammo brand under the sun without issues and  or  different JHP rounds without an issue and went up to  rounds before cleaning it not counting cleaning it on arrival from the factory. Im absolutely in love with mine. ,handguns,devvhv6,2,t5_2rj7r
