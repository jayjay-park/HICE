3401370,0,t3_2z5ony,Its too bad the VCO only has one waveform. Wouldve prefered a digital oscillator if that meant more waveforms. The filter sounds great.,synthdiy,cpfzcrj,1,t5_2vbhj
6591340,0,t1_d00u3xu,Yeah from thinking about it today Im just going to stick to a synth. That video is really cool though thanks for sharing ,synthdiy,d013k5k,1,t5_2vbhj

8234686,0,t3_4s1v23,Yeah. Something is sticking for sure. Bad chip maybe?  Thanks for the input. Ill poke around. Thank you!,synthdiy,d56w3fn,1,t5_2vbhj
9909721,0,t1_dafjnzb,I wouldnt say that it depends if youre more interested in the hardware or in making music.. I love that you get to know your synth inside out and that when youve learned the basics you can build your own stuff. I see my own diy as a continous work in progress and its rewarding to see it grow,synthdiy,daz9d90,1,t5_2vbhj

You can get all the goodness of a serge banana system including putting them in bud or hammond boxes if you ever want to plus you can probably shift a module second hand if you need to. Advantages over Serge are obviously that its more modular with  inch divisions and screw holes at  inch spacing. You can also use eurorack rails if you want. For the panels you can just get them cut to size by a metal yard  not expensive. ,synthdiy,db3f4vx,2,t5_2vbhj

Initially it comes out to about the same price I expect with shipping about  but its for a batch of  rather than just a single panel so I hope to offset the cost by selling the spares on the MIDIbox forums. This is the first panel Ive ever ordered though so Im nervous! FPE just seems so expensive...Tayda is kinda great and kinda awful. On the one hand you can get bulk pricing on low quantities and save some significant money and for a few select items dual gang pots for instance I prefer the selection at Tayda to Mouser. OTOH they skimp on QC so some folks have had significant failure rates for components ordered through Tayda. For cheap passive stuff like resistors pots caps etc it makes sense to gamble for the very significant savings Ive never had a failure from this stuff. For other more expensivecomplex stuff like ICs I tend to stay away because some folks have received entire batches of faulty stuff. But almost every DIY project I do involves at least one Tayda and one Mouser order.,synthdiy,ddzt5o8,1,t5_2vbhj
10866590,0,t1_ddzt5o8,Oh ye i think you said that to me before about the PCB Fab im interested to see what it comes out looking like.Nice one ill have to start using tayda for certain things too. I use RS quite a lot Convenience and Mouser just a little bit but more options are always better.,synthdiy,de0t87m,1,t5_2vbhj
10964162,0,t1_dear9f7,Fucking Nice! Looks Whopper!I love the Design especially the box for the Matrix that will look very cool when its lit up.,synthdiy,deavjtm,1,t5_2vbhj
11173262,0,t3_5zimfo,Is there something wrong with using the existing analog inputs?For outputs you just need a suitable DAC expensive takes up multiple digital outs works really well or to rig up a filtered PWM cheap one output needed works pretty well.,synthdiy,deyh6go,1,t5_2vbhj
