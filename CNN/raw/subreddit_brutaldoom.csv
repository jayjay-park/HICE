7172773,0,t1_d1tcle3,Autoloading seems a bit fidly and unnecessary. If youre on Linux just open up a terminal and pop in    gzdoom iwad Doom.wad file scythe.wad brutalvb.pkReplacing scythe with whichever wad you want to play brutalvb with whichever version or what your copy of the .pk is actually called and the iwad with whichever iwad is needed for the mod. Or you can leave out the iwad bit altogether and select it from the list as normal but if youre in the terminal anyway you may as well save yourself that step.,brutaldoom,d1th6bs,3,t5_37rv0
