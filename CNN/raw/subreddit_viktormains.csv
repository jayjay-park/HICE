6560128,0,t3_45fvfq,The beautiful thing about Viktor is there isnt only one build path to go with him hes incredibly flexible. For example  I almost never bother upgrading my Q until after I have at least two items completed and I usually put a heavy priority on CDR. I avoid building Lich Bane and Ludens Echo due to efficiency standards and often times dont even bother upgrading W until its the only thing left to buy for a full build. Its entirely down to preference and play style. Technically some build paths ARE more efficient than others but ultimately it comes down to how you like to play your Viktor. My preferred path goes like this HexE gt boots gt Morellos gt Boots of Lucidity gt Rylais gt HexQ gt Deathcap gt Void gt HexW. This build with runes caps out my cdr before the  minute mark and provides endless selfpeelkiting with Rylais. My runes vary but my page against manageable AP lanes are Mpen reds Health PerLvl yellows  scaling CDR blues scaling AP blues and flat AP quints. I take Natural Talent instead of vampirism to compliment my scaling AP glyphs which only gives five less AP than if I were running a full rune page of scaling AP without the CDR. As Viktor would say FUNCTION OVER FORM. P,viktormains,czxve0g,6,t5_378p4

7115833,0,t3_4cy93z,Recently I completely changed my build trying to improve my overall chance at winning. This may sound weird at first but is actually a very nice set up. I have up at  shotting casters at lvl  so no more scaling ap. Movement speed quints magic pen reds health yellow and scaling cdr blues. I also take storm raiders surge instead of Thunder lords. This allows me to simply E the jg whenever I get ganked and just sprint away. Try it out. I still rush ludens into rylais unless ad assassin go for hourglass.,viktormains,d1mzb2j,2,t5_378p4

7700523,0,t1_d3hewxo,I am queuing midtop asking people to swap when I get top and they sometimes agree. Every game with Teleport is top lane game.I can try uploading games sometimes and when Ill have more time Im going to try streaming. Basically my strategy is to not allow myself to fall behind in lane Im playing super safe unless I am  sure I wont get punished for my aggression aka jungler was just seen in another lane and my opponent has cooldowns what allows me to reach my E Augment powerspike without many problems. After getting E I usually have upper hand already. I need to finally learn how to CS though I was able to get to Diamond last season with such crappy farm but damn those low numbers annoy me,viktormains,d3hhygp,1,t5_378p4
7725152,0,t3_4l4is5,In general champions with fast gapclosers and some form of CC that allows them to kill you for the duration before you get your tanky items are the worst matchups.As such Irelia is terrible. Jax also not very pleasant. Never played against Jarvan but I suppose hes similar.Personally I dislike Nasus because I feel obliged to bully him out of lane so he doesnt farm what usually requires me to expose myself to zone him and enemy jungler is even more than likely to camp Nasus vs Viktor lane.Honorable mention Nautilus he is not a bad matchup per se but very annoying. He somehow dissappeared recently so maybe after the nerfs he is less of a annoyance.,viktormains,d3kanqn,1,t5_378p4

8300609,0,t3_4t7a7b,So ElSkytzo went over the hextech upgrades really well so I wont bother to address that. I personally would say he CAN be strong pre . I capitalize the can because this is incredibly dependent on who you are facing mid lane and who their jungler is. Viktor is a very immobile mage and as such is very weak to high mobile champions. To sum this part upIf you are facing a mid laner that is melee and has no immediate gap closers pre Diana and are facing a jungler that doesnt have gap closers then Viktor can be strong pre  with q aa e combo.However besides that for the most part I would play him carefully pre . Viktor now scales incredibly well into the late game so I would just focus on farming since you are just starting off on him. When it comes to champions not to pick him against my main answers for the mid lane are Zed Leblanc Fizz.Another thing to remember is that as a beginning immobile mage I would make sure you are very cautious into picking Viktor against a Zac or Elise jungler. They can and will make your life a living hell due to how easily they can catch you out in lane. If I plan on playing midlane I almost always make sure to try and get one of those two banned in all of my ranked games.Like I said earlier he now scales EXTREMELY well into the late game. At full build you can easily q aa half or all of a squishys health especially if you have decided to build lichbane.As a quick tip to close if you plan on starting a fight ult first. Yes it does alot of damage on the initial burst. However most beginning Viktors dont understand that the ticks of his ultimate that follow the burst do much damage than the initial burst.Hope this helps and tell me if you have any questions .,viktormains,d5f4u1g,1,t5_378p4

9494803,0,t3_5age0w,Stay behind minions when tagged with his passive to dodge the Q stun bait out the pillar and if you successfully dodge it go on the offensive. If he tries to combo you a well placed gravity field can stun him because of his cast times.Get boots early if you can its a lot easier to lane against him if you can side step his pillar. ,viktormains,d9jfraq,1,t5_378p4
9562852,0,t1_d9qhn5r,gt Also keep in mind that their standard of play is much higher than your average solo queue joe this includes their costbenefit analysis and decision makingThis is very important. I watched one Apdo video and he got blue buff at minute  what completely changes the flow of early laning it wont happen on our level. People are more respectful of each another and know when they can play aggressive due to them knowing enemy junglers position and enemy cooldowns. I dont even think theres a point of watching those VODs there are things that are useful to pick up like not being afraid to recall early for Doranbootspotions but majority of whats important isnt seen in the gameplay it would have to have a live commentary explaining all the thought process of the player.,viktormains,d9rtfoq,4,t5_378p4

9764073,0,t3_5et4ak,I feel like vik has been double merged which people dont play him seem to miss. The changes to his ult and e were largely down to their unrivaled synergy with rylais.

9966522,0,t1_dayrwew,Basically Rylais is good for peelingkiting tanks like you said but the nerf also is allowing other build options.To me it seems like Ludens would be a good alternative since it offers more burstdamage potential.,viktormains,db6nwvd,1,t5_378p4
10008629,0,t1_dbc303y,No offence but thats absolute trash logic with no evidence to back it up. Youd have realised by now that nobody maxes Q because its early scaling outright sucks dick without AP while his E has far better base scaling which means its much more efficient to max E. Looking from past patch notes youd be able to see how shit Viktor was when his E was nerfed to only clearing full waves at level . Second although I dont want to use my rank as an act of arrogance I dont know where youd possibly get the chance to be able to QAA often without  being punished at least in Diamond enough to warrant maxing Q as even if the DPS is higher which its not youll barely be able to even make use of it unlike the laser which has quite the range and variability to hit it.Also Viktor is designed to be a waveclear champion. I dont know where you heard he isnt but clearing full waves at level  is one of the earliest if not the earliest you can get. His laser is a literal straight line if thats not a design perk then I dont know what is and secondly you do realise how fatal giving up wave control like that? Every wave youre going to give up wave and let them hit it first which means they get to roam free Im not sure how effective roaming is at your level but it puts a shit ton of pressure on your side lanes even if they know theyre coming so just dont please it might work where you are but that doesnt make it the right playstyle.,viktormains,dbc5ipm,3,t5_378p4

10079742,0,t3_5k4c8j,Use your q to help last hit. If there are  minions that are low use the first part on one and the auto on another. You can also use q to quickly burst down cannons.Under tower you will always want to auto attack the caster minions once before the tower hits and then auto again after the tower shot. For melee minions let the tower hit them twice then auto. At low levels you might have to auto an additional time as well.You can one shot the back line at level  with the augment then clean up the melee minions with autos and Qs. It takes a while for you to be able to one shot a whole wave with one E so dont try to do it too early.A lot of CSing in general is just practice. Keep doing it and you can estimate just how many autos it will take to kill minions.,viktormains,dblesu4,2,t5_378p4

10426587,0,t1_dcpeqzz,Lich Bane is off base AD so you only add  damage to your lich bane empowered autos.  That is something but not a lot.The active is interesting though.  I think theres a decent argument it is better than the Ludens Echo passive much higher burst slightly lower sustained DPS depending on how fast echo passive charges.The real issue I have with Gunblsde theoretically is build order.  Im a bit skeptical it makes sense to build gunblade before Lich Bane because lich and perfect core have so much synergy in mid game team fights.  I think gunblade does less for you than void or DCap while being roughly the same price so thats another problem.Not sure how to think about the sustain by the time you get to hex  and gunblade laning phase is almost over.  It is possible the sustain is enough to matter in team fights but I usually find that if I die in team fights its because I get burst down by something.All of that said its an interesting item I just think that like Morellos it is a great laning item that you end up buying too late to get full value from due to your hexcore.,viktormains,dcpx7qc,1,t5_378p4
10455498,0,t3_5p2g3u,Yes ult disappears when you die. Noticed it right as I started playing again around two weeks ago. Didnt happen a few months ago.

10519853,0,t3_5qmow8,gt So after that wall of a text my question would be first of all does someone understand my problem? aand the other question can someone help me with that problem somehow?Yes I kind of understand you. What you probably want to do is casting E while moving but NOT always in a straight line! Viktors laser can be started at any point in his range and then aimed in the direction you want to fire it. Make use of this by not always starting it at the closest point to the enemy and then firing it in a straight line to him. Diagonal is already a bit harder to predict. Also if you can last hit like  minions with E and hit the opponent this is harder to predict since he thinks you will just go for the cs.gt Another question i have is about the buildpath some ppl say rylies sucks now on viktor some ppl its still viable and a decent item for him.. I tend to go for lich bane after my first upgrade or in between upgrading the rest depends on how the lane goesmatchupgold income..but yeah my first item beside the upgrades is LichbaneSo yes rylais got changed and it is not as core as before. However this doesnt mean that you dont want to buy it! I never get it as nd item anymore but more like th item. Its still very usefull to kite with if you have enough cdr! Lich Bane rush is for me the goto aswell it gives you a very powerful powerspike.gt But then i never know wich boots are better on viktor the mpen boots or the cdr boots?if my team is heavy ap mpen boots are better either way haha but what other coreitems does viktor have currently?CDR boots if you need a lot of speel rotations mostly against tanks Sorcboots against squishy teams I take them a lot nowadays! Sorcs  lich bane is very strong! The core items are now Lich Bane Void Staff and Deathcap. You want to have these in almost every build ofcourse you wont have time to get dcap since you already won  Hope this helps and GL!,viktormains,dd0jezu,1,t5_378p4
