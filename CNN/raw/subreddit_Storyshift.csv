7033237,0,t1_d1de67b,Oh will that be a mystery each time?It seems like throughout multiple shifts itll eventually become easy to figure out Flowey through process of elimination.I wonder if any of the other characters will be tricky to figure out even after seeing them? Perhaps one shift could have its version of Undyne covered in armour to obscure who it is...or another shift could have a familiar Mettaton robot body but with a different soul placed in it.,Storyshift,d1dkmda,8,t5_3bsgn

7514942,0,t1_d2wdui9,Yeah I went on some key differences from the neutral ending of the original Undertale and how I pictured a storyshift neutral ending would be. First off Toriel and Asgore have a different relationship than Sans and Papyrus do. Toriel in the neutral ending of the original Undertale does not seem like she cares very much that Asgore is dead. So her being strong and ruling the underground as Queen works out very well. I made it so that Papyrus is so upset he cant bring himself to do anything. Him and Sans do not have the tarnished relationship Asgore and Toriel have. Secondly Toriel. Toriel has a stronger connection with Frisk than Undyne does. So as Undyne would miss Asgore and be upset over his death Toriel wouldnt be so upset over Sanss death. She would be more upset over Frisk being gone. So her motherly instincts would kick in as she is telling Frisk how much she misses him.Third it is more likely Asgore could get on the phone than Alphys. Two different personalities. Alphys is shy and she has a low self esteem. Asgore seems more confident. Also the relationship between Alphys and Undyne is more positive in the neutral ending of Undertale than I could imagine Toriel and Asgores relationship would be at the end of storyshift. Lastly Asriel at the end of the date seems more in love and connected to Frisk than Papyrus did at the end of his date in the original Undertale. So it is entirely plausible that Asriel would be more upset getting on the phone and talking to a disappearing Frisk than Papyrus would be. So yeah Asriel could easily be left out of the conversation in this ending.Also the nice twist of the souls making their way back to their bodies I felt would be kind of cool. I mean after all if some other things can be shifted around why not that?So that is my whole reasoning for the ending being the way it is. Not sure how Voltra plans to do it but anyway I hope she decides to keep in mind the relationships between the characters when she does make the neutral ending. ,Storyshift,d2wetmm,4,t5_3bsgn

7708551,0,t1_d3id6ac,You can go ahead. I did read through some of that document and while its alright I have a few critiques.Why is Napstablook so confident? He normally speaks like hes always kind of tired and he seems uncomfortable talking to people. I think his demeanor should be much more similar to how he is in the regular game.hi... my names napstablook... i watch out for humans in case they wander through... hmm... uh my cousin mettaton is probably about to show up soon... here you can hide behind the lamp i guess... or dont... its up to you...by the way uh... mettaton really wants to see a human... can you make him happy by playing along with his puzzles? i doubt hed actually hurt you...Also why does Napstablook refer to Mettaton as a she? Mettatons a guy. a flamboyant guy yes but hes still a guy.,Storyshift,d3iesno,1,t5_3bsgn
