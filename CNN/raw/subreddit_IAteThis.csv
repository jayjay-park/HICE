2419439,0,t1_cmalflg,Its....awesome.Fried egg. Not scrambled. The fried whites add an extra delicious texture and flavor and then when you get to the yolk if its more over easyish as it should be it adds great moisture to the burger when you bite into it.Its fantastic. I think the best burger Ive ever had was a Breakfast Burger. Meat cheese fried egg bacon and hashbrowns.Ridiculous? Absolutely. Worth the heart attack? Without a doubt.,IAteThis,cmar2jq,6,t5_30brj
