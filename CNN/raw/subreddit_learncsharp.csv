If your text editor has content along the lines ofltp fontArialgtMy textltpgtthen setting the font of the control wont change that. What are you trying to do? Is this an assignment? It is pretty unusual to write your own rich text edit  this is a solved problem  can you just get one from nuget or something?,learncsharp,d7jbvyv,1,t5_2s0xo
9722915,0,t1_daay7v2,Thats right  clean code has good information locality and clear context. In your example with i as a global if you saw the line    var j  iIn isolation is this the globalmodulestatic i or a local variable called i? You could probably figure it out if you hunted around and traced it back but by the time you found it you would have forgotten what you were trying to solve. Also are you sure that the author of this line understood if the local or global i would be used? Perhaps when they wrote the line only the global i existed  someone else added a local i for a different reason and didnt realize it would totally change the behavior of the method.,learncsharp,dabk81z,1,t5_2s0xo
