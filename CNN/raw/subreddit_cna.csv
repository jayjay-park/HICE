3869067,0,t3_2whwhm,Theres some information missing in your post. Is your program in TX? Are you only going to be working as a CNA in TX? You shouldnt need anything from TX as long as your CNA program is approved by the CNA regulating board in TX and you pass the exam. If you want to work in other state after youre CNA licensed by TX you can apply to another states BON via reciprocity.,cna,cqxb2hh,1,t5_2shfy
8840565,0,t1_d79915w,So far things are going well from what people are telling me. Yesterday was my first day flying solo. I have some concerns regarding   of residents per CNA especially since ive never done this work before but everyone seems to team up to keep the gaps filled. Never thought id be doing this kind of work coming from skilled labor. Im working in a multiskilled facility doing both Long term care and short term rehab. the residents in short term are more lucid which makes pericare seem strange but hey everyone needs help sometimes. Once i get my time management under control i think Ill be topnotch. Thank you for following up!,cna,d7aie48,1,t5_2shfy
