2193281,0,t1_clikjw0,Watch some pc footage. Pretty well made a bit repetitive. Swordplay is great. Lots of upgrades takes at least  playtroughs to get all. The story gets more serious even emotional towards the end. Devs are pretty cool too.,shadowwarrior,climbzc,4,t5_2xp24

9294151,0,t1_d8u2y0u,Its not really the demon world is it?  Didnt Mezu or one of the main chars say it was antireality?  If it merged in everyone would exist and notexist in a pointless limbo?I think they got real lazy on the end unfortunately!,shadowwarrior,d8u3m2z,2,t5_2xp24
9299518,0,t1_d8tt1v4,If u like it but the game with those sets diablo  combat is great just it nothing more build diversity is too small imo,shadowwarrior,d8us3xa,0,t5_2xp24

9342103,0,t1_d8zth9f,Toxic is a DoTcorpse explosion upon death happens with any weapon type. Fire and Cold are selfexplanatory. Lightning is a bit weird but yeah it seems like its a sort of snareDoT.,shadowwarrior,d906g14,3,t5_2xp24
9355079,0,t1_d91ioma,True. Then again its SP and co op so theres not much reason to nerf things too much,shadowwarrior,d91tnmu,1,t5_2xp24
9355643,0,t1_d91m3eq,While Im not really sure it seemed like proc chances were based off of fire rate or damage or some such as the slow firing weapons like the bow will proc nearly every hit.  My frost bow chills  on hit and freezes over half the time despite not having nearly that much freeze chance.,shadowwarrior,d91w8kn,1,t5_2xp24

9373453,0,t3_57syot,First time using imgur so I hope I dont fuck it up.Sorry that the Statue isnt in the image anymore. First time I had this particular layout of Calamity Town. It was in the Cookery Mission.It was actually very easy to find so Im surprised I didnt see it on here. If you find the Shade dealer in an alley as opposed to in front of a tower you should be on the right map. Not sure.,shadowwarrior,d945gwo,2,t5_2xp24

9985999,0,t3_5ijg4o,Devs please consider a performance pass with the new weather! The Insanity patch brought fights to a new level so particles are taking their toll.Not sure if settings properly reduce them either.,shadowwarrior,db97cff,2,t5_2xp24
10013774,0,t1_dbcpfk8,The chainsword is much better than the chainsaws as it can use special attacks. This is notable in the case of Force Slash as it inherits the chain weapon ability to dig into an opponent and hit them multiple times. Against large thick enemies that take a while to travel through the Force Slash can do a ton of damage. In melee that same ability can be a liability in my opinion as you dont move as much and are an easier target.,shadowwarrior,dbctnnq,2,t5_2xp24

10116273,0,t3_5ko6zx,I tried to use elemental vulnerability with physical weapons and it seems that you cant turn bosses immunity into resistance and they stay immune no matter what. Not with level  gems at least.,shadowwarrior,dbq5pgr,1,t5_2xp24
