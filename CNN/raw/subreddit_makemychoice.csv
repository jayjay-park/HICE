550325,0,t3_20fowu,Im not going to go on with my life story but I can definitely relate in many ways. Im  Im in school for a major Im not really passionate about. Ive switched majors more than once. And Im definitely dealing with depression and anxiety issues amongst other things.Id strongly suggest making a change. Ive found that trying new things makes me happy. Im currently working at a job that isnt particularly amazing but Ive decided to put the engineering major on hold because it was just stressing me out and causing me anxiety. Ive been much happier since Ive decided to step back and make a change. Even if this job doesnt help me change the world or whatever at least Im staying busy enough to stop being crazy and stressing about my future and such. I guess my point is theres nothing wrong with changing directions a few times in life. Ive bailed on  majors not counting the engineering one and the only thing Ive been motivated to do well in is work. Im starting to be happier. I dunno Im still in the middle of a similar situation but Ive felt good about all the new things Ive tried so Id suggest that.Nobody is ever on their plan A.

I ended up leaving to work with  people I knew from the industry. Im not making more money yet we all share profits if the project makes it big but I love where I am. I feel like I have more creative control my ideas mean something to my coworkers and I wear a ridiculous amount of hats. No day is boring. That being said maybe if you are fresh out of school it would be good for you to experience the soulsucking nature of a big corperation experience the tedious office politics seriously fuck that watch people that are WAY less qualified and have less experience and perform shittier than you get the promotions because you are too valuable in your position. Then you can fully appreciate moving to a smaller company.Im not sure your situation though. What means more to you? possibly advancing your career farther in the long run by sucking off some asshole? Making possible connections with coworkers that you can use in the future once you guys get some experience and one of you has an idea?

1082853,0,t3_23941v,I saw your post over at rUCSantaBarbara and I clicked your profile to see if you had any more info. Heres my advice on choosing schools. First off ask yourself why you really want to come out to IV? Is it the partying the beach the guysgirls? I admit that all of those factors played a role in where I decided to go to school but the biggest factors to me were money location and prestige. Im only a first year but Ive met a ton transfer students from local CCs who saved a FUCK TON of money by staying at home for  years working at home and then coming to the University where their degree means the exact same thing that mine will. And who knows? If you went to a CC you might end up finding out you can and want to go somewhere more prestigious such as UCLA or Berkeley. Also IV has had a ton of problems this year that we are struggling to cope with and these are issues that can be emotionally draining on someone whos completely on their own. I dont want to discourage you but just this year we had the Gang Rape incidents the Deltopia Riots and the most recent tragedy. While the last incident is purely random it does highlight the emotional hurdles one can experience when living on your own. Of course dont let those things discourage you. Isla Vista is an amazing community of diverse people who know how to work and play hard. Its seriously one of the greatest places I could have asked for. Idk about what the CC offers but the UC offers a ton of resources to help make students transition into living on their own easy. Im sure they have something similar.In my opinion attending a CC back home will be  worth it financially. Living in IV youre going to have to get a job that youll have to balance with school. Rent and the cost of living in IV is extremely high between  to share a room and then youll also have to commute down to the city college. Idk if youll be driving but that gas adds up quickly. Luckily UC and CC students have a free bus pass but Ive heard that the commute can really take up a lot of time if your bus gets stuck in traffic.All in all I think youre the only person who can make the decision. Look at it from all angles especially financially and dont let the recent events deter you from this beautiful community.,makemychoice,chrdfow,1,t5_2v0m0

1088264,0,t1_chrxds3,the frees are good shoes but they are def not for everyone. Basically they lowered the heel and made a more flexible sole so it feels barefoot like while given dece cushion. However the pegasus is a more traditional shoe with a  drop from heel to toe versus  in the frees with a more restrictive sole. Basically if you have any sort of stability issues you need something closer to a pegasus or the air series. Only people with near perfect gaits can run long distances with the frees comfortbly unfortunately. But sweet shoes nonetheless. ,makemychoice,chrzlc6,2,t5_2v0m0

They just move around to different bars as they get older to match their own personality and clientele and usually make way more than someone working retail. But its still physically pretty demanding limited upward mobility typically and your hours are always weird. In your retail job look around and ask yourself if you want to be in management there or somewhere similar in  or more years. Cause thats what your background is going to be in and these days its all about what you have skills and connections in. Last piece of advice never quit a job till you have your new job.

The game is incredible but itd be alot better if the bills are off your mind while you play it. If youre going to play it then Id always recommend playing with a few friends even just  players will make the game so much more fun. I played through it with  others and we had alot of fun running around and smashing zombies heads in which believe me when I say its extremely satisfying. Basically just one of those games you shouldnt take seriously grab some friends and have a laugh with.Either way final suggestion is to get the game after paying that bill.

I finished my bottle of wine and went to a bar next to the one we were meeting at and spoke to a girlfriend I hadnt seen in a while didnt know she was there. It was pretty nice.  she texts me that she is in front of the bar I wait a couple of minutes then I text her Im on my way. My attitude was negative at this point.I go to meet her we hug and start talking shes very apologetic she said she saw some friends unexpectedly that she hadnt seen in  years when she was studying abroad. She asked me why i didnt spam message her jokingly as she said she would have done that if she had been the one waiting. She said she thought I had met up with friends since I only texted her once asking when she was coming which I thought was stupid because she could have messaged me earlier. I make fun of her for this a bunch of times during the night everything goes very well we have a great time share a pitcher of beer at the bar then head to the party! We danced we talked and had a blast. Walked her home and we made out and talked for another solid hour in front of her place. Then I took a taxi coupon and got a free ride home well to my friends apartment he lives close by. She teased me that I wasnt going to come up and use the condom we got tonight lol so I accepted that and it was still fun I said i wasnt into rushing things. She teased me saying that I must be distraught about that haha but all in all it didnt bother me because if she mentioned it it might mean that eventually it will happen you know? All in all fun date! so just wait for your date but find something to do in the meantime. Or also you know dont be late to dates cause it sucks. I invited her out tonight to a bar with some friends she might be tired so well see I have yet to text her to ask her if she wants to go or too tired from yesterday. We spoke about this last night and playing tennis our first date again where i destroyed her haha on saturday. so I assume there is a continuation in the making!,makemychoice,cv5z7m2,1,t5_2v0m0

Theyll help pay for your college and I think itll help you develop character more so than the average freshman gets. This is conditional on you being ok with a military lifestyle but you may have more information if what that entails than I. EDIT as for whether you should enter national guard or the reserves Id research the work associated with each and make your decision then.EDIT  A big benefit of joining the military first is that youll get a better sense of what you want to do with your life. A lot of college students end up changing their majors because they dont really have as solid of an idea of what they want to do for a career as they think they do.

8735390,0,t3_4zoydd,The only thing Durham has going for it is that its a highup university somewhere abroad that you like. Apart from that you seem to have absolutely no other pros to it. I mean youd be studying a subject you dont even want to study which sounds like a oneway trip to dropping out or doing badly. As an employer I can tell you Id prefer an employee that did well at university rather than one that went to a prestigious university. Although Im sure thats not the case with every potential employer youll have but thats how Ive always approached it.Also as a Briton I find a lot of people romanticise our little island. Much like we do with foreign locales as well I guess. Im not saying youre doing the same but I think you should set yourself up for disappointment if you do come over here to live for three years.,makemychoice,d6xkklq,7,t5_2v0m0

What youre saying makes sense in that it could be limiting may go to America and Australia first  then get a van and build it up in the uk and go to europe middle east and asia. I reckon I could build a van to live in for around  incl buying the van! Ive been looking into it for a long time and have seen how much my brother has been spending on his truck. As for an income Ive been doing some online work recently which brings in some money.  Also considering busking with a guitar.  Thanks for your advice about the van being limiting certainly food for thought.. ,makemychoice,d7rlzdo,2,t5_2v0m0

Reflect on what the problems are and come up with a few different solutions for them. Its not going to be easy. The waiting that is. Its going to feel very hard but if you both care for each other and want it to work you will both find a way. Take this time to really work on yourself. Just focus on you and push her feelings out of you. Think on the problems and yourself and when the time is right for you two to talk again you will be completely prepared.

9876005,0,t1_dauutkd,Eh I have stayed away from the reviews but there are things that I could see being problamatic for people.  Its a weird game.  Like a mashup of classic americana and over the top anime.  I really enjoy it though and am not even at the halfway point with almost  hours played so you can get some time out of it But I do all the side quests.  In the end as mechanically good as the FF games can be as a fan that is not the deciding factor.  If youre looking for a beautifully scored  beautiful looking rpg with good characters in a mutedbackground story thats pretty unique all things considered FF still the way to go.  If you liked WD  or if you have played a Ubisoft game you should know what youre getting into with WD .

10660508,0,t3_5se998,It sounds like youre leaning towards French so do that. This for your own personal enrichment so do what you want to do! For what its worth I took French for  years in middle  high school. In college I took Spanish instead and Ive found Spanish to be much more useful. I initially chose French over Spanish in middle school because it sounded pretty and I am glad still very glad that I took it. If I hadnt I think I may have resented though thats too harsh of a word taking Spanish for the sole purpose of it being more practical. Having taken French made learning Spanish easier understanding how to conjugate verbs in different tenses etc. and I was even able to practice some French when I went to Montreal on a ski trip in college.I am personally going the Spanish route because I have encountered and will encounter loads more Spanish speakers i.e. working in restaurants and now studying medicine in an area with a huge Hispanic population. I will actually be traveling to Colombia this summer and taking Spanish classes there!You seem to be drawn to French but have reservations as Spanish could perhaps seem more practical it is the second most commonly spoken language in the US after all. As someone who was lucky enough to study both I think learning French first and on a whimI  just went with my gut helped me learn Spanish more easily and also embrace its ubiquity in my own life.,makemychoice,ddfjtmc,2,t5_2v0m0
