6360113,0,t3_42qckz,I frequently got up to  in rumble then switched to control and knocked it out in the first match.IMO playing with the slower higher impact handcannons is really one of the best ways to get better at pvp in general. It forces you to understand your gun better as well as try to do more than spam bullets. After a week with Imprecation my kd in pvp has gone from the occasional  to that being the norm.

6599259,0,t3_462cct,Ive been through a few grueling raids with PUGs lately and I want to share my tactic to complete totems with minimal wipes. This is helpful whether you are a group of seasoned vets or are carrying a couple of kinders.At the start have one rep from either side stay mid to kill the initial acolytes. Then everyone needs to pretend like the totem is their only safe place in the world. When you have to go to the middle you have two roles deposit the power into the floor glyph and kill the wizard on the ledge. Thats it. Do not stay up there any longer to kill ads. Dont wait up there shooting ads for the next person to get the power to head your way. Get back to the totem. Its counter productive to stay up there and can lead to miscommunication and poor timing for the other two still at the totem. The timers seem to be slightly staggered so you should already be at least halfway back to the totem before the boomer comes out of the door up top. Bite chew swallow repeat.I feel like the old adage of group fire gets thrown out the window at this point in the raid. Thoughts? Questions? Counterpoints?,LowSodiumDestiny,d01x11z,1,t5_3c0tx

A CB Doctrine can definitely fuck shit up although I rarely saw them except occasionally in my own hands because of the sheer prevalence of MIDA. Not sure why a Harrowed anything would be a problem except maybe a Yasmin if they dont have a better sniper.

6781845,0,t1_d0kzlp4,Well not Target. We can assume that if we all become real life Guardians well likely establish a real life Vanguard and Consensus within our own established tower. Your role within it would be a long the lines of what you do in real life now. I also work security...more so protective services a bit more proactive and hands on then retail security Glorified bodyguard. So naturally that would put me in a similar role within the Vanguard. Defense of the exterior. Youd from your stance youd be in defense of the interior. If say...someone like my brother who is logistics...hed be in tower intelligence which makes sense since hes a Hunter. But if youre a cook in real life your Guardian would be some form of cook. We DO still need to eat. Think of it in that context as far as what youd do as a Guardian when not patrolling the cosmos. ,LowSodiumDestiny,d0l09pm,2,t5_3c0tx
