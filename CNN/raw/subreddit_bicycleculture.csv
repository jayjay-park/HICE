8871279,0,t3_51m4f1,this article was a pretty decent read. I weigh the risks of whether or not its worth it to get out there every day.The day where drivers actually take operating an enormous vehicle seriously and view it as a privilege are so far in the distant future its frustrating. Couple that with the exponential increase in distracted driving due to the advent of smartphones and general vitriol a cyclist gets just for existing...a bitter pill indeed. I tell people to put their damn phone down at least once every ride. Is it my place to do? Probably not but whatever their banal snapchat bullshit will be there when they get to their destination.NHL comes out on Tuesday who else is pumped?rant,bicycleculture,d7e7b47,2,t5_2sk47

10140050,0,t3_5l5ihg,Its gotten to the point that if a friend asks me for a decent priced bike for getting around town I send them to the Decathlon store. Its a big box sports equipment store with  ownbrand stuff. They have a ton of decent citystyle bikes and most importantly zero condescension from the staff. They also have very decent warranties on all their bikes no fucking around with manufacturers and the onsite service is quick often able to do repairs while you wait.,bicycleculture,dbt942d,1,t5_2sk47
