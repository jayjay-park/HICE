6641715,0,t1_d05rec1,Ive never gotten the impression that he was from a wealthy elitist background but I do think that he was raised in the middle class. When he was scoping out the neighborhood during the day he HAD to have been seen by people but he would have looked like he fit in with the middle class neighborhoods he targeted so as not to arouse suspicion. ,EARONS,d06b7a3,8,t5_3cfj2
6754381,0,t1_d0hxefz,A user on the old AE TV boards used the name EAR after the ONS program aired on Cold Case Files but before it was public knowledge that the EAR  ONS. So its eerie that this connection was made before the information was released to the public.Additionally no posts were ever made from this account but another user sent a PM to this account many years later and it was openedlooked at on the anniversary of Janelle Cruzs murder.,EARONS,d0hyk7d,12,t5_3cfj2
6852984,0,t1_d0t31ay,Right yeah I am not really trying to bust your balls.  I am skeptical I will say.  But the recorded phone calls was more curiosity than anything else when I first asked about them.  If they were obtained illegally they will not be allowed in court anyway.  I was just hoping they were obtained by warrant and that you were given access as the investigation required it.I do realize criminals tend to take the law into their own hands.  EARONS in particular was strongly believed to have been at one neighborhood watch meeting and to have later specifically targeted one especially vocal attendee and his wife for his usual bondage and rape routine.  He was all those years ago about as dangerous as these troublemakers get short of killing people which he did later get into.  If you really have the right guy he must have mellowed out some.,EARONS,d0t3e7z,1,t5_3cfj2
6949723,0,t1_d13zjoa,Yeah I couldnt agree more with what youve said. Absolutely. gtStill I suspect theres other crimes out there which havent yet been linked. I mean it took DNA to link the southern murders with the northern rapes.Still his southern crimes were very strongly believed to be linked by various Sacramento investigators long before DNA proved it. This guy had a lot of distinctive and consistent elements wherever he went which is interesting in and of itself. ,EARONS,d142zwl,3,t5_3cfj2

7497893,0,t3_4hswv4,Honestly I think this is the simplest and most complex question to answer. He started raping because it was in the next step of his progression. EAR was about fear and terror. He clearly had a problem with women and Im sure he long fantasized about hurting women beginning with peeping and progressing from there. In Sudden Terror I believe Crompton states that a more recent study points to sexual predators with similar profiles begin first as voyeurs before moving to rape. In general I think it is as simple as that rape was the next step.Now what caused this behavior is clearly much more complex. Clearly it has to do with deep emotional issues and likely a family history of trauma. Im no psychiatrist but thats often how these things can begin. He clearly had some form of psychopathy but where does it stem from? For Gary Ridgeway it was likely a response to his overbearing mother who sexually molested him for years that grew his deep hatred for women. Could this be the case for EAR? I think he grew up in a chaotic family where he had little control. As a response he took control in his attacks all the way down to seemingly rehearsed lines. Why someone begins to rape however is really difficult other than saying that he had a deep psychology that drove him to commit increasingly brazen attacks that ended in murder.By your statement you seem to separate the fact that he started killing with his raping. I see no reason to delineate. I think he started killing because it was the next step and the thrill of rape was starting to wane. Honestly I think thats why he stopped killing as well.,EARONS,d2ugzmn,2,t5_3cfj2
7703424,0,t1_d3hanjm,This is interesting but Im curious too. What are you getting at here?,EARONS,d3httgu,1,t5_3cfj2
7970882,0,t1_d4bdwhy,This is true even though I think that assault was a little telling since it was one of the early ones.  I think his overall profile resembles that of a military person. Maybe even a forward infantry unit in late Vietnam. Do you know if the police ever pursued that angle? ,EARONS,d4c03n5,5,t5_3cfj2
8056840,0,t1_d4lkid6,It was  or ... I cant remember exactly but thinking it was . I have more info on this guy and some of his movements before and after. I was specifically told her was a murderer. I semi jokingly said something to the effect of take care of this I dont want to be sleeping next to the shotguns to which the cop deadpanned and stared right at me and told me that was actually a great idea husband was out of state so I was home alone with my young kids.Edit to add I have a NH cold case I would love to see some interest and its a major rabbit hole. The main suspect nearly a decade later taunts LE and State officials and posts all over the internet in multiple logins. Its creepy as hell. ,EARONS,d4lnxwc,1,t5_3cfj2

8684175,0,t3_4ywh1t,I think military ties are suspected mostly because of his MO reconnaissance tactics and the way he controlled the scene but I dont know of any physical evidence that suggests military. Some other things that suggest military could be proficiency with firearms involvement in the Maggiore murders periods on inactivity and his mentioning of the officers club during one of the attacks but this is all pretty much speculation I think. ,EARONS,d6r5bq8,9,t5_3cfj2

9915243,0,t1_dazyjab,My brain is like a weird sponge. Its probably why I like the GSK case so much because there are plenty of little details and for some reason they just stick in my brain. And I get curious about everything. I have no answer for why this stuff gets stuck in my head. Why do I know that  different species of bacteria that were never seen before were discovered in peoples belly buttons two years ago? Because its gross and fascinating? Yes.

11128816,0,t3_5ydig6,He hit more areas than a mailman would work. Look on a map of California. He might have worked at a postal depository for a region. He definitely had bucks though. It costs a lot to have such a wardrobe of shoes hoods flashlights weapons. Then one would have to be able to hide these things. If he worked he probably started a shift in the afternoon giving him time to sleep after the rapes. ,EARONS,detfwq3,3,t5_3cfj2

11621060,0,t1_dgawlgz,Go back and look at age estimates in victims statements. This is well within the range.Then go look at Rogue River RD above attack number . It fits into the attack clusters like a puzzle piece. Attack  is within a clear buffer zone between two clusters it was a drug robbery. Here  is a map. He committed a home intrusion rape has good resemblance to identikits lives along a river long suspected to be utilised in two EARONS attack clusters.,EARONS,dgd9as0,1,t5_3cfj2

11800262,0,t3_68bo68,Could he still be untraceable? Sure why not? There are still unsolved serial killer cases abductions and petty crimes. Some have been captured on surveillance cameras and sometimes DNA has been collected yet unfortunately some of those cases are still unsolved. This includes cell phone usage tracking the ping etc.Think about the guy that was on the news the other day for Facebook live streaming his murder spree. Thankfully he ... well killed himself but it took a few days for that to happen.I think if EARONS was still active today he may be if he changed his MO that would possibly mean a few things. For one hes a lot older now so with being older he will become more mature. Now I know how that sounds but its the truth. As people get older they have to learn new things in life for example when a child first moves out of their parents home they realize how difficult it is to pay your own bills and get groceries etc etc. That ultimately builds a level of knowledge due to experience. Additionally EARONS is probably very aware about DNA and he knows that he left plenty at his crime scenes. Id imagine he would be very careful today.One thing to keep in mind about EARONS is that despite his extensive list of crimes in a short period  years but the bulk of his crimes happened in five years he was also patient. His stalking would go on for a few weeks or a month hell maybe even six months as proven by victim . I know Im kinda rambling on here but I believe he would be more cautious yet still very capable of stalking his victims without LEs knowledge. ,EARONS,dgxlmna,2,t5_3cfj2
