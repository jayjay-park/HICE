Id imagine it would take at least a year or two to get an mc off the ground. thats  when he met gemma minimum.  that means he would be  years older than gemma and if he were alive today he would be  which means gemma is .

1609307,0,t3_2cpl1p,This one gave me chills wall of text JAX I want to say thank you for making the ride. It means a lot to me to have a full table. Im certain you have questions and doubts. Thats what this meeting is for. I know every charter is independent. You run them as you want. But I also know the things we do in Redwood especially here in the Northwest impact your local relationships and affect the way you earn. Some of you knew my old man. Some just knew his legacy. Its no secret that he was conflicted at the end. Questioned every decision hed ever made. About the club. About his family. That fear that doubt... it ruined him. Made him vulnerable. Im here to tell you that Im not following that path. The choices that I make are not because Im afraid or because I have any doubts about this club. I watched my best friend get his head caved in to protect what we have here. Weve all watched brothers die in the service of this club. Theres two things you can do when that happens. You can run from the pain bail. Or you can allow it to burn into your heart... to leave its mark. A constant reminder of the love that brought us all here. Sons of Anarchy its at a crossroads. Our clubhouse blowing up last night thats a sign of the times. The end result of a bloody relationship with the IRA. Itd be easy for me to sit here and blame our mistakes on my predecessor but that wont solve shit. We dont need blame. What we need boys is change. I want us out of guns. The RICO heat the competition the Irish blowback. Its just not practical. Between the lawyers and repairing the damage we barely earn a profit.Im gonna move Redwood into more legitimate enterprises. Diosa its doing great. Were earning real money. Were gonna open another house in Stockton. Were going to reboot Caracara. Just found a warehouse down by the docks. So I guess its fair to say that SAMCROs future is in pussy not bullets. We struck a deal with the Irish. One that keeps the peace. But that transition means we all take a hit. Now I know everyone here has had a taste of the gun business whether its in protection storage or distribution. Its gonna sting at first letting go of that cash. But if we dont... Im telling you... this club wont have a future. Weve had members killed in the last two years. All of those deaths tied to the gun business. Outside of guns how you earn is up to you. But if you would like my charter will do everything it can to help you move in a legitimate direction. A direction that keeps us out of jail that keeps us whole and that keeps us alive.,Sonsofanarchy,cji0qx3,6,t5_2rbpl

1905644,0,t3_2gfxhj,I think Clay was absolutely as bad as most of us think he was. After seeing all the cutthroat things Clay did throughout the series it became clear to me at the end that his love for Gemma was the only reason he didnt kill Jax. Lets not forget that Clay murdered JT for extremely selfish reasons because JT wanted to get the club out of guns and take it in a more legit safer direction. Clays greed wouldnt allow that. I think one could even make the case that had he not killed JT the entire future of the club would have been completely different and probably minus a lot of the brutality jail time and deaths. And as for Clay caring for Jax like a son I didnt see that at all. He tried to have Jaxs wife and the mother of his kids killed so as not to expose the secret that he killed his father. And he killed Piney to cover it up too. Theres a laundry list of reason why Clay really is the bastard hes made out to be. He deserved the ending he got in my opinion. Speaking of his ending Jax had yet another opportunity to change course but he didnt take it. He didnt have to kill Clay. He could have showed mercy and been the bigger better man he always claimed he wanted to be but he didnt and I think that was the major turning point for Jax and the beginning of his rapid downward spiral. ,Sonsofanarchy,ckitgny,6,t5_2rbpl

2008262,0,t3_2hqwm0,Its all the shitty things Jax does.Some of the rhetoric on reddit about Walter White being evil and all of this stuff was really overblown. The worst thing he did was attempt to UNFATALLY poison a kid. I understand thats still a horrible thing to do but Jax broke a chicks nose just because Opie couldnt keep his dick in his pants. Hes a racist and a misogynist. He kills innocent people and tries to explain it away to his club. He put the burden of killing an innocent woman that HE wanted dead on someone else because he didnt want to bother with the guilt. His club can handle the truth though. Walts family definitely couldnt handle the truth as we found out. Walt kept his crimes away from his family because it was the best for them. Jax keeps shit from people because its the best for HIM.Walter really got himself into a deep deep hole when he got started in the meth business. Jax has been in and out of holes this whole show and actually enjoys the mayhem. He pulls peoples teeth out with his hands. A person like that should be hated.

2184582,0,t3_2k2ap0,Neros scene with Gemma in Greensleeves made me realize that he probably wont be lucky enough to make it out. This show has never been about a happy ending in my opinion. Of course the person who seems to have the most moral conviction or at least desire for it and who is this close to making it out will probably end up dead before he gets his chance. When Nero was standing in Diosa taking one final look around after he told Alvarez his exit strategy all I could think was damn I bet a big part of him wishes he never met Gemma. She really does have that whole kiss of death thing going on. Poor Nero still thinks its SAMCRO and Charming that are the problems but its due in large part to Gemma too and he just hasnt realized that yet. Sons of Anarchy is an interesting show for me. I started out liking the club for the most part despite the violence and crime because it usually never seemed outright malicious or without outlaw reasoning. Season  I started to change my tune and this season I find myself legitimately hating the club. Im not invested at all anymore in the fate of SAMCRO. Theyve all become such vile weak vicious people that I have lost my capacity to feel sympathy for them since they jumped on Jaxs runaway train. Jax and Gemma in particular are truly two of the most petty manipulative vicious weak characters Ive ever seen on a tv show. They deserve evvverything thats coming to them. I just feel bad for the few decent characters remaining who might become collateral damage like Nero Chucky Wendy and the boys. This show will not have a happy ending. ,Sonsofanarchy,clhihtt,8,t5_2rbpl

I know he hasnt publicly said it but I just cant believe how much he pushed Abel to the forefront this season when hes more been a prop in prior years.

It happens so much where you see someone famous in a show and say oh theyre definitely the murderer because theyre famous why would they take a small role? That sutter purposely casted her in a small role to make people think she would play a larger part in the story. Same thing with michael chiklis. I thought when i first saw him that he was more than just a truck driver and that he was gonna somehow turn gemma over to the club. But in reality it was just a fan cameo with Sutter doing a throwback to the shield. Just because lea Michele is famous doesnt mean she has a larger role to play. ,Sonsofanarchy,cmlgkas,1,t5_2rbpl

I did a little research and read how the writer wanted the viewers to anticipate it which is pretty much think of something yourself I highly suggest doing some research and read other peoples takes on how it ended.

It went from everyone helping each other make money stay alive etc. to lets help Jax in the wildest way possible everytime someone hurts his feelings.

The boys would want to know the same the search would lead them to Charming and as a result SAMCRO.This ending is pretty cut and dried.

I would find this show boring as all hell if everyone was killed by one clean shot all the time because with how many people get shot and killed in this show you tend to forget how they died.

4788981,0,t1_ctxf1l1,I think youre totally right about the part where Chibs hands the gavel back to Jax that was definitely more in line with Chibs character than foreshadowingsymbolism. But what struck me as symbolic was how he paused holding the gavel standing at the head of the table before he walked away and returned it to Jax. I dont Sutter just happened to write that part without thinking about its meaning? unless someone else also holds the gavel during the show then Id agree that the whole thing is just a coincidence And since it appeared in S. I would think he had an idea of how he was going to end the show which may have played into it?,Sonsofanarchy,cty6ule,1,t5_2rbpl

10971364,0,t3_5wobgo,The writing in the final season takes a serious  it is heavily flawed and characters begin acting for the sake of the story instead of how we know they would.Case in point as you said Jax. He is a complete idiot in Season  despite being shown that he is extremely intelligent. How about Juice who wants nothing more than to get back in the club but doesnt think to tell Jax who the real murderer is of Tara? What? That is his best chance and he doesnt take it? Or what about Unser? He knows that Gemma had his truck that she believed Tara was gonna rat and he a former sheriff cant put two and two together?

11185520,0,t3_5z8gog,. Opie lived and died for the club. He volunteered because Jax had a wife and a son to live for not to mention he was the clubs future. Closure matured and so did that discussion If it didnt happen people would have bitched that there wasnt any closure.. Youre wrong. Jax really didnt have that much motivation up until then. It hadnt quite hit close to him yet enough to wake him upOpies death was a huge catalyst for the show and it impacted Jaxs character more than anything. It cemented the shows history and he went out a hero. Not much to miss with that.How anyone can say that it was forced or shoehorned is beyond me and those are two terms that people use simply because they didnt like something that happened on the show and its kinda lazy.
