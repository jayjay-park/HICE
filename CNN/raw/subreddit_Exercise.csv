1506416,0,t3_2akcrf,Personally I work at an orthopedics clinic and I see so many patients that suffer from bad lifestyle choices. If you can eat properly you are already one step ahead of majority of people in America. Great job.  These patients at our clinic are so out of shape and overweight that they begin to have heart problems bad arteries diabetes thyroid issues sleeping issues and tons of other things all associated with their sedimentary lifestyles. So do yourself a favor and start moving and move as often as you can. Some days you will feel the urge to go harder and faster while other days you are going to feel tired and shitty. You know this you can anticipate days where you are going to feel down. Push through pain and keep the blood flowing. You will feel good when a family member or friend says hey you look good have you been losing weight. It will feel glorious but a regimented schedule is what you need to make in order to get those compliments and changes you want with your body. Adding weight to your body is a lot more fun than taking it off. Ask friends if they will work out with you. Go on walks take the stairs even if it is eight floors!working out for thirty minutes a day is honestly not that hard. Even though fucking  around on reddit is fun I have to tell myself that thirty minutes working out is easy and reddit can wait.  Also I recommend doing both weight lifting and aerobic activities because you get a little more bang for your buck when you incorporate both not essential to do them on the same day just doing swimming running or cycling one day while going to a gym to weight lift another.. Hope this helps and best of luck I have faith in you. ,Exercise,cj53r7f,1,t5_2qjf3

9319773,0,t3_581hph,There is the lymphatic system which is constantly trying to clean up toxins and other various things which eventually gets back to the bloodstream and filtered by the liver. It can easily be slowed down as it relies on movement and muscle contraction exercise to move. When taking the class my teacher said one of his clients knows she needs a lymph session every time she feels her thighs touching together. Its not permanent but it is really beneficial to your entire system and also provide much more tone within the skin and makes your legs a little thinner. ,Exercise,d8xcl89,2,t5_2qjf3
