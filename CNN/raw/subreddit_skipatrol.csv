10614461,0,t1_dd9n6ju,If youre buying your own stuff the vest is probably the way to go.  Same price point as the soft shell but you can wear it over an appropriately colored black black or black personal hard shell soft shell or tshirt as the conditions merit.    Soft shell is totally fine over appropriate layers  of the time but if you get stuck on a rainy day or a cold windy day standing on race coverage you will want the hard shell.  Pro Vest keeps the chairlift grease and mustard stains off your personal layers.  Pro Vest means you never forget your pack in the top shack.  Con If your radio batteries are marginal in the cold having the radio on the outside of the vest is not as good as a chest pack.  Con If you like to carry a ton of stuff self evac rope you will have neck and shoulder pain if you wear the vest all day.,skipatrol,ddasv06,1,t5_2useq
