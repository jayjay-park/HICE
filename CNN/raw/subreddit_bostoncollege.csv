411258,0,t3_1yrsp7,I grew up in the nieghborhood in the late s. Its amazing how much the campus has changed since then and especially in the past decade.,bostoncollege,cfne5r8,3,t5_2s4l4

1331766,0,t3_29bzpd,I transferred to BC. The number one thing is community service as BC is pretty big on service to others. I also got into leadership positions in like five clubs my freshman year. When I applied the acceptance rate for the transfers was . Oh and I had a . GPA. ,bostoncollege,cijfv87,5,t5_2s4l4

4177729,0,t3_38m49q,Heavy drinking is much more common than smoking. I found throughout my  years that probably only  of BC students smoked on a regular basis. Which seems to me to be much less than most other schools. It really varies by social group though in some groups everyone smokes and in some no one smokes. Cocaine becomes more common for upperclassmen but still only within small groups. Other drugs like psychedelics and empathogens are much harder to find although they are out there if you really look for them. ,bostoncollege,crwgsgf,2,t5_2s4l4

6244542,0,t3_40986l,BC is pretty Catholic in terms of other Catholic schools Im familiar with like Georgetown Loyola Maryland etc. but not as Catholic as say Notre Dame.There are tons of volunteering and outreach groups that have religious affiliation and theres references to Catholicism everywhere. A lot of BCs policies reflect the CCC including the prohibition of premarital sex birth control etc. none of these things are even slightly enforced but theyre definitely in the student guidebook. If youre okay with not being able to get condoms in the health office its really not a problem. Some people try to raise hell over these policies.I know dozens of kids that attend mass at least once a week some go every day if they can.There are obviously tons of kids that arent Catholic or religious at all but a lot of the classes especially Theology and Philosophy make the assumption that you are fairly well versed in Abrahamic religion. Most of the nonCatholic kids in my Perspectives class when prompted by the professor at the end of year said the only thing they didnt like about the course is they felt that if you werent Catholic you were at a huge disadvantage.Sure youre going to fit in at BC. Nobody really cares if youre religious or not. It certainly wont affect you socially unless you go around being a militant atheist but it might make some of the core classes a bit harder unless youre a very religiously educated atheist.Personally I chose BC because I am very Catholic and had always gone to Catholic school and would not have ever considered it if I werent but thats just my two cents.Edit I just wanted to add that there is religious symbolism all over campus. There are more crucifixes than clocks in the classrooms. There are professors who will start class with prayers etc. Also the current administration is much more conservative than previous administrations. from what Ive heard from alums. Apparently BC used to be a huge party school in the s and s and there have been strong internal movements to be a lot more strict and a lot more religious in the past decade. For example the LGBT groups are trying to form a resource center on campus and theyre getting laughed at by the administration as the door slams shut behind them,bostoncollege,cyzfq6d,3,t5_2s4l4
10108828,0,t1_dboyvs7,The culture didnt fit me. BC is much friendlier and the people are more down to earth. The clubs are less competitive and youre not made to feel lesser if you dont do a million things at once. Theres the joke at GU that youre only doing enough when youre sleep deprived. That culture isnt healthy and I havent experienced anything like it at BC. For perspective two people on my freshmen floor of fifty ended up transferring out and an additional four had to take a semester off for mental health purposes I was incredibly unhappy stressed and anxiety ridden at Georgetown. Im getting the same quality education at BC but significantly happier. ,bostoncollege,dbp6w66,2,t5_2s4l4
