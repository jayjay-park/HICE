On this question it certainly helps you to plug in  for x and see what happens. If you do that you find that bc.

If you are solid in basic algebra and geometry skills you should be fine. I recommend just getting the SAT blue book. It has a ton of practice tests and you can get explanations for the correct answers online. Just keep doing tests see what you did wrong and you will OK. For the SAT a calculator is not mandatory but will be helpful.

4758182,0,t3_3fz4ku, First off dont start with a quote. Always start off the SAT essay by taking a clear stance. For example The idealistic approach trumps the practical approach... or something like that. I know you might normally start off an essay with a quote but the SAT is different. Also agree with previous poster. Your intro is too long and youre writing a school essay not an SAT essay.

6015353,0,t3_3xvdb7,i took every practice test available to me retook those practice tests and of course every time i missed a question i made sure i understood why i missed them. i didnt do time limits or anything like that i just solved and solved and thoroughly understood as many questions i could. but then again i never had a problem with finishing tests so if thats your problem area of course time yourself... but if its not i didnt find timing yourself necessary. oh and i also memorized the  barrons word list. not completely but id say ?soon you will be able to identify a problem type in a few seconds and will be much more efficient in solving certain types of questions. you know your weak spots so you know to look out for those question types when testing time comes around. for example i struggled with idiom questions in the writing section nonnative english speaker so whenever i was stuck on a question in the writing section id retry the problem with that problem type in mind. in the math section id read the question and already have an idea of what concept theyre trying to test you on e.g. special triangles which they love to hide in their little diagrams which helps immensely in finding shortcuts to solving the problem. reading to me was the least cut and dry section and the one i found the most difficult to nail down for some reason though i always scored the highest in reading in my actual tests. reading questions too can be categorized but i didnt find the classification too helpful. rather i think what helped the most with reading was the mindset that a ALL the answer is stated somehow in the passage so keep calm and keep looking and b because the answers are in the passage do not make assumptions or leaping conclusions. a bit more on b because my tendency to assume made me miss questions often  the reading section loves to give you related answers to the passage that seems logical at first glance but are not supported by the passage in any way. so if i were stuck between two answer choices the first thing i would do is to look to the corresponding passage to see which answer choice was really supported by the passage. really try to understand what the answer choices are saying on top of understanding the passage. Dont get trapped in the fancy language. these are just little tips i can think of on top of your head you will acquire many more as you experience it yourself but you cant gain this knowledge unless you go through dozens DOZENS of practices tests firsthand. obvi there are super smart people who didnt have to put in this effort and still got high scores but i was not one of those supersmart people. i ended up scoring RWM in my senior year but that was after years of shitting blood and tears and being neurotic as fuck. takes a lot of discipline to start consistently scoring in the s for the average Joe  good luck but solid studying should get you there.,Sat,cy851jr,1,t5_2qvxv

Generally the SAT math covers three main subject areas The Heart of Algebra Problem Solving and Data Analysis and Passport to Advanced Math.  These in turn can be broken down into certain topics and skill sets.Heart of Algebra which focuses on the mastery of linear equations and systems includes Solving linear equations and linear inequalities Interpreting linear functionsLinear inequality and equation word problemsGraphing linear equationsLinear function word problemsSystems of linear inequalities word problemsSolving systems of linear equationsProblem Solving and Data Analysis which is about quantitative skills includesRatios rates and proportionsPercentsUnitsTable dataScatterplotsKey features of graphsLinear and exponential growthData inferencesCenter spread and shape of distributionsData collection and conclusionsPassport to Advanced Math which features questions that require the manipulation of complex equations includesSolving quadratic equationsInterpreting nonlinear expressionsQuadratic and exponential word problemsRadicals and rational exponentsOperations with rational expressions and polynomialsPolynomial factors and graphsNonlinear equation graphsLinear and quadratic systemsStructure in expressionsIsolating quantitiesFunctionsFrom there you can seek out online practice or chapters in your school textbooks on these specific subjects.

8725436,0,t3_4zglz3,It all depends on your level and your goal score. Every student is different. Some can be great test takers or have a great knowledge of math concepts asked directly on the exam. Still a great starting place is to get the Official SAT Study Guide and take their practice tests. See how you do and how much prep time you need. We dont know you personally so we cant tell you specifically.Let me take Math as an exampleThe NEW SAT Math is much more challenging and requires much more thorough preparation. Khan Academy SAT preparation course suits those students who have A sometimes B in their high school math class. If you have B and sometimes C this program is not sufficient for you and you need a much more thorough review of math concepts beginning with arithmetic and numbers. By the way Khan Academy has a series of brilliant tutorials by the grade. If you go to Subjects choose math and review the concepts you are still struggling with it will definitely help you improve your performance.,Sat,d6wbl40,1,t5_2qvxv

11625688,0,t3_65wb65,Im going to break it down paragraph by paragraph so its easier to see where Im coming from.. Intro Excellent. I would not change a thing except maybe be more specific with your thesis. Yes Carter uses evidence. We know that. But what KIND of evidence. Stats? Expert testimony? You must explicitly state this. Other than that you have summarized Carters argument and presented a central claim which is exactly what you are supposed to do.. Body paragraph   The first problem I have is that the focus of this paragraph seems not to be the personal story but the IMAGERY of the personal story. In rhetoric personal anecdotes have completely functions than imagery. Anecdotes establish ethos while imagery establishes pathos. Both are valid devices but you cant cite one and talk about the other. You may want to integrate quotes more smoothly by including some context of where the imagery is coming from. The analysis of this paragraph is not indepth enough. You first need to state the PURPOSE of the imagery or anecdote. Then you need to state the EFFECT of the device. Finally you must explain how this device builds up Carters argument relative to his other devices. It is not enough to say The audience is likely to identify with this imagery brought about by this eloquent language and thus be swayed in their resolve. That is a given the purpose of rhetoric is to sway. You have to explain WHY and HOW such a device works to get full points.. Body paragraph  again be more specific with what TYPE of evidence Carter uses. again integrate quotes with context. Also be careful with grammar. Add a comma to introduce a quote they do take off points for grammar mistakes. you need to state the purpose of the stats.  the last sentence is excellent. That is exactly what you need to state the purpose of the authors citation of Republican and Democratic presidents. However you still need to explain how this effects the audience and how this builds up the argument.  you show a level of understanding about what Carter is saying but you need to now analyze how this helps his argument. . Body paragraph  Dont jump in with the quote right away. You always want a topic sentence to present the focus of your paragraph to your reader. This is a major organizational component. The audience is likely to identify with this statement because the author states that the Arctic Refuge is one of the precious human rights of the Gwichins. But WHY does identifying the Refuge as a human right allow the audience to identify with this statement? HOW does such a statement make the audience feel? You need to be more specific here. The text He also states...with his rhetoric is on point. THAT is what the SAT graders are looking for. You state the purpose of the appeal to patriotism and WHY it works. Do more of that in your writing. One thing I would change would be to use the words appeal to patriotism because this is slightly different than appeal to emotion. The goal of the aforementioned quote is to elicit an emotional response from the audience and thus be persuaded in their resolve. This is redundant. You have already stated Carter uses pathos and pathos is the appeal to emotion to sway the audience. You must point out what specifically in the quote appeals to the audience and what specific effect it has.. Conclusion Yep youve pretty much got everything you need here. Some say you have to present a bigger idea but I see no need. Just restate your thesis which you did.SCOREReading  because you have shown that you understand what Carter is saying. The one thing you need to do to improve this score is integrate the quotes better and show how numerous details interrelate.Analysis  because you do analyze but you dont consistently explain why a device works how to builds up the argument and what the authors purpose is.Writing  because although you have a central claim it is not carried through the first paragraph. You have a few grammatical errors and organizational issues. Your diction is sometimes not specific enough. However there is no awkward sentence structure and I can understand your main points. The other problems are pretty sparse.,Sat,dgds82r,1,t5_2qvxv
