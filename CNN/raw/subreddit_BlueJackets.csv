20255,0,t3_1uagzw,This game certainly gives us a few reasons to be optimistic. The challenge now is to see if we can translate the energy we had last night into the game against the Blues. Previously we played really well against the Blues and it came down to a general breakdown on our part in the third that allowed them to tie and pull out the OT win. I feel like if we can play a solid  against the Blues and keep our special teams rolling well do fine. A win in St. Louis could really push the team into overdrive setting us up to crush the Rangers and Canes the following week!,BlueJackets,cegqm70,2,t5_2sl3f

But if you want to get down to the semantics of slang calling someone a Cocksucker isnt a dig on their sexuality. Its more in the dickhead family of name calling.From Urban DictionaryCocksuckerA person that makes your life as hard as possible. A person that will stand in your way and mess anything up you do. A person that only cares for them self and no one else! A person that is looking to give one trouble. There is no insinuation about homosexuality in the way it is used. Can you even think of a time that cocksucker was used as an insult for someone who was actually gay?By the standard definition Avery is a cocksucker. A very well known cocksucker who formerly got to sleep with one of the most attractive women alive Cuthbert. Hes not gay.

We also have to have a gritty drive to win which we dont have at the moment... probably because at least subconsciously some have given up on this season.  If Wennberg and Dano continue to improve and we make out well on the draft well be able to fill the hole that Horton left for seasons to come.Or maybe Im being too optimistic.,BlueJackets,cp4hb6a,11,t5_2sl3f

Theyll wait another game to give their goalie some rest. People will play through more minor injuries. Teams will spend more time focusing on the matchup.

One of them is saying hes got an offer from a US college. Thats bullshit he can barely write his own name correctly. That kid was Drouin.Day  aka the combine. Hes not there. Apparently hes taking his decision  hes aiming to the US. Of course everybody knows its bullshit. You also have his fellaw MacKinnon threatening the same thing. BaieComeau has the first pick Rouyn the nd pick. BaieComeau has already said they were going to draft MacKinnon anyway cause they were getting tired of that bullshit.Day  the draft. BaieComeau drafts MacKinnon first. Kid refuses to come to the stage. Crowds booing like crazy. nd pick goes to Rouyn. They want Drouin but they know hes not going to show up hes not even in the building anyway. Rouyn decides to trade their pick to Halifax. Halifax goes up and draft Drouin... Drouin comes pick his jersey. Because hes in the friggin building afterall! Crowd goes nuts again and boos the shit out of him.Couple of days later MacKinnon gets trade to Halifax for garbages. Rest is history. Halifax has a dream team for the next couple of years grabbing a Memorial Cup in . Second time in a row you get this kind of bullshit SaintJohn did the same thing with Huberdeau they won in .During his junior years Drouin was a true pain in the ass for every single team  sure he has talent but hes the whiniest little bitch you can ever get. And he loves to dive. Hes probably the most overrated player Ive ever seen in that League. And Ive seen a lot of hype on useless players before hell at some point they thought fucking Brad Marchand was better than Claude Giroux...Drouin he has a tremendous set of tools hes an incredible passer and he has an amazing vision. But he has no hockey sense no defensive responsability hes weak he whines hes going to get you stupid penalties and hes not going to make it in the NHL. Sure that one deke out of  worked in the juniors and got you in the highlights reel all the time. But hell in the NHL its going to work once in a hundred.

Either way he fills a team need.Im not too sure about the Peeke selection.  Maybe thats the Reilly effect talking.  Hopefully he sticks with the organization and pans out into a solid defensive defenseman.Abramov is a steal for the third round.  Possible discipline issues but that seems to always be a risk with Russians.  Huge point production in the QMJHL and he has another year there.  Also versatile enough to play both wings.  Look for him in LEM in ?Thome... another goaltender.  As is usual with goaltenders well see where this goes.Thurkauf is solid for the th round.

The only other thing I would say as much as I hate to if Bob gets hurt again I think he is dangled for Vegas or we try to get him to waive the NTC and get rid of him. At this point the team has hired numerous specialists and if he still cant stay healthy what do we do with him? He has never truly returned to his vezina winning season weve only seen glimpses and for  mil a year thats a hard pill to swallow. Something will have to be done somehow some way.

Have Campbell in the Boll trademark Healthy Scratch seat maybe?Goalie battle did not have clear cut winners tonight. Despite the goals I think they were ultimately equal in their play. Korpi didnt really face too much that was difficult but Mac let in one crappy goal and a second that was tough to track. Still Mac did really well in several close plays and had some nice puck handling.

10259839,0,t3_5mvmuv,This has been odd for me this season as well... I see it all over hockey related posts but especially after the two most recent losses just fans of only successful teams just shiiiiting down the throats of CBJ. It it really makes me scratch my head because CBJ has consistently been the team that you would have more than likely beat we werent ever a threat to your cup run. So why put so much energy into talking so much trash after TWO losses? This is especially pointed at PIT fans given the city proximity of Columbus and the amount of fans in this city. They claim there is no real rivalry between the two teams we are a historically bad team we have no cups we have no playoff wins and you buy  of our building. You have it all. Why put down the franchise trying to build? You guys didnt win a cup until  years after the creation of your team. Ive been told by those close to me that are Pens fans that CBJ fans are cocky and rude. This is definitely not a representation of me nor have I experienced much of it at NWA vs the amount Ive seen at OSU games. I think youll find cocky and rude fans at any arena but Im starting to think that in the last  years CBJ as a organization and team have been striking a nerve with the big shots of the NHL and Ill take that as a positive.

Also keep in mind that most people probably just saw the headline and ran with it rather that looking up the quote.EDIT and furthermore this quote is specifically talking about a guy who just happened to end up injured Werenski not long after we heard the same thing from another coach Babcock who told his guys whatever and ended up with Bjorkstrand getting hurt.,BlueJackets,dfs6690,4,t5_2sl3f

11460164,0,t1_dfuwqir,gt All armchair psychology aside which is where it should be If youve ever played sports at a competitive level or talked to someone who did you know that a slump is just as much a mental issue as a mechanical issue.  Watching them play theyre still spending too much time passing and looking for the ideal shot instead of taking the shot and playing the sloprebounds that results.  Theyre not creating the scoring chances subjective unofficial stat from all of the SOG.  Yes there are benefits to the high shot count in that it denied the Pens a chance to generate as much offense in the later parts of the game.  But if your shots arent legit scoring chances and a lot of them werent then the stat can be very misleading.gt people are being overemotional with the idea that it will continue into the playoffs. If nothing else because its the playoffs. Youd be a fool to think the players couldnt be affected with a little fire under their ass when it comes to them playing in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.Id love to agree with you on that point I truly would.  But that added pressure might just lead them to feel even more desperate rather than break out of their slump.  Last night they had a chance to take back home ice advantage from the team that they will be playing in the first round.  They had a chance to send a message to the team that theyll play in the first round.  For all intents and purposes last night was a preview of the games that they will start playing next week and they werent even close to good enough and havent been for nearly a month!.,BlueJackets,dfv036h,3,t5_2sl3f

11621277,0,t1_dgd5kq9,On  and  were on Bob IMO.  He lost them behind the net and they went off of him into the goal.  ampnbsp  On  there was a blown holding call that to a turnover Dubi didnt pick up Rust and Bob got ALMOST all of the tip.  ampnbsp  On  Werenski got seriously hurt refs could have blown it dead but I guess they decided that he wasnt in immediate danger where he was?  Basically a power play goal.  ampnbsp  With  I think Savard HAS to put Crosby on his ass.  Crosbys dancing around behind the net with the puck for basically  seconds.  Also Cam is really halfassed about tying up Guentzel right before the shot.  Hes got his head up he sees Crosby coming around with the puck.
