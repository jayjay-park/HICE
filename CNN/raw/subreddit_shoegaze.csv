Really enjoyable.

5779030,0,t3_3u7okb,one of my favourite albums ever. I was always surprised how essential shoegaze lists focused so heavily on UK stuff that was much more dream pop than gaze Pale Saints Lush etc.. This was the perfect reverse engineering of Loveless sound with a very American early s indie feel. Claire Hates Me is supremely catchy while Tone Bender is about as MBV as it gets. ,shoegaze,cxdfyow,5,t5_2qhhx

8303580,0,t1_d5cflae,Yeah. Live everything is layered much better and the vocals are tucked underneath just enough so you dont notice. And I feel like live their vocals are a lot wetter way more reverb and effects on them. They seem dry comparatively speaking to the recording and live vocals. But also these dudes arent great singers to begin with. They have a nice overall tone but they come from hardcore and have no real formal vocal training. ,shoegaze,d5fi6ok,2,t5_2qhhx
