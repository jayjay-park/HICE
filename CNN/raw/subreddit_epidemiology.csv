1049506,0,t1_chnkshz,ok thanks. Ill ask my friend who just finished her st year at Columbia which they use. Ill see whats floating around for free on R it seems that may be the easiest to understand the basics.and yeah my undergrad university McGill is known for being... aggressively DIY to put it nicely. Not a lot of support from faculty.,epidemiology,chnl0nb,2,t5_2rsl1
1976365,0,t3_2hbzm3,it doesnt matter.. you can do general epi work with a MPH focused in global epi and you can do global epi work with an MPH focused in general epi.What I would recommend is Make sure it is CEPH accredited. You mentioned Emory which is CEPH accredited Go for cheaper programs. You will have to pay back your student loans and the job market isnt that great.. and entry level MPH positions doesnt pay that much Go for programs that will give you work experience such as internship and networking experience. This is maybe more location based than program based. But this will help you land a job postMPH,epidemiology,ckrcog2,2,t5_2rsl1

I ultimately want to get a phd in epi health services research or health economics. Im having difficulty picking a field because I like them all and could see myself in all of them.

3953111,0,t1_cr64ff4,Look up graph theory and agentbased models. Network epidemiologists study how disease move a through a social network using this field of mathematics. The field came about during the s what happened to me on just for struggling to understand the spread of HIV. It became obvious that people had to understand how it moves through a network of social interactions. Today epidemiologists use these techniques to study contagions move through society. And know that contagious dont necessarily mean infectious diseases they could be anything that spreads person to person including anti vaccine sentiment beliefs about STD risks bad eating habits even political ideas and cat memes. The lab I work in did a study modelling incarceration as a contagion using the same techniques normally applied to influenza.,epidemiology,cr6vzja,2,t5_2rsl1
4062916,0,t1_crjcp9e,Ok awesome! Im meeting with some potential supervisors and perhaps I can ask them about becoming a research assistant for them.

4245185,0,t1_cs3olap,No that is what I do as well.  It depends on what type of modeling you want to do.  If you are doing a casecontrolcohort study then you will be using regression analyses whether that is logistic regression linear regression survival analysis etc.  If you want to model future outbreaks then you are looking at some sort of agentbased modeling. The former regressions are quite easy to comprehend and do not involve intense math check out this site for some good examples   The latter agentbased modeling gets quite math intensive but you dont necessarily need to do the math you could just partner with someone that knows the math and you provide the epi expertise.  ,epidemiology,cs453ut,1,t5_2rsl1

8101927,0,t3_4q6g4h,So there are a couple points here. While I disagree with the whole Senior epidemiologists just hand things over to the statisticians thing and think timeuntilthathappens is actually pretty long I do agree that understanding the actual methods behind what youre doing are more important than learning a particular package.. SAS is probably the easiest language to teach yourself thanks to the SAS Press.. Theres no promise youll be working in SAS later. Despite having learned it at school Ive never touched it since Ive left and no one working in my lab will be using it.. Picking up languages if youre so inclined is a thing you can and should do on your own.. Stata is hardly a bad choice. It was for a crude survey of a few years worth of papers in AJE IJE and Epidemiology the second most common language a study was conducted in.,epidemiology,d4qqa0w,6,t5_2rsl1

9752782,0,t1_daf7y67,Outstanding response. And yes you hit the nail on the head with my motivation. As for me underreacting I have to disagree. Im merely playing a little devils advocate. Radon is certainly dangerous and I generally agree with updating the building codes to prevent excessive Radon exposure but the current tactics have been used to merely instill fear among the population. We need to do better with education. And as for the numbers its obvious that they dont account for genetic factors or even really many other environmental factors. Instead they basically just took everyone who wasnt a smoker and labelled the cancer as being caused by Radon exposure. Thats just how I feel.,epidemiology,daf8x7s,1,t5_2rsl1
