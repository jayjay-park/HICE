681741,0,t3_21xees,Forget the  hour rule. There is no magic number where all of a sudden your great at drawing. What will work is intentional focused practice in areas you need to improve. Choose a very specific topic when you are about to draw and sit down and study that. Do this every day for several hours without missing a beat. In  year you will get a LOT better. Fill up a sketchbook every month if you can and you will see your skills grow. The key with learning to draw is patience and passion. You have to WANT to do it and you have to have the discipline to do it.,learntodraw,cghrjdl,1,t5_2ub51

3865643,0,t1_cqwvunv,Try using the HB pencil your lines are really dark and should be lighter especially when starting out so you can erase when you know a line looks weirdwrong.Here something I drew yesterday.  Notice the yellow line is that guideline for the side of the face for a profileand most thing on the human body its a balancing act.  The brow goes out.....it comes back in....the nose goes out....it comes back in.....the top lip out back in bottom lip out....back in.....chin out....you guessed it back in then you follow the line of the jaw up to just in front of the ear cause thats where the mandible attaches near the zygomatic bone.,learntodraw,cqwx1d3,1,t5_2ub51

4682384,0,t1_ctkqn6b,oh ok. I think it wont be to different from regular coloring and shading but you will rely on the hard edges of the colors to give a nice effect. I think it is always easier to start off light as possible. Use the white canvas color as your main color for everything and use the watercolor itself only for the shadingshadows. Here is a quick example. Its not really watercolor but the effect of using mostly the canvas as your color is there   I think that kind of coloring is an easy place to start,learntodraw,ctkrebm,1,t5_2ub51

I do have thedrawing on the right side of the brain and honestly I hate it. Its just so damn superfluous and wordy. Rather than being like heres this technique. Try it. Heres why it works. Heres the next technique. Instead its like OK... Heres the life history of this student. Heres a before and after picture they did with this technique. Now you try it without me explaining anything. OH WOW IT WORKED HOLY CRAP THATS AMAZING OUR BRAINS ARE SO COMPLEX AND INTERESTING BLAH BAL BLAH. OK heres the next technique after  pages of junk,learntodraw,cwyzgk5,4,t5_2ub51

6420459,0,t1_czjdvh1,Ok the expression on your drawing is really good. Most peoples first cartoons look either bored or overdramatic but yours is realistic. Personally Id avoid drawing hair line by line though. Experiment with some simpler ways to draw your hair to match the style of the rest of the drawing. Other than that just keep practicing youre doing some solid work.,learntodraw,czjeudk,2,t5_2ub51

Its not about doing sketches daily for  years but actively learning the concepts and getting better every day.You could draw sketches your entire life and not get any better or improve your drawing tenfold in  year by actively learning and having meaningful practices.,learntodraw,d0udzcf,3,t5_2ub51
7093003,0,t3_4cof8v,Need an example if you want specific advice. Dont be afraid of sharing everyone has garbage drawings at first. Mine still are!If your lines are wobbly that can be because youre drawing too slow. When you go slow your mind tries to make corrections midline and thats why you wobble. When you go fast you dont have time to process in corrections.If you mean to draw a straight line up but you end up  degrees off than ghosting your lines can help. Thats where you hold your penpencil right above the paper and practice the line a few times before actually making the mark.In addition if you find with a straight line youre always going say  degrees to the right .... then rotate your paper  degrees before drawing. Never be afraid to rotate your paper into the position thats most comfortable for making the mark youre trying to achieve. ,learntodraw,d1kczzk,1,t5_2ub51

7410824,0,t3_4gtiwy,Spill coffee drops on paper. Literally. Then draw around the splotches.Get one of your fancy sketchbookpaper stacks. Draw an ink scribble in the middle of every single page. Nonerasable permanent soaking ink. Now fill it up  the paper is ruined already what are your drawings gonna do?Set a timer for  minutes crumble a piece of paper and straighten it up. Fill it with doodles and then rip it apart and throw it away. Even if you like your doodles just destroy it.,learntodraw,d2kk8qx,5,t5_2ub51

9324081,0,t3_5845pb,I tried to draw it and it took me  tries.  Its a fucking hard pose.The harder something is the longer it will take.Gesture definitely helps. The process would be to lay your page besides the reference and use gesture to capture the overall pose and proportions.  But from there construction and constant checking is a must.Its a fucking hard pose.   hours to get it right would not be out of the question even for experienced artists OP.The real secret is erase and correct as you go along starting over from scratch when its beyond saving by eraser.When practicing something new start with an easier pose.  Hold the drawing in a mirror along with the reference.  Correct as necessary.,learntodraw,d8xw9ha,3,t5_2ub51

10274012,0,t3_5n4jj6,The upper and lower arms vary way too much in length. If you include the hands your lower arms should be longer than your upper arms. Bend your elbow to bring your arm as close to your shoulder as you can and youll see what I mean.,learntodraw,dc8m5hj,3,t5_2ub51
10278580,0,t3_5n58ez,Quite good for a first try!If you want to improve you should start practice daily. You can mix with this three exercises If you can draw on pictures with transparent layers or photoshop if you can. It will help you to improve your understanding of any subject  and identify the necessary lines. The second one is to use this website and select body part gt head gt and  seconds or  minute. It will force you to draw only the essential. Its also a great warm up. Finally you can use the same website and use a  minutes time limit. It will give you more time but still force you to go fast. I hope it will help you. ,learntodraw,dc94t4h,1,t5_2ub51

10761900,0,t3_5pmt1y,Correction to my last post this is one of your best pieces.  The style is down pat and you seem to naturally avoid reserving too much of the whites as you did with your early charcoals.  Its easier to control the stippling than a charcoal stick in this terms though youre breaking that dependency in your landscape stuff.Id only say add a stronger shadow somewhere right now the light feels very direct but you could make a shadow on say the right side getting stronger towards the bottom.  eliminating the pure highlight there and taking every value down just a notch.  It would add some more dynamism to your work.As you get better I would recommend paying a bit of attention to line quality with permanent mediums.  You need to make  swift confident strokes typically coming from your shoulder.  Im a hypocrite here as Im very guilty of this but learn from my mistakes.  Read up on lesson  of line quality over at   even if you dont do the lesson it starts out mindnumbingly boring youll at least understand what Im talking about and understand why it will become important.,learntodraw,ddq0dxt,1,t5_2ub51
