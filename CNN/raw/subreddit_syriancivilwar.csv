25183,0,t1_ceh8nt8,The IF are a far cry from ISIS who are they hostile to. The IF oppose secularism but not democracy whereas ISIS support a Talibanlike system and dont recognise national boundaries. The IF emerged after the US backed down on its promise to attack the regime in the event of it using chemical weapons. This was supposed to be a big asset the SNC could bring to the table through its contacts with Western allies but it turned out to be weak.

Also even beyond jamming taking out the antenna now eventually immobilizes the whole tank. Therefore these tanks can now be defeated by small arms. This is one of those ideas that gets brought up a lot but the more you think about implementation the worse it gets.

I dont know how you are coming to this conclusion. Every single front is seeing advances by the SAA. Homs is all but secured the rebels are in some small pockets one of which is a castle. In Aleppo theyre advancing into the rebel held neighbourhoods in the middle of the city and moving to cut off the rest of them by the north. Most of the city is in the control of the Government and theyre taking district after district. The rebels in Damascus are again reduced to some small pockets which are cut off besieged or starving. Theyve made gains in Daraa and even resupplied their cut off men in Deir Az Zor. With the exception of Raqqa every provincial capital is in government hands. Most of the land the rebels hold is desert which isnt useful for anything and will be hard to hold with guerilla warfare. gtThats a pretty bold assertion that completely discounts a variety of scenarios....Addressed most of this above much of what you said just isnt true. The SAA just took more districts in Aleppo recently for example. Progress in Damascus is slow but steady and after the attempted rebel counter attack the SAA has recaptured most of that lost territory and are moving once again on the rebel held districts. The thing about ceasefires is every one frees up more men to attack other places and because they are offering amnesties for those who want to fight the extremists they gain more troops. Hezbollah is looking after its own interests by fighting its enemies in Syria rather than inside Lebanon and have secured themselves more weapons and support Im sure. Their losses were minimal but yeah they have been responsible for some victories their total forces are a small fraction of the progovt sides manpower.gtThey speak for about k fighters out of k. Hardly miniscule. And should a peace deal be amenable to the likes of Tawhid its entirely possible that the IF could fracture anyway. So they say. I dont believe their numbers and even if they are true  of the fighters isnt even a majority. The FSA is undersupplied and probably the least effective of the rebel forces the only reason they werent wiped out was because of their extremist allies who have now turned on them. They cant stand up to ISIS arent a big enough prize for the concessions the SNC wanted.gtAll of which have happened in places where rebels are entirely surrounded and starving. Notice how absolutely none of them happen in situations in which the rebels have any sort of reinforcements ammunition or even food.Obviously they wont surrender when they can run but their lines are shrinking and there are less places to run to by the day. Eventually most rebel battalions will find themselves in that situation as long as they keep losing ground.gtNeither does Assad. Hes only just barely turned the tide after  years and massive losses. His supply lines to places like Aleppo are extremely vulnerable and constantly ambushed and he doesnt even bother trying to take IdlibAleppoRaqqaDaraaDeir Ezzor countrysides. Untrue see above. There are plenty of offensives in Idlib and Aleppo provinces Daraa itself isnt fully secured so turning to the countryside isnt a priority in that theatre their were reinforcements to forces in Deiz Ezzor recently etc. Assad has a good chance of winning as long as the situation remains as it has been going for the last  months with victory after victory for Assad.gtAnd if Assad hadnt received billions of dollars in financial logistical military and diplomatic support in addition to more than k foreign fighters his government would have collapsed. I love how you people think that only the rebels are dependent on foreign support when Iran pays the salaries of the entire SAA.Billions? From who lol? Russia wouldnt even send them the aircraft or systems they paid for before the crisis if anything they were hamstrung by international pressure on their allies. K foreign fighters on his side is little compared to the NDF and SAA which number in the hundreds of thousands. Many are just there to protect holy Shia shrines Hezbollah is the one thats most active on the front line. Compared to the support that the rebels have received Assad has been mostly on his own.

294376,0,t1_cfb9pw9,The rationale of Hezbollah was that had they not intervened and the rebels defeated the regime then Hezbollah would have been targeted anyway after a time. Given that one of the first things the FSA and allied groups did was to declare they would cut all ties with Iran and hezbollah after taking over Im inclined to believe that would have been the case. Assir and his gang were stirring up trouble since the very start of the war even before hezbollah got involved and theirs no doubt groups like AlNusra which now have an official presence in lebanon would have given the likes of him their full support in attacking Hezbollah. Hezbollah were not happy about having to enter this war but for them it is a simple matter of survival. These groups fighting now in syria would not have content with defeating the regime they would have moved into lebanon anyway and used syria as their safe haven as they are doing now. The only excuses they would have needed from their perspective is that Hezbollah are Shias and once supported the regime. I mean certainly Hezbollahs involvement in the war served as the catalyst for the attacks in Lebanon but they were almost certainly inevitable and probably would have been of a much larger scale had they just sat back and done nothing. ,syriancivilwar,cfb9zzb,21,t5_2x5s1

497487,0,t1_cfwsk19,Interesting article. Im very confused by qatars policies. On one hand they have tried to cultivate relationships with several shia groups and governments including iranwhereas saudi arabia does the opposite. However they also are the chief supporter of the muslim brotherhood which are an ultra conservative sunni group who want to reestablish the caliphate.  They also seem to really hate the Saudis way more than I knew and it appears the feeling is mutual. I think qatar saw overthrowing assad as a means for them to gain more regional influence especially if a muslim brotherhood affiliated government could come to power rather than their support coming from a hatred of alawitesshia. Whereas KSA seems to be more bent on destroying the shia crescent with the endgame of course being iran. The question remains how though of how this will effect either sides support for the rebels. Id think qatar would want to pull out but are they really going to abandon all the groups theyve financed? Seems to me like saudi arabia is in too deep and will continue backing the rebels at any cost because at this point its pretty much a proxy war between them and iran. Although l they are scared of these radicals resuming terrorist activities on saudi soil and theyre also clearly terrified of a popular arab spring type revolt threatening their monarchy. The fact that KSA recently was trying to get pakistan involved in supplying the rebels tells me they have absolutely no intention of backing off.The real question is what will qatar do and if they did cease funding is that significant enough to have a real effect on the ground?,syriancivilwar,cfwtgdm,10,t5_2x5s1

Im gonna go out on a limb and assume your friend is relatively well to do. Aleppo is that way as youve seen. Compare Aleppo to Yarmouk or Sbeineh. In Duma where I have several friends theyve told me things that scar. Of their neighbors and their families taken from their homes and their throats slit in the streets. Of survival by nothing short of miracle. Of beatings torture starvation. Of dead children in buildings shelled and distraught orphans in the streets. Need we be reminded of the report released a couple months ago? Or of Hama in ? My uncle spent a decade and a half imprisoned he was eighteen when admitted hes seen the hell that is the regimes innards. I dont however see Syria a better place with Assad remaining in power.

587394,0,t1_cg6yqvl,I think my first post sounded harsher than I intended.  I dont mean to say that Israel is going to purposefully destabilize Syria just that Israel will do what it can to make sure Assad doesnt win.  My reasoning behind that is simply that things cannot go back to how they were before the war.  This war has tremendously increased Hezbollah and Iranian influence in Syria effectively eliminated any independent Syrian foreign policy and thereby made a separate peace official or unofficial between Syria and Israel vastly more difficult.  There were very credible reports that Assad wanted to negotiate with Israel over the Golan before the war.  Now if Iran doesnt want that it cannot happen.  Now  assuming Assad won the war  Hezbollah could very easily set up rockets and missiles along the Syrian border like it has in Lebanon.  Thats simply not a reality Israel can tolerate and thus it does what it can to weaken Syria and especially Hezbollah thus the various air strikes on convoys military facilities and antiair sites.That being said Israel knows that the rebels cant bring stability either.  Between the fact that they cant produce a stable postAssad government and the fact that it would be political suicide for them to accept Israeli support Israel cant make them win either.  Between Assad being no option and the rebels providing no option keeping both sides off balance and in relative parity is really Israels only solution.  Meanwhile the war absorbs vast amounts of Iranian money supplies and political capital while occupying Hezbollah so intensively that Hezbollah isnt really in the position to attack Israel like it did in .  Thats what I mean by it being in Israels interest for Syria to be destabilized in the short term.  Until something else comes along having all Israels enemies distracted by fighting each other is the best of bad options.,syriancivilwar,cg71h8p,3,t5_2x5s1

684862,0,t1_cghw9n3,Right so theres certainly a realpolitik side to this. I think one could definitely make the argument that Matar represented a greater threat to the Syrian government than Jarba does. Though the Syrian government absolutely has no intention of allowing the political track to progress any more than is necessary to keep the IC off its back that doesnt mean its in favor of assassinating top opposition politicians. Jarba may in fact represent a greater threat to the Syrian government dead than alive because the act of murdering top Syrian opposition politicians may convince certain IC actors that they have no choice but to intervene directly in the conflict. So yes I think were in agreement. The Assad government certainly wouldnt have any moral qualms with assassinating top members of the opposition... whether or not they would deem such an act in their interests is another question entirely. ,syriancivilwar,cgi4btv,1,t5_2x5s1

727089,0,t1_cgmuapa,The regime is really only capable of two major offensives at any given time roughly divided between one in the north LatakiaHamaAleppo and one in the south HomsDamascusDeraa.  During the latter half of  they surrounded and secured this current position in Damascus while a simultaneous offensive secured supply lines into Aleppo.  Then the regimes southern force turned to Qalamoun while their operations in Damascus settled down.  In Aleppo their northern force moved north of the airport in an attempt to surround the city.  That offensive stalled on the southern edges of Sheikh Najjar industrial city and has since been mildly pushed back as the SAA is forced to send troops to Latakia.  Its not that there is a specific offensive force in every battle but they seem to have enough manpower shortages that they can really only provide requisite reinforcements to two offensives at any given time.  Everywhere else stays pretty static.Now that Qalamoun is largely over that southern force is likely to be turned to other fronts in southern Syria.

It has been responsible for some of the ongoing postwar violence in Libya though the degree of its involvement has been disputed in a number of instances.gtSympathy for Gaddafi and his fallen government is viewed highly negatively by current Libyan authoritiesboth the legal government and extralegal militiasand parts of general society in postwar Libya and even accusations of it can provoke harsh responses. In May  the democraticallyelected postwar government passed legislation imposing severe penalties for anyone giving favourable publicity to Gaddafi his family their regime or ideas as well as anything denigrating the new government and its institutions or otherwise judged to be damaging to public morale.  Derisively called tahloob algae by antiGaddafi Libyans  suspected loyalists have faced strong persecution following the war. Perhaps  loyalist soldiers as well as civilians accused of support for Gaddafi are being held in government prisons. Amnesty International has reported large scale torture and other mistreatment and executions of those perceived as enemies of the new government.    gtReports and rumours of organised proGaddafi activity have persisted since the wars end. The Libyan Popular National Movement was organised in exile on  February  the first anniversary of the protests that led to the civil war by former officials in the Gaddafi government. The party banned from participating in Libyan elections may have also cultivated links with armed proGaddafi groups in Libya. Statements from the party sometimes appear on websites affiliated with the socalled Green Resistance after the sole colour of Gaddafis flag a term sometimes used by sympathisers to refer to supposed proGaddafi militant groups.   gtgtImage i  Flag of the deposed government of Muammar Gaddafi used as a symbol by loyalistsInteresting Tripoli | Sirte | Muammar Gaddafi | National Transitional Council Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgrxah oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgrxah.

The victim in such a case is abducted illegally detained and often tortured during interrogation killed and the body hidden. Typically a murder will be surreptitious with the corpse disposed of to escape discovery so that the person apparently vanishes. The party committing the murder has deniability as nobody provides evidence of the victims death.gtDisappearing political rivals is also a way for regimes to engender feelings of complicity in populations.

1677158,0,t1_cjqi5ai,gt The Syrian State was peaceful and stable before the War.Thats like saying a company that goes bankrupt wasnt mismanaged because it was in business until it went bankrupt.Besides it depends on how far back youre willing to look. If you go back to the rule of Hafez alAssad  theres the Islamist uprising that ended with the Hama Massacre in which between  and  civilians lost their lives. That happened  years ago  just a little over a generation.That event should have been adequate warning of the potential for sectarian strife and the Assads certainly had an ample amount of time to try and defuse possible causes for tensions and win the support of the Sunni population.Yet they failed as evidenced by the current civil war.gt Syria as it is currently madeup cannot survive as a democratic nation.As the current civil war proves beyond any reasonable doubt it wasnt stable as a dictatorship under Assad either.gt You also failed to mention WHY the civil war even was allowed to happen. Assads forces are mostly Sunni at the soldier level. This is why he ceded so much ground in the beginning and why his forces were on the defensive to start. Had his country been  Shiite  this civil war never happens. Instead a portion of his forces defected which created an opening. Assad was afraid of sending in any Sunniled forces and he is STILL afraid of doing so. That kind of problem is difficult to stop from happening. What do you think he could have done in that situation? The portion of military men who were disillusioned joined the revolution.Heres what he could have done win the support of the Sunni population and take away sources of discontent. Not when the civil war started but in the decade before that.The civil war became what it is today because he failed to do that.gt So in that regard you fail to objectify a few key points in your post. Lets not forget that if Assad was really hated by the population  he would be out of office by now. Remember that around  of his country is Sunni. The force fighting him is Sunni. How is Assad able to remain in power if he did not have the support in place? His military though strong cant hold back millionman marches across the country. Look at how the war started and look at all of the territory his military lost in the beginning. And yet despite that  his rule remains.I said that he is hated by a large part of the population and the fact that a campaign to oust him became a civil war is absolute irrefutable undeniable proof of that.Having enough support to stay in power isnt the same as having enough support to provide stability. Assad has the former but lacks the latter as evidenced by the fact that a civil war broke out.gt You mention that Assad let order collapse into chaos. You might want to note the differences of life between that of FSArebel held territory and Government territory  tell me life is better in the FSA areas. And again what the heck is he supposed to do here? The FSArebelheld territory used to be government territory yet it is now in a state of chaos.When I say that Assad let order collapse into chaos Im not talking about his ability to keep order in places he currently controls but about his failure to stay in control and provide stability in those places that are now warzones. Which again is a result of his failure to win the loyalty or at least support of a large part of the population.gt Also while the War was pretty much about Freedom in the beginning  it has drastically changed as groups like IS have taken the forefront in the battle for power. Hell when the movement even began it wasnt about having a civil war. It only grew out of the initial frustrations of protests which turned violent due to Assads military crackdown. Assad underestimated the reaction it would cause. Though just to point this out it was likely that there were guns in the crowd during the initial crackdown. He took the crackdown too far though and it caused for defections and more protests to happen.In other words he completely failed at keeping order and providing peace and stability instead making choices that would eventually lead to the civil war that is still raging today.gt Anyway even if the FSA was the mainplayer in the beginning and your assessment was correct in that regard that assessment is no longer correct. The FSA can no longer provide the security and order that Assad can.If Assad could provide security and order there would be security and order in Syria right now. But thats not the case. Rather theres a civil war war going on. A civil war that broke out while Assad was still in full control of the country.As far as providing security and order goes he couldnt have failed more miserably.At this point the FSA definitely isnt capable of bringing order either but that doesnt make Assads failure any less complete. It just means the country is pretty much fucked because right now there are no good options for leadership that might provide actual longterm stability.gt And You do realize that war itself is a humanitarian disaster right? There are no real winners in war.Which is exactly why allowing a situation to emerge that plunges a nation into civil war is complete and utter failure on the part of its leaders.gt As to your idea of dictatorships  In certain situations like Syria  a Dictatorship is far and away better then perpetual war. As long as Syria remains the way it is  there will be dictatorships in play.A dictatorship is better than civil war but Assads dictatorship has shown itself incapable of preventing civil war. We know this because theres a civil war going on in Syria right now.gt Hell when the  Iranian revolution happened with a U.S backed government being replaced it was due to massive crackdowns and yet since the overthrow  it could be said that Iran is worse off due to the religiousradical government that took his place  yet it is a stablepeaceful country.In Iran a dictator who was utterly hated by a large portion of the population was overthrown.If you want to compare Iran to Syria ask yourself what would have happened if the Shah had managed to stop the revolution. Would the country have become a stable one under his rule or would a new revolution have arisen eventually?gt As to the last bit  you brought up the Syrian deathtoll in comparison to the Libyan postwar. That was a seriously flawed comparison. How many people live in Libya? Around  million these days? In Syria there is around  million.Syria has around four times the population of Libya.

1699904,0,t3_2dv53c,I think US airstrikes in Syria are very unlikely. First off in Iraq the government had no problem allowing US planes into their airspace they practically asked for it. The Syrian government would not allow it which means US would have to get UNSC approval which Russia would never consent to. And even if Syrian government never got those Ss they still have some antiaircraft capability. What if a US plane was shot down what if a US pilot got captured? There are too many risks. Some people also believe that there was an agreement between the US and Russia where the US doesnt bomb Syria and Russia doesnt deliver the Ss. Besides if we trust the news from Raqqa today the Syrian govt is ramping up the airstrikes themselves. They dont need the US to do it for them like the Iraqis.The second reason I doubt well see US bombing in Syria is because the US doesnt have anyone to defend there. They havent supported the FSA with anything more than light weaponry and unless they manage to hold on to Aleppo and consolidate their forces and territory which they wont they wont be getting more help. The YPG is the only other group I think the US might defend. But it is affiliated with the PKK which the US will avoid supporting overtly if only to avoid pissing off Turkey NATO ally. The inevitable war between the Syrian regime and ISIS still hasnt started though it looks like its getting closer. Both sides still have other battles to fight. If very hypothetical if the Syrian regime falls and ISIS takes Syria then we might see US airstrikes. But even then I would think local players like Israel Iran Jordan Saudi sending Pakistani planes lol would be in there first.As for Baghdadis links to Mossad there are none that I know of.

It is known in Arabic as khatt  which derived from the word line design or construction. gtThe development of Islamic calligraphy is strongly tied to the Quran chapters and excerpts from the Quran is a common and almost universal text of which Islamic calligraphy is based upon. Deep religious association with the Quran as well as suspicion of figurative art as idolatrous has led calligraphy to become one of the major forms of artistic expression in Islamic cultures. gtAs Islamic calligraphy is highly venerated most works follow examples set by well established calligraphers with the exception of secular or contemporary works.

2043023,0,t1_ckyujow,Thanks for engaging.  Im admittedly a novice with regard to this complicated situation and larger region.  My sources tend to be all general news articles that I can come across a few trips including getting gassed on the way to my hotel in Istanbul summer  and many friends who are Turkish liberal ideologues professionals including people in and out of Turkey.  Some are armed with facts others with enthusiasm and ideology a vehemently secularliberal ideology.  So while Ive been very fortunate to get many opinions on this my own opinions are based on the opinions of others.  With that said your reasoning seems sound and the analogy to Israel is helpful for me too.  As is your notion that having a a Turkeybacked independent Kurdish state in Iraq would completely undermine PKKs attempts to label Turkey has an enemy and oppressor.  I also agree with that Kurdish refugees in Syria would probably be sent over that way as well as Kurds who feel like secondclass citizens in Turkey.  But Im left with two things hanging chads if you will that . there are so many conspiracy theories see deep state around and about cause and effect in Turkish politicspolicy that its difficult to assign or interpret actual cause and effect especially to an outsider like me.  And secondly this posits that Erdogan and his regime are acting strategically and rationally or with nationalistic self interest outside of corrupt self interest.  From what Ive seenunderstand Erdogan seems kind of incompetent and backward like George W Bush or perhaps Silvio Berlusconi and I think that conspiracy theories aside many things happen in the world that are unpredictable organic and without any proper plan and that to imagine that there is an actual plan other than plunder by Erdogan presumes competence which as I understand it hes eliminated by cleansing the Fethullah Gulen elements who were akin to Romney Republicans ideological but not as corrupt.edit for clarity oh and sorry for all the brackets I guess thats how I do,syriancivilwar,ckzihvf,1,t5_2x5s1

You are making this assertion based upon the contents of the article. And it should be a clue in the title what kind of coordination it is referring to. That is on top of the fact that no where in the article does it talk about airstrikes. Instead the title and in the article you can and should make the assumption we are talking about general coordination rather then some specific coordination particularly when we know there are other areas of coordination going on between the West and the FSA. So in SOME fashion you can coordinate with the FSA against the IS an example of this is the fighting in the countryside. As I said you can coordinate via weapons or general supplies which can be used in the fight against the IS. You even said so yourself in another thread that the U.S government was still sending weapons and doing training with elements of the FSA I would presume to say in part that helps the fight against the IS.

We will return it to the Stone Age and bury Nasrallah under the rocks.Israel of course has to answer so they answer this.I dont think Israel nor Hezbollah are interested in this right now.

I agree that some Baathists are innocent and lost their jobs unfairly but saying that deBaathification was wrong? thats total BS and an insult to me and to all other Iraqis especially the ones who lost family or parts of their own bodies by these criminals. Many Baathists have done cruel crimes against Iraqis. The point with the new Iraq is to give Iraq a new democratic start. How do you want to accomplish that if you have criminals wandering the streets in the sigh of their victims. Let me give you an example of those baathistss behavior before . In every single street in Iraq or atleast in Baghdad there was a Baathist living there they were called mukhtar. Every Mukhtar is there to make sure everyone stays in line with the standards of the Baathist goverment inside their area they knew everyone who lived in their area. Every house and how many people lived in it. When the authorities wants to take someone in for interrogation usually for having something to do with the banned at the time Dawa partyany opposition party Maliki and Abadi are Dawa party members btw or to force him to join the army this happened alot before and during the war. Now the Mukhtar that was living in my street used to kick peoples doors open and drag their men out to send them to war he would insult everyone he didnt like he harmed many people in my area. After the war ended I never saw him step outside the house again I saw him behind the door of his house a few times before I moved out of Iraq. The point is if this guy have stepped out of his house he would have gotten killed right away by one of his victims. Now imagine if criminals like him got to go around like they have done nothing and get their jobs again. That would create chaos and the majority of Iraqis wouldnt accept that.Just because these Baathist criminals are helping ISIS doesnt mean that we should give up to their demands.,syriancivilwar,cltttbl,2,t5_2x5s1

Obama is massively resistant to anything that could evolve into a yearslong dedicated effort like Iraq and Afghanistan so hes kept as handsoff as possible.

2461118,0,t1_cmfw2p0,The government needs to look at the religious institutions like the Shia and realise that they are working better than they are. They have to change. Part of that in my opinion is not to have a mixed government. Let it be run by parties not religious and ethnic lines. If the dawa party wins an election all ministries should be under their control not shared with Kurds or Sunnis who have agendas against them. Democracy doesnt work well if the opposition is also ruling parts of the government. No compulsory military service wasnt around for a while now. It was o my a couple months ago that the government stated pushing for compulsory military service for Iraqi men  there are several types of service depending if you go to university or not etc My father is a veteran himself. Youre right that nationalism runs high.  years in the army in fact. The only problem was that it wasnt voluntary. Turned  and thrown into the Iranian war for  years of his life and  years after. Iraqi military has always been corrupt though. Even in Saddams time. We all knew if you had enough money you didnt have to go to war. However it was still less corrupt. Lets hope for the best.

2592859,0,t3_2pi1uh,In short this article discusses the regimes increased use of conscription and the rising discontent among its own power base as a result of this.I personally believe that forcibly conscripting men is a very dangerous strategy for two reasons.Firstly soldiers who have little will or motivation to fight for the regime are far more unreliable and are more likely to surrender desert or even outright defect to the enemy in the face of an assault not to mention equipment and territory that could be ceded as a result. They also lack experience and are poorly trained a potentially fatal combination on the battlefield.Secondly forced conscription angers the families of the conscripted which has lead to protests among the regimes own support base. Some have even apparently taken to violence to protect their sons from conscription. While it may well be true that the regime could ignore this in the short term internal strife will only increase if the regime doesnt stop.If I were them I would stop the forced conscription. I can only see this causing more problems for the regime than it would solve.,syriancivilwar,cmx0vbi,5,t5_2x5s1

Very subtle and pointless difference. The US Forces will do what the command feels necessary to accomplish the mission the label advise and assist really doesnt mean anything except giving a general idea of what missions they will be asked to do.So while you wont likely see US Forces taking the lead in assaults at least at first they will be driving around outside the bases which leaves open the possibility of combat.,syriancivilwar,cn06rj6,3,t5_2x5s1

Though the evidence for this is weak IMO and quite a few parties to the conflict had motive. Also been accused of kidnapping members of the Kurdish National Council.The YPG have instituted a military draft which some people consider to be unacceptable. The YPG have also been reported to violently put down antidraft protests in their areas. Though the video evidence I saw for this was weak. Still definitely plausible.Given the antiArab sentiment among some Kurds I wouldnt be surprised if their have been some unfortunate incidents but I have not heard of them.

Today they have at least  combatworthy troops.What? No lol  the SAA was far stronger prewar. A number of high quality officerstroops have either defected or been killed in the  years of war. Its not to say its a bad thing to be able to say you have k troops combat ready but given the choice  the SAA would much rather have k troops most of which isnt battle tested yet but fresh and ready then the k warweary troops it does now. The SAA lost alot of good menofficers over the years. The SAA is not in a great position . . .  though with that said  it is in a decent position now much better now after being in a horrible position  years ago.As to Hezbollah it holds some ground . . . particularly close to the border. Foreign militants INITIALLY was their to provide security for holy places. That changed as the war continued on. Now their primary role is to help hold ground around Damascus andor help certain offensives. As the war continues  certain dynamics in the war will change and foreign militants is one of those. gt I disagree. The warweariness of the population is not a major factor in Syria. Progovernment Syrians know that they have  choices the government Dawla insurgents or the AlQaeda dominated insurgents. Progoverment Syrians arent going to jump ship and side with Dawla or Nusra just because they are tired of the war. Are you kidding? warweariness is a HUGE factor in Syria mostly due to later potential complications. The problem with wars generally speaking isnt so much the deathtoll as it is the citizens who have to deal with the aftermath of their lostlovedones and their anger which may lead to protests. These people may know that Assads government is the only way to go but they also know that there is a deal to be had at some point and could prove to use their outrage as a pressure point to get Assad to agree to a lesser deal and in turn Assad does it in order for him to secure his spot in power for the future beyond the war . If your powerbase starts to lose support for you its only a matter of time before it starts to hit you militarily as well politically if such loss of support becomes widespread. You can think of this as a form of greed if you will. If one becomes too greedy it might come back to bite you in the ass. Ergo if the SAA pushes its citizens too hard regardless of rationale it might end up hurting the SAA later. Its a risk which at the moment Id say is minimal right now. This time next year it could be elevated though depending on what happens.warweariness becomes more acute in civilwars when your side the government in this case loses a number of bases and is perceived to be in a longstruggle aka feels like no end in sight. It doesnt help when you begin to lose so many brotherssisterscousinsfriends. The more one loses the more it tests ones patienceloyalty to the cause. gt Nothing like that is possible in Syria. Everyone knows they have to suck it up and keep going because there is no alternative.Its about the idea of internal pressure to get a deal done. Its not just lets sit on our hands and do nothing. There have been quite a bit of internal heat on a number of semihighofficials some of whom have been sacked and calls for even higherofficials to be sacked as well.          Like I said the internal pressure can rise to a level Assad is not ready to handle which is why its a delicate thing to put so much pressure on the citizens under your control. Aka there is a reason why certain highend placesareas havent been particularly targeted for the draftdraft dodgers. Its just a good way to pissoff a huge part of your support base.        ,syriancivilwar,cn3j8p2,2,t5_2x5s1

Even if the Kurdish autonomous zones could pump as much oil as the southern oil fields theyd be forced to truck it by land as the port of Basra wouldnt be open to them.The southern oil fields and the overwhelmingly Shia population that live in the South are literally carrying Iraq on their back economically. If the Kurdish autonomous zones or Sunni majority areas in Iraq decided to go for independence it would be economic suicide. A lot of Southern Iraqis recognize this and there is even a small movement calling for Southern secession.

If you reserach academic papers you will see Takfiri is a commonly used term Edit Rafida is offensive because its a sectarian slur aimed at criticizing Shia for rejected Abu Bakr  Umar and Uthman as the legitimate successors of Muhammed. Nusayri is a commonly accepted as a sectarian slur targeting alawites and is connected to Ibn Nasyr. However Takfiri is by all academic journalistic and religious accounts the term used to describe some who practices Takfir. Its not sectarian its simple correct by definition. Someone who  practices singer is caller a Singer someone who practices and subscribes to Takfir is called a Takfiri. If Shias in Lebanon were declaring Sunnis to be non Muslims then I am sure they too would be justified in be called Takfiris as well as they would be practicing Takfir according to Salafist ideologies.,syriancivilwar,cnnvb1j,8,t5_2x5s1

2870534,0,t1_cnubk4i,gt Is this a serious question? The West has been for better and more likely for worse mostly crushing predominantly Muslim states for literally  years. The only real exception to this is the Ummayids invasion of Spain.No they didnt at most in the last  years maybe but the last  years is dumb. The Crusades were a match that ended up with the Levant in Muslim hands. North Africa is Muslim. The Mediterranean was a constant battlegroundalliances between both. World War I led to Allied powers completely losing control of Turkey and any nonMuslim and Muslim not matching the new modern secular Turkish state removed with the British Italians Greeks and French retreating. Egypt managed to politically defeat both Britain and France AND YES the USSR and the USA had a lot to do with that but Nassers diplomacy proved vital and the most important to the retreat of the BritsFrench when he played both sides and basically killed the British Empire. Afghanistan still haunts the nightmares of the British army and the bones of the British killed in the Khyber Pass are still there. Oh and Im not sure about what the West is here as it is a modern construct but it sure doesnt count Russia who did most of the wars. Britain and France might count if you consider Africa and India but to call them allies during that point is a bit too much. ,syriancivilwar,cnudpjy,1,t5_2x5s1

Based on how ingrained Nusrah is with AQ it seems rather unlikely this move would be anything other than nominally. Zawahiri supposedly signing off on this should be a good indication of this. Purely just conjecture but it could have something to do with Ahrar. Ahrar is essentially AQ  or AQ Jr in Syria. AQ helped found it and several AQ guys have or are in leadership positions. Not to mention how closely Ahrar and JN operate. It would seem as if Ahrar has been a side project of AQ in Syria and if confirmed it seems likely AQ would want to merge the two projects. The only problem is the funding Ahrar receives from Qatar. Im sure Ahrar doesnt want to lose this nor do its allies or AQ. So a stipulation for Ahrar joining Nusrah would be that Nusrah cut ties with AQC. Of course this cant be confirmed as of right now and Im not saying this is whats happening. Just simply airing my thoughts. Either way Zawahiri supposedly signing off on this is the key takeaway of this. Theyll still be connected to AQ either way. Also a group doesnt have to be concerned with targeting the far enemy to be in AQ. That seems to be a misunderstanding of AQ as they have always been heavily involved in local insurgencies.

Nope the YPG currently outside the borders of Kobane Canton in Raqqa governate. In any case you could make the same point about Hizbollah.. Go tell that to IS that the US never bombed them in Jarabulus. The YPG successfully conducted the hardest thing in war  a fighting retreat. They traded space for time and used that time to prepare defenses in Kobane and get in enough reinforcements from Qandil. And it worked.I find it quite likely that antiAssad governments  France particularly  will give YPG good enough antiair weapons to make SAAs already poor ground support even less effective.As well the SAA doesnt have a functional air base within helo range of Hasake or Qamlishi and Kobane isnt going to see meaningful numbers of civilians return in the next  months.That leaves Erfin as a target for strategic bombing and good luck making the decision to fly low enough to avoid NATO AA against unidentified air targets and high enough to avoid YPG ground fire..

The only major cities out of his reach are Saraqib Nawa Marraatt and Raqqa.Assad is winning but at this pace itll take years. Some major battles need to to be won to make sure that he can move troops around. If this doesnt happen itll likely stay the same. A win on one of the threefour major fronts would likely mean the Government will win since the troops can be repositioned to the others. The threefour fronts Im talking about are Aleppo Ghouta Southern and the Eastern HomsPalmyraDeZ front possibly Idlib as well.The SAA itself is in good shape it suffers from manpower shortage but that is far more likely to be because of the number of deployments not that theyre running out. The numbers that are flying around are always between   and  . Advanced ammunition and weapons is something theyre also lacking in great numbers this is especially the case for the SYaaF.Besides the SAARepublicans there are thousands of other troops. The triggerhappy people in the NDF   professional soldiers from Hezbollah and the Iranians a few . Moreover theyve got even more help from tribal groups in Hasakah and DeZ Baath brigades on several fronts and several reports mention Afghani troops as well. Their numbers however I do not know.An interesting extra finding is IMO that current fighting is starting to become extremely heavy. This is seen in the south and especially in Aleppo where Nusra has been fighting very hard to keep their supply lines running. The opposite seems to happen in Damascus where small reports are always coming through that the people there are very dissatisfied with the rebels rebels surrendering and SAA advances. ,syriancivilwar,cpab5v3,18,t5_2x5s1

But ideologically hes a pretty standard Iraqi Baathi still. Secular nationalistic progressive modernist guy. Most of the intellectuals and technocrats and other nationalistic drivers of progress were direct members of the party which numbered at least . million and all those people were with them because the Baath ruled the politics of course and thats how you were able to be involved in the political process. As you know the theme in the Mideast for the last couple hundred years is its always the educated technocratic elite who drive reforms and progress and this was especially the case in places like Turkey Egypt Iraq at various points. The undoing of reBaathification thats coming about is allowing all those screwedover smart nationalistic and intelligent Iraqis to get involved in things again. Even PM Abadi knew it was a terrible mistake since it removed so many useful Iraqis from the political process. He probably got migraines from his Islamic Dawa party over his decisions.We talked about King Faisal Is observation of the great divisions and anarchic tendencies that plague Iraqi society and how Iraq is starting to revert to that. Well Abadi is trying to prevent that. If a secular nationalistic elite does not lead Iraq it will continue to revert to that era of division backwardness and ignorance.Hopefully they will join Allawis INA party since its seemingly the only secularnationalistic one in the country. I cannot even fathom how anyone thought that removing most of the countrys smart and educated and nationalistic people from the political process is in any way a good idea but Bremer and Maliki apparently did.,syriancivilwar,cq1rb2v,1,t5_2x5s1

3680640,0,t1_cqbhkgv,Its very hard to predict how the year will end for them considering the rumblings from Turkey and the Saudis the Iranian nuclear deal and the troubled economies of Syrian backers Iran and Russia. As it is currently Id expect to see a stalemate or some advances in Deir ezZor some gains in the South but probably some previously captured areas being retaken by rebels. Aleppo will see the SAA digging in around the North of the city some positions will be overrun they dont have the manpower to protect every area.Predictions for  major factorsIran Successful nuclear deal  Iran abides by its nuclear commitments for now the US possibly EU quietly ends support for the rebels Saudis and other regional actors maintain theirs. With a resurgent economy Iran greatly increase material and financial support to Syria and likely Yemen with a view to creating a distraction for Saudi armed forces probable Houthi victory situation in Syria may stabilise expect Houthi manpower in Syria in exchange for Iranian support. Unsuccessful nuclear deal  Iran funds a crash nuclear program Saudi Arabia and Turkey increase funding and material supplies to rebels probable military action against proxies in Yemen and potentially Syria with an act now or never mentality offensive likely to fail in achieving its aims in Yemen turns Syria in to failed state similar to Libya. Iran develops and tests several devices within a year likely development of small nuclear arsenal. Upsurge in destabilisation attempts including sanctions and domestic unrest. Probable regional arms race may lead to longterm stability for surviving countries.Russia Economic stabilisation  economy stabilises support for Syria maintained Iran receives S bolstering defence and stability possible strengthening of rial successful trade programs with Iran and far East sure up economy further. Economy continues decline  Population hit by sanctions and economic hardships increases in nationalistic fervour fuelling support for conflicts in Syria and Ukraine this does not necessarily result in an upsurge in violence but will be used if Russian state sees benefit. State likely to offer advanced weaponry to countries aligned against Western and Saudi interests in exchange for goods or money. Possibility of political extremists gaining traction Putin unlikely to be dislodged but may be weakened. Possibility of advanced weaponry S etc. being offered to Iran. Decline in financial support for Syria. Possible support for Yemen to pressure Saudis unlikely.May have missed some things and this is only my interpretation there are many other possibilities,syriancivilwar,cqbtf66,4,t5_2x5s1

This dates back to the French Rule when the French relied heavily on Alawites for its rule in Syria because they were a minority community.During Salah Jadids time many of the top officers were Alawites but after Hafez came to power he began to change this.  There was a period when Hafez was sick and was in hospital he temporarily handed power to a group of all Sunnis to rule while he was gone.

Hills road landmark  at  seconds in the video we see in the lower right corner of the video a hill road that I believe to be route  this is due primarily to the plantations being at odd angles to it rather than flush with the road as is the case with the roads to the North and South of route   Map Domed building Landmark  the domed building seen at  seconds in the bottom left of the video is I believe the domed building located here While there are other possibilities I believe this one to be the most likely candidate due to its  dome segments  of which would be visible from any one side also the coloration darker than the surrounding concrete yet not so dark as other domes in and around Jisr and lack of an adjacent minaret or background water tower which discounts many of the other candidate domes in Jisr. Distance from dome to hospital m Distance of parachute This is hard to determine looking at the earliest point in the video where the parachute is visible while the camera remains unzoomed at  seconds and assuming that the parachute and cargo have a height of around  meters I would estimate this to be around  meters distant placing it at the extreme SW of the hospital or in the countryside slightly beyond it image,syriancivilwar,crdywoz,1,t5_2x5s1

4040835,0,t1_crgqrz6,Sharia is the name for a legal system whose body of law is derived from religious prophecy rather than human legislation. Interpretation and judgement is performed by Muslim clerics similar to ordained priests in Christianity and enforcement is handled by Islamic religious police.Sharia is sometimes seen as invasive for example it has policies for sexual intercourse hygiene prayer etiquettedecorum and so forth.It is often considered the infallible law of God and thus attempts at reform are usually met with outright hostility and accusations of apostasy undermining the authority of Islam. Furthermore as it is considered divine alternatives to Sharia secular bodies of law for example case lawcommon law thats based on precedents set previously are treated with similar hostility even to the point that citizens refuse to acknowledge those legal systems apply to them during regular court proceedings.Now that Sharia has been defined we must address the slander directed towards Sharia  it is from a darker age. Indeed intellectual discourse with regards to debating the validity of Sharia and discussing potential reforms are met with hostility and indeed it is generally thought to be a regression from liberal and progressive values so it is difficult to deny accusations that Sharia is medieval.A Sharia scholar would for example argue that interest in progressive values are indicative of a decline in society as not only are they incompatible with Islam in that they encourage unIslamic behaviour but any logical person would see that said progressive values are dangerous and regressive themselves.,syriancivilwar,crgvwcb,9,t5_2x5s1

4151005,0,t1_crt3bdg,Thank you for detailing the nationalistsecular issue.  It makes good sense in the way that you describe.The regime which we must remember is just a word meaning a form of government is not built on sand.   The Assads have lasted for decades carefully tweaking institutions and agencies as to work in their favor. The regime has those who are loyal to it and those that cling to it. The foundation is sound but the building is facing a tornado.This is where I now disagree with you.  Previously everything you describe was exactly as you state.  Those Syrian citizens were forced to live under just those very conditions you describe.  However those days are now gone.  Gone forever and there is now no going back.What the SAA is suffering is a shortage of reliable soldiers and talented officers.Surely wars cannot be won under such circumstances?  The word reliable would surely signal the death knell to any such national army.Stop focusing on Sunnis When you have a  percent Sunni majority  I would consider it far too dangerous to lose that focus.    The majority of Sunni deaths have been committed by the regime. Not ISIS.  If it was YOUR family which had been barrelbombed tortured or even maimed the hatred would be directed against Assad and not those foreign jihadists.   Many people fail to understand this very important factor.You say the men will fall back to their moderate ways but I dont think so.  If the fighters truly were moderates why would the fighters just follow the orders of some islamist when they are holding the guns?Youre right the men who were religious at the start of this conflict almost certainly wont convert to more moderate ways.  I agree with you also by saying that many will have been radicalised during this period.   However I also believe that many thousands of moderates will have joined these radical groups simply to take up arms against the regime who they consider to be a mass murderer. Its not difficult to understand what drives such men to seek retribution.If I was a disaffected Syrian male it would certainly drive me.,syriancivilwar,crtffru,0,t5_2x5s1

I think the final possibility could be the most significant the pockets of resistance scattered throughout government control are not entirely secured against either infiltration or exfiltration ergo the territory surrounding them can be considered porous and permissive to sedition they weaken the supply lines in proximity to them and divert resources from key frontline areas. Clearing these areas would firstly cement the governments claim to these territories and secondly through restoration of local security strengthen the front line areas from which these pockets sap troops and resources.,syriancivilwar,cru61or,3,t5_2x5s1

Remember that the civilians from enemy countries where the country isnt a dictatorship like USA and Europe are paying for the war they pay taxes the bombs that kill civilians here are paid by someone in USA and they can vote as well they voted for their president and they voted for the war.  Fighting in the sacred month is for aggression committed in the sacred month and for all violations is legal retribution. So whoever has assaulted you then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you. And fear Allah and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.  And if you punish an enemy O believers punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed.

No so why the Turkish flag? They are straight up Turks joining ISIS or working with them! Do you need them to publicly announce it for it to be obvious. Dont try to play dumb and think we are dumb. The same way in  they sent  commandos they are probably sending in units organising ISIS and sharing intel.If the Turks were attacking ISIS on the borders and real battles going on or if they were actually bombing them this would be a different story nobody could logically claim Turkey is linked with ISIS or vis versa the Turkish IDs argument wouldnt make sense but when theres evidence like the article I mentioned explaining in detail of how they are being given access into Turkey being told not to fear them not one single account of Turkey shooting at ISIS. Then they are clearly not part of the solution.gt They didnt stop when IS attacked civilians inside of Turkeys borders and they didnt stop when IS forced them to abandon the tomb.IS attacked civilians inside Turkeys borders? Yeah when they kill FSA rebel leaders or kill targets within Turkey thats considered attacking civilians..Finally ISIS never forced them to abandon the tomb.... After Kobani was completely cleared and YPG was fully pushing ISIS back Turkey suddenly decides to enter Kobani drive through Syria and reallocate the tomb in Kurdish areas? The reality is they wanted to get involved as they saw ISIS couldnt do it they wanted to instigate a clash with the YPG. They put the ball in YPGs court to deny them access so they can look like they were being denied by the YPG to cross in..

This has even larger implication the alliance between Saudi Arabia and Turkey might weaken especially as Iran gains more influence. This election might be the split in power that Iran and Syria can exploit to regain the momentum in Syria. ,syriancivilwar,crytw96,21,t5_2x5s1

4310994,0,t1_csba53h,A combination of both. Some planes were simply frozen meaning they were hidden in hangars for years and all of sudden they were brought out and put in duty without being serviced. If you know a little bit about aviation youd know that every plane has to be serviced every certain number of hours. Example at  hrs you do a quick check at  you do a bigger check then at  another check and at  you do a full service check where the plane is stripped down and remounted. That was not done or often theyd skip it for various reasons. Before the war it was because of corruption and after the war it was lack of parts and qualified personnel. A lot of planes parts were obsolete and they were completely discontinued by Russia. Believe it or not many planes were grounded because they were missing screws or rubber gaskets for fuel tanks. They would machine parts in Aleppo sometimes but it was not up to the industry standards. They didnt care and often planes would catch fire on takeoff or in flight. You never knew what would happen when you applied afterburners. We had planes reach the point of disintegration because of damage caused by violent oscillation and vibration.,syriancivilwar,csbkq9r,8,t5_2x5s1

4328448,0,t1_csdjcnn,February  the United States planned a coup against the government of Iraq headed by dictator Abd alKarim Qasim who two years earlier had deposed the Westernallied Iraqi monarchy. The US was concerned about the growing influence of Iraqi Communist Party government officials under his administration as well as his threats to invade Kuwait which almost caused a war between Iraq and Englandcitation needed.According to the Church Committee the CIA planned a special operation to incapacitate an Iraqi Colonel believed to be promoting Soviet bloc political interests in Iraq. The aim was to send Qasim a poisoned handkerchief which while not likely to result in total disablement would be certain to prevent the target from pursuing his usual activities for a minimum of three months. During the course of the Committees investigation the CIA stated that the handkerchief was in fact never received if indeed sent. It added that the colonel Suffered a terminal illness before a firing squad in Baghdad an event we had nothing to do with after our handkerchief proposal was considered.Saddam was the fool who screwed up attempt  but shooting too early. Some training.  People that arent the CIA can plan and execute coups like Pinochet and many Turkish Pakistani and Thai generals. ,syriancivilwar,csdjnb8,3,t5_2x5s1

4354713,0,t1_csgh9ug,IS and Rojava cannot both exist  they are polar opposites.Therefore YPG military strategy is about destroying IS first and foremost.This also provides American air support which is pretty useful.One of the strategic advantages IS has is an open Turkish border for their fighters and supplies  if this is to be closed it needs to be done on the Syrian side. Part one of this has been done with the Tal Abayd operation. Part two could be Jarabulus or it could be via SarrinManbij or it could be Raqqa.If any of those were to fall then IS would be isolated from the Turkish border and would find resupply much harder.Politically the YPG is one of the forces within a coalition  its the biggest and most militarily important but if Rojava is going to succeed then it cannot just be a Kurdish thing. Therefore youll see attention paid to helping Arab Syrians like ShamsalShamal Liwa Thuwar alRaqqa and the Shammar tribe achieve their political goals ie liberate their areas from IS control.Then there is the issue of the Kurdish pocket in Aleppo and the big one  the relationship with the regime.Sooner or later IS is going to be broken in Syria and the question of the Regime forces in Hasake and DEZ comes into play.All Ill say on that is I dont believe they would ever surrender to IS but if they were offered American guarantees of safe conduct I suspect you might have quite a few surrenders.,syriancivilwar,csgibwo,7,t5_2x5s1

4458562,0,t1_csrh9jr,gtIf Turkey provokes a fullscale war against the Kurds who have grown stronger with two years of peace tacit international backing and a foothold in Syria its not impossible to foresee a minority of Turkeys Sunnis  of the nations population in this event siding with IS whether out of real oppression or smart propaganda as a local defense against perceived YPG persecution. Lets hope it never gets to that point. But just remember how crazy this would have sounded regarding Syria Iraq Libya and Egypt just four years ago.gtSo an IS presence in Turkey is not impossible it could happen and some say its already happening on a very quiet and small scale. Now it wouldnt be a land invasion directly from Syria. Instead IS would establish a localized insurgency that would grow with Sunni dissent and only within the power vacuum areas afflicted by ethnic conflict or disputed governance. If you forced me to make a statistical bet which Id decline Id bet on a  percent chance IS could establish a small territorial presence and a  percent chance of establishing a Sinaiesque insurgency in Turkey within the next five years at this point.  percent chance nothing will happen and Turkey will remain a peaceful country. But this is just contingency planning prepare for everything.You should be ashamed of typing up something this absurd. The whole premise of ISIS starting an insurgency in Turkey is akin to the KKK starting an civil war in Canada to attack the local black population. Such a notion is outlandish outrageous and plain preposterous. In fact your scenario is worse because ISIS isnt even fixated on Kurds the way the KKK is fixated on blacks. ,syriancivilwar,cssol4k,1,t5_2x5s1

France Cyprus an Italy however demanded a rescue of Greece and were succesful at least about for a year or something I hardley doubt this money will be enough to safe Greece. Never forget about Germany that they lost WII so their influnce in the world shouldnt be overestimated especially in military issues. I think Germany was kind of succesful in this Ukraine issue because Germany sells the hightechnology stuff which Russia needs in order to keep up with other developed nations again. In this NATO issue however they have almost nothing to say at all. The only nation which could really intervene there against Turkey is the US and they already signalised that they are fine with Turkeys actions. So no worries and I think this trimming of the PKK is also in the interest of the US because netherless their biggest Kurdish ally are the Peshmergas and the PKK became latley a competetor to them in Iraq. ,syriancivilwar,cth2fcm,0,t5_2x5s1

Most of the context for the looting and corruption and even parts of the tacit civil war was the disillusion of the state or large parts of it and its employees it created the new elites and patronage systems who are hungry for money and power etc with sane US policy planners in charge there doesnt seem to be much reason why Iraq couldnt continue on the path of development that it was on before the first iraq war or even the iraniraq war.

Despite having a prewar population of only around  thousand there are currently over  million residing in the canton. The new industrial park is helping to employ thousands of people.All work in the industrial park is organized by committees unions and civil society organizations attached to the communes...Selah Misto one of the administrators of the industrial union explained that procedures have been developed into order to ensure work proceeds in an orderly fashion and that all work was organized by committees attached to the production communes. He added that communes have already been formed to produce such goods as iron products batteries and automotive parts. Coordination between communes has helped to overcome problems with production and the newly founded committees work to provide expertise and oversight.Communal Economy Grows in Rojava Despite War July  Right now in Efrn there are  soap factories  olive oil factores  olive processing plants  factories making construction material  textile workshops  shoe factories  factories producing nylon  factories processing marble.  mills and  hotels have been built.

We forbid the founding of any more olive factories from an environmental perspective.

4801576,0,t1_ctzr13x,I specifically went out of my way to say that when theyre fired in an unaimed manner they are just as horrible. . I condemn indiscriminate shelling as harshly as I condemn barrel bombing. I made that pretty clear. And this isnt the side I support. I have also made that abundantly clear. I am not a fan of the Syrian regime but despite my reservations I find them far more palatable than most of the Syrian opposition.But youre comparing the two as though theyre similar when theyre not. At all. The propane canister rounds are roughly  lbs when full. There have been several youtube videos about the construction of the Hell Cannons and at least two separate videos said the canisters weigh roughly  kilos so slightly more than  lbs. Which is actually pretty heavy compared to most mortar rounds. But its absolutely nothing compared to a barrel bomb. You cannot compare the blast yield of a  lb explosive to the blast year of a  lb explosive. The hell cannon usually cant even break through a roof. A barrel bomb can literally collapse an apartment building. There is NO WAY to compare the two in terms of their felt impact pound for pound. Moreover the video you linked to literally says in the title that the size of that explosion is from hitting an arms cache. Take a look at the  of them linked in PurpleOlives compilation for a better idea.But your argument falls flat when you try to compare the unguided aspects of both. The barrel bomb is literally tumbled out the back of a helicopter at  feet moving  miles per hour. There is ZERO aiming. None whatsoever. It is literally Are we above X city or Y neighborhood? Drop it. There is ZERO accountability of where it will fall other than on the city. In VERY stark contrast Hell Cannons can and ARE aimed. Not always and when theyre just fired willynilly at a city FUCK THOSE PEOPLE they clearly have zero care about the lives of civilians in that city. You will NEVER hear me defending the position of indiscriminate shelling or bombing. But when theyre used for aimed fire its no different than using a mortar. You can aim adjust reaim and place the same round in the same place over and over and over.upurpleolive created a compilation of  Hell Cannon strikes. From the first  strikes you can watch them put the rounds within a few meters of each other  Video is here . There is absolutely no comparison in terms of the blast yield over  times higher in most of the barrel bombs weve seen or the accuracy achievable with many Hell Cannons totally unachievable with a barrel bomb.Condemn the indiscriminate shelling of Fuah and Kafraya. Or Nubl and Zahra. Or dozens of places in Syria where the armed opposition has more or less said If you live here were bombing you. Those are inexcusable horrific and systemic. They deserve every bit of condemnation. But the Hell Cannon is not as intrinsically indiscriminate as barrel bombing and comes nowhere close to the level of destruction as a barrel bomb can. You cannot seriously compare this Hell Cannon shot which hit its target by the way with the likes of this barrel bomb explosionIn contrast I would strongly suggest you finish the PurpleOlive compilation its rough and then watch this  minute compilation of barrel bombs dropped on Darayya There is no comparison at all in terms of the raw power.,syriancivilwar,ctzs18v,10,t5_2x5s1

It negotiates with a few key tribal sheikhs promising them de facto rule over the Syrian interior in exchange for supporting the government  perhaps Assad can even nominate a Bedouin as his handpicked successor. Tribes join NDF brigades like the Shaytat with the SAA supplying weapons and officers. Once it reaches a critical mass most of the remaining IS fighters would realise that theyre backing the wrong horse and defect. All that the government needs is plenty of money to buy off the sheikhs but hopefully the Iran deal will give them that.

The CIA did provide some funds to the Pakistani intelligence who were in charge of getting cash and arms to the mujaheddin in Afghanistan and some of that likely found its way to the nascent alQaeda. But there wasnt any direct link. AlQaeda themselves werent that big a deal at the time and there were much bigger and more successful insurgent groups in Afghanistan at the time which were more deserving of support. The vast majority AlQaedas funding and manpower came from either bin Ladens own person coffers or from donation by sympathisers mostly in Saudi Arabia including parts of the government.

Kavkaz Center is in no way representative of Chechens or even all Islamists at this point. Its run by Udugov brothers guys sitting in Turkey and responsible for creating the Caucasus Emirate. They have been harping on this bad West persecuting Muslims message since forever and using it against proEuropean Chechens. Its basically a RussiaToday guised in Islamist colors. Here are few stories from Austrian Chechens and their problems integrating just so my comment doesnt sound too curt. At the beginning one guy found it hard to learn the language because he had no local friends. Then he found it hard to find local friends because all he did at that time was attending language classes along with other migrants. He couldnt apply for a job without knowing the language he couldnt afford much in terms of hobbies and as nondrinker he didnt attend barsclubs. After much thought and observations he noticed that locals are fond of dogs and usually chat while walking their dogs. He didnt like dogs enough to get one but decided to ask neighbors to allow him to walk their dog so that he could meet people.Another guy was turned down from joining the Austrian Military. He is a veteran of both wars more experienced and skilled than most todays Chechen fighters and commanders. Yet despite all of that they found some formal pretext to turn him down.

I say that because in the US weve got a history of strong civic institutions that arent tied to one person that people believe in and a shared national identity whereas in Syria you dont have those especially national identity at least when you compare it to say ethnic or religious identity.  I say Cheney probably believed in what he was doing because we all grow up drinking the same coolaid as it were in America and I doubt Bashar had that same experience.As far calling things Bashars X hes the head of the armed forces the chief of state who has veeeery strong constitutional powers and who heads the party thats also guaranteed a perpetual majority in government again because of the constitution.  Did I mention that party is also based on a single ruling family his family?  Its the Syrian Arab Army but its also Bashars army Bashars government etc.  I mean thats just the way it is.

There was that army base outside Maarat al Numan that fell OctNov last year if I remember correctly. etc.Bear in mind that government forces can still resupply from the air.If they encircle government forces they need to be absolutely sure they have the strength to completely destroy them.

The US really wanted to intervene in the first few months but Russia cock blocked the UN so we sat on our asses until the radical islamist elements came in and took over the fight. now its something different that only regional politics can solve. Just as much as Japanese ministers cant come to the US and solve the abortion debate in US politics the west cant come over to the middleeast and solve sectarian violence. Its a political battle no military can win.   That said this whole thing wasnt sectarian to start. Assad played it up as an assault on his Alawite community  that if you were a rebel against him you were actually antiShia. This radicalized the whole fight and made it into a religious thing.

5200353,0,t1_cvctt0t,I have not seen any indication by Russia wanting to kick Bashar out.In addition the more moderate insurgents are a small minority and I dont believe the only reason theyre fighting and refusing talks is because Bashar is still president. They started out as defecting generals staging a revolt anyways an extremely common theme in Syrian history to take power and establish a new military dictatorship except they were far more successful in those occasions in the past. There was a single year in which  separate military dictatorships were established.I really dont think Assad is the only thing keeping these rebels from talks. They certainly have their own ambitions. Theyre not anywhere near as extreme as those of the jihadist groups but theyre not selfless either. Meanwhile the jihadis who comprise the overwhelming majority want nothing short of turning the country upsidedown and establishing an Islamic theocratic regime but will no doubt still be competing and fighting against each other for power. ,syriancivilwar,cvcu3ge,0,t5_2x5s1

5320582,0,t1_cvrpyux,Wrong. Printing money is among the safest macroeconomic interventions possible. Raising interest rates cutting government spendingtaxation raising taxes removing barriers to exports  are all far more dangerous than printing money. However printing money is annoying for the extremely influential moneylending class who have large amounts owed to them in nonadjustable interest loans. In addition most people have moral objections to it. This leads to a frankly incredible amount of ignorance that pours out whenever the subject is raised. What printing money does is create demand. When there is too much demand in an economy you get price instability which can have negative consequences. Note that the uncertainty of price instability is far better than the certainty of falling incomesales that happens when demand crashes in an economy. The two things are not comparable in terms of the damage they cause. Nevertheless too much price instability is bad  it makes lending money more risky and in general buying anything becomes more complicated which you dont want. But price instability has an easy fix  reducing demand. This can be done in several ways raise interest rates until demand falls to acceptable levels. Increase taxes until demand falls to acceptable levels this has obvious secondary benefits in terms of the governments balance sheet! Cut government spending until demand falls to acceptable levels ditto! The damage done by an overheated economy and the difficulty of getting out of that state are incomparable in magnitude to the damage done by a depressed economy and the difficulty of exiting it. Unfortunately due to populist moral objections and the self interest of the banking elite this reality is not exploited to prevent tremendous human suffering and stagnation. How does this relate to Russia? Well besides doing away with the absurd notion that the Russian economy will be harmed by their escapades abroad it doesnt have that much relevance. Russian unemployment looks pretty low. The misconceptions I correct above are of tremendous importance when unemployment is high and rapidly drop off in importance as the unemployment level drops. However the Russian economy is hardly booming and these realities could be all too relevant for them soon. Just as they presently are in many places in Europe. ,syriancivilwar,cvrrlxh,14,t5_2x5s1

Sixteen main rotor blades six tail blades six engines and five drive shafts were damaged beyond repair. In one squadron only a single helicopter was deemed fit to fly. It took a month until the th Regiment was ready to fight again. The casualties sustained by the Apaches induced a change of tactics by placing significant restrictions on their use.Its just very hard to make a helicopter truly bulletproof.

The layout of the sensors is very similar wings on the same side tail fins attached to fuselage and angled a little tubular shape except flat bottom front wing wider. Why it looks so DIY might be from various reasons perhaps that its used only once or that these are protos.High probability this is the AeroVironment prototype of a LMAM Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile. The article says these have been fielded in limited numbers to Afghanistan and that three other companies are working on their versions too thats probably why there have been confusion about what is a Switchblade and how it should look.

5584459,0,t1_cwpa86t,From what I have seen in the past few months that seems to be norm. The SAA and its supporting militias gets attacked inside a village or town of decent geographical proportions and also they have checkpoints outside but instead of regrouping into several layers inside to draw out the fight they either mount a brief defense and move back  kms or just move out  kilometers. If they stay in continue a prolonged firefight they could be reinforced in less than an hour and have a steady flow of replacements in . However they dont and I would say that collapsing and running out of village during the day over open ground while in full sight of the positions you just gave up makes you a very easy target. And a  mm machine gun with a scope mounted on it Hathcock style takes out targets like that with a single burst semi reliably at distances that a even a fast running man needs some time to cross. Now the second problem I have with this situation are the attempts to try to muster a force that already collapsed the previous night augment it with some reinforcements and try to send it twice in to assault a village in the span of  hours. They would just break upon contact. Give them time to rest resupply and regain some morale. Make them do some marching at a parade ground if nothing else. It sounds weird if you havent seen its effect but that would at least establish a higher baseline for their morale and restore cohesion to some level.,syriancivilwar,cwpay8g,6,t5_2x5s1

The report from Al Jazeera which Bill Roggio excerpts at the invaluable Long War Journal has the FSA commander making these remarks less than two weeks ago. Just a couple of days later came another nugget from the alQaeda side of the rebel equation A top leader of one of the terror networks two major Syrian affiliates which calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant told Al Jazeera that the FSA is actually providing alQaeda with weapons. We are buying weapons from the FSA he asserted. We bought  antiaircraft missiles and Koncourse antitank weapons. We have good relations with our brothers in the FSA. For us the infidels are those who cooperate with the West to fight Islam. ...gtContrary to the authors claim foreign fighters are not flocking to Syria because they are affiliated with alQaeda. They are reacting to a fatwa issued in May by Sheikh Yusuf alQaradawi the worlds most influential Sunni sharia authority and the Muslim Brotherhoods chief jurist. Qaradawi declared that the jihad in Syria against Assad and his Shiite backers  primarily Iranbacked Hezbollah  is a duty for every ablebodied Muslim who is trained to fight. In  THOUSANDS of FSA defected to alQaedas official franchise in Syria alNusra. This is because their ranks were and to this day are filled with sectarian extremists.

5682008,0,t1_cx16oih,I disagree completely. While the USSR may have seen opportunity initially the near immediate  reaction of the Islamic Republic regime was to imprison and torture  members of the Soviet Unions puppet party the Tudeh Party. In fact its alleged in the generally unreliable but perhaps reasonable Mitrokhin Archives that a KGB defector to MI supplied them with information on Tudeh membership which was then shared with the Iranians as part of IranContra. As regards Iraq the Americans werent antagonistic to the whole country just the Qasim regime because it was close to the Soviet Union and wanted to create a model Sovietstyle state ironically their primary arms supplier was the British. There was significant American involvement in the Baathist coup in February  against the Qasim regime and the Americans courted the Iraqi Baath party numerous times in the years since as they were felt to be the best possible group to work with in the region in terms of those groups that had any significant influence. Any antagonism with Iraq in the s was motivated by fear that the power struggles within the ruling class would spiral out of control and destabilize the nation and in the s the Americans became antagonistic because the Iraqi regime had begun to threaten the Saudi one as a way of staying in power. If there was a major enemy of America it was Nassers Egypt in the s and early s which lead to two Israeli wars to demolish that state. ,syriancivilwar,cx1eqdb,1,t5_2x5s1

Says someone who has never experienced the real fear of being wiped out just because of who you are. I have. I was a refugee from a war that killed even more people than what Syria has been through. Its paralysing fear that spreads and causes people to act in ways they wouldnt normally. You dont see people as individuals but in the identity group they belong to. In my case it was tribal in Syria its sects. Either way in times like that people are forced to leave their homes and congregate around each other in safety. Mixed neighbourhoods are a tragic place to be especially when your in a minority.That is exactly what Syria faced and why the Syrian government kept thousands of troops stationed in the city. The constant attacks by Farouq Brigade and other Homsi rebels turned all of Homs into a sectarian powder keg. If you were an Alawite you avoided Sunni areas and didnt drive through them. If you did you would die.

If you are asking me for opinion of veracity of the tracks as provided all I would say it is more likely than not a legit readout of what the Link connected radars were showing to Turkey. It is a huge pain in the ass to go in and manually add plots to a track eg fake it to the point that I doubt that a Turkish radar operator would have done so in this short of a time since the incident unless it was some premeditated conspiracyEdit since people are asking Ill try to clarify what I canwhy doesnt it show more detail of map you can easily add or remove map overlays for countiesdistrictscitiesairbasesetc most operators will customize this for their own information clarity eg in this case whoever told the operator to retrieve this data for a screenshot probably wanted a clean display of the trackswhat am I looking at in the general sense radar tracking automatically combined from multiple sources and broadcast through the Link  network. in the specific sense the lines are movement tracks the arches with F in them are the current link position as of the specified time of data retrieval of friendly Turkish aircraft so you see Turkish Fs designated MM and MM.  the red Ms designated HH and HH are current link position of nonfriendly aircraft in military terms dont read too much into it just planes that arent yours basically as of the specified time of data retrieval. the tracks reaching ahead of three of these entities are a bit difficult to explain it is in laymens terms that the radar data for this movement hasnt been  associated with the existing track yet and when it does that entity marker friendly arch or the red M will be updated to the latest position along that track.could it be photoshopped yeah it is clearly an image it is possible i am not here to play political whatifisms only to explain what is displayed. though if you ask me it looks like what i saw on a typical day in terms of consistency of lines and plots and all down to funky aliasing of the lines from low display resolution making them appear crooked to a close eye nothing strikes me as incongruent manipulation.,syriancivilwar,cxb94pe,6,t5_2x5s1

Dont get me wrong I do not wish the summon up the atrocities of the th century and I fully believe in their recent vision of nonaggressiveness specially when it is fulled by deep shame. Its just that... Europeans know how to get shit done  no matter what kind of shit. Its like you can center yourselves fully into something in such a... methodical way. Which is wonderful  of the time.   The EU has a large GDP and brilliant minds. All they need is a joint effort and the resolution to rise their military spending ratio to become military beasts. Its just that you guys dont want it..... which is ALWAYS a good thing .  And Yeah... they cant openly say it but when you see them talking of diplomatic resolution allowing the Regime to continue... Its a good signal that on the Backstage that is starting to get accepted. And want it or not there are  main sources of diplomatic strength inside the EU  The two Permanent Security Council countries and the main backer for the continental union. Their position is surely not definitive but heavily influential.  And I agree with the outcome. I know its not wise to try to predict any kind of outcome to any war specially one as intricate and complicated as this one but I think we will probably see a Baathist rule after the end of this war  but not with Assad. Which is good for those that wish in being trialed for his action as the rise of another big leadership in the party may both refresh its ideas or not and build another strong figure  making the latter every time more dispensable.

However I think this is far fetched. This is about US geopolitical interests not directed at Rojava. Even more I think the Obama admin did try to overcome failures of the past and they clearly seek partners who are reliable and have a somewaht OK human rights record and are committed to democracy. Of course this is not everywhere the case. But the US did back off Saudia Arabia in Iran talks it does begin to criticize Israel it does condemn the exclusive Iraq government etc. One has to see that the Kurds are in fact the only viable partner in the region at least in terms of democratic attitude. Their ideology is not so distant from the early American movements and interestingly has overlap even with the rightlibertarian strands that one can find in the Republican party. Not to say that PYD is rightwing of course. So beside capitalism the Kurds pretty much are close to American ideas of liberty. ,syriancivilwar,cxmwb65,9,t5_2x5s1

5854195,0,t1_cxmw87u,Based on GermanyampnbspMember of parliament have their own staff specialize in one field and are not just exposed to one outside agenda. The members of the relevant committees especially the committee on foreign affairs issue a report and a recommendation for a decision to the whole parliament. Usually there are different opinions along partyfraction lines and a reportrecommendation is approved with at least the votes of the majority coalition. ampnbspThe other members of parliament usually follow the recommendation of their representatives on those committees. The german political system demands a high degree of partyfraction discipline which is why it is unnecessary for every member to be fully knowledgeable on every subject. The specialist members on the other hand do have extensive knowledge of the relevant subjects in their domains and are absolutely capable of developing an informed opinion. ampnbspFrom a political science point of view you might speak of policy subsystem which consist of specialized MPs bureaucrats members of the executive and outside stakeholders. All of which are mainly focused on one subject or field of interest. They all have specialist knowledge opinions and agendas. Those elites know each other very well and depending on their agenda they coordinate and form coalitions to influence state policies.  ampnbspThe view that there are very knowledgeable outside interests whom are capable of influencing the MPs more or less as they want does not hold up to reality. Also members of a policy subsystem are usually active over long periods of time and dont start from zero every time a decision has to be taken.  Usually they are involved long before a vote in parliament comes up and a bill is generally only introduced when there is a high chance of getting it passed. ampnbspThe  days that were mentioned are only a fraction of the time the relevant MPs had worked on the issue. Maybe for MPs who are usually only concerned with for example social policies there is an extensive need for new information but those MPs are mostly irrelevant to the decision making process as they will vote with the experts of their party. If an MP votes against the party line this can very well lead to them being expelled from their fraction.  ,syriancivilwar,cxn0he9,3,t5_2x5s1

The US threw over a certain structure or set in working a mechanism that gave radical groups the chance to benefit. But the US was never responsible for this mechanism in the first place they did influence the outcome by invading but Iraq was already working to this way before any American soldier set foot on Iraqi soil.Syria is the same case it is the prime example of what would have happened to Iraq if the US did not start its war there maybe later but a similar uprising would have taken place. Without any US intervention groups as ISIS benefited and not only ISIS there are several radical groups present.Libya was already radical before the uprising but we did not know it because we dont know much about Libya in the first place a Ghadaffi victory would not have stopped radical Islam from spreading also here a mechanism was set in working way before any Western intervention.These dictators themselves from KSA to Syria and Libya but also Saddam are responsible in the first place Russia too because of the Caucasus and its awful situation in this region.,syriancivilwar,cxq5bb5,-3,t5_2x5s1

Ever since Im to yet to find some evidence of Russians flying any CAS the last I recall was a sortie by  or  Sus armed with BM pods some... was that four of five weeks ago?. In comparison Assadist MiGs armed with BM pods have flown some good CAS for their troops last year. But thats not the point. Point is this since when is the VKS providing CAS to the IRGCrun operation in Southern Aleppo? So far I saw nothing of this. The VKS was bombing all over Idlib no doubt.

This process took time after the Iraqi military recovered from its initial losses. Anyway these cities are surrounded with little hope of breaking out or being relieved. Heavy urban fighting will be required to finish the job. This is time consuming and costly. Earlier this year Iraqi forces surrounded and captured Tikrit in a similar manner and it took longer than some people might have liked but it got done. Once Fallujah and Ramadi are finished all that remains really is the road to Mosul and the countryside around the Syrian border. The land in the west is more sparsely populated and mostly desert countryside. High on square meters but low on resources people or landmarks. ,syriancivilwar,cxqq2z9,21,t5_2x5s1

5914958,0,t3_3wavn0,To preface the AK AKM and AKSU all exist in Syria. Limited amounts have been supplied to the Syrian military with the bulk going to elite units youll especially notice AKSUs among bodyguards of the Syrian militarys pop culture icons like Suheil Hassan and Issam Zahreddine. If I remember correctly prior to the war Syria had begun an military modernization program aimed at procuring quite a few AKs for the military.As for why there arent more? A variety of reasons. Perhaps most importantly because replacing the rifle of an entire nation is DAMN expensive. You dont just replace the rifle the most expensive cost. You replace the ammunition the vast majority of Syrian militarys firearms are .x AKM in numerous flavors including Chinese Russian Hungarian AMD and I believe Polish as well as a limited stock of dated SKSs RPDs and more modern RPKs the tooling to make the ammunition tablissement Industriel de la Dfense the Syrian ammunition factory in Damascus would have to undergo a massive retooling to shift from one ammunition to another armorers and their equipment MILLIONS upon millions of new magazines cleaning gear bayonets etc etc etc. It is essentially an AKM in a new caliber so the retraining costs would be lightened but still necessary. Adopting a new service rifle is a tremendously expensive cost. Theres a reason only the most modern and well funded militaries do so with any sort of frequency bear in mind that the United States has had the M and M as our primary service rifle since the s and the Soviets began a switch to the AK in the s which remains albeit modernized like the M as the current service rifle today.Egypt produced a number of indigenous rifle designs like the Hakim a .mm Mauser rifle based on the Ljungman Swedish autoloading rifle they made like  of them and then began producing a .x version of the rifle the Rasheed that was very similar to the Soviet SKS before finally adopting the AKAKM. This is Egypt a nation that builds its own rifles or did at least and has a HUGE domestic defense capacity to design and develop its own small arms. They would go on to secure a license to build their own AKMs the Maadi AK generally regarded as one of the better built AK variants. Syria doesnt have a domestic firearms industry not a military one at least and would be ENTIRELY reliant on outside nations supplying them like Russia Belarus potentially China.Add to this that the AK was developed as a direct response to the US M .mm M was responded to with the .mm AK in providing a flatter trajectory longer range more accurate intermediate rifle cartridge. Aside from Israel the biggest potential threat to Syrian national security almost any possible threat that Syria would face in the Middle East would also be using the .x round of the AKM or a much heavier battle rifle round like Turkey or Irans .x G clones and indigenous rifles. Their primary opponent is OTHER AKMs. And more importantly other nations fielding soldiers similarly trained to theirs. Frankly the benefits of the AK are lost on militaries like the SAA and the Syrian opposition because the firearms discipline and marksmanship training necessary to exploit the greater accuracy and longer range are simply NONEXISTENT in the VAST majority of the Syrian military and the Syrian opposition. This isnt unique to Syria its a common problem throughout the Middle East and frankly aside from Israel Jordan and Turkey every nation in the Middle East special forces troops being the exception has absolutely horrific standards of marksmanship. It appears to be somewhat streamlined for instruction at the basic levels but either there is no follow on training or the level of familiarization and instruction is simply too basic. Even training allied Middle Eastern partners in the US I found Arab soldiers enlisted and officers alike on our training ranges to be FREQUENT candidates for safety violations and dismissal from training for failure to adhere to simple fundamentals of marksmanship making them dangerous shooters. The notion of spray and pray fire without shouldering unsupported automatic fire SERIOUSLY what the FUCK PKM gunners... it has a bipod for a reason and my personal pet peeve holding it over your head to fire blindly over cover... its not only problematic its epidemic. Arab fighting groups that DONT typify these traits stand out in big ways its what first drew me to pay attention to the YPG fighters aiming down the sights making range and elevation adjustments taking measured shots etc etc. There is simply very little benefit to switching to the AK in terms of firepower  results outside of the lighter weight of ammunition and the farrrrr lighter recoil but recoil doesnt matter if you arent fucking aiming.Eventually we will likely see the remaining Middle East nations that still carry AKs many have switched over to USBritishGerman designs or built their own  Irans copies of the M AK and G Turkeys domestic .x battle rifle Israels Tavor gradually shift towards either the AK or modernized variants or a new rifle system altogether. But the middle of a war is a very bad time to shift offers a conscript army that is already SEVERELY lacking in training and marksmanship very little benefit if any and simply offers more complications than benefits.I hope that helps.,syriancivilwar,cxuzecf,45,t5_2x5s1

5953265,0,t1_cxzanzf,Oh there are definitely civilians dying  Im not denying that. Im merely stating that the rebels have a habit of hamming it for all their worth whenever there is a strike. Given the low number of civllian deaths to combatant deaths total across all fronts and alliances including massacres by all sides is   . to non ISIL or kurd rebels then one must absolutely question the validity of the death tolls form rebel held areas.given that ratio one must assume that somehow there exists strikes which are purely rebels which we dont hear about or there are more rebels dying in each strike than they would like to report. Especially when given that the Iraq war saw a total of around  civilians dead to around k iraqi forces armyrebel although these numbers may be lacking deaths from large bomb blasts and numerous iraqi morgues. Syria in relation has around k civilian deaths high estimate form opposition groups to support your side this is in relation to k rebels killed excluding prisonersmissing  So yes a dictator may kill civilians indiscriminately but what we are seeing here paints a picture of a rebel group whom are likely exaggerating their numbers of civilian deaths to fighter deaths or are simply suffering a great amount of fighter deaths which they do not wish to admit to over the indiscriminate bombing narrative. TLDR your argument hinges on a dangerous amount of civilian to fighter deaths existing that is simply not the case in relation to similar wars be it libya afganistan iraq. I comprehend civilians dying but I also question how these strikes never seem to hit fighters when statistically there should be a proportion of the deaths being fighters. ,syriancivilwar,cy004rn,1,t5_2x5s1

5960203,0,t1_cy0vtp5,Nepotism is part of it for sure. The Middle East is full of tribal alliances that carry over even in the military. Youll find that in countries like Saudi Arabia Syria the Gulf States and other countries the military acts as a place to give favored positions to your supporters as well as a form of social welfare. However officer bloat is an established thing in other countries too. Heres a wellsourced blog post about the proliferation of generals in the US. I think that this is a problem that plagues all armies. Over time certain ranks and the privileges that come with those ranks become institutionalized and expected. In the US theres protests among the top brass about trimming the fact. You can imagine how the protests might be an even greater concern in countries that have a history of military coups. So basically a lot of officer positions have been handed out as patronage and then they cant be cut out of concern that it might weaken your position. Thats why even in the midst of the war and with the often incompetent leadership Assad has been unable to seriously reform and overhaul the army. If he starts sacking generals cutting the officer bloat hell end up facing a firing squad. The concern might be less of an issue with Iran because the Basji and IRGC are more ideological hardliners but a lot of them are veterans of the IranIraq war. Are you really going to tell them hey were trimming the bloat youre not a major general anymore just a major. This is morbid to say but in the long run these armies might be better off by losing a lot of these officers. ,syriancivilwar,cy0wvy4,5,t5_2x5s1

Then the Turks put some fear propaganda in as well. The displacement accusations were them using that as a victim tactic and also the Turks using it to attack the Kurds at what they saw as Kurds succeeding. They accused the Kurds of displacement ethnic cleansing and anything they could the moment there looked to be reprisals for what Kurds and others experienced previously so the moment ISIS etc was forced out they could say look see they ethnically are cleansing! just to suit their narrative and most importantly to reduce the impact of the major losses in the area.I have zero sympathy for these people hating Kurds.

5975398,0,t1_cy2t6oy,Actually I think this is not as unbelievable as you make it sound. Assads future has long been part of the diplomatic bargaining between the US and Russia. If Russia would compromise on the issue they would not make any public statement as long as no finale deal would have been agreed upon. ampnbspAccording to Martti Ahtisaari the Kremlin had offered to support to have Assad step aside  in . Kerrys statement that the US is not seeking regime change anymore would also go nicely with the assumption that Russia could support a syrian future without Assad. Russias influence is preserved because the Baath party will stay in control and the US saves its face because Assad is removed from power. Certainly the process of finding a successor for Assad cant be negotiated between the US and Russia alone and it will be extremely hard to find someone who is acceptable for all decisive parties let alone someone who can successfully reunite Syria.ampnbspPersonally I believe that this is also the only way to end this conflict. For me it is hard to imagine that any side could win exclusively militarily especially in the long run. At some point negotiations and cooperation will be inevitable if Syria is to preserve its territorial integrity and return to an acceptable state of peace and stability. I dont believe this can happen with Assad as president. I also dont believe that Russia is interested in Assad as a person but in what his government means for Russias interests in the region. If there is a way for Russia to secure their influence in Syria without Assad I am sure they would at least consider that option.,syriancivilwar,cy2wmp5,2,t5_2x5s1

Keep in mind the page I cited is HIGHLY unreliable in its commentary even to the point of having peoples opinions interspersed  Id just look through its cited verses from the Quran and Hadiths.Most of the hateful stuff associated with Sharia comes from hadiths typically or early Islamic tradition rather than the Quran which generally tends to be too vague to use directly as laws.Many Sunni fiqh or jurisprudence differ on their view of the Hadiths thus changing what Sharia means even among the clergy let alone the population. For example Hanafi Sunnis only use the Hadiths as contextual guidance and are considered to be the most liberal branch of Sunni islam. Other groups such as Salafists are puritans that wish to return Islam to the time of the prophet and thus Hadiths are practically law for them.edit As an example the hijab isnt directly described nor mandated in the quran. Its derived from the example of early companions of Muhammed and early caliphs. Do I personally give a fuck what their interpretation is? No. Some do and misinform people as if its a requirement of islam.,syriancivilwar,cy9ill6,6,t5_2x5s1

For example in December  Islamic State operatives demolished polytheistic shrines taught literacy and its Services Center repainted walls fixed roads provided water cleaned the streets and did landscaping. The group also imposed penalties on those that smoked hashish.c It concluded the month by taking over the alZayn neighborhood south of alHajr alAswad providing it with a buffer against enemies. This demonstrated the range of activities that the Islamic State was involved in from military operations to dawa hisba moral policing and governance illustrating that the groups leaders created a plan and stuck to it once they decided to reactivate these efforts.deditThe Islamic States most important accomplishment during this period was its takeover of alYarmuk Refugee Camp in early April . Islamic State fighters defeated the Hamasfront group Aknaf Bayt alMaqdis.

6066169,0,t1_cye76ml,I dont understand this point of view. Military capabilities heavily influence political decisions. If the US could defeat ISIS unilaterally with a few missiles then Syria would look far different than it does now. Instead the US is forced to find partners on the ground to rely on because it does not have the capability to unilaterally remove ISIS without incurring a large cost. Every outside actor is using their military capabilities to the best of their abilities to accomplish their political aims and I see a detailed discussion of how the military apparatus works and how one states forces compare to another to be very helpful to understanding why they act in the manner that they  do.Obviously politics is important and political discussion should form the basis of this subreddit but as it was famously said war is just a continuation of politics by other means and an academic appreciation of the tools at the disposal of various factions is extremely informative and useful for understanding such a clusterfuck of a conflict.  ,syriancivilwar,cyerlpx,1,t5_2x5s1

6068169,1,t1_cyezctf,gt While feminism is not the domination of women over men the radical feminism of the YPJ is radical feminism. Its cochair system and  quota is actually something weve never seen in a polity before. It is very radical and they actually regard western feminists under capitalism as not radical enough.Are you sure of this? I personally have seen a video where a YPJ teacher denounced western feminism as being about women over men.Although having read Ocalans feminist works I have to say it was heavily biased towards the middle east.In particular he used the prehistoric matriarchal societies theory as a basis for much of his own theory despite the fact that it has been discredited in modern studies.Personally I find quotas highly impractical and antithetical. Advocates for them come from confusing ideas of Equality with Parity. They have led to incompetent and unqualified individuals being arbitrarily hired or given leadership positions.The notion of ideological training itself I find objectionable. The YPG are acting as the defacto military force of Rojava.

6075914,0,t1_cyfgyj4,gt Socialists at least revolutionary ones usually advocate for the complete abolition of the opposition.Ive met plenty of revolutionary socialists of all kinds and I dont recognice this opinion. gtMarx made good critique of the problems of Capitalism but his solution was bloody and completely collectivist.Marx did not talk much about the socialist future except in lose terms of free associations of producers etc.And he was obviously a very pragmatic person he was open to parliamentary roads to socialism etc. But he firmly opposed conspiracy terrorism etc. I dont think he though that much about the risk of excessive violence from the side of the workers because that had never been a problem. The violence pretty much always came from the established authorities and they were very brutal. I think that if Hayek would have met Marx he would have described him as an archetypical individualist. gtThey do have this right there are democratically run work places in Capitalist countries. What socialists usually mean is that they want all workplaces to be run this wayThats not a right. Thats a privilegie. Yes socialists believe that people should have an equal right to decide about the labour process. You seem to advocate dictatorship. That an absolute ruler should have the right to command other people to do what he wants just because the state has granted him a piece of paper saying that he has this right.Libertarian capitalists seem to justify this order of things with that workers are not forced to work for the capitalist. They can be unemployed or whatever. Yet they do not think that the state is justified with putting up whatever conditions taxes laws etc it wants on its territory. But people are not forced to live within the states boundaries either. They can move to some island or whatever. Its the same thing.gtand usually advocate this be done by force.Thats the only way. A million capitalists wont wake up next morning and decide that they dont want to be dictators anymore. Force is not bad in itself. IS uses force. The SDF uses force. The former is bad because its oppressive. The later is good because its liberating. ,syriancivilwar,cyg1dbn,1,t5_2x5s1

6124022,0,t1_cylh6zj,I imagine that is probably somewhat true I think the biggest factor is that the organised and mobile fighting forces in this conflict are relatively small when we see maps on this sub we  or at least I tend to imagine stuff like world war one where trenches and massive fortifications denote lines of control. Like you say the forces left behind to control x or y place when its captured are often unmotivated or corrupt in one way or another militias. But this is a strong point war where most areas are uncontested and singular point fortifications or check points are used to secure relatively large areas with big gaps inbetween. Also in which it seems most sides cant really control an area where they dont have at least some support from the population let alone take one as urban warfare is supposed to be amongst the most bloody and difficult.

The whole point of borrowing is that it gives them time for the the oil price to go up and for them to fix their spendingtaxation issues.  Oil is still going to be a massively valuable commodity within the next couple decades and oil prices are likely to gradually rise over the next decade with the World Bank predicting somewhere around .barrel in  close to KSAs breakeven price.

6138429,0,t1_cynac6t,gtWhy not? I cant think of a reason why it couldnt be made litre by litre. Provided it wasnt outright supplied by one of external Syrian enemies. So they made  liter a day? That would take  to  years to produce enough for the attack. Ah but theres a catch. Sarin is a very unstable compound it rapidly decomposes in contact with moisture. Its best made shortly before use perhaps by completing the last step of the reaction a few days before the attack.This points to an industrial facility rather than a small lab making bench scale amounts collected over a year or two as the old Sarin would decompose.So a small rebel lab might have made up to a liter of Sarin but not the s of liters used in the East Ghouta CW attackAs for supplying the rebels with Sarin recall that East Ghouta was as is today under siege. The rebels would have also have to smuggle in the Burkan rockets and a rocket launching lorry into East Ghouta too. Into a area where items are smuggled in on foot and via tunnels.Then we have to believe that they launched an attack on their own wives and children the rebels were residents of East Ghouta.

6151042,0,t3_3zsi28,Not an expert on the various divisions within the Alawite sect but it is my understanding that people in the coastal mountain range largely share the same dialect and it has nothing to do with religion. Many of the larger mountain towns are mixed for example alQadmous is mixed Ismaili and Alawite and Safita is mixed Christian and Alawite. You definitely couldnt recognize a difference between how they speak. I believe when people cite someone having an Alawite dialect theyre just making a stereotypical assumption based on the coastal dialect.I dont believe Alawites who moved into urban areas are predominantly from a particular group. Lattakia Jableh Tartus Homs and Damascus have the largest urban Alawite populations as did Taqba before Daesh took it over and in my experience they came from fairly wide range of townsvillages. It is worth noting that alQardaha is basically a glorified village its very small.I havent heard anything about Alawites from Lebanon being active participants in the Syrian civil war... generally speaking I imagine theyre too concerned about their own precarious position within Lebanon to be bothered with Syria.,syriancivilwar,cyot5ae,11,t5_2x5s1

Then the Vienna Process can continue to play out to determine the fate of the country.Having one continuous region is a Kurdish nationalist goal for the PYD but the SDC really is meant for all of Syria so its a little less important for them.

I was both surprised and disappointed to see that very few lets say apparently native born French joined the demo apart from farleft parties representatives.From both that experience and further discussions I had with average people I assume that most of French people must have pretty much the same level of awareness that I used to have before I was caught by this cause. I would say that most people heard about PKK but not in a bright manner more from TurkishWestern standpoint.Lately Id say that things have slightly changed though. More and more TV reports shows examples of people joining the YPG or SDF forces. No later than the day before yesterday there has been a full report on one of the National Channel France  during the main evening news.If I were mean I would analyze that as a sort of relieving narrative considering the appalling number of French citizen joining the opposite side.

I dont believe this is due to specifically to religionthough it helps to justify but is due more to a hate that grows from uncertainty and constant conflicts. This new brand of Islam is a reflection of the mindsets of the newer generations. It simply will not go away without peace and prosperity. The local councils I believe are the bridge that allows the ME to move back into modern values through this lack of strife. Trying to overturn this will only continue the conflicts and allow the hateful side of people and Islam to flourish. ,syriancivilwar,cz9r030,3,t5_2x5s1

CAS as mobile artillery prepping ground push is really able to shift the location of offensive pushes across theatres and Interdiction against mechanised movement goes to restrict the movement of the rebels and their ability to organized counters.But even then the Russians have had lots to teach the Iranians Hezbollah SAA and NDF.  The leadership on the ground is better and the directions of attack and defense just make sense when you look at maps.  Overall the Russians bring a lot of war making expertise and war management to the Syrian conflict.And probably the most unheralded part of Russian involvement is SAA mostly cleaning up their lines of supply and logistics.  They didnt inherit absurd ones like Idlib and the M corridor but when they are attacking back the SAA and NDF are cleaning up the mountains and maintaining short defendable supply lines.Rebels though have always had trouble with coordination.  And there is always a measure of distrust between factions as defeating SAA can always devolve into yet another civil war among the rebels with differing visions of victory.,syriancivilwar,czkxqh5,3,t5_2x5s1

6587830,0,t1_d00mo9u,This is sort of my thing so Id be happy to help.The short story is stalemate. The SaudisCoalition have tried opening new fronts only to see them stall. To the northwest of Sanaa to the east through Hadhramaut and two drives from the south the main thrust being towards the major city of Taiz. Their closest forces are only about  miles from Sanaa.But like I said progress is slow if occurring at all. AntiHouthi Yemeni forces have been under siege in Taiz for months now and the coalition has proven unable to relieve them. Who is doing somewhat well right now? AlQaeda specifically AlQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. They have taken advantage of the war to greatly expand their area of control and area of influence. The Saudiscoalition completely ignore them when it comes to air strikes though the U.S. still hits them with drone strikes and so they advance pretty much unhindered. They even declared their own Emirate. The only thing going against them is apparently the gains have sparked a leadership struggle. But theyre spreading even to Aden where there have been some battles with Yemeni forces.ISIS also appears to be planting some seeds in the country and are believed responsible for assassinations and assassination attempts on some government officials.On the SaudiYemeni border the Saudis continue to be bled by Houthi attacks. The Houthis regularly attack Saudi border posts and villages as well as use artillery mortar and SCUD strikes. The Saudis have been completely unable to keep the Houthis out having to act in a purely reactionary role. After the  war they seem very very reluctant to go over the border into the Houthi heartland to go after them. So thats pretty much where it stands.

6593895,0,t3_45zz4x,It depends what you define as defeat. If you mean by clearing out the territory that ISIS holds then within a    year timeframe is quite achievable. If you mean defeating them ideologically then thats not going to happen even after  years. After all AQ has been fought against for the better part of twenty years and its still around.ISIS whether it succeeds or gets defeated will end up similar to other groups. Itll splinter off among groups that have slightly different views and goals whilst proclaiming that theyre the true ISIS. If ISIS had succeeded in overtaking Syria it would have turned into a never ending game of king of the hill among various jihadi groups and warlords. Each vying for control over various areas. Sunnis have a very big problem that needs some self reflection on. Tolerance for other religions in certain quarters of the Sunni faith definitely needs a lot of work theres a distinct lack of live and let live when it comes to other religions and minorities. Freedom of religion isnt the freedom to persecute other minorities and there seems to be a failure to understand this. Until its addressed then well continue to see Sunni  Wahhabist type groups like ISIS AQ Boko Haram Taliban Al Shabab Al Nusra and JaN fighting for what they term as freedom which is really the freedom to basically do what they want and enforce Sunni superiority at the cost and detriment of other groups.   ,syriancivilwar,d01d2pj,15,t5_2x5s1

He is unwilling to give interviews or to disclose where he gets his information from. If youre a historian youre schooled in knowing NEVER to rely on a single source. Particularly when it puts out information that is occassionally unverifiable and unconfirmable from other sources. This is the issue with the grandly named oneman observatory SOHR. The biggest issue of all is that western media in virtually every nation often relies on it solely without using other sources. Every major credible newspaper does this. THe Guardian Die Welt Der Spiegel NY Times. You name it. It is amazing that these university educated journalists have a relationship to their source material that is about as methodologically rigorous and as critical as a  year old doing a powerpoint presentation for class. Im not saying that the SOHR lies. Often they put out correct information. They have a known tendency to under report rebel atrocity and over report Regime atrocity with the latter often not being independently verifiable. This makes them particularly unfit as a sole source. Is this an issue? Yes. Is it an issue that established western media uncritically and unreflectingly rely on SOHR an nothing else for many of their articles? Most definitively.Of course they do it because the SOHR conveniently supports the narrative that our independent media all suspiciously and independently agree on .EDIT RT tried to do some investigative journalism and get a hold of the guy.

6739564,0,t1_d0fw22l,gtThe actual question isnt about social factors anymore imo. Rather its a geopolitical question. How else would you explain how e.g. Erdogan works with Barzani?If by chance the Barzani family was based inside the current borders of Turkey then they would be an enemy of Turkey if they fought for autonomy inside Turkey. The KRG is outside the borders of Turkey and Barzani doesnt advocate for Kurdish autonomous regions within Turkey. Strategically KRG needs Turkey for imports exports and foreign investment. I suspect that Turkey used Barzanis influence in Syria to confront the rise of PYD. gtWeFSA militia had coordination with the Kurdish National Council KNC we met in Serekaniye and agreed that this town should be controlled by a civil authority and that our armed groups should pull out. But the YPG units did not allow our forces to advance forward toward the city of Hassakah said alBashir. June KNC includes Syrian Kurdish parties that are funded by Barzani. They wanted to work with FSA and were more antiAssad. PYD seemed distrustful of FSA and more tolerant of Assad having some but limited strongholds in Kurdish regions. I guess at a certain point its not just about nationality or culture but power and dominance. gtIts no longer a revolution for freedom and democracy.

Only Iraq is weak enough that they couldnt prevent the Kurds from seceding.And then of course there is the small issue of where exactly the border should be because in many areas its far from obvious. The Kurds would want as much as they can get and everyone else would want to give away as little as possible  especially settlements populated by their own nationals.Lastly given that all four of those countries with the possible exception of Turkey are enemies of Israel it seems unlikely that Israel is acting out of an altruistic desire to strengthen them.,syriancivilwar,d0onr8t,1,t5_2x5s1

SAA forces and NDF forces there currently are mostly native to Haskah . It would be political suicide... . They have nothing to show the rebel because the rebels arent worth their time Most rebel group attack SDFKurds when SDFYPG they started attacking JN in North of Syria.. The US and Russia are more or less decided that Assad is the best choice for Syria will stayif elected again in the up comming election  Which Assad will as he is despite what you thing incredibly popular.  This can be see with Turkey and SA  which want to go in to Syria to remove assad but dont dare to do it with US support. The chance of Rebels getting any more Major victories are close to Null...

Ill add the last bit as soon as I can.The Islamic State apparently maintains wanted letters about all of their supporters that enter their controlled area in Syria. Samples of these documents have now ended up in the hands of German investigators. By Georg Heil Volkmar Kabisch and Georg MascoloThe Islamic State has lost these explosive documents with the names of their foreign fighters. NDR WDT and the Sddeutsch Zeitung submitted more than a dozen secret classified documents with information about German IS fighters. The documents supposedly come from surveys of IS supporters which are performed upon entry to the territory controlled by the terrorist organization in Syria. Each IS volunteer must answer  questions from the socalled Department of Border Administration. Besides names nom de guerre and previous residence information about smugglers character witnesses education and previous jihadist experience is asked after. The entrants can also specify if they would like to become either fighters or suicide bombers.The documents are obviously a part of a larger data leak which supposedly includes thousands of such personnel records and is at least submitted to different security services. We believe that these documents are very likely to be authentic said that Federal Criminal Office.

6918168,1,t3_4ai1g0,gt Joshua Landis director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma said that until the past week he had been in touch with officials close to the Assad regime in Damascus who expressed a constant drumbeat of confidence that theyre going to take back every inch of Syrian soil and Russia is their partner. But those communications abruptly fell off earlier this month. No one was answering the phones in Damascus. That leads me to believe they were thrown for a loop.gt Landis said that Putins planned withdrawal from Syria means hes not going to back Assad all the way. But he said the move was also likely aimed at Washington which has frustrated Moscow by refusing to work with Putin to fight the Islamic State. This is a shot across Americas bow as well Landis said with Russia saying Well leave and youll be stuck holding the bag in Syria.gt The withdrawal announcement reported by Russian state media appears to have caught the White House off guard. A senior administration official said Monday that they had seen reports of the Russian move and that we expect to learn more about this in the coming hours. A spokesman for the Defense Department declined to comment.gt Obama and Putin spoke on the phone after the Russian announcement according to a statement from the White House.

Maybe advertising a political solution where both the rebels and the regime have to make a concession as a way for everybody of the regional powers to exit while saving some face.

Sultan Murad had received large numbers of TOWs last year and were quite prolific in using them. Theyve used a couple in Aleppo but I suspect those were unused missiles because if they had more theyd surely use them.There are more groups involved in the attacks but theyre minor in comparison. The main groups involved are receiving support from Turkey e.g. Ahrar Sultan Murad.The YPG claims that Nusra is involved as well. I havent seen any video or photos showing Nusra involvement but they could very well be as theyve been involved in all the other fronts against the SDFYPG.

7346832,0,t1_d2d9if2,I was mainly highlighting how daft the claims were as the the government funding ISIS were. One could argue that countries such as America had a larger hand by supporting moderatejihadist groups in removing any form of government and propping up the fledgling jihadist groups. If you actually read about the person in question youll find how they insisted upon going to Syria they were refused by numerous people as it was high risk yet they still went through with it. If a trusted fixer tells you no then you bloody well should take some stock in it if numerous fixers tell you no for the same reason then you really should start thinking about not doing it. I dont want to be uncaring but he forced himself into a shitshow with rebel groups who are not to be trusted with a fixer who likely had a large hand in his abduction in the first place. This is literally people blaming Assad because a freelance journalist with low experience decided it would be a smart idea to go into a warzone with many jihadists who absolutely would love to have a western person star in some propaganda. The case would be solid if he was trapped in Syria on a holiday but no he joined rebel groups on the frontlines to report on them and suffered as a direct consequence. I have the upmost respect for frontline reporters but if you are inexperienced and told by numerous people in country to not do it then you have nobody to blame but yourself if what you are told is the reason to not go actually happens. Had he been with the SAA as a reporter then id be more understanding but the fault falls directly on him for entering that situation. Assad did not hold a gun to his head and made him cross into Syria no government members were involved in him crossing into syria. Only rebels so if anybody is to blame then its the rebels but even then they warned him of what could and very much would likely happen. ,syriancivilwar,d2da8tt,7,t5_2x5s1

7485443,0,t1_d2t1y1o,Stopping Nusra Fronts emirateTaha however would not serve as a mediator for long. He was killed in a U.S. drone strike only four days after arriving in Syria. Alongside him was Abu Omar alMasri the former righthand man of Emir Khattab  a Saudi jihadi famous for his leadership in Chechnya  who had been active in Syria as early as . Since Tahas death Nusra Front has continued to very slowly expand the breadth of its consultation process seeking to win some level of acceptance for its emirate plans.Internally the al Qaeda affiliate remains split on how fast to establish the emirate. In the end developments on the battlefield may play a role in determining the outcome of these debates.While a renewed ceasefire would likely spoil al Qaedas plans a steady escalation of hostilities could potentially provoke a level of desperation within opposition ranks that may provide space for some limited level of grudging acceptance of the emirate. A rejuvenated version of the Army of Conquest a rebel coalition including Nusra Front now looks set to emerge in Idlib and Aleppo as a consequence of the discussions initiated by the al Qaeda affiliate in January. This development indicates that some Syrians have already begun to tighten their cooperative bonds with Nusra Front albeit out of a perceived military  and not ideological  necessity.Given the resumption of fighting in Syria and the corresponding rise in Nusra Fronts fortunes the group will almost certainly follow through on its plans and establish an emirate in Idlib by the end of . It is now up to the United States and its allies to determine which portion of Syrias mainstream opposition is confident enough to resist such a move. The first step is acknowledging that the vast majority of Syrias mainstream opposition rejects in principle the presence of an al Qaeda emirate in their country and the imposition of transnational jihadi objectives onto Syrian soil.However the West has not yet demonstrated its determination to provide sufficient support to the opposition so that it can offer a viable alternative to Nusra Fronts influence as a potential government in northern Syria. In the city of Maarat alNuman the th Division rebel group has been linked to local civil society bodies and a moderate judicial system headed up by several moderate Sunni sheikhs. However these institutions werent powerful enough to effectively confront Nusra Front. And rather than offer significant help to one of its most prominent and popular Syrian assets the United States simply stood by and watched silently as the th Division was attacked in Maarat alNuman and ultimately defeated by al Qaeda.There is still an opportunity to rescue some of this lost opportunity. However it will require a substantial expansion of military political and financial assistance to a broad spectrum of Syrias opposition. There are currently more than  separate FSA groups that have been vetted by the CIA all of which operate in coordination with locally legitimate civil political and judicial bodies. In dramatically expanding its support the West should embrace an ink spot strategy that empowers these opposition strands in tandem. The aim should be to establish a gradually expanding network of empowered internationally backed and genuinely influential opposition communities whose individual successes empower the others and provide a barrier to al Qaeda influence.If Western policymakers continue on their current course however al Qaeda will continue to advance along its path toward an emirate. Only by empowering local groups opposed to its transnational jihadi agenda can we avoid gifting northwestern Syria to al Qaeda on a silver platter.,syriancivilwar,d2t1y86,41,t5_2x5s1

Syria can print money but itll lead to inflation that would see a rise of the use of alternative currencies in Syria.

So no still not even close to a direct comparison.Not even going to mention the technological differences between then and now and the responses to rebellion that technology makes possible.gt but boiling it down to these are the casualty figures and he is the president so theyre on his watch and the one to blame!!!! is absolutely infantile.

7690991,0,t3_4ko06c,The particular Chechens fighting for Daesh dont follow a Sufi tariqah. While many Chechens do belong to Sufi orders more fundamentalist strains of Islam have been growing in the Caucasus particularly in Dagestan and Chechenia since the collapse of the secular Chechen nationalist resistance in the latter phase of the Second Chechen War specifically Deobandism and Saudistyle Wahhabi Salafism. Chechenia is a very economicallydepressed region that has been ruled by strongman Ramzan Kadyrov on behalf of Moscow for roughly a decade. The failure of Chechen and panCaucasus nationalism to deliver independence for Chechenia and Ingushetia and Dagestan etc. combined with the brutality and high casualties inflicted by the Russians during their campaigns to quell unrest in the region left Chechen fighters disillusioned with secular nationalist separatism and Chechen youth with little hope and fewer employment prospects. Deobandi Islam had been making inroads in Chechenia for a while by the end of the Second Chechen War but it has been Saudifinanced WahhabiSalafi mosques that have really been able to capitalize on these conditions. Accordingly the Chechen resistance has taken on a Salafi character replacing the nationalism of Dzhokhar Dudayev et. al. and the guidon at the front of Caucasian independence has been taken up by the Salafi Caucasus Emirate. Some of those fighters have volunteered to fight for Daesh in Iraq and Syria.,syriancivilwar,d3gezwy,5,t5_2x5s1

7723052,0,t1_d3is3v6,gt Hafez alAssad was indeed successful in crushing the MBs during the insurgency of the late s and early s. However fact is also the MBs havent had the sort of support they thought or even claimed they have already at that time. Reason is that they became too radical for the taste of most of Syrians especially after Syrians saw what happened in Iran of  they lost interest in supporting establishment of a similar society. Exactly that is the reason why they stopped supporting that insurgency and why this was crushed in .I dont know how you build that bridge between an Islamic sunni movement who advocated for democracy and socialism and the Iranian theocratic shia revolution. They certainly didnt have electoral support if you can consider that a true measure of popular support given the constrains yet they claim to have some way or the other influence over  of the population. Assad admitted to jailing k people in relation to the MB. That probably is a drop in the ocean if you compare it to other groups at the time certainly against the Baathist or even the communists but its far from nonexistent. They lost not because they lacked popular support we have seen plenty of movements survive for decades with only marginal popular support they lost because they stepped up the stakes with the armed struggle that they clearly overestimated.. and then got crushed. Hafez victory was not over the hearts and minds of the Syrians with was a military victory.gt  years later the MBs were out of the country they had no links and no influence inside Syria as of  not even any sort of clue about who is organizing protesting.Thats partly true. The majority of the MB leadership was out of the country exiled by forced or by their own initiative. But to say that they had no links of influence inside Syria its too much of a generalization. There are reports of MB groups in the protests they might not have been the majority but they were still there and according to this source  they were pushing for armed insurrection in Hama. Another interesting element is that today the MB has linksfunds between  and  of the FSA. Hardly negligible although not a majority.gt Regarding overwhelming influence of the secret services problem most of people have with understanding the way Assadists rule is the tight integration of top Alawite clans with a decentralized network of security agencies with overlapping responsibilities and criminal circles. I would never come to the idea to declare that system for being ineffective alone the fact its still in power well at least in most of Damascus and all along the coast is clear evidence its anything than that.I agree and I think this is the direct result of the narrative that Syria is a one man show and Bashar controls everything that goes around.gtProblem of this system was its haphazard selection of victims. By  prisons were full  but not of Moslem Brotherhood they were full of randomly arrested people most often those who fell in disfavour with somebody from within the ranks of the regime.Could well be true. One of the main reasons that people were getting scooped up was for being suspected members of the MB which was illegal. Maybe they werent maybe they were just being strong armed into paying bribes or what not but thats what they got accused of and maybe they became members once inside. We will never know for sure. What we know is that Assad made it clear that the pardon he was handing out included the MB and that leads me to believe that they consider these to be somewhat special prisoners.gt Now the problem is it is all too easy to land in one of Assads prisons. But getting out nearly impossible. There is no legal prosecution no judges no lawyers nothing. One lands inside and guards then inform the people about duration of their sentence. Imagine such a situation and think about it what is left to one when theres absolutely no hope? Usually its religion.gt Means a mass of such people  most of them not even religious at all  were incarcerated without hope of ever getting out again. Inside prisons they did find a small number of Islamists indeed even extremists  such like Jowlani or Alloush etc. and thats how they got not only radicalized but fiercely antiregime too.There are plenty examples of people spending shitloads of time in jail and not turning into religious nutcases.. just look at Oalan or ETA IRA prisoners.. But that goes against your argument that there was no radicalizing aspect already at work and indirectly that MB had no influence and that all radicalisation was imported.gt So its not as if security agencies were ineffective they were highly effective in scaring the people to death of the regime and preventing any sort of serious unrest for thee decades. But they were also counterproductive because they were producing extremist opposition through their own actions prisons were not teeming with MBs but became places where a new generation of extremists was breed out of sheer hopelessness of inmates.I cant disagree. Its the old age question of why men rebel. Surely the powers that are have some responsibility in failing to address the demands of some groups. What Im disputing is this notion that just because MB didnt have a majority of the population behind it.. that it didnt have large political influence perhaps oversized influence.gt Meanwhile outside of prisons the security situation was such that for most of s the regime was forced to let its security agencies create some sort of militant extremist opposition  usually small gangs of literal stupids of all sorts  which were then ordered into show attacks on banks various public institutions etc. whenever Assad needed some sort of extremist threat usually in response to US pressure.First time Ive heard about this. Can you point me in the direction of some sources on this issue? What Ive read are the leaks of US documents demonstrating that both countries cooperated heavily during that fase both against the MB AQ and Saddam. Perhaps the insights about the regime that this gave to American intelligence might have contributed to plan the destabilization efforts that they would later trigger.gt The security apparatus also run a highly profitable Jihad ImportExport business  especially with Libya namely Libyan security apparatus was exporting its Islamists to Syria and Syria was exporting these to Iraq later on several other countries joined this business. This system was so profane that they were charging Jihadists in question for travel expenses  and everybody involved all the way up to Assad earning handsome profits.Yes this is true dont know about everybody being involved all the way up to Assad part though and the funny part is that they would later rat them out to the americansgt What kind of support do you happen to see?gt Namely all the support for Islamist factions came from abroad. I explained above the how comes part. Keep in mind this war is already in its th year and Syria was a poor country already before it erupted. Funding and supplies are more important than ever before. or Nusra is Syrian and this is the group with the largest percentage of foreign fighters except for ISIS. The two other largest Salafist groups JaI and AaS are almost exclusively Syrian. Every group in the Islamic front is by default islamist. Then its just too troublesome to dig through the FSA to weed out all the groups who identify themselves as islamists but MB already claims relations with at least  so the actual figure should be higher.gt What kind of Islamist uprisings were there in Syria of the s? s? s?You had one in  you have the  uprising the  bombings all involving MB and then the  and  and  bombingsterror attacksstring of robberies attributed to AQSaudi intelligence I guess these are the false flag operations you were referring to earliergt Aw please... Its obvious youve missed it dont worry youre surely not the only one but when various Wahhabists in Mauritania or Jordan were calling for Jihad in Syria back in  Syrian Salafists those outside prisons were ridiculing them. They were laughing about such calls. That was why then various Sheikhs and whoever else from Kuwait Qatar and similar places had to travel to Syria organize people pay them etc.Probably. I apologise for following the Mauritanian wahhabists on twitter. But I had a colleague who was studying the Egyptian revolution and questioning the notion that it was a twitterfacebook. revolution and that everybody got very surprised that Morsi got elected and his conclusions were that the math didnt had up since only  of Egyptian population at best had access to these platforms and that we were getting info from a tech savvy westernized elite while the countryside Islamic zealot farmer who had heavier weight in internal politics didnt get through to western audiences.

There is no such thing as the city is not allowed to be attacked why can turkey literally raze Kurdish cities into the ground and is that not terrorism? The whole field of turkey is a battlefield turkey doesnt say well this is a civilian area so we dont bomb it instead they roll in with tanks and do airstrikes. So of course the Pkk is going to battle Turkish military in Turkish cities too. ,syriancivilwar,d3k8rcq,3,t5_2x5s1

It also provided all manner of lethal and nonlethal equipment money advisory and training from the CIA. It gave the mujahideen a war machine they could not have developed on their own.Returning to the Stingers my understanding which may be wrong is that they were being supplied full force to the mujahideen beginning in  whereas the Soviet announced their eventual pullout in . Thats still just one year difference but the use of the SAMs were a huge setback to the Red Armys helicopter gunships probably the one asset that could still neutralize the effectiveness of American support to the mujahideen.Pakistan allowing the mujahideen to operate out of their territory certainly didnt help and I sincerely wonder what kept the KGB from sabotaging everything east of the Durrand Line.,syriancivilwar,d3vfm9l,0,t5_2x5s1

7856464,0,t1_d3ymijs,I see. I would say that depends on what do you want to read. There is no doubt that the books you mentioned are much better in regards of covering specific aspects of the war  foremost the microcosmos of local relations Islamists Islamic extremism and politics in general. On the contrary Syrian Civil War is a compressed military history. For its format its as wellsourced as it can get and still offering a detailled review of the regimes military orders of battle very detailled descriptions of air warfare authors speciality and early involvement of the IRGC  nothing of which is available in other books you mentioned and which is making it as original as it can get. Dont you think so?  And re. TV and news sites its right since the start of the SCW that the media and the public in the West are generally far more interested in extremists and then Daesh than any other topic. These are flashy stories those covered by the TV too and thats what general public wants to read about.

And no one knows the real casualties so far but judging by the lack of bodies its likely a shooting contest. This is the same thing that happened at Banes and Bashkoy. Ahar Al Sham lost so many troops there to airstrikes and artillery. Point is the rebels have to sit through these attacks and these attacks do the most damage.

If you end up in a full out war you have a minister that cannot possibly understand the decisions they have to make.And that has nothing to do with prejudices and everything to do with not having served in the army.

In his latest interviews he expressed his will on coordinating with Peshmerga for the defense of Shingal area.PKK and YBS have around  men. HPE numbers around . The Ezidi Peshmerga Commanded by Hayder Sheshos uncle under KRGs control numbers .KDP still has large popularity among the people of Shingal.Regardless on who will get the majority in the next elections the area will be under KRGs admnistration and under Peshmerga Ministrys control.

8292832,0,t1_d5e4u0m,Lt. Gen. Ismail Hakki Pekin from an ForeignPolicy article  days agogtA group of businessmen close to Erdogan approached us to improve ties with Russia said Pekin who visited Russia in December immediately after the downing of the Russian warplane. Pekins group introduced the businessmen to Alexandre Dugin an ultranationalist Russian philosopher close to the Kremlin who explained that the Russians expected some gesture that would amount to an apology. Perincek claimed that Alparslan Celik the Turkish citizen who Russia alleged killed the pilot of the downed jet was arrested immediately after this meeting. We made a significant contribution to this reconciliation process and both parties Turkey and Russia wanted us to be a part of it.gtPerincek and Pekin  a socialist leader and an army general respectively  may seem like something of an odd couple. Their political collaboration started in prison as both men were detained in  in relation to the Ergenekon case which alleged that a network belonging to the deep state was plotting a military coup against the elected government. Both men share a staunch Kemalist political outlook based on a very strict adherence to secularism and Turkish nationalism as well as an antiimperialist outlook that makes them wary of American and Western influence over Turkish politics. Not sure if this might have anything to do with the current situation or not though it does show willingness to do buisness with Russia among some elements.Interesting to see Alexandre Dugin mentioned that guy is bad news his stated aims are a fascist Eurasian state led by Russia I also remember his name popping up a lot around the wars in Georgia and Ukraine.Im not sure how to peice this together but looked like it could be relevant.,syriancivilwar,d5e5vxa,1,t5_2x5s1

8313687,0,t1_d5goesf,The rebels have only made life harder for Kurds. If YPG didnt utterly dominate all facets of society you would hear it. In the beginning the SAA left the area to its own devices and allowed YPG to run it as long as they made sure that rebels didnt enter. Everything would stay the same. Services like garbage collection electricity schools health and etc would still be provided. The rebels frequently tried to violate their neutrality by doing things such as mass kidnappings of Kurds. YPG once allowed them to enter their area to attack the Christian quarter of Aleppo which was unguarded because the deal with YPG nesnt troops could be diverted. The threat of SAA retaliating made then change their mind. Unfortunately the SAA areas git besieged and their situation was looking dicey. Aftrr numerous threads and attacks YPG decided one night to team up with rebels and jihadists to attack the SAA areas at night without telling the SAA the truce was over. The shock of it meant rebels entered the central districts quickly and took over large parts. A lot of civilians were massacred. An imam had his head cut off and put on top on his mosque while his headless body was dragged on the street. The supply teams for alKindi hospital and Aleppo Prison were slaughtered by YPG. Everyone thought the SAA would collapse. Instead The NDF and SAA recomposed themselves and fought back. They killed any jihadists who didnt get away in time and killed YPG fighters who didnt expect to be engaged in a fight against an enemy that fought back. They got pushed back to their area and were ruthlessly shelled. Sheikh Maqsoud which was a sad haven for hundred of thousands became a death zone and all YPG could do was moan since they were losing territory. Even worse for them was the actions of rebels. They were systematically looting every building they could get their hands on and auctioning some to looters for the right to steal. On Castello road people fleeing to Afrin were getting robbed again at checkpoints and being mocked. Why do you have so much were getting tired.Eventually the SAA withdrew from captured territory and and a new agreement was made. Its been held up so far only because YPG knows the consequences. Last year they were promising to help rebels break the siege I the SAA stopped blocked Aleppo further east and they had an opening. I guess that is why the SAA went for MallahLayramoun area. To make sure YPG doesnt get any ideas.Considering how much Kurdish civilians have suffered from rebels. I dont think there is much appetite by people to do them a favour.

It is WHY the YPG have not received any heavy weapons or serious air drops from the U.S. If you think that does not impact the YPG a lot then you dont truly know because air power cant be every where and every front.You are actually reinforcing my point that they didnt break with PKK hence no heavy weapons. And I never said.. or insinuated that that doesnt impact the YPG but I also think that that was a carefully weight decision. And about they doing better from what I gather the plan for Rojava is not just about defeating ISIS.. thats just what the shortterm circumstances dictate and in that respect not breaking with the PKK is part of their plan for Kurdistan.gtAn authoritarian state not trueWe agree to disagree. Barzanis attitude towards Gorran PKK and Rojava leads me to conclude otherwise.gtThey are selling their own oil before the conflict their economy was doing very good Before their economy was doing very good not it isnt. How is that in disagreement with what I said? gt they have now just signed military agreements theyve been receiving millions of dollars worth of military equipment and also humanitarian aid.Good for them. Just remember that in capitalism there are no free lunches.gt Dont pretend like Rojava doesnt need this.I unlike you have no pretentions of knowing what Rojava needs or doesnt need.gt Finally unlike in Syria in which assad is busy with isis and so many rebels once they die out hell be exactly like the iraqi government trying to weaken Kurds if you think Rojava can survive without international support and protection you are very badly mistaken.I dont disagree. Yet there are a number of different ways of going about it.gt KDP is building the foundations for Kurds in Iraq to be able to look after themselves. I am pro PKK pro Rojava and dont even admire KDP that much but considering they are achieving things through different paths means Kurds should be looking to copy.I see a number of contradictions in your post about what you claim and what you claim you are but that aside why would the Kurds in Rojava or anywhere else looking to copy what the KDP has done in Iraq? Isnt what was achieved in Iraq a direct result of the specific context of the country? If the context is different wouldnt the approach have to be necessarily different?gtIts not Turkey just yet it will be Assad and if theyre lucky then Turkey worse case both.Turkey has been pretty clear that it prefers ISIS or Rebels to Kurds controlling the territory on their border. It hasnt been very modest in its efforts to achieve that goal either by aiding those groups or actively militarily trying to prevent Kurdish advance. Compared to progovernment troops who only triggered a couple of minor skirmishes and who couldve been easily obliterated militarily Turkey definitely presents a bigger challenge for the time being.

It doesnt matter how anyone feels about that thats just an act theyve committed. How in the world am I manipulating the link?Dont change your story now.

This is another BS to appease turkey people are getting tired of appeasing them for their lies I want to add.gt That seems pretty manipulative when you dont even think theres anything wrong with that.

Basically I dont know Im not Assad after all but I dont think Assads position will be comfortable enough after the war for him to allow the existence of the Kurds. Hes a dictator and dictators cannot be seen to be compromising or weak. Pragmatism is important so is total control. From an international perspective Assad is propped up by the Russians and the Iranians. Russia will vote down any attempt to establish a no fly zone a la Kurdistan after the  war. If Assad goes to war with the Kurds the Russians will probably back up Assad against the Kurds but I doubt the US will send airstrikes against Syrian tanks.

No more than  rebels were involved on the first day. At night SAA reinforcements arrived and launched a counterattack in the northyouth housing district and the eastindustrial district the next day. In response the rebels committed their second wave which was at least as strong as the first one to the Industrial District and the Youth Housing area. Another  guys. During the next  days SAA and rebels duked it out but the NDF in the north couldnt handle it and retreated at which point all the loyalists elsewhere also abandoned the city.Rebels never committed more than  men there.

8502126,0,t1_d64a99i,Im not Syrian FWIW and I dont materially support any party in this conflict.Those questions are ones for Bashar alAssad to answer. The rebels were never one unit and no one single person ever controlled the revolution it couldnt have been called off somehow. Whats happened to Syria has been a complete disaster and a tragedy... And it could have been avoided if Assad had gone the way of Ben Ali and just taken a plane to Iran or Russia. Instead he attempted to crush the people with his Shabiha and simultaneously released s of jihadists from prisons to taint the rebellion. All for the sake of more power as if  years hadnt been enough. And Iran and Hezbollah decided to send in their soldiers to support as well for no reason other than sectarianism. We wouldnt have gotten this far without them too.The big lesson after the Nuremberg trials was that just following orders is not an excuse. Responsibility for a regimes crimes extends all the way down the chain of command. Yes the regimes soldiers are not beasts they are human beings with free will and a conscience.Ive met many Syrian Sunnis who told me how they had Alawite friends before the war. Nearly all of them ended up supporting the regime. Now the same people who were pretty chill with Alawites  years ago explicitly hate them now. I dont condone that of course... its a terrible result of this awful war.This war was forced on the Syrian people by Bashar alAssad and his regime. They didnt choose it for themselves.

8543292,0,t1_d69g5xu,It would make the most sense to actually make a concerted effort at reconciliation with the SDF. Despite the actions of the FSA against them and their truce with SAA the SDF have the most in common with the rebel agenda and a recognition of them as an official opposition group a statement of support for the federation project and Kurdishminority rights and a negotiated peace agreement that is actually upheld would I think be in the very best interest of the rebels and I think would be accepted by the SDF if done properly and of course was actually upheld with offending groups properly punished for breaking the agreements. Assad has a PR imperative to regain the whole country but the rebels are already fighting for a break from the status quo so accepting federalism and minority recognition are not things that need to be considered counter to their aspirations. I realize this is hardest for Islamist groups to accept and likewise it is not desirable for SDF to engage in close relations with said groups but it is nonetheless in both groups interests for the foreseeable future. Maybe very long term there will be issues again as ideological aspirations conflict but for anyone in the near future it will be a useful resolution for both groups. Especially the rebels backing federalism seems a no brainer. They will never take places like Latakia and other areas populated heavily by minorities when many groups have made statements and actually committed massacres against non Sunni groups meaning those minority communities will fight to the bitter end and likely receive heavy foreign backing to stop a full out genocide. Federalism is literally the best most realistic option for them even if they do manage to eventually win the heartland from the regime. I just see no real strategic sense from these groups. ,syriancivilwar,d69hc04,2,t5_2x5s1

Thats not how negotiations work. gtthere are no negotiations there is an order to lay down arms and surrender or face destruction.Russia is cooperating with Syrian govt to allow for smaller groups of rebels to lay down their arms and stop fighting. Yes obviously if they keep fighting then the loyalists will fight them as well. There has been thousands of instances of reconcilliation. And before this program came there was tons of amnesties and ceasefires for former rebels.

The Iraqi Hezbollahs Harakat alHezbollah and AnNujaba have been fighting and dying in Syria for years now its documented beyond doubt.thats true but the PMU was specifically started to gather local volunteers most of these volunteers that are not affiliated with any militia wouldnt be that eager to fight in Syria and these groups arent really that large compared to say Assaib AhlAhaq.gtNo one cares about those shrines beyond the recruitment propaganda. This war is about regional politics and power balanceThats actually what your average Shiite fighter really all he cares about its true that its used as propaganda but its actually a pretty significant thing to most Shiite fighters especially those not affiliated with a militia.gtYes and in order to stop them from coming to Iraq you have to fight them in Syria.Secure the Iraqi borders and maybe areas border the Iraqi borders theres no reason they should fight in Aleppo.gtThe vast majority of Shiites in Iraq will do whatever Iran tells them to do hence them fighting and bleeding for Assad.I wish I could get a source on this Its utter nonsense and generalizations. Shiites in Iraq follow different religious authorities the most popular of which is AlSistani and since Iran wanted as many Shiites as possible to fight the Americans during the invasions just like Assad did Sistani prohibited fighting them and that was the major reason why the Shiite insurgency died down pretty early and wasnt as intense Moqtada AlSadr for example continued fighting the Americans and he still uses antiU.S rhetoric to this day.If whats youre saying was true than most of the population of Iraq from Shiites would be fighting in Syria and this war wouldve ended long ago. In reality I can read Arabic and I know what the general sentiments are over there and while most Shiites support Assad in this conflict I doubt many of them are willing to die for him he is still hated because of him opening the borders after  for jihadists and for hosting exiled Baathists he had many problems with AlMaliki his Baathist regime is hated there by default. Its not like Iran magically appears in the sky and tell them to do what it wants and theyd get on it they do it through public opinion shift and propaganda and these methods may or may not work that successfully. My point still stands is that outside if militias directly controlled and funded by Iran your average Shiite fighter isnt that willing to go fight in Syria for Assad your average Shiite isnt even willing to fight in the first place.,syriancivilwar,d6mhr2z,3,t5_2x5s1

8702116,0,t1_d6t7knu,The PKK increasingly sought to distance itself from its terrorist past. The group thus changed its name in April  to the Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress KADEK which claimed adherence to democratic transformation and unity. This was followed in November  by yet another facelift the PKK this time changing its name to Kongra Gel and insisting on its commitment to peaceful activities.But these attempts to cultivate a more benign public image failed  in January  the US government listed not only the PKK but also its various aliases including KADEK and Kongra Gel as terrorist organisations. The group subsequently called off the ceasefire. As a result violence perpetrated by the PKK  which reverted to its original name in April   steadily increased over the next few years. It also began the practice of using front groups especially the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons TAK to conduct attacks in tourist areas frequented by foreigners. It was hoped that the TAK would provide the PKK with plausible deniability when conducting attacks that killed civilians including foreigners. In reality however the PKK directs TAK operations.Explanatory Statement from the Federal Register of Legislation of Australia in  Since TAK is just a virtual label that PKK uses for its high profile mass civilian casualty terror attacks and PKK is being ruled by KCK I think the question of whether TAK is ruled by KCK or not is simply moot. PKK is and therefore so does PKKs plausible deniability label TAK.,syriancivilwar,d6tebah,7,t5_2x5s1

Was Warned of Airstrikes Before IllFated Convoy LeftAirstrikes are not a reason to stop the convoy U.N. official wrote after opposition warned of danger from Syrian governmentISTANBULUnited Nations officials went ahead with an illfated aid delivery to a rebelheld town in northern Syria Monday despite warnings by their own staff and Westernbacked rebels that the area wasnt safe according to communications seen by The Wall Street Journal.Airstrikes Monday night on the town of Urem alKubra just outside the city of Aleppo destroyed  of the  trucks in the convoy and killed about  people accompanying them. The U.S. on Tuesday blamed the attack on Russia the Syrian regimes key international ally.Mondays convoy to Urem alKubra and another that went to a rebelheld town in central Homs province were the first aid deliveries dispatched during the weeklong ceasefire. Western officials hailed the trucks arrival in the town as proof of the deals potential successuntil they were hit.On Sunday Syrian opposition members warned U.N. officials against deliveries to the rebelheld side of Aleppo reporting the government was violating the ceasefire in and around the city noting Urem alKubra. A U.N. official acknowledged the violations in a response.The airstrikes are not a reason to stop the convoy an official from the U.N. Special Envoy to Syrias office replied on Sunday conveying what the official said was the position of a representative of the U.N. Department of Political Affairs and suggesting that some people around the special envoy disagreed with that stance.The attacks were part of a wave of regime airstrikes on Aleppo province that began immediately after the Damascus government announced Monday evening that the oneweek truce brokered by the U.S. and Russia had expired.The exchange of messages revealed divisions between Damascusbased U.N. agencies over the risk of aid delivery to Aleppo province as well as a degree of distrust of the Syrian government.The messages show U.N. officials decided to proceed even though the Syrian regime was violating the ceasefireviolations U.N. officials have been reticent to acknowledge publicly even as they did so in private messages.A U.N. official said Tuesday that the convoy came from the governmentheld side of the divided city of Aleppo and a day earlier officials said the regime had approved it making the airstrike on the aid trucks all the more perplexing.The safety of convoys traveling through government areas is the responsibility of the government a second U.N. official based in Damascus wrote to a senior opposition member in a separate exchange of messages on Sunday. The official was speaking of rebelheld areas in and around Aleppo city including Urem alKubra. If rebels permit entrance we will have all the sufficient guarantees to stop bombing from the government side.Moscow on Tuesday denied that it or the Syrian air force had struck the convoy in Urem alKubra which was a joint mission of the U.N. and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.After the truce brought days of relative calm the Syrian government and its Russian allies restarted airstrikes on Aleppo on Sunday angered by errant airstrikes on the Syrian military by the U.S.led coalition in Deir Ezzour the previous day.Washington has cast the delivery of humanitarian aid to rebelheld areasspecifically some  people in the besieged rebelheld side of Aleppo cityas one of the first goals of the ceasefire deal to be followed by military cooperation with Moscow to take on extremist groups such as Islamic State and the Syrian Conquest Front.The Syrian government has cut off supplies to rebelheld areas with staples such as flour and medicine unavailable or prohibitively expensive.Aleppo was Syrias largest city and its economic heartland before the conflict but has seen some of the worst fighting between rebels and government forces in a battle observers say will determine the outcome of the war.The U.N. has been criticized in the past for delivering most of its humanitarian aid to governmentcontrolled areas while regime forces often hamper deliveries to opposition territory sometimes blocking staples such as flour. Members of the opposition said U.N. officials said they were eager to deliver aid to Aleppo to rebuff these criticisms.A representative of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and a spokeswoman for the office of U.N. Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura said they dont comment on leaked staff correspondence.Washington had hoped a successful truce could clinch a larger political deal to end the Syrian war now in its sixth year with some  dead according to U.N. estimates.Noam Raydan in Beirut and Nathan Hodge in Moscow contributed to this article.,syriancivilwar,d7wqztj,1,t5_2x5s1

On a per capita basis the  million tons dropped on Laos make it the most heavily bombed country in history The New York Times noted this was nearly a ton for every person in Laos.How can one be so uneducated.

The deployable troops those are the Tiger forces Militias Iraqi militias SAA regulars... They will move around to a front wrap it up and move to another. A fraction small of the first will move a larger fraction of the second will and the latter will move out entirely once an operation is finished. Now for Aleppo if the frontline is entirely done for there would be about k from the first possibly k who will move around and k who will be relieved to other duties around Aleppo guarding supply lines rebuilding training policing securing... The second category would only see k speculation true number unknown move about and around frontlines in Aleppo capturing the Anadan plains would be the smartest.

9258935,0,t1_d8pjyg4,It seems likely that Lavrov sees it as the following. On paper the U.S. is hostile to alNusra. Yes they carry out bimonthly airstrikes targeting high ranking pre alQaeda officials those might plot attacks against targets abroad similar to . But those have little if any influence on the events on the Syrian battlefields. As long as an alNusra subgroup focuses on Syria it is safe from any U.S. harm. Now the U.S. continues to support other militant groups with weapons training intelligence and political support. They call them moderate Syrian opposition. Completely coincidentally every single of those opposition groups is fighting sidebyside with alNusra giving alNusra antitank and artillery support propelling their offensives being an systemrelevant part. In classic military terms one could say alNusra is a Guards Rifle Corps. Groups such as the FSA th Divison or Jaish alNasr form Antitank and Artillery Brigades. Together they form an army under unified command. They may differ by name but they are the same. You support one you support all.  Although Kerry agreed to separate alNusra of its antitank and artillery units he has done nothing. He didnt even try. Why?

9260004,0,t1_d8prg6u,Its more about priorities at this stage ISIL has had its gains stopped for quite some time now. Theyre basically bottled up and contained but not defeated entirely yet. They cant mount large offensives like they used to but can accomplish small scale goals occasionally.I say its about priorities because the other factions  groups within Syria are more focused on each other at this stage than picking a fight with a largely contained force. The rebelsislamists FSA et al. are far more concerned with fighting SAA and retaining the territory they hold whilst trying to defeat the SAANDF in line with their goal of removing the regimegovernment. The civil war is beginning to reach the conclusion which will still take a number of months to play out and can still be impacted by surprise events and at this stage the FSA and SAA are focused on each other as the bigger threat. Yes they both fight ISIL but they wont at the cost of losing manpower fighting their primary threat. ISIL is a threat to be dealt with at a later stage its still dangerous but it is nowhere near the level of dangerous that it was.Its a rabid dog thats been tied up to a pole its still dangerous but its not going anywhere for the time being.As for the killing  and  new emerge its been obvious now that the quality of life of the average ISIL grunt has gone down significantly not to mention the quality of recruit. A couple of years ago they could kill  and  fresh young new recruits would be there to take their place but now?

Whatever it may be it sounds totally irrelevant to the concept of a slippery slope fallacy.Im not creating a new concept  let me rephrase myself. You said we cant conclude YPG can help PKK in the future because PKK is helping YPG at the moment.We can not also  conclude YPG will never help PKK. All we can do is looking at our data and speculate about the form of relationship  looking at the ties between PKK and YPG I suggested chances arent low for YPG to help PKK in the future. This isnt a fact we cant know the future  we can assign probabilities.gtIt becomes a slippery slope when you say that this is a vaild argument for intervention which you seem to be trying to say here.I havent defend punishing YPG once for their possible acts in the future. What I said was If YPG is fine with having a PKK fighter spokesman  and Bahoz Erdal fighting and training their militia it gives enough reason Turkey to act against YPG. Its not logical to deny organic relationship between YPG and PKK.gtTurkeys stance on things doesnt matter when we are discussing the legitimacy of an attack on the YPG by the TSK. Of course Turkey will see their own actions as legitimate doesnt mean that they are. The thing is that attacking a group who has shown zero aggression towards you with your casus belli being what they may or may not do in the future makes your actions illegitimate at least from a self defence perspective. Its just aggression at that pointBy that logic one may ask what did AlNusra do to Russia or U.S to trigger their reaction?,syriancivilwar,d94vf4t,1,t5_2x5s1

9464795,0,t1_d9fav8k,The area had factories and was mined heavily. Giving the flat landscape the attackers would have been at a distinct disadvantage. An idiot general got around  men killed.You have to look at the battles in Eastern Ghouta like fighting in the ocean. The majority of the area is rural and flat and the towns and bases are like islands. Artillery dominates the battle and taking a town or a base turns the surrounding area to no go zones for rebels. Soldiers dont have to be directly present to keep it out of their hand. Tal Kurdi was a strong point that allowed rebels last year to threaten Adra prison cut the highway take the suburbs and even reached the mountain range to the north. This capture secures them but also places the rest of rebel held Ghouta out side of the eastern urban area in danger of falling.  Their only saving grace is the low number of SAA troops actually fighting.The northern part of the bulge that exists now from Shifuniya to Midana are small and not very dense. Midana is fortified to the west and north but taking Shifuniya would expose their unfortified flanks. Towns at the southern part like Nashabiyah are heavily defended with several lines trenches at the south only. If the SAA had the numbers they could easily sweep through the area and stop outside of Beit Sawa and Douma. However since the number of soldiers are small they will pause and give time for rebels to start digging and getting ready. Which just slows the fight down. Sending a few thousand soldiers would drastically shortern that frontline and free up lots of them while the urban areas could be held under siege until enough men are available later on.,syriancivilwar,d9fq9sz,10,t5_2x5s1

Europe is competitor and no more then that and they didnt want Europe and Russia cooperated as it could be important competitor. They cant afford direct conflict with RussiaChina or EU but help to create enemy for them in the Middle East where they can waste huge resources. Islamic factor is the main idea around which they could build such enemy. It explains their interests to Syria and wish to restrict Iran and replace its influence there. Unfortunately they got sectarian conflict in the region that overwhelmed idea of Muslim Brotherhood and Co. ISIS is one of consequences of this policy as well. That is why they closed eyes when Turkey nursed ISIS. They simply created rain of money for any islamocentric  no matter moderate radical jihadists terrorists etc. They are k miles away anyway. They believed they could built something manageable and something big and able to sacrify itself to islamic idea  fighting in Europe and Central Asia there is no doubts if Turkey and KSA has success then they will extend their ambitions on european areas and central asia where number of muslims is very significant  millions of people who would be able to die for idea. And this mass should be organized itself into state or something around TurkeyKSA. But they missed tiny aspects of islam and vulnarability of muslims to radicalism where islam is propagated outside of traditional structures. Especially when you finance it through salafits and wakhabits. It was used by AQ as the last is accompanied by saudits and grow where saudits finance islam.

Under the ottoman empire dozen times massacregenocide happend. And othere religion and people did it too like the assyrians and arabs. result millions of yezidi death.During the uprising against saddam hussein the peshmerga use sinjarnorth of sinjar mountains and villages to attack the iraq army.  saddam hussein start the antiDevilworshipping campaign against the yezidi and destroy  villages and poisons waters ect So peshmerga cant use the village to attack. A yezidi girl was in love with a moslem guy in order to merry him she convert to islam. When she return to here house she was stone to death. moslems where inrage and alqadia of iraq send in April  few vbied and kill over  yezidis. And with the US invasion the iraqs where not happy with the yezidis.  Because of that the yezidi community is very close because they dont trust them outsiders.When ISIS attack mosul the iraq army who protect the sinjar and around that flee to erbil. And the peshmerga of KDP whent to sinjar to protect them and make krg bigger. PUK send there peshmerga too because they dont trust KDP. PKK send  fighters too in secret  was arrest by KDP. So when the ISIS attack the sinjar there where . KDP and around few s PUK peshmerga.The KDP peshmerga flee with almost no battle they order yezidis stay in there house. The PUK peshmerga where in battle for  hours waiting for KDP peshmerga backup with never came. The ISIS capture and massacre yezidi around . yezidis flee to the mount sinjar. after few days coup between PKK and YPG they free the yezidis from the mountain. So the Yezidis split in  groups  to the KDP one to the KCK and one to the PMU. And all  hostile against each other. KDP want yezidi join krg and want the PKK leave sinjar and PMU order to join the peshmerga. PMU yezidis are against the PKK because they fear the yezdis get split but they need to pkk protection against the KDP. The PKK wants canton for yezidis?.Because of the hostile of the  groups and sinjar city is bomb to shit  like kobani.And the yezidis are not allowed to return to there city by the KDP. And the currect economic crissis of KRG. this is why lots of yezidis whent to germany. ISIS capture yezidis man women and childeren. man and the childeren where force except islam or get kill. the women where use as sex slavery. From the last report was i did see where around  yezidis missing but not sure if this is for women or everyone including who get kill by ISIS. ,syriancivilwar,d9tt69c,21,t5_2x5s1

Look how long it took US forces backing the SDF to capture Manbij. Al Bab is comparable to Manbij. No one is capturing Al Bab for sometime as long as the issues between TFSA and SDF are unresolved. The regime and Russia have always been the counter weight that can tip the scales in either direction. It really depends on the regime and Putin regarding the success of the operations on both sides. No side will be able to fight off ISIS and the opposing faction while capturing the city at the same time without the help andor backing of the loyalist factions. Thats just the reality of the situation. Manbij is to large of a city for it to just be steamrolled and SDF might not be on top of Manbij right now but they have the ability to put pressure on the rebel pocket which prevents any chance for capturing the city.

So you get Iran but piss off Russia since theyre now more competitors for the energy market than allies. Which Russia and Israel simply wont tolerate because thats pretty much all theyre banking on for their future. So this is terrible but its not a terrible idea even if there were to be a general environment of instability in the Middle East.

The northern FSA would not exist without Turkish help. If there is one thing we learned from this conflict is that air support is a game changer. e.g. YPG was losing to ISIS in Kobane until CAS arrivedThat boils down to an acknowledgement that the Northern FSA are not some beacon of revolutionary ideals from the beginning of the war but an artificial construct of Turkey to stem SDFYPG gains against ISIS.gtImported proxies do you mean the Syrians who fled from Assad and want to take their country back?

Russia might be furnishing the treasure to operate the air wings pay for the ordnance fire the missiles etc. Iran is sacrificing the bloodalthough quite cleverly they are coercing Afghan Shia who are refugees in Iran to shed their blood instead.Probably both Russia and Iran can be satisfied with an arrangement   whereby their core goals are met Russia to keep and expand and upgrade Naval and Air Bases in Syria and to build new ones Iran to  keep Syria as a link in the arc of Shia influence thus keeping a direct secure and robust ground link between Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon running through Iraq and then through Syria.

9848531,0,t1_dar44hn,gt Can you give me an example in modern times someone going to prison for speaking Kurdish in Turkey?Yes. This is a rather wellknown case since it involved a lawmaker Leyla Zanagtgt  In  Zana became the first Kurdish woman to win a seat in the Turkish parliament. She created a scandal when she spoke Kurdish on the floor of the parliament after being sworn in even though it was known to be illegal. The Kurdish language even when spoken in private had been illegal for decades in Turkey. Only in that year  was the Kurdish language finally legalized though speaking Kurdish remained illegal in public spaces as Zana was sworn in. Her remarks endedgtgtgt I swear by my honor and my dignity before the great Turkish people to protect the integrity and independence of the State the indivisible unity of people and homeland and the unquestionable and unconditional sovereignty of the people. I swear loyalty to the Constitution. I take this oath for the brotherhood between the Turkish people and the Kurdish people.gtgt Only the final sentence of the oath was spoken in Kurdish I take this oath for the brotherhood between the Turkish people and the Kurdish people.gtgt Although Zanas parliamentary immunity protected her after she joined the Democracy Party that party was banned and her immunity was stripped. In December  along with four other Democracy Party MPs Hatip Dicle Selim Sadak and Orhan Dogan she was arrested and charged with treason and membership in the armed Kurdistan Workers Party PKKThe Turkish state understands that language  culture which is why it deems a separate Kurdish identity to be a threat to its power.gt The conflict is certainly not just about basic rights this has been demonstrated in the peace talks called Kurdish initiative that AKP started with the PKK.Tell that to all the Kurds who feel that their struggle indeed are about basic civil rights especially since they were suppressed for decades as a people and since they still feel suppression today as part of an ongoing antiseparatist campaign by the Turkish state. gt The PKK Kurds clearly want a huge chunk of Turkey to be Kurdistan and will stop at nothing to get it.All youre doing is repeating government propaganda used to justify their crackdowns.The PKK has moved away from secession as a goal greatly due to Apos ideological shift away from relying upon the state as the primary instrument of political power. Democratic Confederalism focuses on local autonomy as a form of governance as opposed to a topdown nationstate. This kind of rule or administration can be called a nonstatepolitical administration or a democracy without a state. Democraticdecisionmaking processes must not be confused with theprocesses known from public administration. States only administrate while democracies govern. States are founded on power democracies are based on collective consensus. Office in the state is determined by decree even though it may be in part legitimized by elections. Democracies use direct elections. The stateuses coercion as a legitimate means. Democracies rest on voluntaryparticipation calan .gt Its unfortunate they didnt get a country in WW but Turkey is not obligated to give land to anyone under international law. Its also obvious that you want this according to the way you refer to towns in SE Turkey as Kurdish towns.Again the PKK is seeking autonomy not secession which shouldnt be surprising considering how the Turkish state has treated these towns By suppression via military occupation and the arrest of mayors and other Kurdish politicians. BTW I refer to these towns or cities as Kurdish since they are majorityKurdish towns and not as a recognition of some form of Kurdish nationalism.gt In regards to arrest of HDP officials. I for one am against the illegal purge of all opposition parties institutions companies etc. But the reason HDP is targeted is for their alleged links to the PKK and not by merely being Kurdish as you are implying.Isnt it convenient how the HDP were attacked by the government and its street thugs after the party was able to get more than  in Parliament? Also isnt it a typical tactic of authoritarian governments to use terrorism as an excuse to arrest opposition party members especially ones from a minority ethnic group and with differing ideological progressive values compared to the rightwing AKP.Few democratic nations if any behaves in the same fashion that Turkey has behaved over the last few years as far as its internal politics is concerned. Besides the arrest of dozens of its members the HDP has also had hundreds of its offices attacked and looted often while police looked on and did nothing. Thee HDP has also had its rallies bombed twice by Daesh and neither time did the Turkish government feel the need to retaliate as if the deaths of dozens of leftwing Turkish citizens were an irrelevant unworthy of notice  or more likely members of the Turkish state sympathized with Daeshs attack on HDP members more than anything else especially since the HDP has been deemed an enemy of the Turkish state. gt However you cant just come out and say that HDP is being purged for being Kurdish or that speaking Kurdish is illegal in Turkey because that is misinformation.I dont think the HDP are being targeted primarily for being Kurdish but also for being a leftwing secular party as well. Also speaking Kurdish may not be illegal today but it is still difficult for Kurdish speaking people in Turkey. I noticed how you totally overlooked the governments seizure of Kurdishlanguage papers and TV channels as an ongoing campaign of intimidation and oppression of Kurds. Heck the government even shut down a Kurdish cartoon program that was deemed to be separatist in natureMore on Turkeys targeting of the Kurds,syriancivilwar,darabjw,1,t5_2x5s1

The elderly and the injured did not receive the treatment they ought to get. Especially the first man feels sad about the warehouses rebels kept... Full of food medicines and so on. But they kept it to themselves. The contrast between this and receiving free food and medical care from the neighboring Sheikh Maqsoud was very strong to him.

In spite of this they rebels kept it closed to us. We would only get a very small part.It is noteworthy that the second man says that YPG liberated his neighborhood.

I even remember rebel supporters trying to pass off the rifles as being captured from the government despite their configuration matching more closely with the FALs in the hands of Libyan rebels. The Ms still see use depending on the group. Actual Americanmade MAs are used in numbers by various Americansponsored FSA groups like Division  and the TFSA as well as the Kurds and IS captured from the Iraqis but the MAs and their ChineseIranian copies are no longer as commonly used by the rebels  which seems to be as a result of the Lebanese border being sealed off. ,syriancivilwar,dazt3rq,2,t5_2x5s1

Thats why he criticizes the PYD for not being nationalist enough its an attempt to smear the Rojava as not a true Kurdish state. Even the collaboration between the two during the Battle of Kobani came very begrudgingly and that was when they were both facing an existential threat from ISIS. With ISIS gone theres no reason for them to cooperate any more. If the US did not intervene in the favor of the FSA back in  when chemical weapons were used what makes you think they will intervene now for the SDF when Russia and Iran have a massive presence in Syria and there is a serious risk of a wider war? ,syriancivilwar,db084er,3,t5_2x5s1

9919146,0,t3_5hgrdc,Its really impossible to know how a Trump administration will act due to his ahem unpredictability but it seems like a sure bet that ties will be tight between Putin and Russia so I dont think American interest in Rojava is likely to be cultivated as a proxy conflict. Any conflicting interests that do arise will see immediate capitulation in Russias favor if Trumps handling of Carrier is any indication. This gives Russia a very powerful position in determining the outcome of this conflict which by default gives power to Bashar alAssad who has proclaimed that a federal system is unacceptable to him and he believes if put before the Syrian people they would not accept it either  and hes probably right the Arab Syrians are going to be eyeing the Kurdishcontrolled oil fields to help rebuild and a federal system would impede this. Prospects are grim and it looks like the SDF are not going to be able to take alBab in time to connect the cantons so the SDF is going to have a weak hand at the table. However the fledgling prodemocratic TEVDEM organization seems to have really mobilized and laid the groundwork for their new governing bodies. PYD representatives and Rojava administrators have also talked to diplomats and there is a positive public perception of the Kurds both in the US and Russia. So in a way it depends on how sympathetic the Russians are to the political goals of the SDF are namely a federal system and whether they are actually planning on pushing alAssad in that direction.,syriancivilwar,db0hnec,1,t5_2x5s1

10068096,0,t3_5jy4nz,Very important lecture given by Nasrallah to a naturally receptive audience at one of the greatest turning points in st century history thus far  the victory at Aleppo looks like for now to set Syria and its regional and international allies on track for the greatest triumph in the name of the selfdetermination of nationstates not integrated with a U.S.dominated world order since the end of the Cold War. This is why Syria and Lebanon and Russias enemies are so rabid about the direction this conflict is moving. It isnt about President Assad or even just Syria but what it means for other nations who might want to go their own way if they can resist the transnational Salafi Islamism and the liberalimperialism and all the Gulf money and Western financial backing and other resources. They had finally found a way to conduct aggressive and expansionist wars against disobedient small countries without risking too many casualties of their own citizens resulting in possible domestic legal complications and political fallout through utilization of regime change wars hybrid wars fourthgeneration warfare to militarize opposition in countries who dont submit to your wishes and to turn society against the state and itself. The defeat of that model in Syria heralds a new era. It is Syrias greatest victory since its inception as a modern state in the postOttoman period and it is a victory for nationalism and selfdetermination in this world. Hence why internationalists of either the Islamist or liberal variety who think they have a Godgiven right to spread their preferred ideology over other peoples borders and across their lands by force if necessary despise and fear this turn of events so.It is truly their Vietnam moment in the st century. Aleppo gentle nurturer and crossroads of civilizations returned to its rightful Syrian hands stands today as a city of true significance and global magnificence.This was also quite pointed  Nothing less from Sayyed Nasrallahgt Sayyed Nasrallah then voiced condemnation to ISILs burning of two Turkish soldiers alive warning that Turkey is paying price its support to the Takfiri group.gt In this regard Sayyed Nasrallah called on Ankara to announce a clear stance from ISIL.gt Turkey banned social media yesterday in a bid to prevent its people from seeing the price of supporting ISIL Sayyed Nasrallah said.,syriancivilwar,dbjw9fw,6,t5_2x5s1

Generally it would not have been correct for the U.S. to provide close combat air support to the SAA when not requested by the Syrian government to do so. Without any agreed upon parameters liaisons for military communications or coordination such efforts to degrade and destroy ISIS would have been risky. Under comparatively favorable conditions at Deir ezZor things did not turn out so well. There is always the risk that the SAA might have launches SAMs to try to shoot down the US planes. That would have been awkward....Finally it should be noted that ISIS now takes robust precautions to render themselves less vulnerable to air strikes. The U.S. has responded to the U.N. resolution to encourage protection of civilians from Ethnic and religious cleansing and from ISIS attempts at genocide. Strictly speaking those conditions were not so manifest with respect to Palmyra or with Deir ezZor.Moreover it would have been naive to believe that had the U.S. magically managed to solve the Syrian Governments ISIS problem that there would not have been contingent impacts on other stakeholders especially the moderate nonIslamist rebels.,syriancivilwar,dblq54j,1,t5_2x5s1

If I was going to speculate rather than pointing out the purges to be trendy I would point to the Turkish armed forces historical focus on preparing for high intensity conventional war against a Warsaw Pact AFV equipped enemy and light guerilla warfare against the PKK insurgency. Turkish forces are having to learn how to fight a lower intensity war against an asymmetric opponent making extensive use of ATGMs and SVBIEDs while hiding among civilians. Compared to the US backed SDF forces which took Manbij and are advancing on TabqaRaqqa Turkey lacks the decade of experience the US has from leading operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Furthermore the assets available to Turkey are nowhere near as capable as the US led coalition. The US can call upon vast numbers of ground attack aircraft including strategic bombers it has enough armed drones to continuously watch over and support ground forces and airborne intelligence aircraft are constantly scanning for ISIS forces and communications. Even though the Turkish air force can now operate safely in Syria it simply doesnt have the same resources. Which isnt to mention the numbers and capabilities of worldclass supporting special forces not only from the USA but also the UK and France with more experience in this kind of warfare than any other such SF in the world.,syriancivilwar,dboagmc,5,t5_2x5s1

They knew and they even saw it as a positive considering it would help further isolate Assad. They even knew it could blowback on Iraq but they didnt care.Their primary goal was getting rid of Assad whatever the cost. That desperation led to the creation of ISIS the migrant crisis that now threatens the entire EU Brexit the death of hundreds of thousands and an exponential rise in the power of jihadi groups like AlQaeda across the globe.This is criminality on a mass scale. Absolutely disgusting behaviour that has literally led to genocide. The US and its allies are complicit in unimaginable horrors.

In conclusion by taking Tabqa dam and city the SDF will get control of an important source of electricity as well as an excellent crossing over the river.

People just falsely project that because they had a major victory with the capture of Idlib city and most of Idlib governorate in the Idlib salient campaign but this was since the beginning of the war low hanging fruit with overextended troops and a low numbered skeleton force in the provincial capital not to mention being the most antigovernment in sentiment popularity wise of any governorate in Syria. Its also less strategically important by far compared to Aleppo Homs the coast the capital etc.The closest insurgents ever actually got to winning the war was in the summer of  when it looked like Aleppo and Damascus could actually fall before Syrian forces forced a stalemate that divided Aleppo city and secured a decisive defensive victory in Damascus.

10390728,0,t1_dclt5c3,gtgt The conclusions of my analysis are based solely on what I believe is most advantageous to the stated goals of the Kurds.gtI didnt actually imply that you meant Kurds owe something to SAA. What I was trying to say was from SDF point of view they dont feel any guilt on their part so they wont also feel obliged to do something about it.I was trying to underline that if the SDF were to alleviate the siege of DeirEzZor it wouldnt be out of any arbitrary guilt for anything but out of pure military realism regarding the implications on the SDFs Raqqa offensive that the rapidly deteriorating situation in DeirEzZor could have. Specifically my explanations regarding how much more difficult and costly the SDF attempt to liberate Raqqa would be if they ignored the SAAs need to be alleviated in DeirEzZor and allowed ISIS to overrun it and consolidate their remaining hardpower directly in Raqqas backyard. gtI must add this I personally hope SDF would start an offensive towards DeZ. And I agree with you that this will achieve a very strong bond between SAA and SDF. But I think prospects are against this becoming true. Agreed especially with the last sentence unfortunately.gtgt The SAA will hold on to every square of DeirEzZor with every single man they have there.gtYour argument about why DeZ wouldnt fall is completely reasonable. I also think and hope they will do it for a long time. However lets also not forget how much potential SAA has in terms of disappointing people. The last example was in Palmyra. We all thought SAA was playing every card to stop it. And we did believe for a while that ISIS advance was stopped. That as well as the fact that theres no way of predicating the tide of war is why I believe it is imperative that for the SDF to alleviate the seige of DeirEzZor to prevent ISIS from consolidating their remaining hardpower in Raqqas backyard.gtgt They will also take Raqqa much faster that way because if the siege on DeirEzZor isnt alleviated Raqqas defenses will start being refortified with the majority of the hardpower ISIS has remaining.gtI disagree with this part. When you take some place from ISIS not all militants die. Most of them excape or retreat to nearby strongholds. So if DeZ falls most of ISIS militants will join up Raqqa defences. And when Raqqa ops starts they will fight to the toe since they wont have any place to escape. The difference would be a scattered ISIS combared to the majority of ISISs remaining hardpower being consolidated in a base thats in Raqqas backyard. My main assumption is that ISIS is attempting to consolidate their hardpower in DeirEzZor facing the inevitable loss of Mosul and the rising strength and effectiveness of the joint Coalition and Iraqi army activity. If DeirEzZor falls ISIS will be able to fortify their defenses in Raqqa to a level that the Kurds will have a much more difficult and costly time trying to penetrate. Besides preventing that liberating DeirEzZor would give the Kurds the advantage of going up to Raqqa along the Euphrates significantly hindering ISISs supply lines into Raqqa and increasing the chances of a successful encirclement of Raqqa that ISIS will not be able to break out of. ,syriancivilwar,dclurt9,2,t5_2x5s1

Last year maybe but after the fall of Aleppo and their singular success in North Hama becoming a disaster due to infighting its not going to happen. If they had set aside their differences and fought alongside each other in that time one might even agree that they could have pushed to the gates of Hama.One must also understand that the rebels are nonmonolithic for a reason. Contrasting rebel groups such as Div   and Ahrar  if you look at the ideologies and their goals we see a far different end goal for Syria in mind. These views have wedged between how the rebels commit their strengths and how they fight the government.Up until this point the rebels have received copious amounts of funding and arms from the US Jordan Gulf and Turkey which has been relaxed. The SDFs efforts in Syria have seen a shift in US policy Turkey has largely shifted into supporting the Euphrates Shield operation instead of the antigovernment Idlib rebels and after the Southern Storm Offensive last year  Jordan almost completely stopped aiding Southern Front a more secular member of the Free Syrian Army. They were supported against the ISIS affiliate Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade awhile back but have since then been unable to completely oust them. The rebels as of now are at an impasse. Up until now secular rebel groups have had to rely heavily upon more radicalized groups in order to gain traction but are terrorized by said groups if they overstep as seen in Maraat alNuman  where they crushed Div  for control. Unity would certainly have helped a number of times during the conflict but unfortunately the fact that the different groups in Syria all have totally different end goals in mind groups such as Div  and Southern Front want a democratic Syria Nusra wants to establish an Islamic Caliphate.I might be coming back to post more sources sorry Im in a bit of a hurry here,syriancivilwar,dd5q1fi,23,t5_2x5s1

10599416,0,t3_5rpj1l,Does anyone else ever get sick of the constant Sunni Islamist victimization narrative? In this case just like every other one Sunni Islamists were the aggressors. Violent heavilyarmed Ikhwan militants took over a city killed most of the poorlyarmed SAA peacekeeping force and then began sacking government buildings and murdering Baathists and sometimes even their wives and kids. The operation had been planned months in advance in Iraq and Belgium. The Ikhwan had started stashing weapons in mosques and schools in Hama in the Summer of . You can argue that the regimes response was disproportionate but that doesnt negate the fact that the whole thing never wouldve happened if the Ikhwan didnt feel the need to violently seize a city and murder innocent people because they didnt like the presidents religion.Its actually kinda funny to see how the narrative has changed over the years. During the battle in February  the Ikhwan called Hama a liberated city and bragged on their radio station about allegedly killing  soldiers and regime supporters. Now they claim that they only had a light presence in Hama or some other bullshit and that Hafez just picked a random Sunni city to massacre or something. Its always the same with these people. When theyre winning theyre brave warriors killing evil infidels who deserve death because theyre evil infidels.

And finally the narrative that Kurdish people are currently being oppressed in Turkey is equally silly.

Tiger forces mission in East Aleppo is to actually reach the Assad lake and recapture the water supply to Aleppo city from ISIS. Gas or fuel shortage through the entire governmentcontrolled areas makes it hard to transport and cold in this winter. SAA Operation in East Homs will hopefully be successful through the next weeks and they can restore the gas and oil fields to help with that. NDF militias especially in the old city are using their power and are stealing from some houses like refrigerators washing machines and such to sell them else where. Also kidnapping people and asking their families for ransom money. Disgusting stuff. I heard government released a statement to stop such things but in the end these NDF groups act as mop gangsters in these areas because unlike West Aleppo these areas dont have much police security yet. Russia has deployed some forces before to demine all the explosives rebels have hid throughout East Aleppo before they left the city. They have finished their job and left already they are now teaching some SAA forces how to demine explosives for the future. The government recently has made an agreement of about  billion Syrian Liras to be spent in rebuilding of the structures roads and houses in East Aleppo. Dont think that would be enough but hopefully more comes after.No doubt the city has went through a devastating war and alot has changed. The old city is a huge loss of this war sadly.

10883770,0,t1_de27ej3,I would say it is mostly just due to the YPG not having artillery and tanks. I did a comparison a few months back on Russian airstrikes and coalition airstrikes during Manbij. Most civilian casualties from air strikes are from civilians being too close not from a bomb missing its target. When you compare only urban bombings between the coalition and Russia they have very similar civilian casualty rates. Youve probably seen recently that last month the coalition killed  more civilians than Russia but that is due to Russia striking in more rural areas currently. So I would say the airforce is not really a large contributor between the two in why we see low civilian casualties. While I do agree the coalition is more precise as they use a lot of JDAMs it isnt such a large precision gap to impact civilian casualties. ,syriancivilwar,de2l0l5,2,t5_2x5s1

I could work with identical materials and come out with the conclusion that Russia is operating like a bankrupt yet ambitious major power and that couldnt be refuted either.Where there are tangible analyses that we can break down i.e. in his reading of US doctrine he isnt quite nailing it on the head and that makes his reading of Russia suspect as well. He describes the USA as operating moreorless exclusively in a bumbling monolithic slow and undercommitted fashion despite the fact that Libya which he deems a US failure Id argue it wasnt Americas war to lose was played very nearly precisely by what he describes as the Russian rulebook. In Yemen Africa and Pakistan weve also seen America employing tactical force for strategic gains and then finally theres Syria...Say what you will about the US involvement in Syria but its been fluid localized employed proxies kept all the exit strategies open and been completely successful at  out of its  goals support YPG and fight IS. Theyve failed at regime change but they never really invested real resources in it and Im sure that the Americans know that Assad staying in power isnt the worst possible outcome.All of which is to say the US at its worst is on a level playing field with Russia at making cheap gains via tactical investments. Russia seemingly having the upper hand in Syria is the byproduct of them having more concrete goals there it isnt in any way indicative of an actual ontheground tactical advantage nor is it supremacy of doctrine.,syriancivilwar,degceg7,3,t5_2x5s1

Is it mujahideen or not? And is Jihadis a literal translation of mujahideen or not? If they call themselves jihadis and take pride in it then why using this term is ruining rational discussion? We can say that the usage of the term Jihadi differs significantly in East and West and moreover we can add that many anticolonialist definitely not religiously extreme fighting forces also used mujahideen term as their descriptor underground newspaper for Algerian leftwingleaning ideologically Arab nationalist Front of National Liberation during the times of Algerian liberation war against French rule was called El Mujahid for a reason but thats another point.And whats wrong with wahhabis? I mean how you would characterize religious orientation of the overwhelming majority from the groups fighting for the rebel side in this war? Even ikhwanis are very few and far between totally overshadowed by Salafistleaning groups and fighters. From what I get more than  of nonDaesh nonSDF insurgents in Syria follow Salafist ideology and doctrines and thats a conservative estimate most probably you know it even better than me if you are really from Syria so its perfectly rational to call them wahhabis. Yes most of ranknfile fighters are not very wellversed in dogmatic Islamic subtleties and nuances but still they totally associate themselves with global SalafiWahhabi movement even if they are not able to quote Uthaimeen and bin Baz as much as some imported Najdi scholar or judge a la Muhaysini could.

11278147,0,t1_dfa98ht,You know I totally agree with you. But thats not surprising. System of propaganda is so powerful and allpervasive that people often solidarize with politicians who fervently and consistently act against those peoples interests domestically. And now were talking about some complicated stuff in a foreign land most people know next to nothing about. For example the previous offensive in Northern Hamah which happened half a year ago or so was lead by Jund alAqsa defected to Daesh since ethnically Uyghur TalibanalQaedaallied Turkestan Islamic Party and groups like Junud ashSham and Jabhat Ansar adDeen which mostly consist of foreign fighters with extreme Salafi ideology the former one has ChechenKistin leadership and the latter has sizeable percentage of fighters from Morocco Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Yet it still was spinned in MSM as Syrian rebels offensive against forces of dictator Bashar alAssads regime and there was no widespread public outrage against such a terribly biased narrative.I think that general public is also to blame for the simplicity with which they fall for these cheap and primitivistic propaganda traps but without diving deep into international politics details conflicted allegiances thinly veiled and evershifting clandestine alliances and perplexed peculiarities and to comprehend this sort of stuff most of the regular people have neither time nor abilities plus in many cases no real interest and passion its extremely hard to cut through all these layers over layers over layers of informational bullshit.

From February  gtThe Turkishbacked Ahrar alSham group announced on Saturday on Twitter that the rebel forces had taken Al Babs silos and sports complex in its southwestern districts.My conclusion is that Ahrar cannot be defined as TBR in any meaningful way compared to nonES rebels. I found that Ahrar is a vocal supporter of ES but they have participated in ES without official recognition or support from Turkey. Their presence makes little functional change to the organization as a whole and they are not as reliant as ES rebels are of Turkish support.

Now they dont have a voice anymore and you will find them as refugees scattered about everywhere in the world and the majority of them have turned to side with Assad with how things have turned out.gtIn this particular case the recent northern Hama offensive Ive seen no reports of ethnic cleansing or genocidal actions which would supposedly be carried out by rebels.Thats true no ethnic cleansing or genocidal actions were carried out. Yet! They have the fight to be focused on. Do you really not expect them to carry these actions later on? Who killed father Frans Van Der Lugt in Homs? A famous priest in the country who has been serving the community for  years and bringing Christians and Muslims together not on common religious grounds as it is often attempted but on human grounds instead. Also who blew up the Armenian Genocide Memorial Church?gtTherefore I am worried about the things I can see and that are widely reported and acknowledged rather than the as of now rumours used to attack rebels.Murdering by rebels is no rumour. It is very much reported as well. Look at history and even recent wars when has civilian toll ever been an argument to which side is fighting for the right cause?,syriancivilwar,dfdalcg,2,t5_2x5s1

The Baath Party won  out of  seats in the Parlamentary elections the rest went to Opposition Partys and Independent politicians not affiliated with a party.The Syrians among the Rebels will have to join the political process like everybody else and prove there support through the ballot box there is no terrorising or negotiating your way into power there is only  path and it goes through the ballot box.gt No thanks the Assad regime has greatly destabilized the region.

The problem with a  year old conflict is that resources have dried up and basic infrastructure has completely collapsed.   You have no power running water or food for a lot of locations.  Its very hard to have children focus on education when their families are in survival mode.And so that esentially creates a lost generation.   Lets say you were  years old when the conflict began.   If it ended today you would be the age when most children are in th or th grade and you havent had a day of proper school yet.   Even worse if you were  years old at the time you would be  now and school is no longer even an option as your family now relies on you to work to help survive.    This will create a very large uneducated workforce in the near future which will struggle to find jobs and will only feed the radical islamic groups with more recruits making the region even more unstable.And we are not even close to an end to the conflict.    ,syriancivilwar,dggcr4i,4,t5_2x5s1

Thought it was important as they didnt choose terrorist organization. I think it simply comes from the fact french people have a thing for armed struggle  we rarely present an armed group with left tendencies as only terrorist they still reminded the terrorist attacks of the PKK.The general read is that its part of bigger diplomatic campaign from Turkey reminding some of the recent fails trying to get influence back in the region by forcing the US to comply more to their interest as well as weakening the PKKthrough weakening of their US backed allies and showing they are willing to at least cause them trouble.I really thought it was going to be worse it even talked a bit about PDK Mossul etc. Guess it could always be more complete but thats not too bad.EDIT Clarity amp words,syriancivilwar,dgv4b5m,2,t5_2x5s1
