4786535,0,t1_ctxvez0,Thanks for your advice. I ended up throwing the milk out as it just wasnt working. I believe there was never any grains in there to start with and I got ripped off .Ive moved onto kombucha though and really love it. If I find water kefir grains Ill still give them a go.,Kefir,ctxvrev,1,t5_2swnj
5081165,0,t3_3jus5l,Damn gnats. Ive been trying to kill one for the past few hours.Obviously youve already dealt with it by now but I would cook with it. Deglaze a pan and make a sauce or use it to make rice.,Kefir,cuyh1ig,1,t5_2swnj

10589301,0,t3_5rawu9,I had the same issue but used raw milk.  Ive also been trying to make kombucha and I think the shelf I have everything on is too warm so its fermenting faster than I expected it to.Im going to try to do it for less time in the same spot.,Kefir,dd87e64,1,t5_2swnj
