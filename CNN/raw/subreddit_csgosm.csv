6924644,0,t3_4ahmbb,hi bigioh we learn your site from thetabetaplays. I am sorry for scammers but you should assume that kind of situations at the beginning. We put some over price items at the site because of your request. Actually none of us think include thetabetaplays that those items going to sell. First of all we want to support your site and i will continue to selling of my items at csgosm after this crisis. I wished that you do that statement when site goes offline. Because i charged from my credit cart  dollars today than i bought some items when your site goes online again and my items sold in  hours. Therefore we helped to scammers for scamming you us unintentionally. If i know this situation i didnt do this. I hope you can withdraw our money until end of march otherwise I screw up D.Anyway lets talk about some solutions idea. Firstly whitelisting is a good idea but you should do this at the beginning. Secondly any kind of payment method has own risks. You should guarantee yourself at legal framework. In Turkey exchanging digital items for real money still at the grey zone. You should consider your countrys laws because you are dealing with money and you have to protect your rights and our rights on the legal infrastructure. Secondly I couldnt write any kind of information about me at the user settings even I intent to give you wrong information except email. You only know my paypal email and steam profile link. Users have to give you more information about themselves which you can validate in case of a legal situation. Maybe the best solution is you should make a contract with payment firms face to face at legal infrastructure. I strongly recommend to you get advices from a lawyer.There is an another point for your site. If I try to sell overpriced items users cant see steam market prices on the item. I think this will not stop scammers but item sellers might consider their prices again. if they try to sell their items at normal prices you may minimize your lost even you scammed. You may limit to maximum prices of items. I know this idea not good for free market economy. But at the beginning you take lower risk for scamming. For example I try to sell an item which has  dollars price at the steam market. If you limit this items price maximum  dollars you lost only  dollars instead of  or more. When your sites money circulation getting high you can remove this limit. So that is my first suggestions for this topic Regards.,csgosm,d118e8g,1,t5_3bwye
