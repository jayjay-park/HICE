10451587,0,t3_5pme96,When we moved cross country PA to WA  I couldnt drive with the stuff  time constraints  so I used Upack and was happy with it. The deal is they send the freight part of a semi drop it off with you you fill it and pay by linear feet used then they fill the rest up with freight and deliver it to your new place. It was a bit of a pain that the apartment we moved to had no place to park it so we had to speed unload so it might not work if you cant find somewhere to park it. But it took about a week and was the cheapest option we found for our needs. ,SeaList,dcssclu,3,t5_2sall
