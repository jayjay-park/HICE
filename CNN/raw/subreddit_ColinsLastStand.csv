11341585,0,t1_dfgvkx8,well see thats where I only have questions.If the disparity exists because of choices women are willingly making choices in regards to family College major part time vs full time is it even an actual problem like is there anything wrong with it at that point?if societal trends and culture are leading women down those routes. is THAT a problem? is there something inherently wrong with the trends toward these choices? do women who deviate from those trends have equal opportunity in doing so? and if so then is that okay that wage differences shake out the way they do?basically with all of these lines of questioning I find the discussion is no longer on the subject of a wage gap but on broader societal and cultural matters. and at that point I begin to find bringing up any sort of wage gap to be pointless because it is a terrible way to go about broaching the topics at the core of the disparity. so essentially to your question of where is the middle ground if one is discussing the gender pay gap idk if there  really is a middle ground because it doesnt exist in the way that it is implied  times out of . the term itself should be put aside and the issues addressed directly and not behind some misleading term.,ColinsLastStand,dfhjrt2,1,t5_3jlua

Its helped them in the culture war significantly up until now but theyve overstepped their bounds.  I think the right is so loosely defined now you have libertarians neocons paleocons the alt right....   Its so loosely defined that anyone who is pro free speech is considered right wing by the left. Meanwhile the right is happy to support anyone on issues they align with and I dont think they mind if people are calling Rubin right wing.,ColinsLastStand,dft80e8,2,t5_3jlua

11460881,0,t1_dfup9c2,I do think you have a misplaced sense of gratitude.    People think of Christianity as Abrahamic religionlite  Diet Abraham. Abraham Zero  but the Crusades happened because of Christianity. Assuming we interpret the bible you have in your hotel drawer the exact same way it would lead to similar consequences.ampnbspChristianity went through a metamorphosis. We no longer equate to nonliteral interpretations of the bible as blasphemy. We dont hang and burn people. We dont stone our wives to death.Much like matter and antimatter I dont think the base counts for much. If our ancestors happened to be Muslim instead of Christian but went though the same metamorphosis then i would argue that we could be equally as fortunate with that being the base of our rootsampnbspThis change didnt happen because of religion it happened in spite of it.,ColinsLastStand,dfv30lz,2,t5_3jlua

11496463,0,t3_640y5q,Its been a rough day. Im shocked scared and tired. I was at uni when I heard about the attack thankfully its a bit from central Stockholm so I was out of danger. I immediately thought of my little sister. I hadnt spoken to anyone yet but somehow I just knew she was there. It may be hard to believe but I just knew it. I immediately tried to call my family but the phone networks were already going down. I managed to get hold of my mom after a few minutes and she told me that my sister had indeed been on her way out of the building when the attack happened.At this point I freaked the fuck out. I told my mom that I was going to find my sister and ran out of the building I was in not stopping to take any of my things with me. My mom told me to stay where I was to be safe but I told her I had to find my sister. I was almost at the tube station when my mom finally managed to convince me to stay. My sister hadnt been hurt and she was on her way back to her school where shed be safe. So I walked back to the building I was in and stayed there for the rest of the day. I was surrounded by friends who took care of me and helped me through the shock. I love them for that and I will never forget what they did for me today.In the end my sister was completely terrified and in shock but physically unharmed. I dont think Im overreacting when I say that thats a miracle. Something happening to her is my worst nightmare so Ive been a mess today. Im starting to recover from the shock now though and Ill make sure that this weekend will include a lot a fucking ton of hugs and family time.,ColinsLastStand,dfz4gdx,4,t5_3jlua

11571151,0,t1_dg7kvgk,Reopened because they were closed in low income areas. The cost of the card isnt the issue here its the fact that some people without cars have to travel miles away to even have access to one. Maybe where you are you can just drive down the road and find a DMV. Not everyone has that benefit. Youd like to think people are just too lazy I know. But when you say just get an ID and some states are making it harder to do so it makes voting less likely not more. ,ColinsLastStand,dg7lgl5,3,t5_3jlua
11627920,0,t3_65wew0,Just as a side note regarding tensions between South Korea and Japan they still exist to some capacity albeit not as pronounced as they were  years ago.The  year occupation is still very much a sore spot in Korean culture and any misstep is like lighting a match onto a pool of gasoline.The most recent example was with with Tiffany of the KPop group Girls Generation. She posted a Snapchat of her vacation in Japan and used a Snapchat filter with the words Tokyo Japan stylized to look like the Rising Sun Flag which is considered offensive in Korea because of its association with the occupation and the Imperial Navy.She received death threats was harassed on social media to the point of leaving it temporarily and worst of all had to be removed from a popular variety TV show that she was a part of all because of a Snapchat filter.Another example was in the popular Japanese mangaanime Attack on Titan which has a large worldwide following including South Korea.One of the characters was modeled after Yoshifuru Akiyama a general in the Imperial Army during the time of the occupation.This offended many South Korean and Chinese fans as they view him responsible for the horrific acts of violence rape sexual slavery etc perpetrated by Japanese soldiers during that time leading to the author receiving numerous death threats and potentially hurting the success of Attack on Titan in Korea. So while its not to the point of outright toyourface racism theres definitely still some lingering animosity in South Korea towards Japan and with these feelings being almost ingrained into their culture at this point I dont know when it will ever go away.,ColinsLastStand,dge1cj8,4,t5_3jlua
