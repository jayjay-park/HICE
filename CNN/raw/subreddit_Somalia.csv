4043515,0,t1_crgsu6f,Im perfectly aware of that but black doesnt just mean african Americans. Black encompasses everything from carribean to just visiting from Africa.Somalis are black. It doesnt not refer to a race but to a skin color. Most white people in the US are american citizens but there are plenty of white people that are recent immigrants or just visiting.Embrace it dude black is beautiful. Why this aversion to being considered black? ,Somalia,crh6wwv,1,t5_2qm0m

6052072,0,t1_cyco1qw,The Somalia needs to helpsupport and nurture small to medium homegrown business and so capitalism and a good monetary system is key to that. Look at china pre and post .However to do that it needs stability and to have a monopoly on the use of force. I do agree though that liberalism is not needed or useful in somalia.its too late to be worried about western military invention in somalia it had already done so in  when it had pressured Ethiopia to wipe out the ICU and the disastrous  intervention. Also the west used  and weapons of mass destruction as a casus belli to invade both countries. You should be more worried about the clandestine activities off the CIA and how many Somali politicians are in their pockets.,Somalia,cycxf0z,3,t5_2qm0m

Consider the fact that the combined real estate in one city i was working in was around  billion and the exports of livestock alone are around  billion. I think its a reasonable guess.gtSomalia is hurting for investment.Its hurting for a lack of investment oppertunities within itself. Ive heard of like  banks which shut down because of a money glut.

8068252,0,t1_d4mtpsn,Sorry for not clearing up my statement there. The knowledge I was refering to is that which is applied in the academic discourse. I believe more than anyone that Somali society and the Somali territories have a massive wealth of untapped and unknown knowledge both oral and archeogical. I argue that these mostly untapped assets have been severly underused and remain mostly unknown and as such lie compelety outside the pale and scrutiny of academia.I.M Lewis is one of those examples of greatly outdated research and academic corpus I certianly had in mind. Many of his views and the factual information he provides in his books and papers have no evidence and were seemingly conjured out of nothingness. He goes to make more grevious error by building upon these views and evidences to formulate and construct a history of which he parades as fact. A great example of this includes his factual claim  and subsequent clinging to such a claim   that the Somali port cities and towns are of Arabian and Islamic origin giving th century founding dates to cities and ports that in all likelyhood seem to have existed since  CE at the very least. Such basic factual information with a much stronger backup from the archeological and historical literary record has been repeatedly ignored by him.Prof. Ali Jimale Ahmed is the same with I.M Lewis except in the reverse. He is a revisionist the likes of Dr. Eno and many of his statements and provided factual evidence similarly have no backup whatsoever. The mainstream Somali academics most notably Dr. Samatar base alot of their works on I.M Lewis. The man being a pillar of current Somali studies you can see how great of a flaw remains so deeply embedded in the field with the older Somali academics  all longtime compatriots of Lewis   being heavily under his influence as is clear in their vaguely orientalist projections in their writings. They also greatly support his literary corpus as his works are still used as though they are fundemental introductory works when they should be considerd nothing more than optional readings for those interested in older anthropological research and orientalist approaches or for their modern sociological and sociopolitical analysis. Because of this the very academic basis and structure of the entire field needs to be wholly remade and rebuilt which is really no different than making a whole academic field out of nothing. However I will concede that alot of these authors and academics  most notably Prof. Ali Jimale I.M Lewis and Dr. Eno  that despite their clear biases they have certianly done good work and given thorough analysis on modern Somali sociopolitic and anthropology with I.M Lewis having a look through the dominant Somali lenses and Dr. Eno and Prof. Ali Jimale giving us a view of Somali society from their experience as minorities languishing on the lower rung of society. But as I said their works are to be much better regarded for their sociopolitical and sociologicalanthropological research and insight and will provide very little for those concerned with premodern Somali history and studies outside giving us modern contextual cues to build upon. As for Mohamed Abumaye he seems to be engaged in contemporary Somali diapora sociology and sociopolitic and how modern western colonial and imperialist expriences of Somali society led to the diaspora as well as its causation for contemporary diaspora problems with Somali diaspora youth education etc.. I really look foward to getting ahold of any of his future works and I am convinced he will make truly massive and revolutionary works especially with the antiimperialisticcolonial and moderncontemporary racial deconstruction and analysis he will provide. I believe that along with Mohamed Abumaye Safia Aided is another exemplary example of someone I believe whose future works will help build and bring into existence a true field of Somali studies as well as destroy the current Somali studies scholarship as  evidenced by her recent cadaan studies social media awareness campaign. It is young Somali men and women like these two rare Somali PhD. students who will place us on a correct trajectory from which we can subsequently disperse into delving into the vastness of untapped knowledge residing in the oral and archeological resevoir that is the Somali nation and its territories. I do feel quite ignorant of not having of heard of Abdi Latif Ega as his noval seems to have garnared some acclaim. I will certianly read it through. Your response is much appreciated.,Somalia,d4my4qj,4,t5_2qm0m
8795799,0,t1_d7507jx,No Ehtiopia can be underminded by a invasion with the suppport of the oromo people which account  for   of its population and whom have been mistreated. Somalia probarely have to aquire nuclear weapons to withstand both and utilize them most notabely against a more united Kenya if need be and with acess to both water and uraninum it shouldnt be diffcult. It is sad that the uprising against Said Barre was the work of kenya og Ehtiopia it shows the greatest challange is uniting our own people.A defense treaty with China or Russia can be signed both seeking a naval base of a strategic location.,Somalia,d754w6n,2,t5_2qm0m

9030878,0,t1_d7x8efz,That is precisely what I also call for. A secular democracy is not a method of eradicating religion but its a method of ensuring that all people are equal in expressing their independence without having any single viewpoint being pushed down their throat. Simply put you do you and I do me. Great to see people such as yourself not conforming to the status quo of religion dominates all. Many people seem to misunderstand and assume that I wish to eradicate religion when all Im trying to do is create a system where all ideas can flourish without fear of persecution. Great to here from you. ,Somalia,d7xdaat,1,t5_2qm0m
