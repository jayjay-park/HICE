9286395,0,t3_57gxde,I gave my partner a ring too. We discussed it beforehand and he gave me pictures of things he liked. I waited a few weeks after he proposed and gave him a special proposal time as well. To me  both having rings symbolized that it was a mutual agreement that we are in it together.  He loves his ring.  We are currently deciding if we want to get a separate wedding band or not.Long story short  Id say test the waters  maybe send him stories where the guy gets a ring too and see what he says?,engaged,d8t48ui,2,t5_2ug26
