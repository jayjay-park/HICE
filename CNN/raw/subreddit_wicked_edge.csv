815,0,t1_ce2hdxt,Hey sorry for replying on something old but I ended up buying a Dovo Shavette with the basic red insert the Proraso soap in sandalwood since I want to feel super manly and was gifted some Wilkinson Sword razors by a friend. I was looking at putting together one of the build it yourself samplers on Maggards and I was wondering if there were any that I should start out with. On a tight budget since we didnt get paid for our days off during the holidays so I was looking at the  pack option.

Still had a tube of it lying around so Ive been using it for test lathers and to break in a new Omega  more quickly. It makes a nice enough lather.If youre US based one nice feature is that it comes in a TSA approved size and since it is relatively low cost forgetting it on a trip is less of a worry than some of the nicer artisan soaps.For actual shaves with a DE havent tried it preferring TOBS Sandalwood and Proraso Green for my real shaves.,wicked_edge,ceg90jm,1,t5_2s46m
16105,0,t1_ceg8p4l,That makes sense then.  I suppose Id start by asking what is popular in Denmark.  A quick googling suggested that the Anglamark shaving cream is most popular way more than Brig and Gilette apparently because it is perfume free and unscented for example.  I dont know whether theres a domestic brand of soap or cream there seems the few wet shavers are stuck with palmolive sticks but that may make it a cheaper option for you to provide as a result.

53088,0,t1_cekfw69,Ah well that explains it. The pressure and scraping of a multiblade cartridge makes many most? who use it believe that they have sensitive skin especially if the razor is used with canned foam which is pretty bad compared with true lather. You can make an enormous improvement just by getting a brush and a shaving cream or shaving soap and start using real lather. Heres how I make lather and I recommend that you make a series of practice lathers using the technique to gain experience quickly. Play with brush speed brush pressure firm is good and how long you continue loading once you see microscopic bubbles.

70374,0,t3_1uw7ls,Canned shaving cream is like McDonalds food.  It has pretty much one thing going for it consistency.  And thats often more important than hitormiss quality so if it works for you great.  I would say its also got cost going for it but I wont because I use the cheapest mug soap you can buy at a grocery store or pharmacy which is almost always cheaper than the cheapest canned cream.  I will admit that it can be hard to get a lather but Ive found that soaking it with scalding hot water works adequately.  Throw the puck in your mug just cover it with very hot water and let it all soak in for a new puck then do it again for a few minutes before every shave and pour off the excess before you soap up your brush.  Youll get a nice thick layer of slimy goop on your soap that lathers well though its easy to get too much soap that way.,wicked_edge,cemfvu7,2,t5_2s46m

176361,0,t3_1w45mu,It sounds like you are doing enough things right that you shouldnt be having this much trouble. Your problems could simply be due to the Derby blade not being sharp enough for you. Do you have thick growth? Try using a sharper blade. You could also try to soften your facial hair more by exposing it to hot water for a few minutes. What I do and seems to help is take a minute or so before I get out of the shower and let the hot water hit me directly on the beard. ,wicked_edge,ceyisoq,1,t5_2s46m

Check maggard shave shop to see if they have a shavette blade sampler.Lathering on every pass and watching your technique closely shave top to bottom back to front front to back and bottom to top. Wash and dry your neck. I mean really dry. You may to wait a few minutes. Then run your fingers over the area. If it feels smooth in one direction thats good. If it feels a little rough that is against the grain. Try shaving against the grain again to see if it gets smoother.Ultimatley because every face neck and hair are a little different its going to be a trial and error thing to find what works best for you.Lastly if none of that works try going to a barber shop to get a shave and pay attention to what they do.,wicked_edge,cfb5y2d,3,t5_2s46m

While Tradere and Pils are experimenting with different form factors ATT is just making the quintessential basic razor as well as it can possibly be made by machining it from solid stainless steel.Most manufacturers sell different baseplates andor different handles. Maybe it is gimmicky to sell them all together as a system. So dont buy them the system just buy a damn razor. Nothin gimmicky about that. But if it turns out to be too mild or too aggressive or if you decide you want a different length handle the options are available.Then again if it were me that had a couple hundred bucks to blow on a razor Id be trying to find the Tradere open comb in stock somewhere...,wicked_edge,cfo3vil,1,t5_2s46m

485192,0,t3_1zo9hq,Razor bumpingrown hairgt Pseudofolliculitis barbae PFB is most common on the male face but it can also happen on other parts of the body where hair is shaved or plucked especially areas where hair is curly and the skin is sensitive such as genital shaving more properly termed pseudofolliculitis pubis or PFP.gt After a hair has been shaved it begins to grow back. Curly hair tends to curl into the skin instead of straight out the follicle leading to an inflammation reaction. PFB can make the skin look itchy and red and in some cases it can even look like pimples. These inflamed papules or pustules can form especially if the area becomes infected.gt This is especially problematic for some men who have naturally coarse or tightly curling thick hair.gt Pseudofolliculitis barbae can further be divided into two types of ingrown hairs transfollicular and extrafollicular. The extrafollicular hair is a hair that has exited the follicle and reentered the skin. The transfollicular hair never exits the follicle but because of its naturally curly nature curls back into the follicle causing fluid buildup and irritation.gt The easiest cure is to let the beard grow. Existing razor bumps can often be treated by removal of the ingrown hair. Extrafollicular hairs can usually be pulled gently from under the skin with tweezers. Complete removal of the hair from its follicle is not recommended. Severe or transfollicular hairs may require removal by a dermatologist.gt Medications are also prescribed to speed healing of the skin. Clinical trials have shown glycolic acidbased peels to be an effective and welltolerated therapy which resulted in significantly fewer PFB lesions on the face and neck. The mechanism of action of glycolic acid is unknown but it is hypothesized that straighter hair growth is caused by the reduction of sulfhydrylbonds in the hair shaft by glycolic acid which results in reduced reentry of the hair shaft into the follicular wall or epidermis. Salicylic acid peels are also effective. Prescription antibiotic gels Benzamycin CleocinT or oral antibiotics are also used. RetinA is a potent treatment that helps even out any scarring after a few months. It is added as a nightly application of RetinA Cream .  . to the beard skin while beard is growing out.

486826,0,t1_cfvhews,The c isnt a bad razor but there are better options for the same amount of money. I say this for two reasons shave quality and build quality.As far as shave quality goes a few years back Muhle and Edwin Jagger who had been sourcing heads from Merkur and putting them on their razors decided to work together to design a better head. And while some people whove tried both prefer the Merkur the vast majority prefer the Muhle  EJ. In my experience theyre less harsh but just as efficient they remove whiskers just as well as the Merkur with less chance of irritation.When it comes to build quality theres no comparison. Again it isnt that Merkur razors are badly made and their shortcomings milling marks plating imperfections pieces that dont line up perfectly do not affect performance. But the EJ and Muhle razors are perfect. When Rolls Royce puts a chromeplated part on an automobile it has been plated by the folks at Edwin Jagger. Nuff said.As far as the alum goes if you can put it in your budget theres no harm. If you decide you dont need to use it on your face it neednt go to waste  the stuff is a very effective underarm deodorant.,wicked_edge,cfvltib,1,t5_2s46m

Heres a response I did to somebody elsegtI actually ended up dropping my SR onto the faucet at my old apartment and it took a huge chunk of metal out of the blade making it irreparable. I actually moved onto using a Mach  and then a Fusion for a while as they had so much hype from people around me. I got tired of spending that horrible amount of money on cartridges and moved onto a DE Edwin Jagger Chatsworth and more recently getting a Feather Artist Club DX folder with teak handle and even more recently getting a Feather ASD DE.DE shaving is quick stupidly simple really too many people around here overthink it and after the first  months I have never cut myself doing it again almost  years since Ive cut myself with a DE. Straight razor shaving takes longer is more finicky has a MUCH higher chance of cutting yourself youre stropping all the time and honing occasionally. You just dont have these issues with a DE.EDIT I should clarify that I used that SR for about  years and I did enjoy it hence why I got the Artist Club but there are big downsides to using it especially daily.,wicked_edge,cfys97n,8,t5_2s46m

Just do WTG for now and finish with DE if needed. Hopefully you didnt roll the edge stropping and it is still usable. Positioning is a bit tough at first .. but in time your eyes will learn hot to focus and your body how to get in better position etc. So only WTG for starting up till the hands pick up some muscle memory and you get more confident with the strokes.Angle should be about  spine height from your face .. start lowflat and rise a bit. Did you felt tugging? or just it wasnt cutting? if in doubt run the lather between your fingers to see if you have cut some hairs.

The money though is really a minor issue its really only a few bucks per year difference.  For me the larger issue is time.  I estimate Im saving  minutes every morning by using canned goop which adds up to quite a lot if you look at it on an annual basis.Now there have been plenty of people on here informing me that actually you can wet shave quickly with the right technique Im not going to debate them on that point I know you can do it quickly but I know I will never be able to lather up my face quicker than I can squirt some foam into my hand so for me it will be Barbasol during the week when Im getting ready for work and wet shaving on the weekend when I have the time to do it properly.,wicked_edge,cgmc028,1,t5_2s46m

752191,0,t3_22rrir,ItalianBarber.com is a great vendor.  Ive ordered from them several times.  For each kit and I assume youre getting one for yourself too youll need Razor  Brush  Soap  aftershave optional  Instructions For the instructions you could either include a book search for Leisureguy or put in a little card with the following QRCodes How to Shave Like Your Grandpa as an introduction to wet shaving then Mantic playlist for detailed instructions.Whats your budget for this?  All of the RazoRock razors are inexpensive and have good reviews.  The Edwin Jagger razors cost a little bit more but they have a little more cachet as well.  For soaps Cella and RazoRock soaps are inexpensive and perform well.  If you want to spend less Arko is really cheap and performs well although some dont care for the scent. For the brush an Omega boar brush is an excellent performer and is priced inexpensively.  This isnt because its inferior its because there is a ready supply of boar bristles.  However the brush will take a few dozen shaves to really soften up.  It can also smell horrible at the beginning but that can be true of any animal brush.  If you have more money in your budget you could go up to a Muhle synthetic fibre brush.I dont think you need to do anything different for your best mans kit.

FMT Brush  Artist Brushstrokes which makes the H.I.S. shaving brush would have some Kabuki brushes using the same fiber as the H.I.S. which would be Generation  and some others using Generation .However there are too many companies making Kabuki brushes to keep track of much less to incorporate into the rating system.  A Kabuki brush rarely translates  to  with a shaving brush since the purpose is different. The handles lofts density and flair have huge variants from what is normally used in by most Traditional Shavers.

798696,0,t3_23ag6e,If you want one thats inexpensive you want a boar brush. A pure badger brush is also an available cheaper brush but the costperformance is much better with a boar. I recently recommended someone else who was purchasing from amazon the Omega . I believe it was ..copy from one of my previous responsesgtPure Badger hair is scratchy and will never get any softer. The Omega brush will be stiff and a bit scratchy at first but after about a week or two of regular wet dry cycles the ends of the bristles will split and the brush will be very soft and give you a ton of lather. Source I have a pure Badger and switched to an Omega.

828567,0,t1_cgy5f7x,Its a palette cleanser not a nose resetterThe point of a palette cleanser if I am right about this is that it clears out any lasting flavors IE that last donut you just ate. However scents are something you adapt to and your body eventually learns to ignore those scents. Much like Oxygen and Nitrogen have scents probably but our body neglects those as it would be sensory overload. They may not have a scent but you get the idea. The way to reset your nose would probably be to not use it for several weeks months or even years. Im not a doctor but I know if I skip on an aftershave for a couple months it still doesnt hit me that hard when I decide to try it once.

850277,0,t3_23v7c3,Bay Rum burns thats all there is too it. But if your cream is irritating your skin or if youve given yourself a harsh shave its going to burn.The simplest thing is to go with a different aftershave. Try an alcoholfree balm. You can spend as little or as much as you want from Nivea to Green Irish Tweed.But then again some people are sensitive to sandalwood. If you change up your cream you might find that youre able to tolerate the Bay Rum. There are lots of creams specifically made for sensitive skin TOBS Jermyn Street Proraso White etc. but anything without sandalwood might be a good place to start.And make sure your technique is dialed in. Even if youve been DE shaving for years its easy to form bad habits. If your blade angle is off or youre using too much pressure youre going to irritate your skin.

I mean if you were trying to win an eBay auction theres no reason that you would go on the internet and talk about how valuable it might actually me. At the end of the day we can either presume positive intent on those who buy stuff on eBay or negative intent. Im generally pretty cynical but this is a razor that were talking about.

1220246,0,t1_ci6vcyr,Yep your beard can grow in many different directions. For example your beard can grow first down on your neck and then up at the bottom of your neck. So to go with the grain wtg you have to change direction. Yep grow your beard and see in which direction it grows. Then memorize it. This tool is maybe helpful.The kit that you bought is a nice deal and good products. Separately bought those would have costed more. However most of the time kits are little bit overpriced because they include unnecessary stuff like shaving mugs shaving stands etc. Blade samplers are somewhat expensive. But once you have found a blade brand that works for you you can order them in a bulk of  blades. The prices vary depending on the brand between  dollars. Those  blades will last you for  years assuming you change the blade once a week  shaves.,wicked_edge,ci6w9i8,2,t5_2s46m

1232768,0,t3_287zhe,Its nonsense. How you remove the hair does not change how it comes back. Theres a common misconception that shaving makes hair grow back thicker and heavier but thats based on a posthocergopropterhoc fallacy.Guys tend to start shaving when they first  well need to shave. Typically during the teenage years when they are just getting whiskers. As time goes by and the average guy goes from his teens into his twenties into his thirties his beard comes in thicker and heavier. Its easy to assume that this is due to all the shaving but in fact its just a product of increasing testosterone levels.Tweezing will change how long it takes for hair to come back it doesnt just remove the whisker at skin level but pulls it out root and all. The downside is that this can lead to bleeding irritation infection and ingrown hairs.

1291722,0,t3_28vkgx,It depends on the soap. The percentage of unsaponified oils and other additives will affect it. Also how much moisture the soap is exposed to.Soap is alkaline by nature which inhibits mold and bacterial growth. If you have a soap with a small percentage of nonsoap ingredients and keep it dry between uses it could very well stay good forever.On the other hand a cream which has more raw oil in it than most soaps or one with a lot of something like colloidal oatmeal in it would have a higher chance of spoiling and growing mold. But there shouldnt be a problem for you with the soaps you listed IMO. Theyll be good for at least a year but if you keep them dry should last indefinitely.,wicked_edge,ciexokz,1,t5_2s46m

1372699,0,t3_29tlgq,It is material which influences weight durability and aesthetics. It is construction three piece twist to open slant open comb that gives you function blade gap blade exposure blade angle and aesthetics. So it is NOT just the blade that does the work. But that doesnt mean a  or  razor is five or ten times better than a cheap simple three piece razor from pot metal and there are even cheaper razors that work alright.If you ask me and that is of course a personal opinion the best value for money is the Weber a stainless steel razor for  with a build quality that will easily outlast your grandchildren. It gives a very comfortable and very efficient shave once you find a good for you blade.

1384366,0,t3_29yo80,I find that for me the primary difference is comfort. All the slants are highly efficient and indeed they are all pretty comfortable as well but the iKon and the Stealth and the bakelite slant are noticeably more comfortable than the C and C. The heavy handle of the C is IMO a pain but I know that some like it. My opinion of the handle is undoubtedly a personal preference but one based on actually using the razors in question. If the Stealth comes in at a price somewhere around the Merkur razors I would think it would be a simple choice the Stealth of course. One advantage the Stealth and iKon enjoy that the Merkurs lack threepiece construction so that if you dont cotton to the handle you can readily swap it out for another handle. The Merkurs twopiece construction forecloses that option.edit cut some words,wicked_edge,ciptafx,5,t5_2s46m

1454144,0,t3_2asgi9,Hot damn that looks a bit rough.  Okay first of all its probably a rough area with sensitive skin. My neck gets pretty rough when experimenting despite my face and head doing okay.  So to reiterate suggestions in the thread aftercare is helpful but youre really going to need prepwork. I shave before I shower due to bad ventilation and fogging but I prewash when I can with hot water and Razorocks Lime soap. Some kind of precare lotion oil or soap might be helpful.  Probably the biggest thing will be letting your skin heal for now and possibly between shaves in the future and mixing up razor blades. I assume youve tried these elsewhere perhaps such as on your legs. YMMV indeed because even if a blade and razor combo works on your legs maybe not on sensitive skin. A Gillette AM turned my neck to mincemeat but works just fine on my girlfriends legs.  Lastly technique pressure stretching etc could be an issue as others have stated. Id recommend when starting after a rest you skip the ATG pass and go with a WTG and maybe XTG to see what works without the razorburn and bleeding. Maybe take it back to baby steps with a milder or smoother razor until you hit something thats too aggressive then step it back down?,wicked_edge,ciyjvuu,2,t5_2s46m
1454444,0,t3_2artmm,My own ranking on aggressiveness for stainless steel R gtATT HgtATT HgtTradere st gen OCgt Ikon SBgtTradere SB . I havent tried Weber or Pils. The R is a fantastic razor and would kill if it was stainless steel. But they make it out of cardboard and will eventually rot. I find the R just a touch more aggressive than the H the stubble shows up an hour later with the R. The ATT is a fantastic razor and will last several lifetimes. ,wicked_edge,ciyl8sb,3,t5_2s46m

1457407,0,t1_ciyq40k,I havent tried the Polsilver Super Iridium blades. Ill have to check those out. I used Feathers yesterday. It was a very close shave but I did feel a little burning with the alcohol based The Beach aftershave. Ive been recommended Derbys as I hear they are pretty sharp but a little more forgiving.The scent of The Beach is wonderful and perfect for someone who enjoys spending time by the water but doesnt go as often as they would like. This is my first synergy soap but Ive heard it performs just like the others.  It lathered quickly and was fairly slick. As far as the aftershave goes I enjoy the scent and the aftershave definitely allows you to carry it on with you longer than the soap alone. ,wicked_edge,ciyym4n,1,t5_2s46m

My lather really started exploding AND performing even better when I started adding even more water to the lather.One suggestion I see on the boards often is to practice lather.  With the practice lather keep adding more water little by little until the lather actually breaks down because of too much water.  Then you can see really how much water the soap or cream can hold.  Also the points where you add water feel the lather to see if it is slick or getting even more slick with the water.

1562797,0,t1_cjbwqg8,You could do some gentle exfoliation in the shower with your face wash and a warm wash cloth basically gently scrub your face in small circles with a warm wash cloth. Or a gentle face cleansing brush. You could also use a face wash that has round microbeads for exfoliation. If that doesnt produce results a chemical salicylic or glycolic acid exfoliant can be found in the skin care aisle could be used.

Both options youve laid out would work although if I had to pick either a k stone or a pasted strop I would opt for the stone.  They do work great in tandem if you ever look at getting a full honing setup where the pasted strop is used after the k.A pasted strop will refresh an edge but eventually youll need to go to stone.  A k stone will work on an edge much longer than a pasted strop.

1750786,0,t3_2ei74e,Most people get somewhere around  shaves with a blade. It does depend a lot on the coarseness of facial hair how many passes you are doing your lather your water. If you are doing an against the grain pass at the end of your shave a dull blade will become really noticeable and start to tug and cause irritation. If you dont have a heavy beard and shave a single pass you may get over a week of daily shaves out of a single blade. I find Derbys are okay. My local Turkish barber uses the single edge version in their shavettes for traditional shaves and shaving neck hair so they must be happy that they work well for most people.

1799036,0,t3_2f4tvu,I highly recommend one of the Maggard Razors and as an extra that site sells a complete introductory kit.If you are used to a cartridge razor take care to avoid the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make when switching to a DE razor.  Read this post on blades which may surprise you and get a sampler pack. Try  brands from your sampler pack and then use the best of those exclusively for a couple of months. To stick to the same brand for two months you will have to buy a couple of packs of that brand so that you can replace blades as they become dull in use. By keeping the brand of blade constant variation from shave to shave is probably due to prep and technique so you can focus more on perfecting those by not changing the razor or brand of blade. Also after two months youll really know what that brand of blade feels like so when you try a new brand the differences are highlighted.   You can take a look at the reader reviews of my introductory guide and decide from those whether the book is likely to be helpful to you.

1905908,0,t1_ckisj7r,I placed around  worth of items in the shopping cart I was window shopping online amazed at your catalogue. I was probably over the  pound limit I have no doubt that youre not profiteering from the shipping costs theyre high because of my geographical distance. I am in the literal sense of the phrase on the other side of the world. I never meant to offend you or belittle your businesses just stating my meager disappointment at the shipping cost even without going over  pounds its incredibly substantial that in no way is your fault thats unfortunately what shipping is like. Its an oligopoly business and it holds all the power its probably the closest thing to the banking sector in regards to barrier to entry. Although I would like to ponder on a similar business concept. Theres a website called iherb that ships at a flat rate of  international express  pounds for  each extra pound is an extra . I have no idea how theyve managed to get the cost so low I would assume some sort of agreement with DHL. I know its a long shot but have you looked into something similar? I would truly love to make Maggards my gotostore but the shipping costs inflate the real prices of your goods once again not at all your fault. Im not sure if you understand how retail of any sort works in Australia but the general idea is were an affluent country  years of consecutive economic growth a statement no other country in the world can brag of. So businesses have figured we can afford to pay more and inflated their prices. It is literally cheaper for me to search for US prices as the only barrier is the shipping cost. Every product at Maggards is substantially cheaper than any store in Australia including the .AU exchange rate. I am sorry if Ive offended you or discredited your name I never meant to do that. You have the best selection of goods and price  of any shaving store Ive ever encountered. Ive gone through at least  of the links on the sidebar you tick every category and rightly so. Youve established a wonderful business. My hope is that in a few years global shipping costs drop which will probably be happen with specialization and economic parity the shipping game is still young. Hopefully that happens Id love to shop at Maggards.

Aggressive and mild are ambiguous terms. The slant is quite mild in terms of how it feels on the face kind and gentle to the skin and thus mild in that sense. But the slant is also extremely efficient at removing stubble and so aggressive in that sense.I recommend any of the slants. The C is  the  which IMO performs better and also has a solid aluminum head rather than one of chromeplated pot metal as does the C costs  for the head alone and you could pair it with a Maggard Razor MR  to get both a handle and another head.

Sos Aqua Velva.If you were to upgrade your brush to say a Plisson synthetic it would feel much softer on your face.

2418410,0,t1_cmafv1h,Bowl hand or face you pick. Ive tried all three and for me face works best. Bowl adds another piece of equipment to a crowded counter so though I started with that and it does help in seeing how the lather developsbut use a bowl of a dark color a cereal bowl works well I pretty soon moved to face. I went to palm lathering for some thirsty soaps that required more water but then I discovered that for those soaps I could add small amounts of water as I loaded the brush and that has worked well.Initially I used a dripping wet brush holding the tub of soap on its side over the sink to let excess water spill away but gradually with no conscious thought I started to give the dripping wet brush a shake and then load so that there was no excess water to spill. Your technique in general will similarly change as you make unconscious adjustments through experience. The brush with a shake is not so messy and is quicker by seconds. Maggards soaps lather easily so try giving one shake to a dripping wet brush and then brushing the soap briskly and with a certain firmness that you learn through practice not lightly but not heavily. Does that help?  Try different loading times watching the brush as you load and see how the lather differs. And different brushing speeds and different brushing pressure. Play around with it and see what happens when you try different things.edit typo,wicked_edge,cmamhlm,1,t5_2s46m

2474671,0,t3_2nrwgc,With my EJ DE I find that one shim with feather blades works the best for me.  With no shims it hardly cuts my hair during WTG and XTG passes so I find myself having to use more passes andor I inadvertently add pressure which kills my skin.  One shim adds just enough aggressiveness to add performance while keeping the razor user friendly.  Two shims is just too much for my skin.  I think a slant would be best for my hair and skin type but EJ with a shim gets me by.With that being said since this was only your second shave I wouldnt suggest that you start shimming yet.  Like Lesiure said try different blades and pass techniques first.  I have the best results going WTG XTG and ATG.  If Im having a bad lather day or if my skin is dry or irritated I will replace the ATG pass with a XTG pass in the opposite direction as the first XTG pass.  Lather really is key when going ATG and it takes time to develop good lather skills.,wicked_edge,cmhks2n,1,t5_2s46m

It will provide benefits to your skin outside of just a scent. Great starter brush go for it.Blades are very atypical. What works for my skin may not work for your skin and so on. Get a sampler and be sure to give each blade  shaves before switching out and each blade manufacturer a good  blades before you write them off. I prefer Feather blades whereas some people hate Feathers and prefer strictly Derby blades. Ive found that Astra provides a great shave for the vast majority of shavers.

The other is subpar in my opinion. Read through the different advice found in the threads and on the sidebar about soaps and creams. There are many artisan products available which your brother in law will enjoy more.,wicked_edge,cmuxkte,4,t5_2s46m
2581492,0,t3_2pd12h,I highly recommend this starter kit and given the pricing and range of products on offer at AoS I recommend shopping online better prices better products greater range.Read this post on blades which are generally a surprise. Try  brands from your sampler pack and then use the best of those exclusively for a couple of months. To stick to the same brand for two months you will have to buy a couple of packs of that brand so that you can replace blades as they become dull in use. By keeping the brand of blade constant variation from shave to shave is probably due to prep and technique so you can focus more on perfecting those by not changing the razor or brand of blade. Also after two months youll really know what that brand of blade feels like so when you try a new brand the differences are highlighted.   Take care to avoid the four most common mistakes cartridge shavers make when switching to a DE razor. You can take a look at the reader reviews of my introductory guide and decide from those whether the book is likely to be helpful to you.

2597525,0,t1_cmxmjad,Yeah I think everyone hates cold sores. So I checked and I got my vaccine . years ago so that pretty much checks out. Honestly that could be exactly how long since Ive had a cold sore.I looked at the study and it was done over  years with  people after  years none of them had had a cold sore during that time so its somewhat convincing but the sample size should be much bigger. If this has truth to it I cant believe they arent doing huge studies and marketing the vaccine as a curepartial cure or inhibition of herpes. Also just for your information. Valtrex is available to take and if you take it when you feel when coming it will completely keep it from coming through the skin. My doctor also had me take one pill a day for a month or so and after that I never had a cold sore if my memory serves correctly.

2635014,0,t3_2q2vjr,Posted by the owner.gtLet me clear this up in one post. The former bst required an insane amount of moderation and was a massive debilitating headache. I started the BST the first of any shaving forum nearly a decade ago to allow members to offer great deals to one another and help each other out. Over the years its turned into something very different and folks are making good money off the bst and not always offering compelling deals to members. Now you never know what youre going to get. I want to make it clear to members if you buy something in the gentlemanly deals section no listing fees or costs youre going to get a deal. If you buy in the bst aka panjo  youre going to pay market value. Period.BampB costs money and its worth money and doesnt exist for others to make money off of. If you want to sell an item on BampB and make money on the success and community of my site then youll pay a nominal fee to support it and put money in the kitty for us to continue to do awesome site upgrades buy products to give completely unbiased reviews etc. If you dont want to support BampB and you want to sell an item for free at market value  then dont list it on BampB and dont complain about it. You have a choice exercise it.We get more traffic in an hour than most other shaving forums get in several months. If you dont feel we offer value and you dont want to give money towards a great group pushing a great message fostering an incredible community  then just type another address in your browser. This hoopla is really over a tiny amount of money the fees are much less than ebay and the money isnt going to some fat cat corporation its going to a site that generates FAR more money for charity in a year than it does lining my pocket. A site either grows or dies and weve been making some serious investments in growth. If you dont want to be part of it fine  but Im not interested in hearing claims of injustice for not allowing folks to make money off of my site without kicking in. Want to list an item and not pay? Offer it at a great price... Done  there is a forum dedicated to it. The only complaint here is folks who want their cake and to eat it to  get fair market value for their items using the largest shaving community to advertiseget customers and not have to pay a penny.Dont be cheap. Offer a deal and dont pay bampb  or make money and give is a tiny cut. Just dont whine. lt,wicked_edge,cn2j34h,3,t5_2s46m

At my local Sally Beauty they have a discount club you join for . and they give you a coupon for  off your next purchase. I used it to buy some Pinaud Clubman aftershave the next time I went.I wouldnt used canned shaving cream though. Target sells Creamo which should be a better soap for you to use without a brush.

3062858,0,t3_2v8qbl,Good tips here.  Ill add a few.. How fast is your stroke?  If you learned on a modern Gillette you might be tempted to shave like the men in commercials.  i.e. Long slow confident manly strokes.  If you do this with a DE youll get lots of tugging and pimples.  Use quick short strokes so you slice through your hairs without pulling on them.  You might be doing everything correctly only not quite fast enough.  . Use less pressure.  Imagine trying to shave the lather off a balloon without popping it.  . Wash anything that comes into contact with your neck more often.  Pillow cases especially.  Buy a couple extra pillow cases and swap those suckers out regularly. . Try doing fewer passes or shaving less often.  A little stubble may be less visible than pimples. . Change up your prep and post.  If youre using preshave oil try not using oil.  If youre not using preshave oil try using it. Try using different soaps or different aftershaves etc..  Everyones skin responds differently to all this stuff.  ,wicked_edge,cofgnef,1,t5_2s46m

Williams makes great lather once you dial it in and its as slick as any of the artisan soaps. Its not as idiotproof as Tabac Cella or Arko but it can produce LOTS of slick lather that will not fall apart. ualmightywhacko hit it on the head when he said this soap is better in the mug.As ulonesomewhistle stated youre not using enough water. When you think youve got enough water in there double it. Here are some pics of a Williams lather progression.

Learning your beard grain and focusing on technique will gradually improve shaves.A good shave should happen naturally and one should not go for a BBS. Pushing ahead too quickly is going to lead to getting cocky which is a sure fire way to get irritation and lead to disappointment.Take your time go for comfort over closeness and respect your shave. All things in due time. Persistence and practice is rewarded with an ever improving shave.Back on point short strokes and work on blade angle. You might be tempted to apply pressure but remind yourself that the best shaves happen when you apply only enough pressure to maintain contact with your skin.

It is true that these are often the perceptions of people who lack shaving experience but you see these kind of ideas shared fairly often both here and in the other sub.The learning curve for a straight is steeper than that of a safety razor and while I agree you arent going to spend an hour a day maintaining your straight the stropping cleaning and restropping is notably more maintenance than shake off your razor and put it away.Unlike DE razors which were replaced by cartridges so that companies could maintain their little monopolies on razor technology straights fell out of common usage because they were actually replaced with better shaving technology.,wicked_edge,coo6fgj,15,t5_2s46m

Margaritas in the artic is a much different scent but enjoyable all the same. Its a very fruity smell but it has a kick of menthol and is great for an early morning shave. Happy shaving!

3270112,0,t1_cp0s1qd,Well youve amply demonstrated your ignorance already so no assumptions are required. FWIW the iKon  is neither stainless nor zamak its CNCmachined aluminum. As is the Standard razor. And you can get either of those for less than you paid for your Slim.Computercontrolled machining is not a technology that was available in the s and it enables modern manufacturers to make razors stainless and aluminum to tighter tolerances than anything Gillette ever made. Thats not a matter of opinion or preference its a matter of fact.I firmly believe that the Slim is one of the best razors ever made. And it may even be the best razor out there for you. But if you really think that no modern razor is worthy of your consideration then I stand by my comment that you really dont know much about modern razors.,wicked_edge,cp10phd,-1,t5_2s46m

While most are acceptable I find some that stand out a little more.For what it is worth I do not feel that I have comparably sensitive skin. Interestingly I am of the same opinion as urudiegonewild.

3309850,0,t3_2y27vp,I generally recommend a slant for reasons cited at the link but I find that for me the Shavecraft  is more comfortableand some others like it as well.So if you go for a slant thats my recommendation. That said the Parker C and C same head different handles is very comfortable and very efficient and at  it costs substantially less than even the C.With any new razor it will be necessary to do some renewed blade exploration a brand that best in one razor may not be best or even good in another.The advantage of a slant increases in proportion to the degree to which your beard resists cutting men with thick coarse tough wiry beards love the slant men with beards that cut easily are puzzled by the enthusiasm if not suspicious of itthe word hype come easily from them in the belief that everyones experience is like their own. But the experience varies with the nature of the beard.In a poll I ran  who tried a slant loved it  said it didnt work for the and  found it much the same as a regular razor those being men whose beard is easily cut.I can use a slant daily with no problem. As explained at the link above you do use very light pressure with a slant and that helps. I have what I think of as a normal beard and I can detect the slants greater ease of cutting.edit typo,wicked_edge,cp5jtla,6,t5_2s46m

3326754,0,t3_2y7xg3,Tough one because it sounds like you have a combination of things going on. Is there NO part of your face that ends feeling smooth and wellshaved?From the reports here by others it would seem that Stirling does take a bit more work to get a good lather but also offers a very slick lather so it might be that you are really not shaving with enough lather to help prevent irritation. Normally the irritation will come from too much pressure andor poor angle as well as going over the same spot of skin repeatedly in an attempt to get a smooth shave.I dont know that it will help but I do cover a lot of these points in my wetshaving tutorial including an easy way to find the right angle and some tips and tricks on how to maintain the right angle as well as watching the pressure.

I recieved a dovo from them that wasnt shave ready Im guessing it was an anomaly but be wary. I would get something from boker or theirsissard from them if you go that way.  executive shaving they outsource a honemeister by the name of mark Odams aka razorguy UK who is very experienced and does great work. I dont know that the razors on their website are not a rip off but they will be shave ready.  geo f trumpers in London. The razors that they sell in store and online our shave ready. Ive spoken to one of their barbers who does the honing work for their whole chain. The razors that they sell though expensive are ready to use straight out of the box. I dont usually share that piece of information. You dont know the struggle it is to find honemeisters in the UK. Its a nightmare they always have massive backlogs and are closed.   Go with one of the invisible edge strops regardless of the above choices. They are really nice quality and affordable. SR shaving is tricky in the UK. But there are a number of things Ive done to make my life easier. I got some nice strop paste that maintains the edge for a bit longer. But I also got a small barber hone off eBay that I U.S. To refresh the edge every  shaves depending on how I feel. Honing isnt for everyone its hard to pick up an find information and its time consuming. But if you decide to do just a little bit of maintenance for yourself thats a good way to go. Good luck . I didnt see your budget before writing this P the cheapest razor on the invisible edge is a dovo best quality  round point. Thats the best youre gonna get new.

The C has the same head but the black coating on the handle can chip.I find that the Edwin Jagger is somewhat more comfortable and more efficient than the Maggard razors though those also are good but the Parker C is more comfortable and more efficient than the Jagger.Read this post on blades and do get a blade sampler pack. Try  brands from your sampler pack and then use the best of those exclusively for a couple of months. To stick to the same brand for two months you will have to buy a couple of packs of that brand so that you can replace blades as they become dull in use. By keeping the brand of blade constant variation from shave to shave is probably due to prep and technique so you can focus more on perfecting those by not changing the razor or brand of blade. Also after two months youll really know what that brand of blade feels like so when you try a new brand the differences are highlighted.  After the two months start exploring every  weeks try one blade of a new brand. If its better it becomes your regular brandthe one you use daily. If its not return to your regular brand for another  weeks. This gives you a break shaving with a brand thats good for you and also reminds you of what a good shave is like. Every now and then most will stumble upon a brand that takes their shave to a new level. The Standard is also very comfortable and very efficient like the Parker C but costs substantially more.,wicked_edge,cqzx0z8,4,t5_2s46m

4033243,0,t3_36pm28,People who do wood turning can buy kits so they can assemble a stand razor and brush that all have matching wood in them.  Here is oneSo you could find a DE razor kit and find someone to turn a handle to match.  Here is a kit  I have no idea how easy it would be to get a close match on the wood.  There are people on Etsy who do customturned razors but it seems like that would blow your budget.  It might be easiest to contact your gifter to see if he can make you a matching razor and you would cover the cost.  If he still has some of the wood this would be an exact match for what you have.Another option would be to match the metal in the stand and get an allmetal razor.  There are lots of those available.  Here is just one example.A short widerimmed bowl is the best thing for building lather.  You could probably find something that matches well at a grocery store.

So after shaving with a DE for a year shaving with a cartridge would definitely be different than what you were used to.Plus cartridge blades are too dull.

4072961,0,t3_3765r6,If you still have not made a soap or cream purchase here is a recommendation for Van der Hagen Glycerin shave soap puck.  Ingredient list  It seems to be suitable for sensitive skin.  It has a scent but it is very mild and I find it pleasant.You dont have to purchase it online.  It should be available in your local grocery or drugstore.  In the USA it should be available in CVS.  At least thats where I purchased my puck.  It is not very expensive.  I got it for . .oz.  Artisanal soaps are much more expensive and rightfully so  they can range between .oz to about .oz.  At ..oz  .oz VdH is not too pricey.  If you find that it does not work for you you can toss it out and not feel too bad.It is a solid shave puck so you will need a bowl to store it.  Look in Dollar Tree or a similar store for any ol ceramic bowl.  Get one with a wideish mouth wider than say a tea or coffee cup  it will be convenient to load your brush from a widemouthed bowl.I know VdH does not get mentioned here a lot particularly the glycerin soap puck  some find that it is difficult to lather especially if their water is hard.  I however find that it gives me great lather consistently and easily and I think I have moderately hard water.  With my Omega  boar it whips up a thick cushioning lather in under a minute.Edit add price information,wicked_edge,crkjlw5,1,t5_2s46m

It struck me that the old pricing resulted in men deciding to postpone purchase until they were sure they would like DE shaving. This was counter to my intention to offer the very information novices would want to know at the outset of the endeavor. So the prices were dropped in hopes that they would be closer to the level of impulse purchase with the effect of getting the information into novice hands much sooner.

Check your technique  angle pressure etc.  Avoid going against the grain.  Try new blades.  Consider using a shave soap and brush.  If none of those things work a new aftershave is certainly worth a shot.  In my experience the most healingirritation reducing aftershave is made by Kramperts  either the bay rum or Frostbite.

4336050,0,t1_cseeews,One remedy if your water does turn out to be hard run the sink halffull of hot water or cold water if you like a coldwater shave. Dissolve a pinch or two of citric acid in itnot much. Use that water for the preshave beard wash the lather and rinsing the razor and splashing water on your face at the end of each pass. Do the final rinse with tap water. Use the lather from a distilledwater shave to define the baseline quality of lather you are going for. You can get a small container of citric acid online and in some stores. You want pure citric acid not citric acid mixed with anything else. It can often be found in healthfood stores used as a salt substitute and also to prevent mold when growing sprouts and where canning or brewing supplies are sold.Read this post and this post to see the difference it made in two instances.Shaving is very much a YMMV activity and some after experimenting with softening the water with citric acid find that they are happy just using the unsoftened water while others prefer using softened water. To determine your own preference use citric acid a week skip it a week then use it another week a week being on the order of  shaves and then decide based on your own experience. Preferences are something one discovers.  And preferences vary from person to person dont assume that anothers preferences will match your own. They may or they may not. Best to experiment and get some experience with both approaches. Then decide. ,wicked_edge,cseehxu,2,t5_2s46m

4382180,0,t3_3as24m,UPDATE Doug Smythe has posted a video showing how the foam layer arises.Downthread I posted this but I thought in view of future readers I would give it more prominence here. The idea is to test whether the top lightcolored layer in some HTGAM soaps is a different soap or is as HTGAM said merely solidified foam of the same soap. Since I had a HTGAM soap with a distinct top layer so I was drafted for the experiment a description of which follows. Photos are included so you can see whats happening. Before scraping the putative foam layerAfter scrapingThe bowl is in a low oven now. After being in the oven awhile and while it was in the oven I scraped more of the top layer away to expose the bottom layer more clearly. The stuff in the bowl was sort of crusty and I planned to scrape it out and put it on the puck for a direct comparison but then the top layer peeled awayapparently it had not been meltedand exposed some liquid soap underneath which is still liquid but as you see is darker in color. Perhaps I should take another crack at melting that. It occurs to me that the foamy soap would provide some insulation but the part of the foamy soap in direct contact with the hot bowl would melt better. That may be why it was still relatively firm on top and liquid beneath.UPDATE Okay heres a photo after the liquidy part hardened and here it is atop the puck Youll note that the part that melted fully matches the puck color. The part that didnt still has the foam coloring.So the next step Im doing is to take the thing and try melting it again but pushing the foam part firmly against the bowl. Previously I just piled it up in the bowl so that it was not pushed against a good heat conductor but just exposed to the hot air in the oven.Ill let that melt for a while then repeat the two photos above after it hardens in the bowl and then scrape that out and put it on top of the puck.But for the part that did melt that does seem to match the underlying layerand as you observed I scraped away only the white foamy part so the melted part came from that.FINAL UPDATE Here is the final melt To my eye it looks somewhat lighter than the brown puck but its also thin relatively transparent and in a white bowl which may account for the lighter appearancei.e. if it were thicker it might be as brown as the puck.And when I scraped it out with a spoon it slightly fractured as it curled which made it look lighter here it is on the puck where most of it seems somewhat lighter than the puck but that may be an artifact of what happened to it as I scraped it out.The fact is I think we needed more to melt than I hadan opinion I held before I started this. You can see that some of the melted sample on the puck on the left side looks close in color to the puck but I dont think this effort is very conclusive at all. Not enough to work with and so its too thin.UPDATE Last night it suddenly hit me that the bits of melted soap were a different color from the pucks bottom layer because the melted bits are so thin and the puck is relatively thick. So this morning I used a spoon to carve out some of the soap from the pucks bottom layer. You can see in this picture where I carved away at the center of the puck leaving a depression.The shavings in the middle are from the puck those on the right are melted top layer. To my eye they are the same. I think its reasonable now to assume that Smythe was telling the truth that top layer is simply solidified foam as indeed Chris Cullen of Caties Bubbles said in thread posted by ummosh. The experiment could be replicated by someone with a puck that has a thicker top layer. Lessons learned. The foam layer is sort of insulated from heat by virtue of the structure bubbles. So in melting it squeeze it against the container to get good heat conduction. Also once the melt happens the top layer may not be sufficiently melted so youll have to stir it in.. Compare the melted foam layer to an equal thickness of the bottom layer. A thin layer particularly on a white background will look lighter in color than a thick layer the bottom layer of the puck. If you make them of equal thickness then they look alike as shown in the final photo.,wicked_edge,csjlw3p,3,t5_2s46m

4430035,0,t1_csp2ov1,I seem to have had a somewhat opposite experience at least with the new Williams soap.  I keep the puck bonedry wet the brush and shake off so much water as I can until I dont hear any more water falling off when I shake the brush and start loading the brush with it.  The moisture is enough to let the brush boar bite off soap into itself while not building a lather.  Then I add a few drops water to the brush and take the brush to my face I facelather.  As I build the lather I add a few drops of water and at a sweet spot I have good lather.  Any more water and the lather quickly deteriorates into suds.  I feel this soap has a narrow window of soaptowater ratio.While the soap is hard when it is dry the surface seems to become soft and slick with a small amount of water enough to let a brush bite soap into it.Too much water  blooming the soap has only ever rendered suds for me.All that being said I should also admit that I have used Williams some four times so far with results getting better each time.,wicked_edge,csp3g5x,2,t5_2s46m

4505705,0,t3_3crvrw,Your lather may be a little dry experiment with working a little more water into it as your work it up on your beard.Read this post on blades. Try  brands from your sampler pack and then use the best of those exclusively for a couple of months. To stick to the same brand for two months you will have to buy a couple of packs of that brand so that you can replace blades as they become dull in use. By keeping the brand of blade constant variation from shave to shave is probably due to prep and technique so you can focus more on perfecting those by not changing the razor or brand of blade. Also after two months youll really know what that brand of blade feels like so when you try a new brand the differences are highlighted.  After the two months start exploring every  weeks try one blade of a new brand. If its better it becomes your regular brandthe one you use daily. If its not return to your regular brand for another  weeks. This gives you a break shaving with a brand thats good for you and also reminds you of what a good shave is like. Every now and then most will stumble upon a brand that takes their shave to a new level.Save the leftover blades from any brand you stop using since at some point youll get a new razor and a brand that is not so good in your current razor might be absolutely terrific in a new razor and the best brand in your current razor may not be bestor even goodin a new razor. ,wicked_edge,csyleyn,2,t5_2s46m

4592677,0,t1_ct9hlo9,I dont fully understand the reasoning behind why ATG is more prone to cuts than WTGXTG is.  Perhaps someone who has done the science will chime in.  The tendency for causing irritation is definitely there.  If I had to guess it is trickier to maintain proper angle and pressure when one is holding the razor upsidedown.  So one tends to remove a thin layer of skin along with the hair in some areas causing irritation or cuts in those areas.Yes stopping ATG will stop you from doing strokes that show high probability of cutting thereby making irritation essentially a nonissue.  You are eliminating the root cause of a problem rather than solving the problem which in this case is really not bad at all.ATG can definitely be learned through practice and feel go slow and gently with short strokes at first.  If the razor wont slice hair smoothly or if it shows tendency to cut stop immediately reset the razor angle and pressure and proceed.  There should be parts of your face where you can shave ATG comfortably.  Go ATG in those parts.  Try to identify where ATG does maximum damage and close in on those areas over time.I dont go ATG in the mustache and chin area.  Im hesitant to try because my hair is denser there.  Maneuvering an upsidedown razor there is unwieldy so I just avoided it XTG in both directions does a decent job in these areas and I leave it at that prefer comfort to closeness.  Sure I feel some stubble when I go ATG in the upperlip area and in the chin area.  I dont care.  WTG and XTG feel nice and smooth and thats plenty.  I go ATG only on my cheeks and neck.,wicked_edge,ct9i1a4,2,t5_2s46m

If you dont like the acrylic consider the  which has the same exact knot in a painted wooden handle. Its a great little brush but you have to be patient with it  it takes forever before it starts to break in.In my experience Omegas break in a little faster than Semogues and big boars are usable more quickly than small ones.

My first really great shave was with this blade in a c. I had that Ah ha! moment. The combination was very mild and comfortable and allowed me to refine my technique and work up to try buffing diagonal strokes ATG. After a while though I found them so forgiving that I began digging in and using more pressure than needed. I decided to keep experimenting with other blades to keep my muscle memory and technique up to par. The angle is so different too between blades its quite fascinating.

4705356,0,t3_3fclvv,You might want to get the whole kit at the same time because the brush and soap are the most important to shave quality while the razor itself will probably be the biggest cost savings.You can get  sticks of arko for about  off of amazon. That should last you at least a few years. This is the absolute best value in the wet shaving world. Dont let its low price fool you it really is good stuff. For the razor you could probably get buy with an inexpensive razor but you may want to get the Parker c. Its a little bit more expensive  but it is very comfortable and efficient. You wont feel the need to upgrade this razor to something more efficient like you would with many of the less expensive razors. If you are looking to spend less than that I would recommend a clearance razor from Maggards. For the brush I recommend either an Omega Sseries syntheticin the regular not pro size or an omega boar brush. Both run about . Avoid any badger brushes in this price range as they will be uncomfortably prickly and will likely shed hairs or fall apart. For aftershave grab a bottle of Pinaud Clubman.

4742722,0,t1_ctsbn2b,Definitely go WTG before you go ATG as that is a recipe for irritation. You should be able to get a reasonably close shave by simply going WTG then XTG. Keep in mind that WTG does not mean going straight down towards your chest but rather going in the direction the hair grows. If your hair grows from your Adams apple towards your ears that is the direction that your WTG pass should be in.Because everyones face is different there is no single best blade that I can recommend you try. What works for me might be terrible for you and vice versa. You should check out tryablade.com. You can pick out an assortment of blades to try or grab a top ten sampler. You should get at least two of each type of blade that you decide to try in case one is a dudrare but possible and also so that you can use one brand long enough to decide of it is right for you. Really focus on angle and pressure and your WTG XTG passes should remove most of the stubble. The VDH brushes are on the bad gear list because the quality control on them is shoddy at best. Some people have ones that work great others have ones that begin shedding hairs and eventually fall apart. When you decide to replace it here are some suggestions. Omega boar brushes are very good and run around . The omega sseries synthetic is another really great brush but get the regular size not the pro size. If you want a truly stellar brush at a good price any of the Plisson style synthetics would be a great options. These include the Fine Angel Hair currently sold out Chiseled face brush and the Stirling brush a lot larger than the other two optionsIf you decide to upgrade the Weishi to something a little more efficientMany find the Weishi to be too mild which is great when learning technique not as great when you want a close shave especially if you have tough hair you should look into the Parker ccsame head different handle. At  you get a great razor for relatively little money. If you have any other questions let me know. ,wicked_edge,ctsd573,1,t5_2s46m

I stopped asking because I felt so crappy about the whole thing that I just let it go. To my knowledge no refund was ever issued. But it really made me feel like shit.

That said I havent read any good theories on exactly how they would be differentIs it really difficult to see how they would be different?  Theyre made of completely different materials. Potatoes are mostly starch while hairs are mostly keratin a protein. The paper makes reference to the micro structure of potatoes as an important factor. Is it similar to hairs microstructure? Potatoes are bigger than hairs. When a razor blade cuts a potato a larger portion of the blade possibly all of it is pressing on a single potato piece. On the other hand when a razor cuts a hair only a small portion of the blade is contacting each hair. Razing small stuff thats sticking out from a flat surface is a very different kind of action than cutting through the middle of an object. Just to point out one difference when shaving the blade is held at an angle out from the face which would not work at all for cutting through a potato where the spine of the blade is going to be held directly above the edge.,wicked_edge,cumatyn,1,t5_2s46m

And many English speakers probably from association with cartridge razors can the DE razor a handle perhaps because that in fact what a cartridge razor amounts to and then the blade becomes the razor. But DE razors have handles and one advantage of the threepiece design is the ability to swap handles. BTW although the Parker C costs less than the EJ and is somewhat more comfortable and more efficient the Parker threading seems to have drifted off standard so swapping handles with a Parker may not work so well.

I would also add an aftershave to that list nivea sensitive after shave balm is good and maybe skip the alum block. The delhaize supermarkets also carry a decent delhaize razor blade brand which are also ok. I presume loccitane is pretty popular in France but all the products that Ive tried from them were mediocre and overpriced so I would avoid them.,wicked_edge,cuz28qo,1,t5_2s46m

5159181,0,t3_3lo3vq,IMO doing  passes before the third ATG pass helped a lot  Also make sure you didnt get irritation from the previous days shaves. For  example if yesterday you irritated and got a few nicks dont try going ATG today just wait one more day or maybe let your beard grow a little more. For me using a mild razor like the Wilkinson sword helped a lot and I also did  passes one WTG and anothet XTG that helped me reduce the hair and when I went ATG it was perfectly fine apply little pressure and dont do dry passes in areas where you dont have shaving cream no double or repeated strokes! If some areas are more sensitive do XTG again or try ATG with a  degree angle or something like that not talking about blade angle. If you cant just go for a DFS its what I do and Im satisfied with it it doesnt irritate my skin but still provides smoothness as my beard isnt very thick,wicked_edge,cv7vg2q,1,t5_2s46m

5192792,0,t1_cvbvq4b,Im not sure exactly what you mean without seeing a picture but I think it has more to do with what kind and quality of brush you have. I took a picture for us to help demonstrate All these brushes were soaked in water for a minute or two rinsed and had a couple good shakes. So theyre all slightly damp and you can see that they all clump differently. The two on the left are both new to me as of yesterday. The first is a Frank Shaving silvertip badger. The bristles lie nicely and are evenly spaced like you were describing. The second is also a pure badger Frank Shaving brush. The fibers are not as soft and premium and I suspect that your brush looks more like this one pointier than a higherquality badger. It will continue to fan out a bit but will ultimately continue to look like this. Then theres a horsehair brush a boar brush and a synthetic. Youll notice the horse hair has that same even distribution with little pointiness. The boar however will always clump together in little spikes when wet this isnt to imply that its stiff or sharp its just how the hairs behave when wet. The synthetic may change depending on which one you use. The Plissonlike knots which is what this is will look very much like a highquality badger whereas an Omega SSeries brush will more closely resemble a boar brush. This was probably more than you wanted or maybe I didnt even answer your question but damnit I tried. ,wicked_edge,cvbxb04,1,t5_2s46m

5207592,0,t1_cvdpd3l,I do agree that its not the best choice in terms of quality however for many people the Wilkinson is a good option to avoid compromising too much when first trying DE shaving  In Europe it is extremely cheap probably cheaper than a brand new cartridge razor like the Mach  or Fusion and it helps to have a very mild razor for a variety of cases such as for those who like shaving other sensitive body parts or even because some of us cant handle going ATG with a more aggressive razor. I own the Muhle R and the WC and I use the latter for when I want to go ATG or when I want a much faster shave or simply because my skin is specially irritated and I dont want to take chances.

5285267,0,t3_3ne4ny,gt I know a lot of this can run expensiveIt can but it doesnt have to. You can start be eliminating things from your list that are unnecessary  specifically a stand and a bowl. Brushes have flat bases for a reason  theyre designed to stand upright. And the handles are printed to be rightsideup when the bristles are pointed at the ceiling. As far as a bowl building lather on my face is maybe the most enjoyable part of wet shaving for me. Why give that up by using a bowl?You do need a brush and some soap. The RazoRock Plissoft brush has already been mentioned if you can get one of those do. The Whipped Dog synthetic brush is very similar but slightly more expensive  if you dont want to wait for the RazoRock to come back in stock get that one. I like the mm size.For soap Barrister amp Manns Latha line has already been mentioned but bears mentioning again. Its inexpensive    ounces  if you sign up for the BampM rewards program designed to be easy for beginners to work with and absolutely top quality.The only other thing you need is a blade sampler.

Ill be linking the actual gear from Badger Shaving Co. since I think they have the better options right now for beginners.. Razor I recommend either the Edwin Jagger DE or Parker CC. Theyre both solid options but Id probably pick the Parker as its open comb it feels nice to shave with hard to explain without actually trying both and slightly more efficient. The Parker is  at Badger The EJ is  at ME.. Brush You have a few options here. Boar or synthetic. I recommend boar in Canada if you dont want to spend too much. Otherwise you can get a WhippedDog synthetic for  USD shipped Amazing value in the states but quite pricey for Canada. Omega boar for  at Badger.

5634506,0,t1_cwvibt7,Thanks for the advice! The winner was my favorite because it had almost no pitting whatsoever. Its just a black patina which I think I could take off or have one of the users who restores them take off when they hone it. Now the Eclipse. It looks really small to me but does that effect the performance? Clearly it would be easier to get up under my nose and such but will it make it more delicate or harder to hone or what? ,wicked_edge,cwviifc,1,t5_2s46m

5643685,0,t3_3sa5g3,I used the shaving creams and after shave balms. Both original and sensitive skin versinos.I prefer the sensitive skin versions to the original. The original balm has too much perfume for my taste.The sensitive skin shaving cream is my discovery of the last year. Its now my goto shaving cream for  out of  shaves. I used to be a Proraso man for about  years. Its the product line my father and home town barber used the one I learned with and it stucked. Now I only use the green proraso prepostshave cream when I need my menthol kick and Proraso red shaving soap when I feel for a little sandalwood. Once this tub is finished Ill probably try Proraso red aftershave or another brand for the sandalwood smell.,wicked_edge,cwwnjhw,3,t5_2s46m
5658014,0,t1_cwy9b6k,Agreed. In straights  poor steel is poor steel no matter how you hone it.When someone hits a huge wall with traditional wet shaving or  a cartridge for that matter I often suggest they take a break from shaving let their skin relax and give it a more practiced go when its comfortable again. I believe a practice hand will get you nearly a great shave with that last little bit being the right gear. Although at some point its hard to make the gear do what you want without the skill!

5658130,0,t3_3skkcl,There is a ton of good discussion going here. OP I have been using a safety razor for about as long as you maybe a year or two longer. It wasnt really popular at the time I was just looking for a solution to the incredibly uncomfortable and ridiculous looking razor burn that I would get in college. It didnt help that I could barely afford Mach  cartridges either. Regardless my first was a Merkur C as well I got into trying different blades and soaps but never got too crazy. My current brush is probably at least  yrs old sure gross. I use CO Bigelow Proraso cream. I use shitty Derby brand razors was gifted a  pack or something I might die before theyre gone. I freaking own like  stupid razors as I got an idea to try something new over time. With the cost of all that stuff Im sure I havent saved much money really but I dont think Ill ever go away from my safety razors. For me it IS a smooth close shave primarily because I dont get razor burn. Is it not as close as a cartridge? Maybe... but who cares? I dont feel jaded nah. Im not really into buying tons of different creams oils blades ect anymore I just pick up what has worked for me and continue about my business. ,wicked_edge,cwyg2k8,2,t5_2s46m

5664878,0,t1_cwz75v3,Thanks for the interest. I will admit that I cheaped out a bit on the razor. It is a Van Der Hagen right off the shelf of Target. I got it just to get into DE shaving. I did go out and order online Gillette  OClock Yellows which seem to have a decent reputation for being smooth and have worked fine for me. I also have a good Geo. F. Trumper shave cream. I have wondered whether my shaving experience would be different if I upgraded my razor. And no doubt Im sure it could marginally? But I was just a little hesitant to spend another  or more for a piece of metal that basically just holds the blade. So a sincere question for someone with more experience with this than me do you think an upgraded razor would make a material difference in shave experience? I was under the impression that shave prep and blade and technique were pretty much the key and razor had the least to do with it.,wicked_edge,cwza7ho,1,t5_2s46m

5678678,0,t3_3sv1tr,A BBS shave is when you feel no grain regardless of the direction you rub and a perfect BBS no roughness felt anywhere is not a daily thing though with practice one can get BBS on most of the face. The type of razor is really not relevant you can a BBS result with a DE just as you can with a straight.It helps not to focus on trying for a BBS but instead on doing a really good prep and paying attention to technique. If you consistently feel roughness in one particular spot check the grain in that spot. I had a consistent rough path at the corner of my jaw on the right and when I finally checked it turned out that the grain there is more or less horizontal with the nosetoear direction being ATG. Since I did my XTG pass in the eartonose direction what I thought was WTG XTG ATG was in that patch actually XTG WTG XTG. So now I shave nosetoear for that patch resulting in for that patch XTG ATG XTG.,wicked_edge,cx0zva1,1,t5_2s46m

5690851,0,t1_cx2i1x3,The sample packs are blades and the razor is what you put the blade into. Its an easy slip to make particularly if youre accustomed to cartridge razors where the razor is little more than a handle and the blades come already mounted in a cartridge. Youll note that you can pretty much pick any random  brands. One will probably work reasonably well for you they all work well for some people but perhaps not the same people for each brand and then you start testing a new brand of blade periodically which I think you should continue at least until you hit a brand that makes you realize what you thought of as a good shave wasnt even close. ,wicked_edge,cx2i7h2,1,t5_2s46m

5732172,0,t1_cx7hv18,Nothing nefarious implied here. I was frustrated by the commenters here who insisted that because Mantic received a razor for review that the whole review was tainted untrustworthy and should be dismissed. Your post arrives with consistent results and receives the kind of thoughtful consideration I think Sharpologists review was due. He deserved better treatment than he got here.My thoughts are on the consistency of results is thisIts less a matter of YMMV technique  the people of rwetshavers presumably have fine technique  and more a matter of expectations and approach. You mentioned finding the angle and that you spent some time finding it. The reviews at Sharpologist noted that its meant to be a transition from a cartridge razor where the angle is defined for you. Position the head parallel to face and the angle is the one that OneBlade states they spent so much time four years! finding. If you treat it as a cartridge razor made from the very best engineering and materials it begins to work. You know from cartridges the point of the pivoting head is to overcome misapplied pressure and still shave without nicking. That pivoting head is something wed never see on a single edge or DE.The difficulty here is were DE folks used to blade choice used to thinking about angle pressure number of passes... If you think about it as a person coming from a cartridge OneBlade tells you to make good lather your point that you make regularly  good lather and prep with a cart is better than foam with a cart and to figure out grain and do a  pass  with and across. Thats already more education in how to shave than most people ever get with cartridges. I really think that we DE folks look at this thing in the context of DE not in the totality of what it is. The reviewers on Mantics site all understood that its different from a DE and treated it either like a cartridge or like something that required a little adjustment. If you use the same handle angle to face as with your DE the head and blade arent going to be parallel to your face and the blade angle will be wrong. Follow what the razors head guides you to do like a cart and it works. Because they understood that and approached it with that frame of mind it worked well for them.Its possible that all of the wetshavers accomplished DE folks looked at it in the context of DE and it fell short. Remember its not for DE people its for cartridge shavers. You cant treat it like a DE.Problematically for OneBlade DE people and SE and SR people are the fanatics. OK sure there are some people who love things like the Feather MR but no ones out there talking about the early MachIII as the pinnacle of the Mach design. The people who would be interested in trying it out and reviewing it are not the same as the target audience. Thats a difficult situation.Set your expectations accordingly. If all youve used was a cartridge with foam and lousy attention to grain if you use OneBlade and follow their advice you get a decent shave quite likely the best youve ever had. If you go a step further and do a  pass you get a completely smooth shave as you and the Sharpologist reviewers noted.Thats why you and Mantic got similar results and its why WS got similar results within their razor sharing pool.,wicked_edge,cx7mrmb,2,t5_2s46m

6182118,0,t3_3z16fx,Hey all!  Over the past three days I have had a lot of free time on my hands so I have been watching videos of guys shaving watching videos of guys talking about shaving watching videos about guys talking about razors and blades.  I have been reading on here and other sites about guys shaving talking about razors etc etc.  anyways you guys get the point. So my progression of shaving is as follows  thick beard painful to shave but must shave due to military standards.  I learned to shave in shower when I started shaving my head much less messy.  Then I found an Italian shave cream at a mall called c.l. Bigelow.  I started using a small cheap boars hair brush and continued using cartridges at five bucks a pop. After all this research I got on Amazon and just purchased Murkur progress long handled. Alum blockA sample pack of bic bluebird feather and oclocksI still have the cheap boars hair brush and will continue to shave in the shower.  My routine is generally as follows get into shower wash face with either my own homemade soap or another artisanal lye soap.  I then put about a dimes worth of shave cream on the brush and work it into my face and head.    I then shave my head while my face marinates I then relather my face and shave my face with a cartridge.  Knowing what I know now I am considering getting another larger shave brush and possibly go badger to give the amount of lather I need to do both my face and head at least two full lathers.   So I would like your advice on a few things.  First is how well knownrated is my shave cream?  I can post a pic if requested. Its in a green metal tube and is called C.O. BigelowSecond is would you recommend an additional brush to continue with my ritual without having to use a bowl something I would likely drop  Third is with the new murkur and my inexperience I was thinking of dialing it to a  for wtg then  for xtg and atg then dial up as needed. Thoughts?  Thanks again guys for your help!  Im excited to finally get a close shave and not dread shaving! Edit Words are hard. ,wicked_edge,cyscc6i,2,t5_2s46m

6635453,0,t3_46hb00,Like the majority of the answers here I have to agree that application of postshave products is not a necessary step.  However I use post shave toners salves and balms to condition my face after a shave.  Its final step the process of exfoliationdepilationrestoration for me.A word about fragrances  I am a huge scent hound.  I spend about as much money and time on rFragSplits as I do on rShaveBazaar!  The thing to remember is that even the most fragrant lather will not stick with you much longer than the time it takes to clean up your sink after your shave.  I use a good quality toner my favorites are those offered by uhawns of Chatillon Lux.  Their scent lasts a bit longer than the lathers you shave with so I make it a point to match my EdT or cologne with a toner that compliments the fragrance Im planning to wear.  I find that running these combos by my wife or daughters is a great way to pair them up.  Youll also get some great suggestions from the folks on this sub rWetShavers and rShaveoftheday.So welcome to the club man!  Spoil yourself like the rest of us!,wicked_edge,d05nvd0,5,t5_2s46m

6698295,0,t3_47aw9g,As others have said dont disassemble the razor. In fact dont even loosen the head. For all the reasons they said plus most modern razors are threepiece design with heads made of chromeplated zamak. Every time you loosen and tighten the head you are putting stress on the chrome plating that covers the threads. Even if you never get the head and the handle crossthreaded that plating will eventually chip scratch through or just wear out. And when it does the zamak underneath will corrode very quickly and the head will break off.You will increase the lifespan of your razors and blades and minimize the chance of cutting yourself if you just rinse the razor under warm water when youre done then set it aside to dry.,wicked_edge,d0c5tta,4,t5_2s46m

6735703,0,t3_47x0pl,If youre getting irritation and weepers bright red skin and clusters of red dots your technique is very much not on point. Youre using way too much pressure.Likely youre doing this to compensate for poor blade angle. Go back to square one and start paying more attention to what youre doing. Listen to the razor  it will tell you when your angle is right when that sound changes make an adjustment in your angle instead of pressing harder.That said the right blades may make it easier for you to get a comfortable shave. I find Kai blades to be unnecessarily harsh in many razors. Get a double helping of the Top Ten Sampler from Try a Blade and work through it alternating a new blade with your current best blade. Even if you went through a blade sampler before do it again  your technique has changed over the last year.Finally your brush may be causing a small part of the problems youre having. Art of Shaving pure badger brushes are very prickly and the promotional ones are downright awful.

6767185,0,t3_48dw6n,Even though we have seen two artisanvendors close their doors recently in the last year or two at least a dozen new artisans and vendors have entered the market. I think that at least for the next several years this market will continue to see growth but that doesnt necessarily mean that it will be fertile ground for every new upstart vendor that wants to make soap. As the market matures it will naturally be harder for new vendors to compete against more mature businesses with established customer bases and reputations.The simple truth is that as a market expands and this market has been expanding rapidly not every vendor will survive for the long term. Some people either lack the business sense to maintain their customer base others dont know how to differentiate their product from the masses and still others wont spend the time to market their product effectively or seek partnerships that will allow them to expand their customer base. On top of that existing businesses need to keep updating with the times. Scent trends change and customers are now sophisticated enough and have a wide enough selection that professional packaging is important.It is sad to see Strop Shoppe go because I loved their soaps. But the truth is that they let their customer service slip more than once and customers could go months at a time without receiving their product or even getting a response via email. I speak to this from personal experience. On top of that they confused their audience with multiple very similar product lines with stupid names. If you dont keep things simple and straight forward you introduce barriers that will prevent people from buying your product. I really enjoyed KnockOut Shaves original shaving cream which was different than anything on the market at the time. However that product was discontinued years ago and since then his offerings have been kinda muddled since he offers more of other peoples soap products than his own yet never really made that step from artisan soap maker to shaving retailer ala Maggards or Italian Barber. ,wicked_edge,d0jc9ek,2,t5_2s46m

Next time add the wwater amount you usually do and let it sit on your face for a few minutes. lf it drys out it was to dry too begin with. So try again.

7093508,0,t1_d1kcwqi,I am also new to this DE thing. I got a sampler of blades and was having fun going through them. I used some feathers lord Gillette etc. and had mixed experiences with the amount of blood my neck was losing each time anywhere from none to looks like I was mauled by a puma. One day I decided to use the bic blades next and put one in. I lathered up and on the first attempt to shave my cheek it felt like the blade had basically grabbed on to all of my facial hair and was yanking it out. Needless to say I took the blade right out and swapped in something else with no problems. I have not tried the bic blades again since. Long story short the blade can make a ton of difference with regard to tugging. Take time to find the right one. I have been through a dozen or so and am down to a few to choose from. Ill probably never pick one exclusively since I feel like half the fun is finding good blades. ,wicked_edge,d1kf2dz,2,t5_2s46m

7151443,0,t3_4dhfav,This issue happens all the time.  It always is a matter of technique or a dull blade or both.  Eliminating the question of whether or not the blade is sharp is the only way to sort out the technique.  Given that you have attempted to hone it odds are good that the blade now does need to be rehoned.  I mean no offense but the odds of your having honed it correctly are not good.  If you get it rehoned then you can sort out the technique.  The most common shaving error for beginners is using too steep of an angle.  The spine of the razor needs to be close to the skin.  The general rule is no more than one or two spine widths from the skin but if you are going to err one way or the other keep it closer to the skin.Another common problem is stropping.  One wrong strong can roll the edge.  The spine needs to stay down on the strop during the entire stroke.  ,wicked_edge,d1r1prp,7,t5_2s46m

The DEs shorter blade and perpendicular handle let me get a closer shave than I have ever gotten with a straight.The advantage of the straight is that its a more engaging experience. It takes longer and requires your undivided attention. And when you do get a good shave theres a greater sense of accomplishment.

8121044,0,t3_4qgtia,I was using Harrys last summer before I jumped into DE shaving and they are definitely right up there and comparable to the cartridge blades made by Gillette and Schick. I agree with you about the shaving cream in the tube because it isnt really designed the lather. The shave foam on the other hand is quite good with the lather and still will use some of the leftover I have because the quality of the ingredients outweighs the drying character of the accelerant in the can. Their balm is absolutely awesome love the nice licorice scent.But as you said DE is the better way to go if you are ready to drop the money on the hobby. If we are being honest with ourselves nobody starts DE shaving to save money when they end up buying  different soaps.,wicked_edge,d4svmgu,1,t5_2s46m

First I soaked the brush for  minutes or so and then made a nice lather in my hand after the brush was good and lathered I left it for an hour before cleaning the brush I did this a handful of times and it helped with the breaking in and to get rid of the smell.

Please read this post on blades to understand why a blade recommendation is sort of pointless. Do note that when you get a new razor its important to try a few different brands a brand that is best in one razor may not be best or even good in another. I recommend that you try using an alum block as a postshave skin treatment glide it lightly over your wet skin following the final rinse let it sit a moment or two and then rinse dry and apply your aftershave. Several have commented that it has helped their eczema.I just listed a wonderful Gillette Diplomat which is modeled on the s Aristocrat.

However I dont have one of the razors since I already have a couple of EJ razors. The handle is stainless steel so just the head is chromeplated Zamak which as you point out may break if the razors dropped but this is a weakness of all razors in this price range including Edwin Jagger itself the Maggard VOC V and VA and others. Aluminum heads for example on the Standard iKon Shavecraft line   X Short Comb are less apt to break of course but they also cost more.UPDATE According to Edwin Jagger the heads Italian Barber is selling are not EJ heads however similar they may be. I admit I was surprised that the EJ manufacturer would be able to sell the same heads to other vendors it makes sense that they cant. So although the head may work for you it is not the same as the EJ head. That said the EJ head has an excellent design which is why there are so many knockoffs of it. According to Edwin Jagger the IB head is one of those knockoffs.,wicked_edge,d5lg95q,1,t5_2s46m

Ive found that you need to widen the hole at least  mm wider than the knot size you select. A  mm knot will require a  mm hole and maybe bigger. The VigShaving knots are quite dense as well. I was very pleased when I saw them in person compared to the stock photos online. I ended up widening the knot hole of a particular handle to mm just to fit a mm VS knot. Ive found that sanding drums attached to a drill or Dremel work best for opening the knot hole. Good luck!

8542547,0,t1_d69d33s,I highly recommend this procedure I recommend that you try  brands of blades trying them in alphabetic order is as good a way as any and then stick with the best of those for two months so you can master technique without being distracted by blade variability. You can of course simply continue with that brand but you might find it of interest to seek a brand that works better for you. A simple way to do this is to try one blade of a new brand once a month. If the new brand is better switch to that as your regular brand if its not then stick with your old brand. Then a month later try a blade of another new brand and make the same decision. After a year you might return to the early rejects with improved technique they may turn out to be good after all. This method means that most of the time you shave with a brand that is good for you and that you always are comparing just two brands at a time your regular brand and the new brand you just tried. You can stop the exploration at any time. Most will at some point encounter a brand that takes their shave to a whole new level and thus lose interest in further exploration.Since a brand thats best in one razor may not be best or even good in another a certain degree of explorationtrying at least  brandsis recommended for any new razor. Since you now know what a really good blade feels like from the old razor you know what youre looking for in the new razor. Theres no rush.

8543893,0,t3_4wrets,Welcome to the wonderful wold of SE razors. Its hard to tell from your picture which one that is. You mentioned in another comment that its an Ever Ready. My best guess is you have an Ever Ready  there.This is one of my favorite razors of all timeto echo uinna some of us like them more than DEs. Two things youll need to know to get started You need SE blades. These look like the paint scraper blades but you need shave quality ones. Pretty much everyone who uses SEs finds the GEM PTFE blades to be the best. My general suggestion is to buy  or  PTFEs from tryablade.com to decide whether or not SEs are right for you. If so buy them by the  pack from Connaught Shaving. Even with shipping they are the best deal. SE shaving is very different from DE shaving anglewise. While in DE shaving youre using a  degree angle or so in SE shaving you should lay the top cap against your face and then angle it down ever so slightly  degree at a time no more than  degrees or so until you hear what sounds like scraping a knife over toast. That sound tells you that youre dialed in with the angle.Good luck!,wicked_edge,d69k1rl,5,t5_2s46m
8544898,0,t1_d69nm73,Interesting I seem to have no problem with the Marco method even with my soaps that contain clay. I think the biggest plus about the Marco method for me is that I dont have to add much water after loading to get the right consistency which also probably stems from loading too much soap from the get go. With the damp method I actually started loading that way after reading your post I feel like I have to add outrageous amounts of water to get to the right consistency especially with thirsty soaps which usually translates to ish minutes of working up the lather on my face lather on faceadd more water back to face repeat which my face doesnt love. While with the Marco method I seem to be able to get to the right consistency with almost half the water and half the time again may be caused by loading too much soap.

The votes have in reality little to do with relevance even though Reddit insists on pretending so  the voting system is an anonymous popularity measure driven by the sum of all kinds of irrational motives. Youre best off to ignore it. I sort both postings and comments by new.And now to your question that comes up often more than enough reason to get down voted here btw. There is no specific answer to that  as the knowledge you would need to answer it is the result of the testing youre about to start. So any blade drawn randomly from a hat will do. Many will recommend their own favourites ignoring the well known fact that there are many others out there for whom those blades are rather unpleasant and dont work well. Voskhod have been recommended thrice  for me they are amongst the worst blades. How will they work for you? Nobody knows. Which is exactly the reason for recommending a sampler pack.Read a thorough treatment of the matter here. editNote that you should not go through the sampler pack all at oncegtExperienced shavers all recommend that as soon as a novice finds a brand that seems to work reasonably well he should be faithful to that brand while polishing his technique and not try another brand until hes consistently getting good smooth nickfree shaves  perhaps a month or two.

They each have enough soap for  shaves and you need to take the soap out of the container and mash it into a bowl in order to load a brush.IMO these are probably a lot more hassle than nonwet shavers are likely to go to in order to try out traditional shaving soap.I would personally just get them a full tub of inexpensive but good soap that way they can load right from the jar. For instance the RazoRock Classic and Tobacco soaps are only  for a decent sized jar. Maybe a tad bit more than you were thinking of spending but you only get married once and a full jar is a nicer gift than a sample IMO.

Sometimes redpink coloration can show up on the grout in between the tiles in the shower area indicating the presence of colonies of this bacterium.According to multiple sources   S. marcescens is an opportunistic pathogen in humans and is resistant to antibiotics.I fear that a deepenough shaving cut might present an opportunity for this pathogen if established in the shaving brush to produce infection so I keep my brushes away from the shower area and inspect them periodically for any redpink coloration on the bristles.  I admit that I might be acting out of fear uncertainty and doubt and that this bacterium is not so harmful as I am imagining it to be.  I would love to be corrected if that is indeed the case.

Ive always read high praise about the astras so when I got this starter kit I tried them first and thought I must be doing something wrong.

8908934,0,t3_52ado8,When it comes to razors there is no correlation whatsoever between price and performance. While you can reasonably expect an expensive razor to shave well good inexpensive razors of which you have three will do the same. To the point that personal preference becomes much more of a determining factor than the razor itself. An expensive razor will or at least should be made to tighter tolerances from higherquality materials and flawlessly finished but none of those things necessarily changes how it shaves.As to brushes a good synthetic or boar brush will make just as good a lather as a good badger brush at a fraction of the cost. But the face feel is very different. And if you want the feel of quality badger hair its not going to come cheap.But even among badger brushes the correlation between price and quality is tenuous at best. The pure badger brushes from Piccadilly and AoS each have a US retail of  which is a lot of money for a brush that uses the very lowest grade of hair. For that you could get a Frank Shaving finest badger brush and an Ace Shaving silvertip either of which would be much more pleasant to use. In fact my Frank Shaving mm finest XD retail  is extremely comparable to my Rooney  retail . The biggest difference besides price is that the FS knot doesnt shed.As far as the brands you mentioned Simpsons brushes are very well made but IMO youre paying pay a steep premium for the name and while construction is excellent their best badger hair is inexcusably inconsistent. Kent brushes are also very well made with some of the finest softest hair youre ever going to find set tall in a nice latheturned handle. And theyre competitively priced if you shop around. But they dont have any backbone. None. While I enjoy them a lot of people prefer something that is more resilient.You could spend a whole lot of money without improving on the razors you have or the brush thats on its way. If you want to try other stuff by all means do  its a fun hobby and even the most expensive stuff falls into the affordable luxury category. But what youll be paying for is a new and different experience not a better shave.,wicked_edge,d7iq33o,13,t5_2s46m

Personally I would keep working on trying to get more than one shave as it would bug me to change a blade every day and Feathers are one of the more costly blades especially if you change every day.

9363870,0,t1_d92t07y,Ahh  good catch. So currently I have menthol classified as a scent and all the soap scent profiles have to add up to . In the case of lemon chill there is a very large amount of menthol in it so it takes up a large percentage of the total scent profile. In this case lemon is still the only real scent but its not  of the profile due to the menthol being included. It hasnt been too much of an issue for recommendations yet if you like menthol and and lemon it will have a high recommendation but  I didnt consider that ordering by scent strength would be skewed by this. Either way I have plans to separate out menthol from scents since its kind of its own beast anyways.

Some individuals find that they cannot detect any difference at all and I imagine you fall toward this end of the range while to others the differences between different brands when using the same razor and their usual technique is quite obvious. It is certainly true that the experience of the blade varies by technique and by razor but I also have become convinced that it varies as well by person. I see no real evidence that my conviction is false though fairly regularly one of those who cannot detect differences between different brands of blades will strongly represent his experience as the true experience and have trouble believing that the experience of others might differ.,wicked_edge,d97656b,2,t5_2s46m

I actually have my Arko stick mounted in one of those twistup tubes.  When reforming the shavings do you recommend forming it into a cylinder by hand and then mounting it in the tube?  I worry if I grate it directly into the tube the sides of the stick will adhere to the sides of the container preventing use of the twistup mechanism which to be honest is pretty flimsy.

Its not for everybody but it certainly has a place in my Den.Unfortunately it was never available on the website.  It kinda flew under the radar because it was a headache for Chris to make.  But after it was released to a few lucky people the demand grew and Chris promised to make a second batch with signups for it being on the Facebook group page Razor and Brush.  You can contact Chris for more info but last I knew the second was sold out as well.  Keep your eyes out for anyone who gets it and doesnt care for it.  It does come up from time to time.

9947952,0,t3_5hy5hd,gtCould anyone tell me more about this part of the market? Whats considered the best and why? What brands you personally think are fucking great?Muhle Merkur and Edwin Jagger are considered the best as they were around prior to the current wetshaving boom and make quality product. The current Edwin Jagger head is shared with Muhle and is a well made razor with a lovely finish that gives a nice shave. Its considered a fairly mild razor.  Merkur and Merkur make a variety of other razors as well ranging from mild to more aggressive.My issue with them is that they are being underpriced by offerings from Maggard and other vendors which offer a similar head and quality for about half the price. Theyre also made out of Zamak zinc alloy which is fairly brittle when dropped and has led to a fairly large number of clumsy and disappointed shavers. If I were going to target the midpriced market and I may be when I find the time so PM me if you want to team up on something I would work on finding an overseas manufacturer that would make razors out of brass at a profitable price and selling it with a  year warranty. I can tell you that for some reason Pakistani razor salesmen have a hard time understanding the words  piece razor with a brass razor head and it will usually take about  minutes of FB posts for them to finally admit that despite their initial assurances while they do have a brass butterfly razor and a zinc alloy  piece they dont actually have an all brass razor available.

Im not sure how aware you are of your allergens but I found out yesterday that I am allergic to an ingredient in the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream which I had no idea about until I used it for the first time. At least consider sticking to a safer soap one free of potential allergens until you build up your lather skills. I havent tried the oz London Barbershop soap that I received with my kit yet because from what Ive seen the cream would be easier to build a lather with over a soap for a beginner I could be wrong.

I was able to smell the citrus a little bit but it was still very overpowered by what everything else is going on. I would strongly recommend Orange Chill for a orange scent. I have been recommended Pharaohs Dreamsicle as well for a Stirling Citrus Scent. Did you check out Rods AMA in rWetshaving  ? he mentioned some of the scents in there that sounded neat if you are gonna do a Stirling order.Edit hmmmm maybe is it a really light Vetiver?

10475013,0,t3_5q0gln,I placed my Conk soap in a metal container placed  containersoap in a pot of water carefully watched it as I boiled the water which melted the soap to fit my container. Before shaving Id place a thin layer of water on top of the soap to soften it and hop in the shower. After showering Id pour most of the little water I added out of the soap container wet my brush or you can let it soak while showeringwaiting for top layer to soften get the extra water off the brush by gently waving my brush up and down and then started swirling in my container. This usually gave me a decent lather but it was touchy. Dont add too much water to the soap when softening or else youre going to get over saturated runny lather. I have since tried many samples Taylor Maggards Stirling and I feel like Conk gave me the slickest face for my razor. I have many other samples to try but I did find the slickness to be a big positive. But like TheBoed it was also my first soap so it also holds a special place in my heart as it helped me get a decent lathering technique and forced me to try multiple things to get it right which I could use for future soaps. ,wicked_edge,dcvg96k,1,t5_2s46m

Soak your brush then get most of the water out by squeezing at the base of the knot and then again closer to the tips. Load more product than you think youll need then apply to your damp face. Then dribble water onto the brush and then mix that in with whatever youve got on your face. Repeat until you reach a thick and slick yogurt consistency. Good luck! This hobby is the best.

11307050,0,t1_dfcfbus,The bevels on opposite sides of the blade meet to form the edge.  The angle of the bevels is determined by the geometric relationship of the spine to the edge.  Anything above the plane defined by the spine and the edge is honed away until the opposite planes meet at the edge.  The only way to produce the fine edge needed for a razor is to take advantage of the spine for ensuring that precise angle.  The spine is one the major keys to proper honing.For that reason you really should tape the spine until you learn what you are doing.  Beginners tend to destroy spines by taking decades of hone wear off in a single honing.Theres really not much point in buying a set when learning to hone.  If youve got a sacrificial razor I would just figure out the basics with the finest hone youve already got.  If you really want to spend some money you could keep it to a minimum by buying a synthetic barber hone.  If you google Swaty barber hone you will get a sense of them.  If you cannot produce a decent shaving edge off a Swaty then you are going to be wasting your money on any other much more expensive hones.,wicked_edge,dfdmy2u,1,t5_2s46m

11599903,0,t3_65jo4e,A couple of points  Your brush is a boar brush.  Theres nothing wrong with that in fact the one you picked is a pretty good quality one however they take time to break in.  It may take a bit of work getting a lather to build until the brush is broken in however a wellbroken boar brush is quite a pleasure to shave with.  Stick with your current brush and in the long run itll serve you well.  If you want a solution immediately consider picking up a quality synthetic from Stirling or Maggard.  Theyre inexpensive around or under  and are super soft with great backbone.  As far as the soap Im not deep enough into the soapmaking stuff to understand the ingredient list.  Suffice to say that not every soap performs the same and if you have a soap thats hard to lather part of your problem could be the soap.  Consider something like Cella Arko or Barrister amp Mann for something super easy to lather and learn on that.  Best of luck!Edit Really this got downvoted?,wicked_edge,dgauvzu,5,t5_2s46m

Most of the people that I have encountered complaining about alum did not know that they were supposed to rinse in off.I leave it on for two minutes during the time that I am brushing my teeth.  I then rinse it off and immediately apply a homemade aftershave balm to my still wet face.,wicked_edge,dgngm1b,1,t5_2s46m
11714401,0,t3_674o3j,I have had my Poraso for over a year and I am not even a third of the way through. It is a bottomless tub. How on earth did he do this. ,wicked_edge,dgnuuis,9,t5_2s46m

11748394,0,t3_67n96r,Looks nice. The true test is how it does the job for you. I used my Weishi a few times before giving it to my brother. He likes it better than I did.,wicked_edge,dgrpkaa,1,t5_2s46m
11749847,0,t1_dgrt1wo,ugymar is correct about the base. I found it to be a very slick comfortable base that produced a great shave. I think its on par with glissantI give BampM the edge though because of scents. ,wicked_edge,dgrvhuc,3,t5_2s46m
11750482,0,t1_dgrvn76,Can you recommend any?,wicked_edge,dgry36i,2,t5_2s46m
11752269,0,t3_67mrb8,Two that I havent seen mentioned yet that are in my top three performers are Meissner Tremonia and L. A. Shaving Soap Co.Every scent by both these companies rates at least  out of  stars.  Of course I also like BampM soaps but with a little less enthusiasm for both performance and scent ratings.  Perhaps once Im more skilled at wielding the blade Ill open up to less forgiving soaps.,wicked_edge,dgs5dqw,3,t5_2s46m
11753753,0,t1_dgrwbuw,Jesus do I feel lucky I pay less than  for a haircut and shave in the Okanagan Valley but I was one of my barbers first clients when he moved out here so I get a familyfriend price also helps I bring him beer.,wicked_edge,dgsbfq1,1,t5_2s46m
11755341,1,t1_dgrr3jz,Its honestly a consideration because the ahem terrain that women shave is very different from men. We need a closer shave for our legs than you do for your face and legs are a lot larger and longer than faces. The angle of the blade plays a huge role in the type of leg shave a woman can get. So its not just about making it pink,wicked_edge,dgshx5y,0,t5_2s46m
11756941,0,t3_67p869,Years ago prior to mapping my beard growth and using various cartridge razors I was plagued by ingrown whiskers. I always pulled them as soon as they appeared and they healed quickly. After that using the Bump Fighter cartridge razor the ingrown whiskers stopped. Since I began using a real double edged razor the ingrowns have not recurred. ,wicked_edge,dgsogdf,1,t5_2s46m
11770403,0,t1_dgu7cbs,I really wasnt as bad as it sounded. The mole was so small I didnt even realize it was thereI mean I knew about it but I didnt think about it beforehand. It was very very slightly raised on my chin and a very light color. It bled a lot but its never caused any problems since.   Maybe my technique improved or maybe I sliced it off. Either way its not that bad ,wicked_edge,dgu7ftr,2,t5_2s46m
