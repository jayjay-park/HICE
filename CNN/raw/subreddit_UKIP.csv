1464497,0,t1_cizdyh5,Awesome Its very good to have someone listen to me too. Especially as a YOUF and a UKIP supporter. Im not used to it haha. Well said too I totally agree people younger than myself and my age go Apeshit when they arent listened to but its because when they are given a chance to speak or a demonstration of their thoughts they just spurt racist shit and smash up shops which although sending a message gets nothing done. It infact as you may well be thinking does the reverse. So thank you for the commendation. It means a alot.On a related note my best mate voted for UKIP as i say but it was the first time he had ever voted. In the run up to it he was saying Whats the point nothing changes As annoyed as I was I was thinking that it is a real shame that he feels that way as does my dad. It was the same situation with him.With regards to UKIP lying to its voters I agree it does. But I believe its just capitalising on the anger and frustration of a large group of Brits. I cant condem a political leader for that? However I must say I dont know of a single party that doesnt lie They lie about the same issue but from different ends E.g  There is nothing wrong at all with the EU or The EU is awful and a dictatortship. Same topic different lie I guess it just depends on what lie you want to go with. Thats how I see it anyway. I find so odd but interesting how you can think differently to me on a topic but be so absolutely convinced that youre right and Im wrong or vice versa how I think youre wrong and Im right on an issue I love brains haha. A labour voter? Cool. Thats my Mums clan. She absolutely infuiriates me with it no matter what I ask her her retort is Because I always have voted Labour It is by far one of the most annoying things she does. In my opinion that is absolutely no excuse for voting for anything especially something as important as Government. I recall one devious time at home we were discussing Politics As usual when I thought I would cunningly read out UKIP policies but pretend the were New Labours as she hasnt a clue what Labour stand for anymore. Like I say because I always have done is her excuse. I read them out to her as I did so my Dad started to twig on what I was doing but thankfully he kept quiet. About  mins later she agreed with almost all the points I told her what party it belonged to and she was pissed off but impressed in a way. It really irked me that she should fall for that and not have a clue why she votes for who she does. So she is politically irrellevant to me. I love her though haha. I imagine you are more clued up though. I dont mind Labour at all I really dont. Id be pretty chuffed if they won next year obviously after UKIP. The EU isnt perfect at all Im glad you see that. I adore the culture of other countries especially Far Eastern and Scandanavian. I appreciate that immigrants help build the UK up after WW but I swear I think its gone to far now. I cant seem to say that without being labelled a Racist Xenophobe or Nazi. I get hounded for my honest opinion I dont think that and say it just to cause a stir or piss people off i think it because its what i think and everyone seems to think You dont really think that youre just being a dick. It is so upsetting and angering to hear that. Its like being accused of a crime I did not commit. I imagine that is how a majority of UKIP voters feel.On your point of diversity Oddly enough I was thinking about my friend and family circle and I know  non white Brit and absolutely no immigrants i cant think of a reason for this other than Coincedence. I just find it really odd. I really agree with your point on things to be learnt from other peoples cultures I really do. But again from my perspective it seems that other cultures are taking over British culture on a daily basis. And for lack of a better word it scares me it really does. My Uncle is convinced that he grew up with the nd Sri Lankan ever in the UK. Which seems fairly creditable given the time. Hes known him for years He called him Crowbar for reasons I wont go into. A few years ago he said to my uncle Well out breed you then well out vote you Which is one of the most annoying things i have ever heard it is that that scares me. Because on the surface he is a pretty cool guy adapted well and speaks great English and is a good friend of my uncle. But HE said THAT. It baffled me and angered me.  Make the lie big make it simple keep saying it and eventually they will believe it A very good quote that has stuck with me since school. Its creator is a less than nice bloke though haha.Congrats on the Wedding Im a part time wedding photographer myself. I love weddings. Its interestings that your Husband agrees with UKIP I think i read that right apologies if not. How do you feel about that? And what are you studying if I may ask?And Youre welcome I apologise on behalf of the wankers who say those things. They dont deserve an opinion in my opinion haha. They just dont know what to say or think and are angry. Ignore them. D ,UKIP,cizumgl,1,t5_2rjmj
1744140,0,t1_cjz0bv1,hey now I can fully understand why someone would be so upset by getting down votes that theyd e angry meta posts about it.  Think of all the Reddit points they are loosing.  How dare the British public make its voice known and engage in Reddits own democratic system,UKIP,cjz0drv,0,t5_2rjmj
