7606794,0,t3_4jiewm,A lot of my guild seems to be more fond of a PvE mode.Its tough to speculate. I personally think a PvE server removes something special from the game but essentially what counts is one thing Demand. Of which there is a lot for PvE I am certain.However I think its important for things to stabilize with the DDoS all the new GMs. Servers also cost a lot of money and to me its more important that the cash shops stay as they are.,kronos2wow,d36upnb,4,t5_3embg

7647143,0,t3_4jyehn,Only superficial PvP knowledge here but since you havent stated how much you know about the game Ill cover a few general things that may help you decide. Rogues can stealth Being able to go into stealth is a big deal if youre looking for world PvP. Very fun to ambush people out of stealth when theyre least expecting it and stealth is useful in other types of PvP too. If you think being able to stealth is awesome definitely play a rogue.. Youll be very restricted in your pet choices as a PvP Hunter In order to interrupt casts you need to have a pet with a s attack speed if youre serious about PvP. This limits your choices to either Broken Tooth a golden cougar or a Bloodseeker Bat a brown bat with Broken Tooth having slightly better stats than the bat. Heres a list of all pets amp their attack speeds. This is a dealbreaker for some so I figured it was worth mentioning.. Hunter is easier for soloing As the Hunter comes with a pocket tank its generally easier to level than other classes and a lot of fun too obviously subjective.. Both are perfectly viable for PvP Despite Vanilla having a reputation for being unbalanced there really isnt a single utterly dominant class in PvP. Both Hunter and Rogue are popular PvP classes and theres no clear consensus on which one is better. They have different playstyles though Rogue has stealth and lots of CC Hunter has a pet and range. Id recommend you decide on personal preference Which class looks cooler to you? Which playstyle do you prefer? Which class allows you to play your favorite race?Hopefully this helps OP or someone finding this thread at a later point.,kronos2wow,d3bfslp,1,t5_3embg

Many quit Kronos because they want at least a population of kk. It was a slippery slope.As soon as Kronos might have big enough population numbers again say If some decision were to double the population in  days a lot might come back.
