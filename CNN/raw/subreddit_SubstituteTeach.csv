3791622,0,t3_33tyh6,I only do elementary so it is fairly limited in range what I get offered my district is huge so even with this limitation I usually work every day.  However I much prefer the upper elementary grades th and th.  The kids are usually much more responsive to the change of having a sub and they are easier to get along with and handle for me.  The subject material taught in those grades is also easier for me to teach and I absolutely love teaching California history any chance I get to do so in a th grade classroom.I absolutely will not touch Kinder though.  I did  jobs in Kinder emailed my district and asked to be taken off as a K sub because I didnt want to have to deny them.  I just cant handle kids that young.  st is pushing it for me sometimes but they are usually pretty good.  I sometimes avoid the lower grades at the beginning of the school year because the teacher hasnt gotten them into their routines yet which makes me coming in an even bigger shock.,SubstituteTeach,cqoh4bw,2,t5_37yin

4073001,0,t3_36xfpx,Good for her for representing us well. Far too often I get told by family and friends that my job must be soooo easy. I think they have the stereotypical sub in their minds...the one who sits the whole period and just plays on their phone or whatever. I am always on my feet teaching modeling facilitating and monitoring.,SubstituteTeach,crkjrsf,1,t5_37yin
5582397,0,t3_3rknzg,Really depends on the school for my district. Overall all though the front office and other teachers are really helpful and support me when I need something. Ive run into some standoffish teachers and office staff but I dont focus on it too much since Im usually only there for a day or two. Ive only had one teacher be rude but I dont sub for that team anymore.,SubstituteTeach,cwp1qtj,5,t5_37yin
7349535,0,t1_d2dkp3t,YMCA is the only program we have here besides daycare and they all run about the same. The principal knows about my medical issues fortunately. Im also booked up through the rest of the school year in regular classes so I wont have to be pulled. I think I will have to talk to her about it. As much as I love the teacher she works better with older kids.,SubstituteTeach,d2dlbfr,1,t5_37yin

10682974,0,t3_5strnw,I sub elementary mostly and love it but the little kids up to grade  get really stuck on routine and can get downright indignant if you dont do it like their teacher. BUT if you keep on course remind them or pretend that Mrs. Normalteacher has written you a plan explaining everything she wants you to do that day and dont let them derail you its pretty fun.,SubstituteTeach,ddhv98e,3,t5_37yin
11217634,0,t1_df3h54z,Yes youll definitely need the day emergency permit. Thats from the state. Once you have CBEST results your college transcripts saying youve graduated and some money you send it all to the state and theyll grant you your permit. The California education website has more info about this. Heres what I found quickly via Google and is the sheet I referred to back when I applied a few years back  It gets a bit confusing because the state requires stuff that the listings arent posting. Its because once the state grants you that permit the schools dont have to ask for your livescan or transcripts for example because they know that the state already looked at them and approved them. SO...heres your list of things to get official transcripts with bachelors degree on them so dont order them until thats official livescan CBEST results  day sub permit application money for permit. Send all of that in. Once you have that sent the state will give you the permit. From there you submit the permit along with whatever the district in question wants. Usually itll be the permit TB test CBEST results UNofficial transcripts district application. Some will require letters of rec but most wont not for just subbing. Im just letting you know that its not the norm to require CSET for subbing and unless your plan is to become a teacher one day it might not be worth your time and money the tests arent cheap. Definitely inquire about Walnut Valley USD. Just call up their district office ask to be transferred to their substitute coordinator and tell whoever answers that you just got your sub permit and are interested in subbing for their district. Worst thing that can happen is theyll say they arent currently hiring. Most likely though is theyll ask you to bring all your documents to the district office for them to look through. Usually the process is super fast once you have the  day sub permit that part takes the longest. Oh I also wanted to add that most districts are going to want a TB test so if you dont have a current one of those Id get that done sooner rather than later. Good luck! Subbing is a lot of fun and its how I started. I ended up subbing for two whole school years. Once I was in elementary schools every day I decided that YES I definitely wanted to be a teacher. I teach first grade now and love my job!Edit to add I actually live in the area so if you have any questions about surrounding districts give me a PM  Ive applied to just about all of them during my teaching position search haha. I ended up closer to LA but Im hoping to move either this or next school year a bit closer to home.SECOND edit Ok I was on edjoin looking for future jobs and searched that Pomona listing for you. Dont worry since it says if applicable the CSET is NOT applicable to subbing. I have a feeling they just copy and paste that on all their listings. If it was a teaching position then yes youd need it. For subbing you dont. You can always call their district office just to double check on this. Some people apply to sub with a teaching credential so they would already have their CSETs taken...in this case they would want their CSETS with their sub application. For someone with just a day they wouldnt need them. Hope that helps.,SubstituteTeach,df3i70r,1,t5_37yin

11674918,0,t1_debmes2,In VA where im at it is also a quick process. However! All i needed was  credits from a Community College. I dont even have an associates degree. Just over  credits... They just need a body in the room to make sure the kids are alive at the end of the day. ,SubstituteTeach,dgjd9l7,1,t5_37yin
