10139580,0,t1_dbt6ilo,My understanding from what i remember from my undergraduate British Empire course is that the ear was mearly the pretense used to begin the war. The British had other reasons that involved money control of the Americas and other tomfoolery but decided to use the ear to fan passion for war. The interesting part is that in many ways this war set up Austrian succession and the  years war as well.,warfacts,dbt6wrg,5,t5_3i851
