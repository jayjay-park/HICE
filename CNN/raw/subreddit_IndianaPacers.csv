2187710,0,t3_2k4b7s,if we were going to be competitive this year i would hate both of these. However the thought of getting rid of the george hill contract a year early sounds great to me so that we are able to build again before PG comes back. I love Dwest but he is getting up there and we are no where close to competing this year you guys are so i say its a good trade for both.. Also fyi rpacers is usually more active then this sub is,IndianaPacers,clhwt5b,3,t5_2smpi
