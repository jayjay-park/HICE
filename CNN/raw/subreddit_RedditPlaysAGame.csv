Length NAMultiplayer NoWhy you feel its a good choice Banished is an extremely relaxing a somewhat slow paced game Except when all your villagers start to starve! and it is great to unwind to. Once you begin to pick up on how the game works and get a feel for it all you can then begin to build substantially sized towns. While content is somewhat bare the added options for disasters and harder starting positions give Banished a host of replayability. I think wed all have a great time playing this and there would be a lot to discuss!
