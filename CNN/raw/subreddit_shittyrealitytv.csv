1857204,0,t1_ckczhpa,In a way Im glad that Graham decided to end it because I cant stand Ashlee but at the same time why couldnt they figure it out on their own?  They werent asking people to get married they were asking if they were happy enough to continue at home.  Ashlee and Graham seemed happy although I do agree that he was being duped by AshLee he wouldve figured it out on his own.,shittyrealitytv,ckczl3h,3,t5_339cp

Did Xoyna no idea how to spell her name kiss the little dude to  make their exes jealous  stay relevant to the camerasOr  other actual feelings!? doubtfulWhat if they mastermind a fake relationship throughout the show to pry their exes apart?

3761881,0,t3_33h908,I love Ryan and Jaclyn yay! I had a feeling they would be my favourite couple but their rocky start gave me doubts. Part of me wishes they could just bring Kayla to live with them lolI actually found the other too couples a bit boring. It seems like they are acting like strangers obv but growing apart rather than together like Ryan and Jaclyn. I mostly found myself thinking about how expensive rent is. Holy shit. I thought Toronto was bad....,shittyrealitytv,cql2zd5,4,t5_339cp

5411015,0,t1_cw373h7,I think it was all because she was assuming shed be the last girl chosen aka  the girl no one chose. It always drives them crazy which is pretty reasonable. She went full nutsy though  but they are giving her the emotional edit haha.,shittyrealitytv,cw3bey1,7,t5_339cp
