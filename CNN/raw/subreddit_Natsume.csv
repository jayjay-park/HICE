9883226,0,t3_5gwlwh,Oh look at that Im tearing up again This episode was certainly another emotional rollercoaster. Little flower mushroom youkai was adorable! I felt so bad when he started crying after his rejection but Im glad hes ultimately being given a chance to join Shuonsamas group. Im sure he has enough resolve to complete the training and be deemed worthy of their group. ,Natsume,davt3q4,4,t5_33udp

XDBut actually just this morning I found official art merchandise from the anime of Matoba with those exact butterflies! XD I wasnt even looking for it! I was just looking for Natsume stuff on amazon in general and I found this scroll! What are the odds that I would see it right after asking lol?I still dont know what they are but I was so surprised to see them. XD,Natsume,dgbn52i,2,t5_33udp
