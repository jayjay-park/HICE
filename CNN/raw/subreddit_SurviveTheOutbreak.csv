9495520,0,t1_d9jighf,Alexandra knew exactly why the head librarian was making her leave again and it damn well wasnt for more books. Their supplies were dwindling particularly the food and things for warmth. One could always use the books as tinder but shed die before shed resort to that. The head librarian made her swear not to tell the others of the status of their supplies to keep everyone from panicking. It wasnt surprising that a bunch of type A studious interns would be the first to worry. She didnt need that she needed them to be focused on the cause so she could do the dirty work. With her halberd strapped to her back its weight almost a comfort she pulled her satchel over her shoulder and began to unravel the locking mechanism that prevented any infectedstragglers from squatting in the library.,SurviveTheOutbreak,d9jixgv,1,t5_3hbbe
9496739,0,t1_d9jjrqw, th Ave. NYCDavid was huddling on third floor of the fire escape above some sort of construction equipment office. The floor beside the escape had been a remodelled upscaled condo owned by the cousin of a friend of his in junior high when he was still living in New York. He remembered he had been to a party here just a few months before his dad lost his job at one of the big banks that flopped in . It was the only familiar address that came to mind as he was caught in the throng of Central Station just as the entire Manhattan descended into a cannibalistic nightmare. He was suppose to meet up with a few longforgotten friends for a day visit the museums shops and bigcity sights. Instead he found himself on the run for his life.By some miracle he had managed to survive. The condo had been empty when he gotten to it the entrance unguarded and unlocked. He had been hiding there ever since. As the city descended into a chaos of death and looting he barricaded the door with the suites refrigerator and cowered alone in silence. For the first few days the blair of sirens drone of helicopters and screams of people was all he heard. After the first week all he heard was screams. By a month it was quiet. Save the occasion break of moans and shuffling from the things that stalked the streets. They looked like humans except they werent. The first two nights he had kept an intent watch on the streets out the windows of the condo....but he soon lost his stomach of seeing people pulled down by the creatures and devoured alive and kept the curtains shut.    Luckily he had the foresight to fill the luxurious bath tub in the condo unit with water before the utilities went off. The condo had been cleaned out by the former fleeing occupant of food but the tub gave him at least  gallons of water. He found a jug of bleach and used it to sanitize the water and keep it from going stale something he read online. It was almost a month before he dared venture outside on the streets. Before that he had scoured the other floors in the building for whatever scrap of food he could find. Luckily none of the things had managed to get inside. But soon he had cleared the building of everything edible and hunger forced him to take to the streets.Next to the construction office was a butchers shop and grocery store. Both had been cleaned out by looters early on but he managed to find a few unspoiled cans and nonperishables that kept him menially fed through the summer months. Next he hit the restaurants then the vending machines at the nearby bowling alley and soon he was scouring through desks and drawers for a lucky candy bar or bag of chips. All while the things were constantly nibbling on his heels. At first he had a cleaver salvaged from the butchers shop as his sole weapon but soon he found a foot piece of rusty rebar he found lying around more to his liking. He quickly learned from observation that things were able to take unimaginable amount of damage to their bodies but their heads were vulnerable. A poke to the eye socket usually bought them down when they came running at him. But avoidance and running away seemed to be the best tactic to take as David realized. Through his scavenging runs he would see a few survivors milling about through apartment windows or scurrying through the streets but David avoided them just as much as he did with the things. There was no telling who was nice and who was bad or desperate enough to kill him for the Oh Henry bar he had in his pocket. Best to avoid people as well he thought. He had experienced enough trauma in high school to know what some folks would do to those they deemed vulnerable.     The winter with its frigid weather had been hard but also a blessing. The thick snow kept the things bogged down and pair of snowshoes he had fashioned from two large pans taped to his shoes had made scavenging through the winter streets feasible. By now the nearby stores and offices had been cleaned out and David was now taking his chances scavenging the individual apartments units along the block. His lockpick a poor quality MadeinChina gimmick he had bought online and kept in his wallet came in handy in the task. He was no streetwise burglar but he managed to pick oneinten doors and lockers he tried. He always knocked on the doors before trying them making sure no thing or breathing New Yorker was inside to greet him. It was nervewrecking work but hunger drove him and his luck held up. No thing or baseball bat to the face spoiled his winter scavenge.  At least he didnt have to worry about collecting water from rain melted snow gave him all the HO he needed during those freezing months. For warmth and to melt the snow he burned stacks of magazines cardboard packaging and copy paper in a garbage can he had improvised into a stove on the roof. Still it was a hard four months and he was relieved when the warmth came back with spring. He had plans to trek back to Philly where he lived to hopefully find his parents and family alive and rejoin with them. Even for a loner like him a year without anyone to talk to was getting to him.But his luck ran out on him it seemed. Two days before a dozen or so things caught him by surprise and managed to follow him back from a scavenging run. They chase him to the first floor bypassing the firstfloor entrance door that he did have time to lock behind him. Though he reached the third floor in time to lock its door and push the fridge to barricade it his pursuers now knew where he was and they wailed and bashed at the door to the condo relentlessly. Thinking they would tired themselves and leave he had stupidly to hole up in the condo unaware that the noise of his pursuers had drawn a large crowd of their kind right outside the street of his hideout. By the time he realize his mistake it was too late. His only backup exit the fire escape ladder that led to the streets below was now being watched by a milling horde of flesheating creatures that had converged to his location. He was royally screwed.The constant nervewracking banging on the condos door had driven him outside on the fire escape where the constant monotone moaning of the horde he could at least cancel out as white noise. That or he was hoping by some miracle someone would find him in his predicament and come rescue him. He tried hard not to think about the hungry eyes of the things that were glaring at him like a slice of pork on the street below.God if you can hear me please....please....please dont let me die up here.    ,SurviveTheOutbreak,d9jobgu,1,t5_3hbbe

He had only taken three steps wrapping a rope around his wrist and the handle of the machete so he wouldnt drop it.Running low eh? I believe there may be something this way I was going to go there before you know that.,SurviveTheOutbreak,d9kz9m4,1,t5_3hbbe
