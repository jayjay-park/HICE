I think that as long as you are willing to invest the money necessary to provide a good habitat for that carpet python you should go for it. Have you done research on what equipment youll need to set up a vivarium for it? ,carpetpythons,d71qb2l,1,t5_342ff
10318441,0,t1_dcdkthe,Im not all that experience with carpet morphs but to me he doesnt look like a jag. There are bigger carpet python forums out there that could probably tell you more confidently. Either way hes a beautiful snake with a neat pattern.  ,carpetpythons,dcdngg4,1,t5_342ff
