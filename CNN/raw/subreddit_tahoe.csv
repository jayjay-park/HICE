1962365,0,t3_2h5p6y,Honestly the commute from South lake can be a bitch in winter even with a capable vehicle and in summer there is constant road work going on on the east shore as well which can make drive times pretty lengthy.I am not familiar with the housing situation in Incline Village but that might be your best bet if you want to live in the Tahoe basin while working in Carson but you will most likely still deal with the wintersummer driving delays that i mentioned above.,tahoe,ckpo0ff,5,t5_2s4yk

Theres still a lot of snow at higher elevations and I take full of advantage of that with my snowboard. Its been springlike up here but starting today the weather is going to get pretty active. The winds were howling last night and its supposed to snow today. If you like BBQ food Moes in Tahoe City is a cool place to eat some good and inexpensive food on the lake. ,tahoe,d2dats7,1,t5_2s4yk

9164877,0,t3_55rvx2,Without additional details it is hard to be more helpful but in the large scheme of things South Lake Tahoe SLT has the largest housing supply so on average can be one of the cheaper places. Without knowing how close you want to be to bars restaurants ski resorts shopping lake access beaches etc it is hard to get any more specific then that general average. Also SLT has some cheaper areas where maybe you dont end up in the nicest neighborhoods with the best of neighbors so again how nice of an area do you need to live in needs to be considered.,tahoe,d8dpr71,1,t5_2s4yk

TAMBA and the Forest Service are building new worldclass trails around one of the most beautiful places in Tahoe Angora Ridge and Fallen Leaf Lake. Three miles are funded  were raising money for the last three.Fallen Leaf Lake is a gem at the base of Mount Tallac. To the west of the lake is Angora Ridge site of the devastating  Angora Fire. With your help we can link many old user trails and connections to the new trails at Tahoe Mountain. The US Forest Service completed the hard work of environmental approvals for approximately  miles of new trails. These trails are shovel ready but need funds for construction. TAMBA is teaming up with the Forest Service in  to build the first phase of these new trails six miles in total on three new trails. Some of these trails will eventually be part of a bikeable trail around The Lake.This project coincides with the th anniversary of the Angora Fire. On June  Lake Valley Fire Dept will host an event to remember the devastating  fire and celebrate the rehabilitation of the area. Also Lake Valley Fire is organizing volunteers to help with the trail building.This project is supported by the Meyers Community Foundation which is helping raise awareness and funds for the project.Please support this trail project today. Every donation helps! TAMBA needs volunteers to help on this project!
