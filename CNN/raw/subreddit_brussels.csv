1955060,0,t1_ckofnb3,You sound like you lack life experience despite your bio.  First of all as uCreativo explained you need at least some form of document allowing you to work in Belgium whether it be a working holiday visa or fullblown work visa you need something to start off and then look for a sponsorship to extend your stay and eventually naturalize.  And why would a company go through all the trouble to bring you from wherever you are if there are  others just like you here? I dont know what languages you speak but everybody here speaks at least French Dutch and English unless if they work for an international corporation so your fourth language better be damn special and valuable and if you dont speak one of the three mentioned above then youre simply subpar.  Im not trying to be a dick to the contrary Im trying to prevent you from making a mistake. Sure if you have enough savings to come here and search locally then go ahead. But you need a fell structured plan positivity wont help you you need to do this the rational way and think everything through.  Take it from a guy that has worked lived and attained citizenship in four different countries in three continents and Im going on to my next one in two years.  Best of luck.,brussels,ckosdk8,2,t5_2s5xy

3757948,0,t3_3313b0,If you couldnt find anything via Brik Im afraid theres not much left to do. You can always contact their office and ask them in person and see what they can do for you.If not go for a walk through the neighborhood and look for signs that say for rent. Sometimes owners will just put up a sign without contacting a broker or advertising via internet since there is a lot of passage in the street. That might be your best chance.,brussels,cqkmtfk,1,t5_2s5xy
