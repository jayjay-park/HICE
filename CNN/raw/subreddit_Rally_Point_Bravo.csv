11341795,0,t1_dfhdmee,The general principle of elasticity of supply in economics makes it such that in a system of alienable private property commodities that are supply inelastic will quickly be bought up by whoever is in the best position to do so. These commodities can be thought of as possible solutions to a given problem that a lot of people have or that a whole society has. When the set of solutions can be owned by one or a few people who can collude to hold all of them but one or a few out of use they get to monopolize the solution to that problem and overcharge people who use the solution. This overcharge from monopoly control is called rent. We pay rent to landlords because locations are inelastic in supply. We pay rent to power companies because fossil fuels are inelastic in supply. We pay rent to pharmaceutical companies because ideas that solve medical problems are inelastic in supply. These are the robber barons of our time.This rent seeking is the foundation of our selforganizing market system. Therefore our whole system of value of commodities is extremely distorted by the artificial inflation of the value of certain necessary goods  shelter energy healthcare. In such a system we are already living under tyranny. Economic force is backed by military force. In such a system if pluralism means that we have to make space for the ideas that allow for the tyranny to continue we may be shooting ourselves in the foot. That said I do like the idea of allowing for pluralism and winning out anyway because our ideas are better.Alienable private property had to be regulated into existence and rigorously enforced. Its not a state of nature. On the other hand the state of nature is not necessarily ideal either. If we were to philosophically as a society begin to consider finite natural resources prime real estate locations and intellectual property to be our Commons we could implement a system of both equity and liberty. We could change our regulatory system to tax negative externalities including taking more than your fair share of our Commons instead of taxing profit income and sales. Tax bads not goods. Use the revenue to fund programs for the common good and distribute the rest as a dividend like they have in Alaska kind of like UBI but its a Commons share so its not welfare its a birthright. The effect of such a system of regulation is that very productive economic activity will be incentivized and detrimental activity will be disincentivized. So productive forces would be unleashed and passive income strategies would diminish. This would stop the inequity generating part of our machine without slowing down the whole economy. The best part is that a plurality of different kinds of people can get behind an idea like this. There is a very distinct libertarian appeal to it even as collective ownership over the means of production would likely emerge from it. Even the people who currently benefit from monopoly ownership over scarce goods would benefit by a quickly advancing society that survives climate change.,Rally_Point_Bravo,dfhkmnj,4,t5_3jhc9
