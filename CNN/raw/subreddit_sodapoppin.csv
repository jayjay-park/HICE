3274271,0,t1_cozv9yl,What you described about Lea being manipulative isnt a great act its a very standard act that all women know how to employ. Chance is just retarded. And the thing is the relationship ALREADY FAILED. We reached the failure point  or whatever months ago with the Hawaii trip drama. That would realistically be the breaking point for any man thats right in the head and not a total cuckold beta. There is no chance of this new manipulative relationship failing unless Lea becomes bored with leading him on. Good luck with that. ,sodapoppin,cp1hsie,3,t5_2v6kz
3274339,0,t1_cp0cqes,Actually hes not really that awkward. He has some weird tendencies that he sometimes does to try to be funny but hes fairly normal other than that. Hes had a hotter girlfriend before Sheri. Something happened to Soda be it depression or some other mental breakdown that caused him to attach to Lea. I feel like thats the only explanation for why he likes Lea and believes her. Something happened that made him feel like shes his last hope for a relationship. Perhaps that something was her lies from the beginning or Chance finally started believing his own self deprecating statements. ,sodapoppin,cp1i2je,3,t5_2v6kz
