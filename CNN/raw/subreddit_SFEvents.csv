9127322,0,t3_54tfnz,Cool concept! For a bigger city like SF it might be easier to search by proximity to zip code instead of by city. Id be really curious if I had a neighbor that played tennis at my skill level for instance less so about someone on the other side of town.Im also a little uncomfortable that anybody can see registered users first and last name before logging in but if that changes  or becomes optional  Ill definitely check it out.,SFEvents,d88yene,2,t5_2zxax
