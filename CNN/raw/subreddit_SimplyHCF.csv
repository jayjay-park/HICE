Friday Saturday and Sunday.Why do you think you should be staff on SimplyHCF? I think I should be staff on SimplyHCF because Im a experienced Hardcore factions player and Ive been in the HCF community for as long as it was alive. The reason why I think I should be staff is I can deal with hackers spammers advertisers basically anything around breaking the rules. I handle every individual responsibly and mature. I can deal with large factions coming in the teamspeak and talking about their base getting phased into or anything like that I know alot about the plugins on SimplyHCF and therefor that is why I should be staff.Do you have experience in the staff domain? Any popular servers? I own my own PvP based server so know alot about the anti cheating plugins and such and have resigned from other staff roles when HCF came along As of right now I do not take part in a staff role other then my own server but I did on SharpnessHCF and CurseHCF.What do you prefer doing on our server and why? PvP chat monitoring answering questions etc. I am always in the teamspeak and I would always be in the support rooms ready to take on question from the users I am always in game and ready to look out for hackers spammers advertisers anything that breaks the rules.Why do you think we should promote you and what will you bring to our team? I will bring great responsibly staff membership to the SimplyHCF staff team I am very nice mature and do not stress easily.
