Afaik its not common for a game to go higher in a base prices and if these cases are outnumbered by thousands to one game mostly they actually get cheaper.Edit My point was that his statement was just dumb. Games lower their value with frequent sales trade offers outnumber demand and the base price also gets lower to appeal potential buyers who didnt by now.,GiftofGames,cfu4q1l,0,t5_2tb4r

I was pretty young back then so I hadnt exactly mastered the tactics of an RTS so our games were always hilarious. One in particular I remember was when I played a game as Aztecs and all I made for military units after reaching Castle age was monks.

898526,0,t3_24dyqc,These are two of my favourite moments from gaming doubt itll work but heres two stories to make your day a bit better!In DayZ the original mod I was playing with an awesome group of friends in Elektro. We were having the best rave ever and had been throwing flares and chemlights everywhere as we looted blasted EDM and metal and killed every zombie. We started taking fire and ended up holing up in the church as fifty cal round pinged off the door. This was before the duplication glitch had been patched so my buddy took out his PDW and with his black hero character duped at least ten of himself inside the church all pointing towards the door. WE CREATED THE GANGSTA CHURCH OF ELEKTRO. I pity the fool who enters that church and sees all that pure ghetto fire power lined up against him.The next event was with an actual arms realism community. We loaded into a blackhawk down map created by one of the guys. It was the pitch black of night as we kitted up in operator gear and loaded into a blackhawk help to go look for the downed pilots. There was  or five of us in the chopper not including the two pilots flying. I actually spotted the crashed bird and we ended up touching down in an old wheat field. No sooner had the sound of the chopper faded we started hunting. An old farmhouse was out in the distance so we croush ran through the tall vegetation heads on a swivel as we searched for the missing soldiers. We were still a ways off when the DSHkM opened up on us. The brilliant red tracer fire opened up on our position kicking up dirt as the . cal rounds impacted. We hit the deck and low crawled to the waist high decreipt stone wall ahead. We occasionally managed to get off a shot towards the truck but were quickly pinned down by fire. We can only assume that he ran out of ammo before he could kill us as the fire just stopped abruptly. We quickly regrouped and headed off towards the house splitting into two teams to breach and clear the compound. The building was roughly three stories tall with roof access. Surprisingly it was clear of contact. I was on the garrison team as another went to search for the pilots. I had a silenced M with  round beta tracer mags camped out on a little balcony facing another compound. For the next thirty minutes the team was shooting at shadows and dropping M rounds on the next compound over until we spotted smoke. We had one pilot run to us and the other team successfully recover the other pilot. With all this we had no casualties and two confirmed enemy kills. Signalling for the evac chopper over the radio we sat down to wait. As the chopper touched down we took contact. Scrambling to get everyone aboard it took about a minute of bullets pinging and deafening sound but we finally managed to get in the air. That moment of being free of that insane waiting game was pure euphoria with lots of laughter to debrief and go over what had happened. It was a hell of a night!Anyways thanks a ton for the giveaway!

1329761,0,t1_cij1aml,Thank you. You know there was a period of about  years between the US and Norway when we went back home to Kiev. Now because of how long Ive been away from home at this point it felt like moving to a new foreign place at first. New school new appartment new people English and Russian have more or less replaced my Ukrainian which isnt really a problem since everyone understands russian in ukraine anyway but it does feel bad when you cant tie  words together into a sentence in a language that you spoke all the time  years ago. So I was out of my depth for some time. And then completely by accident I reconnected with a friend all the way back from the first grade. And after that things started getting back into place. Pretty soon the feeling that I was now back home appeared. For once I spent  uninterrupted years in a single school. I still go there every few years for graduate meetups even though technically I finished school in a different country. Its probably the period I would consider as the most character defining for me.I just added you back on Steam sorry it took more than  hours time zone differences are hard and I basically just woke up. Ill message you there right now.,GiftofGames,cij7rjt,1,t5_2tb4r

If youre trying to make gamingstreaming an actual form of profit whether primary or secondary League probably isnt the way to go because of the insane number of people already streaming it and really only the pros getting viewers if that was you I was watching p But hey follow your dreams!Very impressive indeed. Quite a unique case too Id never seen one like that. Ill send the pics of my setup your way later once Im finished building dont expect anything too impressive though. Once I find a job Ill be customizing it more maybe buying some posters and stuff for my room too it doesnt really reflect my interests too well p If I can afford to Ill be crossfiring a GPU eventually and hopefully buying  more monitors as well. My desk is actually very well suited for a triple monitor setup.Thanks to Dan Dan for president! I finally have Battlefield .

He leaves the house at  a.m and returns at  p.m to  p.m. His boss doesnt pay enough and sometimes my dad has to work on weekends. Dad is under a lot of stress he has sleep isuues and sometimes he is awake until  in the morning. It really hurts seeing him like this and I hope he gets better soon.

2566322,0,t3_2p5d45,Hey. Long time lurker and Ive picked up some things from reading previous requests. Heres a couple things I would advise you do when you write requests.. Use complete sentences. Its annoying to read and I guarantee it will piss off some of the gifters here.. Use proper grammar and spelling. It makes you look more mature and people look favorably upon you for doing it.. Read uMaximumDan s guide to getting gifted a game. You are much more likely to get a game if you read this and follow it.. Even when not asking for a Steam game include your steam ID. It lets people see how often you play games and if you are going to play the game you get gifted. Let people know you put it there just to show you are an avid gamer.EDIT Reddit fucked up and posted it before I finished. Added in the suggestions.,GiftofGames,cmtk1yi,1,t5_2tb4r

2622320,0,t3_2pvsgb, My Steam profile Im looking for the Majestic Nights Season Pass. It sounds like DLC but really its like The Walking Dead or Kentucky Route Zero  youre buying all the chapters at once. And it really looks like an awesome adventure game. I lost my taste for shooters last year and started getting into adventure games among others. Majestic Nights is set in the raving s and all those conspiracy theories youve heard? Theyre true. Neon lights and chemtrails synthpop and MKULTRA music videos and reptoids... I love this setting. Im excited to play around in it. Hell Ill probably end up running a tabletop game in the same world. Maybe Ill call it Depeche Motorcade. Goat Simulator is next on my list. I want this game  out of curiosity and the other  for the coop. An old friends coming into town next week and this sort of stupid glitchy combo nonsense is right in our gaming sweet spot. Especially with the recently released Goat MMO Simulator free DLC Im psyched to level up my goat warlock or whatever the heck. Volgarr the Viking is also on the list. I said earlier I stopped playing shooters  nowadays I pretty much just play Nintendo games adventure games and ballshard platformers. Volgarr looks to be just the balls Ive been aching for  classic oldschool hatefucking sidescroller. Im a little busy this week with holiday stuff so please feel free to wait for a daily or flash sale before picking up one of these games should I be so lucky as to win one. You could gift it early but I wont be able to play until late next week anyhow. My favorite holiday song! I actually have long despised Christmas music but there are some great shows which also disparage the holiday. Futurama often does so in musical form and you can watch one episodeA Tale of Two Santashere Skip to the nineminute mark for the Christmas Elves song. Or if youre looking for a real Christmas song I started teaching myself piano earlier this year. One thing Ive been working on learning the last month or so is Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. I dislike it less than the standards. Play it slow and a little bluesy it doesnt sound half bad.Anyways thats my entry! Thanks for the giveaway and good luck all!,GiftofGames,cn0vi5z,1,t5_2tb4r

Especially with the big amount of assholes in the world. PMoney is money. Sure we need it to live. But its not the most important thing in the world. And Ill get it back eventually. Just as it goes it comes back. Maybe someone will overpay me for an easy job out of kindness. Maybe friends will invite me somewhere pay for a dinner or whatever. And itll even itself out. Thats what matters in the end. Friendship. Being able to have people you can rely on materialistically or not. I guess thats why I can feel like I do about it.

There is a story behind this but lets just say that its a southern country with a rather turbulent history and the situation is not changing anytime soon. So I moved to a northern country thats safer and more stable.I am not very wealthy so I cant afford vacations out of state and when I moved was the first time Ive been in a different country. When Christmas time came around and there was a Santa Claus parade for some reason. This was very new to me at that time. There was also a spectacular firework display that evening. I wont go into much detail but I was very impressed  As I said I celebrated very few Christmases but this is my most vivid memory of this holiday.

2671648,0,t3_2qknbb, REQUESTSTEAM CounterStrike Global Offensive SALE ENDING SOON  www.steamcommunity.comid Why do I want this game?Because Ive seen and heard so much about this game and I am really into fast paced multiplayer first person shooters. I am really into this game I played this a few times at my friends and it was an amazing experience. It wasnt like the now Call of Duty or Battlefield it was different and interesting. After this experience I got more interested in CounterStrike. I downloaded CS. at my school to play with my friends whenever we had the free time. After playing a few times the game still didnt get boring. Now my friends upgraded themself to CounterStrike Global Offensive and I couldnt back then because I didnt even had a computer to play it on. Last years christmas when it had  off And I also forgot that I even had a steam account made because of a Call of Duty I bought which the code already had been used. Why am I interested?Why I am interested in this game is because of the said fast paced multiplayed action and the fun it can provide even when you play with random people. You can play like a team or go lonewolf and you can use a different tactic every round. I played Call of Duty and Battlefield on my PS when I didnt have my PC and the games they make now isnt my cup of tea. I want a simple fun multiplayer first person shooter and I think thats CounterStrike Global Offensive since I watched so many videos of gameplay and played it for a bit myself Ask me anything about why I chose this game I cant come up with more points to make. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindness. Happy new year and I hope you had Happy Holidays.Take care TamimN ,GiftofGames,cn7b2hh,1,t5_2tb4r

2777780,0,t3_2rsqvf,Hi this is my Steam ID and I want to have Age of Empires III The Complete EditionJune . A  year old boy is sitting motionless in front of the family computer. He had done all of his chores and is bored. Hes read tons of books and he is very very fond of history. Hes bored anyways and as he tries to find something useful to do after watching the grey storm and the downpour through the window an idea comes to him. He runs to his parents bedroom.Dad can I play on the PC? he asks putting his best smile and giving him a look that he could never refuse.Sure but what are you going to play? Says his dad.Age of Empires II dad.And thats it. Just Age of Empires II. He doesnt need anything else. He can play the history and make it his he can roam through the hot desert with Salah adDin in the Third Crusade or fight for France with Joan dArc in the  Years War. He likes it and he has fun while he learns more and more about the history he loves.Fast forward to March . He can finally plays the last entry of his favorite saga Age of Empires III. Hes hiperhyped since he read that he can play with Bolvar the liberator of his country and after again doing all of his chores he gets his dad permission to play and they even get to spend some time together while taking turns to play some matches and missions while they wait for their daughtersister to get home because shes in a party and shes promised to be at home before am..He is no longer a kid but a young man about to get to his s. Hes still very fond of history and he plays every once in a while an Age of Empires match in his dying PC. He needs to get into college and he prays to God to have the knowledge and the wisdom to approve the test that will finally allow him to study in one of the most important universities of his country. Hes applying to enter to two careers one of them is History.He aces the test and not just gets into the college but he gets being the one with the highest score in the test.I am that guy. I thank to God that I got into college with the wisdom He has given me. What surprises me the most is that I did not study at all but still got the best grade out of hundreds of people applying to get into this career. I wont say that AoE taught me all but Id be lying if I said that I didnt learn a lot of history with it.Thats why I want this game. Its difficult to be true almost impossible to buy original games in my country and having the opportunity to have the best entry of the franchise and original on my Steam library would make me incredibly happy. In the name of memories. In the name of nostalgia. In the name of gratefulness.Thanks for the opportunity OP. Blessings and good luck to yall!P.S Sorry for any syntaxspelling mistake.

2977465,0,t3_2u8kr4,Game Total War Shogun I encountered Total War Shogun  once before. It was about  years ago in the heart of Florence France. See at that time the war was raging in France and my family wasnt the kind that could sneak its way away from such things. My little sisters were the first gone. Those bastards got them in the early occupation stopping them on their way to the nearest bread dispensary. Back in those days we thought that a few kids even ones ... ? I dont even remember anymore... were safe. But we learned the hard way. I can still remember their laughing to the beat of their own skipping feet. See we didnt realize they were gone for a few hours after that. Theyll come back Maman said. Theyll come back. We learned that they wont come back.The three of us left searched every day. But two days later my brother was gone too. Picked up by the patrols? By the traffickers? Maybe even by saboteurs on the other side? Only God knows and he keeps that secret locked in his stony heart.I can only imagine what my mother went through further when I was detained the day after. Detained. Its such a cold word compared to what they did to me. I dont even remember most of it. Thirtynine hours later a man had found me in the lot behind his apartment with more blood around me than in me. But I didnt care. You see I had nothing to return to. By the time I had come to consciousness and stumbled in a daze back to the place where my family once lived she was cold and the muzzle of a contraband Israeli Desert Eagle . calibre pistol was warm. I remember so little of the night but the cherryred fresh light of the faintly steaming gun and the screen of the old iMac were the only lights in the room. I glanced at the screen flickering soldiers and shamefru disprays were a mockery of life. My brothers favorite video game. He played it only hours before he was gone and my mother left it pristine even when she knew she would be gone. Maybe that screen is still lit in that dark room with cavalry charging into the void and ashigaru standing tall against the occupation.I hope now that I can return to that faroff battlefield in Japan and maybe make peace with my family and maybe my mother will smile upon my efforts to gain control of a life they took away from me and the life they took away from her.,GiftofGames,co6jy09,1,t5_2tb4r

3399170,0,t3_2z45mq,Its probably a bit late for me to enter but Id still like to share my  cents. I loved Lord of the Rings conquest and it was battlefront style. Im not a huge scifi fan but I absolutely love fantasy. But since thats been done my choice would be either DC or marvel Universe.I feel like you could run around as cops or villains fighting just like in battlefront but when you get to a certain point amount you become a super hero or super villain. batman or the joker. It would be more  difficult to make a game like that because of all the different powers and whatnot.  ,GiftofGames,cpfqc9k,2,t5_2tb4r

3439517,0,t3_2zf2sn,I would love Shadowrun Dragonfall.I initially bought Shadowrun Returns from GOG on a whim since I had heard it was a Kickstarter success and was in general a pretty good game. Hoo boy. It had me from the first notes of its kickass menu theme Ill start with mechaincs. Shadowrun Returns was my first taste of turnbased tactical gameplay. I loved it. At first I used mostly guns not realizing how much else there was. As I progressed however the fantastic complexity of the combat system started to become apparent. There was so much depth to be had especially among a varied team between guns swords drones spells figments and the Matrix. There were so many ways to approach every fight. The tactical nature had me approach combat like a puzzle. Where can place my mage so that he is out of the line of fire but still has access to my team? How can I best get my decker to the terminal without getting him killed? I had never played a tactical turnbased game the closest Id come before is Transistor so combining the depth of abilities of a turnbased rpg with real movement in space threw me off a bit. Once I got the hang of it though I found theres nothing more satisfying than perfectly executing a plan that I had been incubating for four turns prior. The interplay of the different classes how they can be used to bolster each other and cover their weaknesses is the kind of complexity I love from a video game.On to the story. Shadowrun Returns is one of the few games Ive played with a wholly to me new concept. Its blend of Scifi and fantasy is something Ive seen nowhere else much less constructed in such a compelling way. Ive always loved cyberpunk worlds and found the more believable than your average Schifi perhaps because they infuse the future with the grit of today. Shadowrun had everything I love in a cyberpunk world and its own uniqueness besides. The monolithic corporations the government corruption the interspecies tension the gutter rats the tension between tech and magic and of course the shadowrunners all worked together to build one of the most compelling worlds Ive found in a video game. The environments oozed style from the grime of the alleys to the sterile beauty of the Universal Brotherhood. The characters were vibrant and distinct each with a story to tell each trying to stay afloat as best they can in the rat race that is Seattle. I still remember many of the shopkeepers names thats how memorable most of the characters were for me.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Shadowrun Returns. I was not expecting much but it delivered a captivating world smart and deep combat and left me wanting more. Ive heard that Shadowrun Dragonfall improves in many ways over Shadowrun Returns having a more openworld design and persistent squadmates and that makes me salivate. The ability to work with a dedicated squad through multiple missions as opposed to purchasing a shadowrunner for one job honing their skills in relationship to one another is something I would love. And I can easily see how an open world would improve the game. In summary I would love Shadowrun Dragonfall because I love the world of Shadowrun I loved Shadowrun Returns and I hear Shadowrun Dragonfall is even better.Steam ID ,GiftofGames,cpkbx1q,1,t5_2tb4r

3465468,0,t3_2zxnpt,I have recently fallen in love with indie roguelike games.  If they have puzzleplatforming thats a bonus but I cant seem to get enough of the roguelike genre.  My favorites right now is probably Risk of Rain but there is a super fun overhead roguelike called Nuclear Throne that you should check out if you enjoy that genre.  Also a high difficulty d platformer is in the works called Bleak that I got to demo at PAX.  Keep an eye out for these if you enjoy the genre.The game I would like is HalfMinute Hero because it looks like something I could really get into and spend some quality time with.

At the time the dynamic turnbased style was very new to me so that definitely kept me interested. Story and characters were decent. Heh I remember playing the Medabots RPG both with medabee and rokusho for a very long time. I think it eventually got too tedious and difficult for me but mostly tedious.

4056231,0,t3_370cjb,My Steam ID My Wishlist is nothing short of insanity as any of my steam friends will tell you.Any my Number one Item on my WL is honestly the most expensive item so if you want to go with   go ahead is Kerbal Space Program This game is fun Ive watched streams and Youtube videos of it Most specifically JackSepticEye and Robbazs Master Cube  part series as well as a bit of Scott Manleys Videos so that I would know the basics And I love the way the game is. You can start and build up your own space station and try to get your little Kerbals to the Mun and Minumus and all the other planets in the solar system.Ive always seen the Kerbals as a cute little race of . . . Kerbals and honestly I really love watching videos and putting my mind to the test with games that require me to actually plan out how Im going to get to this location or what I plan to do once Im there. There are so many things you can do and even if you only have a few minutes or an hour in your day you can either try to get to the Mun or Minumus or Duna or the other ones or you can spend it building rockets and blowing them up with accidents both of your own and not of your own account.The game is really fun and like most awesome PC games I hear there are mods for it so I would love the chance to use some of the mods Ive seen like Mechjeb Autopilot mod and even if you dont use that its suppose to help you become a better pilot Kerbal Inventory System so you can build your own rover right there on Duna rather then pre building one and lugging it up to space and then there was an Armory mod I saw in Robbazs videos that looked really cool I mean TANKS in a space game?!?! Possibly on the Mun blowing shit up?!?! Hell yeah Im interested.There are possibly tons of other mods and even if not this is definitely the one game that made a hell of a splash when it came out of Early Access.If I win I will make sure to do my best to land my Kerbals on the Mun and Name a Kerbal after you to show as proof and if I cant rename Kerbals I will name my Rocket Ship LastMinuteHero or possibly LastKerbalHero to show my thanks.BTW the game has been on my Wishlist since October  .To clarify Ive barely started using steam since August or September of  so thats pretty much most of my Active Since my steam account is  years old but I never used it until recently Steam Career has been in these last  months.If its too expensive I dont mind picking something cheaper from my WL and well if you havent played KSP whether you have it or not you should definitely give it a try. Im sure I can run it on my system and I have a  year old Laptop so if youve got a beast Im sure you can run it too.Thank you for the chance either way Im sure who ever you pick will be elated to win the  game on their Wishlist.,GiftofGames,crin2qh,2,t5_2tb4r

But what would be really useful for us deafies would be some kind of way people can communicate with us during multiplayer games. For example in Counterstrike its not feasible to type and shoot at the same time. If there was an option that let us communicate in other ways than speaking online I would be happy. Limbo was one of those really interesting games for me due to the lack of language. There were no words spoken or written. So in a way it was for deaf people. Haha thats okay.

4242119,0,t3_39hjix,Do you know how many chicken nuggets you could have bought for ?As for true love I can share a story I wrote to a friend a few months backThe nights can be hard when youve been alone for so long. It comes to a point where you get used to the loneliness and just come to expect that nobody is every going to put any time into you. For me loneliness is hard but love is harder.Sometimes the winds just blow hard one way and youre forced to turn and sail with them. On this particular day the winds blew me away from occupying space in the library to meeting a friend for an afternoon drink. I took a seat at the bar and almost immediately got an apology text. Looks like Im drinking alone today I mumbled to the bartender.While trying to discover myself at the bottom of a few bottles of cheap beer listening to some pretentious song Id punched into the jukebox I hadnt noticed that someone was sitting next to me.Katie wasnt special the generic uniform of a young college student a face chapped by Winters cold. She wasnt special save for the fact that in a completely empty bar she decided to sit next to this degenerate scumbag.Whats good here? she chirped like a tooeager sitcom character.Im having Molson but I was about to switch to bourbon. Its a cold day and Makers Mark seems right.She hailed the bartender and ordered two. I gave her an incredulous look which she countered with a rosy smile. I hate drinking alone she said and you seem like nice company.Who does that? Who makes a friend out of a stranger? Who smiles in a dive bar at three in the afternoon on a Tuesday?We talked for hours. Other patrons came and went friends even but I was fascinated with Katie. Her imperfect laugh God that laugh! If a man were left to hear just one last sound let it be that laugh so that he might die happy. We laughed like two longlost high school lovers meeting again for the first time in years.The night was ending as they tend to do and we began going through that all too familiar song and dance that one is forced to perform when a bar wants you out.It was really nice talking to you. I was having a bad day went to get a drink and didnt expect to see anyone else at a bar that early. Its great how these things work out.I liked it too I slurred. I was more focused on just staring at the soft glow on her face born of the reflection of streetlights on the snow.Well I guess Ill be going. Maybe Ill see you around sometime?Im sure you will.I left without exchanging information without actually saying goodbye. This girl deserved better than what I was going to put her through. Hell nobody really deserved my baggage.I got home put on some Coltrane and lit a cigarette. I thought about Katie. I thought about her crying when I disappointed her. I thought about fights. I thought about her watching me drink myself to death.I smiled and poured three fingers of The Macallan  year. Who am I kidding? She was just a nice stranger. Besides loneliness is hard but love is harder.,GiftofGames,cs3skju,3,t5_2tb4r

4255735,0,t3_39po18,Oh my. Ive wanted Burnout Paradise for so long. Whenever any of these Humble Origin Bundles pop up I always enter for that one game. cRight so better make a good impression right? Well first off I havent played an open world driving game for so long but they were great. My fondest memories as a kid were been chased by cops in Need for Speed Most Wanted and pulling off epic stunts on the way. Although the stunting isnt as good as it is in Burnout Paradise from what Ive seen.But yeah Id love to relive one of my favourite genres when I was a kid. Its hard to come by a good racer that has an open world. I just hope EAs next Need for Speed game is going to be good. xSecond choice would be Mirrors Edge. Ive never played the game but Ive always wanted to. As for my book recommendation I recently read Flu by Wayne Simmons. Its a very engaging story and it covers multiple people surviving in a zombie infested Ireland. Simmons really captures characters and gives the book a gruesomely realistic feel.,GiftofGames,cs5c7b0,2,t5_2tb4r

4739271,0,t3_3ftw0b,Team Fortress . I love that game. Ive been playing it since  and have clocked nearly  hours on it.What got me into the game were the awesome trailers. What kept me playing is the awesome community behind the game.There are  different classes each with their own abilities but also shared ones.The Scout can run faster than any other class. With his double jump he can get around places with ease and dodge all those pesky projectiles.The Soldier can rocket jump so fast he can be faster than the Scout! He can give his team buffs with his chargeable backpack to push to victory one explosion at a time.The Pyro burns its enemies down with the flame thrower and can also extinguish teammates and blast enemies and projectiles away.The Demoman has many weapons in his arsenal but the stickybomb launcher remains the most viable one. It can deal high DPS and can be used to set up traps as well.The Heavy is a huge tank and has the most health of them all. With his minigun he can wipe entire teams out. And of course sandvich for teammates.The Engineer can be a master of defense with his sentry gun dispenser and teleporter. The fastest way to the action for slow Russian man.The Medic. Oh meet the Medic. This class is the best class in my opinion. He can heal people with his medi gun and crossbow. He can charge ubers to give him and his patient invulnerability or grant the patient sweet sweet critical hits.The Sniper and his rifle can deal the best damage from all across the map. He can cover his enemies with piss and his teammates to extinguish them. Gotta love this hunter from down under.And last but not least the Spy. This sneaky Frenchman knows how to do the job. He is a silent killer. Sometimes not. He instantly kills any class in the game but is also one of the squishiest.The game is never the same with all the many weapons and hats so I always keep playing until I cant. I love this game and its community.And the mechanic pretty much random critical hits.Edit But really the classes are the mechanics themselves. There are just sooo many things to fit in here!,GiftofGames,ctrxgny,1,t5_2tb4r
4740602,0,t3_3ftw0b,The mechanics behind the fighting system of Devil May Cry  blew my mind back when it came out and thinking back  havent played in many years it still does.Granted I havent been gaming too much in the last decade I havent even played the Arkham games yet though I hear the mechanics are awesome as well but as far as hack and slash run aroundbeatemup games go the system in DMC was STYLISHSeriously the entire fighting mechanic was built around stringing combos in the most outrageous ways possible racking up the kills while your at it and forcing variesty into your gameplay. You cant spam the same attacks repeatedly and expect a decent stylish score every time you needed... STYLE!!! And you accomplished that with the awesome variety of controls granted to you by the mechanics of the game... you can switch weapons on the fly in mid air IN MID ATTACK! And in doing so both adding to your combostyle meter and allowing for some of the most fluid dynamic action Ive seen in a video game. Now Im sure there are new or better fighters out there but the fact that the DMC franchise already had a system that worked well and took it leaps and bounds further to create something new and exciting creating a new kind of game mechanic even  Most games utilize past proven systems its difficult to create new ideas so rare in any field of creativity really... every form of art relies on tropes styles techniques proven over time when new ideas surface and just work really really well to the point it leaves so many in awe at the sheer brilliance of execution something so unique it becomes the standard to be imitated emulated it becomes that new timeproven system thats art... thats a magical moment. And I feel that was achieved with the fight mechanics of DMC.Thanks for your time and for reminding me of just how much I loved that game when I was a good decade younger.

5508725,0,t3_3qjco3,Steam ID MylesShortWhat I would like Steam ControllerHistory A few years back I had a slip and fall which resulted in a slip in my spine called spondylolisthesis Ive already had moderate scoliosis from a young age and was only worsened since the fall if that wasnt bad enough though spondylolisthesis can also cause bowel problems and about  years ago I started having these pseudo seizures where If I drink too much cold water or experience a rapid temperature change most of the muscles in my body start to convulse Im still conscious so its not a true seizure but after an episode it leaves me extremely drained and makes my back and shoulder pain so much worse.  I can move around decently but Im pretty much in some form of constant pain some days are better than others though and I take it one day at a time and try to remain positive.Why I want the Steam Controller Ever since I got my PC as a gift I left console gaming behind and Ive never looked back but one thing thats always kept me from fully enjoying PC gaming is the fact that I have to sit at a desk and use a keyboard and mouse if I want to compete it really ends up hurting my back and arm after short periods of time playing with a controller lets me play longer but its just not a great experience against mouse users and leads to a decent amount of frustration.I know the steam controller wont solve all my problems but it would absolutely close the gap and help me play more accurately than a controller but longer than sitting at a kbm effectively being the best of both worlds.Ive been trying to get on disability for a while now but in the meantime I only get  a month and after bills Im down to  a month to spend on myself realistically I could save up for the controller but i would basically not be able to do anything for an entire month.Recently had to sell my DS and some games just to get MGSV huge MGS fan there was no way I wasnt playing that.Worth it but now I legit have no games that are even worth selling ahah.Id be beyond grateful if I win and youd absolutely be helping a down on his luck gamer have some fun relatively pain free times If you do pick me the steam controller cant be purchased as a gift but if you add it to your cart the page readsSteam Controller can be gifted to an address within your country during checkout.If youre in NA PM me and Id be happy to tell you my address.And as always thanks for the giveaway!

5549428,0,t3_3r4tjc,Does it need to be a Steam game? I wanted Fatal Frame for the Wii U My NNID is Foxdiesolid.There are a couple reasons why I want this gameFirst my girlfriend loves the Wii U but Im starting to get short on games that she can play. She skipped some games like Bayonetta  and DK Tropical Freeze because theyre insanely hard to play. But she is pretty good at survival horror games and she loved the whole concept of Fatal Frame. She loves photography and the idea of having to get close to ghosts photograph them to damage them amazes her. I also want to play this game SO BAD. Im a huge coward for horror games but when I played the first Fatal Frame some years ago I loved it mainly because I was able to man up and play it!Second and now its the bad part I cant buy this game because of an ongoing economic crisis in my country. Turns out that Brazil isnt all fun and carnaval after all. The DollarReal conversion is  so every brand new game and digital games like Wii Us Fatal Frame costs more than double of what they used to cost a couple years ago when the dollar was only  reais.This crisis also ruined jobs around all areas. Im already graduated in IT but since I dont know coding they said I could be anything so I preferred focusing on projects and IT management so there are no jobs for me. It took me  months after my graduation to get a job but it was a horrible helpdesk job where I was underpaid and overworked and God knows how I managed to endure almost a whole year there. Finally I asked my boss to fire me so I could quit that job and get some insurance money to improve my CV. And thats what Im doing! I decided to acquire another degree so now Im studying English to become a teacher. I thought I could get a job pretty quickly I hoped so because I only had enough money to pay for a single semester but it wasnt that easy. I only got a couple of interviews but Im still unemployed. My GF is already an English professor and she is trying to recommend me to her boss but the hiring period is only in late January so Im pretty much seeing all those new releases Xenoblade X Fallout  Disgaea  Transformers Devastation... passing by without experiencing them.I know that for most people around the world PC gaming is cheaper. But not here of course. Building a good enough gaming PC costs more than  PSs. And I was always a console guy even though in my early gaming years I was playing Mechwarrior and F Raptor on the PC and installing games via floppy discs. When I discovered that I could simply insert a disc on my PS and then play the game without any command line or complicated installations everything changed.Why you have so many consoles? you ask. Well my past income was enough to help with bills at home and buy games but not enough to buy a house or a car. So I spent lots of money with gaming over this past year and even a little bit of that insurance money I admit. But since this crisis got me plus the lack of a proper job I was forced to sell my DS with every game I had for it plus some PS games just to buy some new releases at the time. The rest of this money was spent on a new surge protector because my old one broke beyond repair for some reason. So now Im pretty much broke. I also turned down on some other hobbies like Guitar sold one of my guitars with pedals and amp and Im currently trying to sell the other cheaper one and Gunpla even though they cost around  bucks MG kits costs around  dollars each because of those cyclopean taxes. Yeah taxes. In my country games are considered slot machines and bandai Kits are toys so they arrive here with  of their value in taxes.So as you can see theres no sob story really. I just dont have a job and I want to keep on gaming with my girlfriend. Its the only hobby that I have left besides reading but I already have to read a lot for university papers and theres no time left for my own readings unless Im writing something about Lovecraft or Poe.I dont even know if I will get gifted besides trying a little bit too hard as you can see in my profile sadly but I want to thank you in advance for your kindness. I already gifted people around Reddit and I know that it feels awesome.,GiftofGames,cwkyhxx,2,t5_2tb4r

5668362,0,t3_3sohzt,Well that escalated quickly. Listen it was not my intention to try to rip anybody off or to scam. I even said in the OP not to do it if you couldnt afford it. Can I afford to buy it myself right now? Yes. Does that mean Im rolling around in gold like Scrooge McDuck? I wish. Money is always tight and I figured if some kind soul with a bit more disposable income than me felt like getting it for me why not? Whether thats right or wrong is debatable. The bottom line is what I wrote was poorly worded in part because I specifically wanted to avoid writing a sob story. I hate reading those and I dont like using my situation for gain. That is not what I was doing I promise you. Now IF someone does end up getting it for me Im going to buy something of equal value to give away to the community. I love it here and I think what you guys do is incredibly cool. The last thing I want to do is compromise the integrity of this place.

5776744,0,t3_3ua228,The game I want is Undertale plus soundtrack if you are willing.I want Undertale for several reasons The dark sense of humor rampant in the game appeals to my sensibilities in a way few games do. I am never one to shy away from what is known as gallows humor and jokes about death when done in good taste can honestly leave me rolling on the floor Few games can adapt to your choices as well as Undertale does where the game allows every playstyle from kill em all to cant we all just get along? And does it in a way that makes it seem like every choice is valid and possible. In Skyrim my choices were this guy with the funny accent or this other guy with a funny accent and a nice tan. in NV it was a bit better but I still was shoehorned in to an extent. Besides a few NPCs increasing in hostility my choice of faction only really affected what the narrator said over the last few slides that make up the ending. Dont even get me started on the choices in Mass Effect. But Undertale lets me go my own way no matter how evil or kind that way is meaning I can do several playthroughs and experience a fundamentally different game every time.  The soundtrack has been described to me as excellent and I love me a good video game soundtrack. As a musician and aspiring arranger I am always trying to listen to a variety of different types of music so I can try to emulate a lot of different stuff in m music. While Darren Korb is probably still my favorite writer in the video game sphere I still listen to a variety of different people.

5784653,0,t3_3ua228,  Meh Steam  The Beginners Guide BUT WHY You scream from a passing bus. Theres Fallout  and The Witcher  and MGSV why are you requesting this!?Well hun let me tell you a thing.When I first got my PC I thought gaming was nothing but FPSs and huge AAA productions about killing things. I didnt know the vast wasteland of variety that was the PC market. But I dug into the indie market with my newfound knowledge. I believe my first game was FTLFaster Than Light. It was my first Steam game on a crappy little Toshiba laptop without dedicated graphics but I played the hell outta FTL. It was new and different something I hadnt been exposed to before. I was like Well thats all well and good but what about everything else? I was still into games for the gameplay at that point and had no idea that games could tell a STORY. So I was told about The Stanley Parable from a Youtuber named Nerdcubed. Apparently it was pretty good he said. But I must go into it blind. He didnt want the viewers to watch him play his video said that going in blind is the best idea to get the best experience. So I did. I was walking into an experience that let me know video games can be so strange. Variety is what I learned. The Stanley Parable gave me a narrative story with absolutely ludicrous dialogue and choices. I was simply amazed at this strange little game. It got me to begin to actually SEARCH for games that were against the norm that were different from anything else and unique. And there truly is nothing else like it. Which is both great and sad as I will never get another experience like it.BUT HOLY SHIT THE SAME GUY MADE ANOTHER GAME OMG.Out comes the Beginners Guide silently sliding into the Steam store without me knowing. It was in my recommended and I was like what it be and I SAW IT WAS MADE BY THE SAME PERSON AND I FIGURATIVELY DIED.Really though this game promises a sad story in the same way that the Stanley Parable told its story and I need it in my life.

Point and click puzzle adventure. I lived and breathed it. I played it over and over. It ignited what seems these days to be the only passion I have in lifegaming. Kings Quest  was the next! I love it too! Theyre fantastical and clever and... well I mean... you play royalty going around being super polite to people and solving their problems while questing for what you love. Whats not to love?! . Ok I looked at teh kitteh. When I was growing up my evil awful nowalienated and estranged biofather no joke actually celebrated Festivus ... I do the Christmas thing because its what the kind strangers I met on the internet who liberated me from my birth family and adopted me such irony! do...

6025094,0,t3_3xzvia,My favourite game from  is Homeworld Remastered Collection. The game is a remaster of the two classic homeworld games which came out in the early s. You control a mothership from which you can produce other ships to build up a fleet to destroy the enemy mothership vs. AI or multiplayer or to accomplish other objectives campaign. The game has an incredible story  two in fact since the remastered version includes both games and the gameplay is characterized by being much more slow paced and less reflex intensive than its counterparts which is perfect for me as I usually suck at traditional RTS games. I wholeheartedly recommend this game if you have  bucks to spare and you like space games. If I had my own vault I would probably do my best to make it as selfsufficient as possible as I have no interest of going out to the horrible world that humanity has left behind after the bombs fell. I would spend the rest of my days reading playing sports with my fellow vaultdwellers and generally enjoying the simple things in life. ,GiftofGames,cy9eu53,2,t5_2tb4r

6066487,0,t3_3ym657, entering for Witcher . I really love the game my friend has it and hes let me play it whenever I can go over to his house. Ive finished Witcher  and  and Id really really love to have TW this Christmas.  Im a bit wary of putting in my email here since its whats used for GoG and I use it for most of my stuff but heres my Steam and I can provide the email through PM or something?Most memorable moment this year is definitely Christmas. It was going on like any other Christmas until around pm when we heard some shouting and we rushed outside. My  uncles and a friend of theirs who were all pretty deep into a couple bottles of gin and vodka were shouting at some crazy person going on a rampage outside our house brandishing a metal sptaula yes a spatula for cooking only it was made all of thick steel this was in our province and chasing a kid. Hed ran at a kid and hit him on the head with the spatula and my uncle immediately tried to run out and restrain the guy. My cousin his daughter didnt let him and my uncle shouted to my other uncle Bring out the gun!! Uncle  proceeded to bring out a rifle for intimidation only no ammo and another cousin brought out a katana god knows why we even had one in the house. Our aunts and grandparents were crying their asses of at this point and me and my other cousins were restraining our uncles. Eventually one of us called the police and shit calmed down. Rampage guy didnt get caught though since he was the nephew of our neighborhoods mayor. Shits corrupt yo.Not even kidding shit was real crazy this year really unexpected end to Christmas.,GiftofGames,cyet3ca,1,t5_2tb4r

6251745,0,t3_4161y2,Thanks OP!PSN goukiFavorite games? Borderlands  Ultra Street Fighter IV and CsGO Is multiple games allowed?Borderlands  is the best coop couch player game I have ever played so far and lots of things to do. From hundreds of quests to the biggest places to explore and all the sweet sweet loot. Borderlands  is a mix of RPGish gameplay and FPS with like I said a loot system explorable worlds places and a levelup system. This game is meant to be played over an over to strengthen your character and with friends so even better! Loot in this game is all great. Many things to find and have fun with like how the game advertises theres a shitload of guns to find. All in all this game is worth all the hours you spend on it.Ultra Street Fighter  is my goto fighting game very complex learning curve with practice leads to satisfying results. Many characters to choose from and learn. Fun gameplay mechanics when mastered and the fighting system is greatly balanced. The best version so far after all the different kinds of Street Fighter . It may be a frustrating game at first but feels so good when defeat your game demons with that one combo youve been practicing all night long. A classic fighting game for competitive players but not so beginner friendly. Probably my favorite game as of now.Last but not the least Counter Strike Global Offensive. A beloved competitive shooter. Gameplay can be skillbased but since the latest big update more on luck not a bad change IMO. Another game fun with friends or a good game for tournaments and racetothetops. Weapons that are available are very solid. Skillbased? Strategic skills weapon skills etc. Complex learning curve too if I can say again. My favorite FPS to play on weekend nights and shenanigans with friends. A very gud game where you git gud.Thanks again OP. edit Whats up with the comments? It says  comments but theres like . ,GiftofGames,cz098b8,1,t5_2tb4r

6407941,0,t3_43f8yb, Oh hallo FunkyRutabaga here I played MetaHuman Inc. about a week and a half ago which was pretty awesome. So far Ive enjoyed every Choice of Games game that Ive played. Theyre all textbased choose your own adventure games basically digital version of the Goosebumps books I used to read as a kid. but more grownup and with more than one good ending. Also I played Undertale in NovemberDecember and its my new favorite thing for so many reasons! The way the mechanics tie into the story the way your playstyle affects the world the cool things you notice when you look at the different endings side by side. Also skeleton puns and dogs. I know its a big popular bandwagon game now but I do feel like it was really well done. I kept myself away from most of the big spoilers so the neutral ending was a huge shock to me and the moment I really fell for the game. Imma go ahead and spoiler tag the rest of my fannish rant here. I had a few panicked moments after Flowey closed the game where I thought my computer had actually fucked everything up and I was gonna have to redo the entire Asgore fight which was just STUPID that FUCKING GOAT. Then of course I had to do the True Pacifist run and then the Genocide run it was so satisfying when I finally got past the final boss and I keep intending to do another neutral run but I feel really guilty killing everyone. Again.spoiler My number is  I would adore Dyscourse if I win  I am going to enter the bonus as well! Backstage Pass has been at the top of my wishlist for a while now because I just erm really like otome games. Also this one has a character with green hair and you can dress up your person which is just aplus. Do you know how many stupid flashbased dressup games Ive played? I would like to play a nicelooking one that doesnt try to trick me into clicking on ads for once.  Allternatively if I were to win the bonus and you dont wish to drop thirty bucks on a stupid dating game The Purring Quest is my number . You play as a cat. I like stupid games. My number for the bonus raffle is Thank you for the giveaway!,GiftofGames,czi0nl9,2,t5_2tb4r

6486434,0,t3_44fynu,Hey! I just got bootcamp working on my Mac so Im finally able to play Windows games. Ive played the first part of Assassins creed years ago and it was one of my favorite games. Ive also heard a LOT of good stuff about Far Cry. To be completely honest I wouldnt mind either of Assassins Creed Chronicles China or Far Cry . Ive really been wanting to get back into open world games and I think these would be a really good start considering my computer can just handle these games at a decent and playable framerate Yes i doublecheckedI dont know if my Steam ID is applicable to the UPlay giveaway but here it is anyway.

A dream where a bored high school junior without money or a job to get him some set out on Reddit to look at cats only to find a generous man giving away The Division the game six of his friends are staying home from school to play. Feeling left out he posts this comment in hopes that he may once again be in the loop. But no seriously I think this game is going to be amazing. The open world elements make me happy inside and the destruction makes me yearn to blow up everything. All in all it looks like an amazing game that has both the shooter elements I love and the strategic elements that make me feel like I didnt just waste  hours playing the same game.

7031855,0,t1_d1cd3q1,Not necessarily opposing the rule here but Id like to point out another factor that you might not have considered price. When it comes to Steam and online gaming in general you can usually purchase great games for incredibly low prices during the major Steam sales or the major sales of other online retailers you can get great indie games and sometimes great if older AAA titles for  or much less. However when it comes to buying console titles this line becomes a bit more blurred. For older consoles sometimes you can grab games for relatively low prices at older gaming shops if theyre not as in demand or there are more copies of them out there although admittingly most of the older console games I see for low prices are generally shovelware or at the very least lower quality games. However rarerhigher rated games and more likely to be the games that people actually wantrequest and newer great console titles for newer consoles like the PSWii UXbox One are more expensive and their prices will not drop very low if at all during sales. You can expect great console titles or newer console titles that are wanted by the community to be at the very least maybe  during a major sale. See the price difference? The price for  great Steam games could be as low as  together while the price for  great console games could be expected to maybe be as low as  together.What Im arguing here is not necessarily that the rule is unnecessary... but rather that the rule might not be economically feasible for many. If they own a console which can cost upwards of  or much more then chances are theyve spent a lot of money on the console or the equipment already alas why they are choosing to request for titles that they might not be able to purchase at the moment. After reading and thinking over this several times its definitely not an absurd rule... but I feel as if it hurts the wrong people for the wrong reasons.Again Im not necessarily against the rule but Id like you to think over it and think about the entire scope of what this rule will do to GoG.,GiftofGames,d1deyuf,2,t5_2tb4r

7088426,0,t3_4ck8gn,REQUESTSTEAM The CullingSteam link to gameSteam ProfileRequest Ive always liked the Battle Royale idea for a game since I first read about it so games like HZ and Arma  BR mods always were interesting to me the adrenaline you get when you know its just you and someone else left is very hard to describe so lately Ive been playing Ark Survival of the Fittest  because its free to play and a battle royale game but although Ive enjoyed the game the whole dinos thing doesnt feel great for me because most part of the game is spent fighting dinos and not people so I feel that The Culling is a game I can spend a lot of time into Ive been watching a lot of streams and its exactly what Im looking for  but for me its very hard to buy it since where I live Venezuela we have a currency lockdown where we cant exchange our local currency for USD or anything else making it very hard to buy a game unless you go to the black market where the price is very high supply and demand Im a  year old electronic engineer and my salary is around  a month making it almost impossible to buy games although Ive been able to buy a few on very good sales Ive never paid more than  for a game. The idea of this is not to make people feel sorry or anything but to give an idea on why I havent bought a game I want so much even when its only  but those  for me is a lot of food and services because even when you earn  a month a lot of things are a lot cheaper than in other countries but games are not one of them.

Its a simple indie game taking the best features of The Legend of Zelda and The Binding of Isaac which creates a challenging experience but is also very fun to play.Id love to get Game of Thrones Telltale.

7719335,0,t1_d3jj9fw,Some of us doesnt represent most of the  users. If we were all swimming in dosh a sub like this wouldnt exist. Maybe for the sake of making friends but no more than that.gt have to respectfully disagree with your statement saying that things like this will crash your chance of getting a request filled. In fact its quite the opposite. They didnt go about it in a mean or hateful way. I can see where misconceptions on how the process works can arise and I think its perfectly okay to ask.The only thing that comes to mind when I see self promotion lack of patience and even disappointment at not having your request fullfilled by now is nothing short of entitled  I really hate that word but its the only word I can think of in such situation . A person who would look at this discussion and request with this mindset would get a bitter message. If you choose to look at it at an innocent discussion I dont judge you for it.gtNow what will crash someones chance of getting a request filled in my book at least is shitty posts and shitty responses where people are dicks because I look more at the person than the request itself.So your response seems a little counter intuitive. Perhaps there is a reason why you dont get a request filled and maybe you should reevaluate your method on how you go about it.Im me man. Im not trying to be someone else in this sub I speak whats on my mind and if one of a hundred posts will get some flak  like this one  Id be in peace about it.If my comment will affect your decision wether to give him the game or not I wouldnt be bothered in the slightest. In the contarary. If he does get it Ill see another dudes day made great by a stranger on the internet and he will enjoy a brand new game. Im not a dick. I dont think I ever seen you around chat I dont think I spoke to you or interacted with you in any way. It doesnt matter if youve seen my request or not Im in peace with what I wrote and submitted by the feedback I got I dont think I did anything wrong. My comment was to criticize what in my opinion was a self promotion and the rest of what I said was raw statistics. I wouldnt mind posting a single request or  of them I dont care if its my allegedy shitty methods or any other reason. I dont judge.,GiftofGames,d3jmvto,2,t5_2tb4r

I just did.So a few months back when Overwatch first came out Blizzard offered everyone one more free name change.So I decided to take this one seriously and pick a decent username.I get to the username changing thing and Im screwing around with names like BigBoy and AsianPersuasion and thinking that the website would ask me Are you sure you want the name MemeMachine before it locked in I decided to click OK. Turns out that they dont ask for confirmation...So now my Blizzard name is MemeMachine....As for the game I want I want Retro City RampageDX. The reason for wanting it is because I recently got a DS and would love to play the GTA top down retro game.Life is treating me like the underside of a school desk. Because that shit be nasty.I guess you need my steam ID?,GiftofGames,d6pfbg0,1,t5_2tb4r

There was an annoying boom box in the game that one of my friends kept turning to max volume. I walked over grabbed the boom box and ran. He started chasing me. I managed to get a little ways ahead of him so I placed the boom box in a crate. I jumped onto the boom box and lifted the crate literally right as he got to me and suddenly I was hundreds of feet in the air flying away with the boom box.

9728393,0,t3_5ef9fl,The game I want is Overwatch.I dont play games anymore lately and I dont know what to do anymore. I played CSGO but that went away fast. Then I switched to League of Legends but after hitting Gold and it being the preseason I lost all desire to play itand grinding for IP is such a chore.Im gonna buy a library membership in the town library but the membership starts from the calendar year so it would be a waste to buy one for just  month instead of the whole year duration.Ive seen a lot of Overwatch from streams and on the subreddit and I really like it. Its kinda like a fast and fun CSGO with gorgeous characters. Ive actually wanted to buy it myself and started collecting Steam Cards earlier this year in hopes of getting enough CSGO keys to get it but I got scammed out of half of them so I gave up on it. It as a roundabout way of getting it but I had no other choice since  on a game is too much in my region Bosnia. Its also the only new game my computer can still run.My favorite character would be either Widowmaker Mercy or Anna. I like being in he back of the fights chilling and picking people off with Windowmaker and her vision is super helpful to the team. With Mercy youre directly helping your team with the heals and resurrection all while making the play dynamic since you have to stay alive yourself. I havent seen much of Ana but she looks like something I havent seen in other games. I love how she can both damage the enemy and heal allies with her gun  her nano boost is crazy. I want to like Lucio but having a megaphone for a weapon looks ridiculous.My favorite map would be Ilios with the exception of the random hole it has. Who put that there and for what? Its just a random hole.for people to cheese out tanks. My other favorite map would be Kings Row. I like the old timey city environment it has lots of side paths which I like and the color pallet is great.I also love how any additional DLC or character is free as opposed to CSGO and LoL. Cant wait to see what the new character would be. Steam ID,GiftofGames,dac8k28,1,t5_2tb4r

9911167,0,t3_5hdrj8,RL will be my number.The game I want WatchDogs What it is Watch Dogs  is a third person open world hacking filled crime simulator in California more specifically San Francisco. Its neat because you can either choose to go in guns blazing in some missions or be stealthy. The game actually is not like Grand Theft Auto and doesnt require you to murder but instead prefers you dont. The default weapon is actually a tazer.Why I want Watch Dogs  I absolutely adore open world games that let me do whatever I like. Watch Dogs  takes that to an absolutely new level no scratch that a whole other planet. I can hack players traffic lights cars or anything else I want. You can even hack manholes to burst and throw cars in the air. You dont see many good third person open world games anymore that arent Grand Theft Auto anymore. Saints Row for me went the way of the dodo after they literally took it to hell and GTAs fun and all and I love GTA but I have all the GTAs except GTA  and  and the Stories games. Ive been playing GTA V as my open world game since two months after it came out its getting a LITTTTTLE boring.Why I cant get it Well I cant get it because of the time of year and because the price tag is  dollars. Its also almost my birthday and I cannot afford a new video game for my birthday from friends or family or even from me or for myself. I would be extremely thankful if I could get this.My random number is just RL like my previous number.Peace and blessings.,GiftofGames,dazg54p,0,t5_2tb4r

10084613,0,t3_5k6w3t,Merry Christmas!The game I will be requesting is Dark Souls IIIThis past couple of months a good friend of mine has been trying and trying to get me into the wonderful world of Dark Souls and after getting stuck on the Taurus Demon I scoffed at him and gave it up for a while. Now nothing but divine intervention could get me back but for some godforsaken reason I felt the need to explore the world just a little more. Instantly I was hooked because the game immerses the player in a world where even the weakest enemies have potential to kill. After every area a shortcut can be opened to truly illustrate the masterful world design. Because this game does not feel like separated levels or areas it feels like a world that needs saving. I have now played through the entire game once and my second character is stuck in Anor Londo the general half way point of the game OampS and sorcery do not mix well. With the immersion however is also a deep and frustatingly vague lore. Most of the known history in Dark Souls comes from short dialouges or item discriptions which obviously lead to interpretation but the general story stems from the fact that you are trying to save humanity by keeping the Flame from dying out. The flame is interpreted many different ways but the most common one is willpower or just life itself. Your enemies are ones who have gone hollow or crazy either in their quests for glory or as an aftereffect of the flame waning.Why I want Dark Souls III is because from what Ive heard Dark Souls II does not live up to the expectations so I want to continue this amazing immersion. I love going into these games blind so unfortunately all I know is that it is generally regarded to be the second best following the original and that it improves upon many of the faults with the original. Ive watched up to the first boss and I can already tell that it is a game for me.I am not getting it for myself because it is still full price but on sale for  right now and I cant afford anything above  because Im still a struggling high school student.I have never been gifted before but I have done a giveaway and gifted someone Ultimate Doom.Thank you for your generosity even if I dont win this is a very kind thing to do!Steam IDI hope you do decide to grant me the best Christmas gift ever Praise the Sun!edit Formatting,GiftofGames,dbm1ku0,1,t5_2tb4r

Half an hour later a Ferrari stops in front of their house a middle aged man in an expensive suit steps out of it.

I actually think that theres tons of fun to be found in indie games and most of my time in gaming these days is actually spent in those. I know i would enjoy this one a turn based strategy game where making skill shots matters? Well count me in! I know the artwork is great and im sure the soundtrack isnt lacking either. Concept seems nice and the longevity is there. Would really be amazing if i won this.Thanks for the kind giveaway.Here goes a cute doggo gifSteam ID,GiftofGames,de7gewb,1,t5_2tb4r

11417067,0,t3_61uc3a, Post your top  or  most wanted gamesgt . GTA V what can I say about GTA V? Its the sandbox game to beat all sandbox games. An incredible storyline a ridiculously deep sandbox teeming with life a shitload of content and insane online experience with friends granted. This is the game I could see myself playing for a good couple years easily its replay value is insane. And somehow its still regularly updated. What more could someone want in a game really?gt . RimWorld this game I crave for mainly for being an addict of cruelly difficult survival games. That and the infamous storyteller in the game that generates events to make for an interesting storyline. Its also got a surprising amount of personality depth in the sims. I seriously want to get my heartbroken again anew with RimWorld.gt . Crusader Kings II DLC the nonskinsmusic ones which are essentially not many the actual dlcs that is GOD I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME. I seriously cant get enough of the vanilla base game. The amount of RP and imagination into backstorycharacter building you place yourself adds to the fun. Its one of my most played steam games and I itch to try out the new dlcs and new empires and events they come with. Seriously if you own it and its just gaining dust try it out now. And install the ASOIAF mod if youre a fan of GOT. Hands down my favorite mod of any game. What games have you played that are similar to the ones on your wanted list?gt . GTA V all the previous GTA installments Saints Row III which is a good hoot a bit of Mafia II.

What is the last game you completed?gt Either Rayman Origins or Brothers A Tale of Two Sons exactly a year ago next month. Dunno which one I enjoyed more... What games are in your library that you would like to play more? Why havent you played more?gt A couple classics Fallout  GOTY the Bioshock Trilogy amp Mirrors Edge. Fallout because I was incredibly bored by it the Bioshock Trilogy as I havent even scratched the surface of Bioshock  because the atmosphere legitimately creeps me out too much way too ominous and Mirrors Edge because of a single level I cant complete. Frustrating I know. What is something you are looking forward to in the near future?gt Finally graduating university. Im desperate to find someone I care for and settle down already. Felt Ive been ready for it a while now just need to start my career already. What is something you are looking forward to in the near future?gt Moved back home to be closer to the family and help out with finances. My first year back is coming up to an end and Ive got stable work and going to university in an accelerated program. Lifes looking good after flunking out of an Ivy League and losing that scholarship. Cant bear to look at old friends on FB because of it all... What televisionbookanimemangacomicetc series are you currently into? How is it? gt Since about last year after crashing out and burning out in uni I started watching all the comedy classics Friends Seinfeld Modern Family etc. Lots of laughter certainly helped cheer myself over several months. That and Your Name Kimi No Na Wa literally changed my mind on life. What is a movie you recently watched? How was it?gt The original Descent movie. Hands down my favorite horror movie of all time. God that movie had it all. It Follows was also interesting but only in the first quartertohalf. Tarantino was right the director somehow fumbled the great premise in the second half. What is your favorite meme? Why?gt The Awkward Moment Seal. After spending a great deal of my formative years in a foreign country  where I had to learn the language from scratch  partly in boarding school Im almost certain I could be one of the most awkward people to strangers or new people in general. Haha... What is your favorite YouTube channel?gt All my favorites in my teen years either went to shit or quit KevJumba apparently he has posted after a  year hiatus! UberHaxorNova Swoozie and VanossGaming. Right now Im surprised how much Im enjoying KSI and his Sidemen gang. Something about watching a guy lose constantly and win occasionally resonates with me. I wonder why haha What is your favorite localcouch game to play?gt Move or Die. Up to  players locally or online or mixed a very easy to jump into game and drop at moments notice. A lot of competitive fun recommended highly by me. What is something you are improving at? How? How are you doing?gt Trying to improve my sleep schedule. It was out of wack during my stint at a university abroad. Nowadays I get up at  am sharp and Im out by  pm on a good night. I absolutely love starting my day early makes me feel productive and an active member of the community. Something about seeing your neighbors out and about while commuting to work amirite? What game would you like to be remasteredremadehave a sequel?gt Time Splitters Future Perfect. That game holds a lot of cherished memories surrounding gaming and my brothers amp cousins where the pvp game modes were just unadulterated fun. Still think back fondly to the weapons like the heat seeker and fattening darts. I hope Crytek finally gives us some closure on Time Splitters s production at some point...ampnbspSteam,GiftofGames,dfq42pk,1,t5_2tb4r

11475498,0,t1_dfwlj7h,True but asking non english speakers to write in general which is what you are already doing would put them at a disadvantage. Telling them to write why they want the game would still put them at a disadvantage.  ,GiftofGames,dfwqrpa,1,t5_2tb4r

11746389,0,t3_67fswo,History gt The other classesSteam ID Well... I dont exactly have a favorite meme in general... they just gotta be dank enough so its aint really something I think about... so Ill just give yall my favorite reddit meme... NSFW coughforthosewhodontgetit     My day Spent  minutes staring at the ceiling before falling asleep. Later woke up to take a mighty dump worthy of coming straight out of a giants brown starfish. Went back to sleep. Woke up later. Took a short walk. Came back started up my computer stumbled around the interwebz for anything interesting. In other words I didnt do anything. As for why I want this saw a mini flood of Request posts for it the day and a few days afterwards the game came out. Looked it up on Steam and took a quick look at the trailer?. The game looked fun. Buncha dudes and dudettes thrown onto some island and have to duke it out in a battle royale. Seems like a pretty chill survival shooter. The trailer also did a pretty nice job showing off what it is. An open world freeforall survival shooter is awesome. Nothing more than that. Id just like to be able to play it.Am I stronger than Hercules now?,GiftofGames,dgrhe8f,1,t5_2tb4r
