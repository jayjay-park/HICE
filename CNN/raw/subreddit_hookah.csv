I smoked SB for awhile until I used some shisha I had for about two months and it tasted like medicine and I starts reading more about them and it just made me stop buying any of their shit. I got into Haze after that and the first three flavors I had didnt have a lot of flavor and it gave me a horrible headache. I tried again later and I didnt like the taste at all.

If you arent using Tangiers tobacco pack it lightly in the bowl sprinkle it in but make sure it isnt touching the foil.  If you are using quicklight coals I suggest switching to natural. Less unhealthy and last waaaaaay longer. If youre using coconaras a very popular and effective option use about  for most tobaccos.  Whatever coal youre using make sure it is completely lit before putting it on the hookah.  Poke lots of holes and dont make them too small a toothpick is good.  Stem     inches into the water.  Keep the coals on the outside rim of the bowl rotating them around the bowl every once in a while.  Let the coals sit on the hookah for  mins before starting to smoke. Trust me it helps.  ,hookah,cfehzus,3,t5_2qkma

461469,0,t3_1zd5dk,To be actually addicted to nicotine you need to have a certain amount in your system over a period of time. How much and for how long varies person to person. Cigarettes are more or less designed to get as much nicotine into you as quickly as possible resulting in addiction. With other forms of tobacco use there is often less nicotine to start with and users generally use less.I havent smoked a hookah before actually just bought my first one to try out earlier today but I know with cigars and pipes you dont inhale. This limits the amount of nicotine you absorb because while you do absorb it through the lining of your mouth its a fraction of what you can absorb through your lungs.Not inhaling also creates a delay between puffing and your reaction to the nicotine. Creating a true addiction requires there to be little to no delay between taking the chemical and the reaction. With cigarettes the delay is IIRC about  seconds. When smoking a pipe or cigar the gap is closer to... I believe Id read four minutes. This doesnt allow your brain to draw the same connection between the chemical and its delivery system.Any behavior however can be habit forming if it is enjoyable. This isnt necessarily a bad thing. Habits are more easily broken and do not pose a withdrawal risk when you stop. Wanting it at the end of the day but not needing it is a habit.,hookah,cfspwmy,1,t5_2qkma

695356,0,t1_cgjaxrr,So saying that automatically infers Im trying to make a reputation again you are so far off youre in a parallel universe. Just because I said it doesnt mean I want a reputation Ive already had that reputation just a FYI. For awile infact its making a statement Thats true and I think its fine in a thread like this. Oh I like to attack people who dont like QL coals. Well I guess Ive attacked everyone on this planet huh. I guess I attacked my GF last night when she said she didnt want to use three kings but wanted to use naturals I guess as well.And seriously? Talking about the ignorance of a majority of members wasnt even involved in my post about that and posted long before you got here so why are you acting like I included you? Like I posted it because you disagreed with me. No. That was posted hours before you got here. So if trying to make a reputation for myself is defending what I feel is a good product even though Ive had the reputation of Quicklight Advocate for awile now without actually trying for it than I guess Im trying to make a repuation for myself even though I already have the reputation? Makes sense. I want it but I already have it. Thats like buying a car that you already have the exact same make and model of.So if you are just making a point its hard to make a point when Im actually not in every thread starting fights and if you arent willing to back that statement up by checking dont try to make it. Oh wow I went into a thread here last night and used sarcasm maybe you can find that one. You cant make a point if you lie about it. So you are seriously arguing with two comments I made IN THIS THREAD ABOUT QL COALS wow. Of fucking course Im going to make comments about QL COALS in this thread.. that is astonishing. What was I supposed to talk about?  wheelers?So pretending Im trying to make a repuation especially online.. really.. come on.. is a nice argument but doesnt work because Ive already had it. Dont get me wrong are naturals better in the fact that they last longer ash less and the FACT that yes they dont have chemicals that give you head aches nausea and add a funky taste for  of people yes naturals are better than QL COALS but certain QL coals  arent that bad. Ever notice how I always refer to three kings when I used to use logic and facts. I used to try to explain to people that didnt like QL coals that you will still get a headache and get sick using natural coals if you dont light them properly as well. You know. Carbon monoxide is a bitch and EVERY coal produces it. The main argument against QL coals I hear is the taste they add. Personally I never taste anything IF LIT PROPERLY. So I try to explain how to light them properly and how to know when they are safe to use. Also the headaches and nausuea coming from QL COALS only is straight BS. You get the same problem from naturals if you light them halfway as well and smoke them.So tell me how Im driving people away even though my main concern is to educate people how to use them properly so they dont have a hate for them when they really arent that bad of a product. They have a bad stigma because of base ignorance. When I went back to QL COALS after learning how to light them properly I was amazed at the fact I was having s great session and it was me all along and not the coal. Im driving the people away that come in posting new content with just a small pumpkin hookah and QL coals. I wish them a happy session and go on my way where as most of the comments as about how they should upgrade and to not use QL COALS because they suck. Thats not a valid reason. Please you obviously have not seen me around enough to make assumptions like that. Ive noticed alot of members that used to comment regularly I havent seen comment near as much.,hookah,cgjbb9q,2,t5_2qkma

It will take you longer to fill your base with water than to get the bowl ready cause all you do is just stick it on the top of youre hookah and youre done. It activates when you start pulling. Stops vaping when you stop pulling. It counts your pulls and times them. Adjustable voltage to make bigger or smaller clouds. And has a meter that tells you how much power you got left. . on hookahshisha. You can find it  cheaper other places. But I refuse to use anyone but HS. The clouds are insane and you can use practically any e juice and flavornicotine strength you want.

Shisha Fruits have a nice solid flavor that really lets you know what you are smoking. I havent tried a shisha fruit that I havent liked yet. I have had some flavors that I dont particularly like in general but as a reviewer those flavors were still on point and very bold and refreshing. Shisha fruits are real fruit and you cant eat them no matter how good they smell.  Shisha Fruits are non nicotine non tobacco flavor for your hookah.,hookah,ck5q9dl,0,t5_2qkma

Ive read before that a slight restriction can enhance flavor by itself because it lengthens the amount of time that the smoke contacts your tongue when you draw.  Kind of like how you taste a drink more when sipping rather than taking  a shot.  I know Ive heard this before and I think utangiers might even have said this at some point although I could be wrong.  Do you think theres any merit to this?

While the KM is mostly brass and copper that material doesnt extend to the downstem and the bowl port. Meanwhile the Khaleesie is one of the two Shika Vs that do not have a copper downstem copper being more prone to rust but still has a copper bowl port not that itll ever be in water or anything. Hookahjohn has a better selection of Shikas and carries the Trimetel Lv which is more or less identical to the KM Emperor but with the copper downstem. Additionally it comes with a nice Egyptian bowl and a Shika washable hose which is a  dollar bonus! while the KMs generally come with mediocre unwashable KM Pro Hose mouth tip is not removable.

2934224,0,t1_co1jsxv,Lebanese hookahs are cheap tin made hookahs nothing special Syrian hookahs have that super unique slightly restrictive draw that concentrates more flavor out of your shisha. Also they are the most beautiful solid hookahs out there. They take the most time to create and are pretty rare these days. Turkish hookahs are basically casted. simply made in a cast iron  shell with a preengraved design the liquid metal takes the shape or we the designs are as they get molded. Turkish pipes are pretty open in terms of draw a little more restrictive than an egyptian. Egyptian pipes are your most common middle eastern made hookah. In terms of overall quality Syrians are the best. however Egyptians are good too Shika pipes are good quality as are some KMs however once you get used to Syrian pipes in the end nothing else will cut it imo...   Nawras are tops among Syrian pipes!  ,hookah,co1mtar,2,t5_2qkma

3016781,0,t3_2uooan,Do you get frequent headaches even when you dont smoke? I suffer from migraines but only during the winter to spring and fall to winter season changes basically April and November suck for me. Do the headaches start while youre smoking or the next morning when you wake up?Could be carbon monoxide probelms. Make sure your coals arent over the middle of the bowl. Smoke in a well ventilated area. Crack a window if you can. I know its hard right now when its cold. Some crazy idea I just thought of if you have a table or something window level just sit the hookah outside on it and pull the hose in through a crack in the window and stuff the rest of the crack next to the hose with a towel or something to keep out the draft. Ive never done it but it will keep the coals and carbon monoxide outside. Might be a pain to rearrange the coals though. Do some flavors trigger the headache more than others? I loved AF orange until I smoked it and happen to get a full blown migraine with vomiting later that day. Now I cant even smell orange soda without feeling like Im about to get a headache and be sick.If you took all precautions and cleared any actual medical problems and you still want to smoke best solution might just be to pop an Aleve or Advil or whatever you take for headaches before you start smoking.,hookah,coaor80,1,t5_2qkma

3179876,0,t1_cork7xw,Everyone tends to complain about it but I dont feel it so much it one of those things thats so minute youd only notice it if you just went from drawing on a KM or whathaveyou then to drawing on your Sultan. That being said I absolutely love it I planned on making a rundown post of all the pros and cons of it here this weekend pics and all some few tips I can give you is the stem is quite heavy so it can tip easier then others just make sure its on a hard flat surface and you wont have any issues Im on a rug only reason I noticed. The hose port is also smaller then other as such a grommet may be to tick to work with your hose I have an ASLI as such just use paper towels or athletic tape. Also when you get yours make sure to clean it well copper thats been sitting a while will get a verdigris which you dont wanna smoke.That all being said do not fret youll love it. Sure there may be some issues here an there but looking at that hookah every time you smoke and know it will last a life time well makes up for any pitfalls.,hookah,corlcwm,1,t5_2qkma
3190811,0,t3_2woipt,Not quite sure. I just got Tangiers for the first time and I also tried it with the Kaloud combo. Mine wasnt harsh but the clouds were super thin.

3210728,0,t3_2wvyj7, They are expensive but they are made with high quality materials thinking about Starbuzz and Regal stems but lots of marketing and they all fit the same bases. Yes without a doubt. You will only be able to buy a Mya stem very very hard to find alone because the other stems wont fit your base. Indeed there are almost none. But as I told you in the previous point get a new hookah. Some hookahs have like you say an adapter for another hose in place of the purge valve thinking about the Unity hookah Size has no difference. I feel that smoke gets a little cooler with long pipes but honestly I think its just in my head. Be very very careful for air leaks with multi hose hookahs. Also you did a very good basic job with the Harmony and the DHose. Remember clouds are only the result of a good packing and heat management not a different pipe or water level.,hookah,cousi7q,2,t5_2qkma

3281091,0,t1_cp20mnh,Definitely check for air leaks. Do it systematically. First put the stem on the base no hose no bowl and plug up the hose ports and see if you are able to get any air from sucking in on the bowl port. If you are getting air at this stage you have a leak between your downstem and bowl or a hose port or purge valve is leaky. If it is airtight then plug in the hose cover the bowl port with your hand and take a drag through the hose again no air  good air  bad. Continue by adding the bowl to the top and covering the top of the bowl with your palm or very tightly covering it with a sheet of foil so that no air gets through check for air. If at this point you are completely airtight then you can rule out an air leak. Also is your hookah a  hose and his is a one hose?CheersCheyenne,hookah,cp29rt6,2,t5_2qkma

3328254,0,t1_cp7mpzx,I would imagine the mass produced ones are made by injection molding think.plays on press but I could be wrong on that. The hand made bowls in my experience are usually thicker which probably effect the heat retention and distribution.Obviously bowl design changes everything too.   But comparing a cheap Chinese channel to say a tagiersyoud likely find one working better than the other because of the material thickness and how it holds heat and where.  If it is in fact slip molded like you mentioned density may also be a factor as tiny air pockets would likely act like an insulator.   You got me thinking speculative science now.   Makes me want to take ceramics classes again or find a place with a wheel and kiln I can use.,hookah,cp7ncet,2,t5_2qkma

How hard do you have to bump it to tip it over also how easily does the base break? Is the builtin diffuser dismountable?

3413787,0,t3_2zbfjn,Skip any silicone bowl that isnt a samsaris bowl and even then I dont recommend them. Just get yourself a normal phunnel bowl an ft bowl or an alien mini phunnel bowl. You can grab a normal phunnel for somewhere around the  range depending on brand and where  i purchased one on Amazon for like  bucks. It was a great bowl but I got the wrong color. You usually get what you pay forAs for hoses I dont even know what that is in the picture. I just picked up a tonic washable hookah lounge hose for  bucks again off amazon and it works amazing. There are all types of hoses out there so it really comes down to personal preference on the hoses. I wish you luck in your search! Note I usually dont recommend Amazon for anyone when it comes to hookahs and accessories but sometimes you can find good deals on good products. Never buy any type of shisha from Amazon because you basically cant buy tobacco from them. Youll get the herbal stuff. Just stray from Amazon unless its like basics. And even then make sure they are name brand! ,hookah,cpheaal,4,t5_2qkma

I was in the market for a high quality inexpensive pipe and so far this fits the bill. Its sturdy heavy and quite beautiful especially considering the cost. It doesnt have the engravings or the tray of the Hilal but I imagine it smokes exactly the same. Its significantly taller than I thought it would be and does have a copper down stem with a nut welded on the bottom.

Its got KMs number hence the HookahShisha sale theyre getting rid of stuff like KM Shareef which is just a vastly inferior version to Shikas Electroplated Blacks. There isnt a solid argument for KM versus Shika right now other than the name brand. But thats like getting a Toyota instead of a Lexus because more people have Toyotas and recognize it quicker both good but Lexus has more bells and whistles and is better made. Oh and HookahonMars HookahShisha and UltimateHookah are my goto shops. Made at least a dozen orders from each in the past and theyve never failed me.

Which isnt any better than they smell.Definitely try frozen lakes the best watermelon mint Ive tried so far. Lemint is also good and their plain Lemon is my favorite Lemon shisha. Its very subtle though not in your face Pledge Lemon like most other lemon shisha. Subzero is very good. It smelled like a generic cleaner to me others have said it smells like urinal cakes. Dont let that scare you the taste is pretty good. Very different mint.Mint fiesta is good but it has spearmint which is hard to mix it like you would a more herbal mint like AF Mint. Doesnt taste good with fruity flavors at all. Really the only thing I found mixed well with Mint Fiesta was other mints.Haze Colada is decent enough. Better than any other pina coloda shisha Ive tried but I dont like pina colodas. Same for Yummy Madness. It really does taste like the white gummy bears Ive not had fumaris wgb but I hated the white gummy bears growing up.

Steam stones worked well and so does the gel that Deezer sells. Beware though the mint gel that deezer sells is insanely strong. Both stones and gel come in nicotinefree varieties but you can also get some with a little nicotine content if youd like too.edit in bold I accidentally a word,hookah,csw68o3,3,t5_2qkma

4610256,0,t3_3e5g4c,Brief experience helping a friend with his lounge. I would say not use any expensive bowls because they are prone to breaking. Large cheap Egyptian bowls should be fine. I agree with Gragorovichs suggestion of the hookahhose. Your customers will appreciate coconut coals and being indoors will probably reduce the smell using those.  Your startup costs can be pretty big depending on the style youre going for. Stoves couches music system lighting hookahs bowls shisha coals rent to name some expenses. Unless you have been saving for a while you might need to take out a loan and have a business plan. However you should always start small and work your way up. Being around a college usually helps too since that will be your biggest audience. Also you could ask for financial advice from a CPA if you know for a fact you want to do this. This may be especially useful because they can help you with calculating the costprofit you may see. I wish you the best of luck! ,hookah,ctbpemj,3,t5_2qkma
4614339,0,t3_3e5g4c,Worked at a moderately sucessful lounge before so this will include things we did well and things I WISH we would have done! ampnbspampnbspSeating Lighting and Music are the atmospheric components. Comfortable chairs are an absolute must imo your guests will be sitting there for many hours hopefully . We had regular lounge lights that made everything lit but still quite dim. That being said we had  flat screen t.v.s playing music so the dim lights make for a calm relaxed atmosphere with minimal glare. We also had black lights which made the weekends amazing.ampnbspHookahs those that are saying get Khalils are absolutely right. We had smaller chinese made hookahs and although they smoke just fine they dont have as much wow factor as a KM. They also broke more often and needed replacing sooner.ampnbspHoses MAKE THEM WASHABLE you will have a lounge and will serve anywhere from  hookahs a night depending on the business level and you will need hoses that dont ghost easily and can be washed many times a night. Aluminum dream hoses or aluminum lulava hoses would be the way to go imo. There are other washable hoses on the market with fabric on them but that fabric WILL take a beating FAST in a lounge. Keep it simple with aluminum that will last you forever. If you really want to keep  fabric hoses I used to pull those out for the traditional crowds or people who look like they can give a nice tip. ampnbspSHISHA!!! A well made hookah that smokes like a dream and tastes like sex in candyland is going to be the key. Our lounge was far from the prettiest or nicest in town but DAMN we made some nice hookahs. We had  different brands but for starting out I might keep it simple with  or .  or  brands could equal  seperate flavors or more and have a solid menu with cool mixes. MOST people in my lounge never wanted one single flavor even though personally I can smoke mint or peach alone. Ask this community or myself if you wish on some mixes I was pretty damn good at coming up with concoctions  Peach cobbler peach rings chai tea AF Smaug  Watermelooons Fruity Loops you name it. The options are limitless!ampnbspIn general mint some solid good fruity mixes double apple mint for the traditionals grape and rose are all solid starts. ampnbspGood luck to you and happy smoking!,hookah,ctc7u59,2,t5_2qkma

5552353,0,t3_3r4uyd,Use  coals. The key isnt to put a lot of heat down and Grill the shisha but less heat to slowly heat the entire bowl and bake the shisha. Try using  coals instead of . Make sure theyre fully heated and just set them on there. I usually dont take many pulls for  minutes while I let the entire bowl get warm I try not to take any but cant help myself . You can move the coals  degrees after  minutes or so so that the coals are opposite on each other on the bowl then move them to the  empty spots still opposite of each other. This should help some. Also I dont pat my shisha down that much. I usually sprinkle in just above the center spire instead of the rim and barely press it down to level with the spire. ,hookah,cwlbj4k,1,t5_2qkma

I was looking at entry level pipes and most of them all have the same features and look the same. In the UK I have met individuals who know about the scene and have invested like myself I guess into different pipes and products. The lounge scene is pretty crap in London from my experience. I have a friend who runs a a lounge in London who uses genuine tangiers medium phunnels lotuses and standard km pipes but he is one of the few to serve up tangiers tobacco. Lately there has been an influx of glass pipes from china. Al fakher is king so is star buzz and for some reason fantasia is still served. We have a weird habbit of making weird homemade mixes which dominate the lounges who sell these heads for a premium e.g irn bru skittles jo etc....

AF orange SB blue mist SB geisha and mint were all flavors that I found mixed well enough with one another that were also easy to find in physical stores.

6971573,0,t3_4b5pcy,This post really chaps my ass.To start with this is really just an ad disguised as market research. Im not buying the whole letting an online forum set the price point idea that youre trying to convey. You and the guy who created the product know that  is a really high price point and is up there with the most expensive hookahs on the market and you know people are not going to be tripping over themselves to buy an overpriced hookah. In fact you even said that the hookahs price is already determined to be  the only variable is the price for shipping. Even if you can manage free shipping the most you can drop the price is . That alone tells me this post is an ad hiding behind a bullshit question. Second of all you are intentionally misleading everyone in this post. You said gtI personally stand behind this product and I only smoke out of them.Just the other day you wanted to know if the saharasmoke hookah you bought had rust or notYou wanted to know what coals to use in a Kaloud lotusyou also wanted to know why your new kaloud lotus came with a sandblasted finishIts very clear that you are new to hookah and you straight up lied when you said you only smoke from this new hookah when clearly you bought yourself a saharasmoke hookah to smoke out of just a few days ago. Not only that but you wrote this entire ad with this impression that you know what good hookah is like as if you had some experience to base your opinions off of but you clearly have very limited experience.I dont like being lied to. If you had just posted an honest ad instead of peddling a false pretense about the viability of the price point I would have been more interested. Then you tried to pretend like you knew what you were talking about. You said later in the comments that you and your reputation stand behind this product when you were just asking if you should use cubes or flats in your lotus that you didnt know is being sold with a sandblasted finish now to smoke out of your SS hookah that you thought had rust. Thats twice youve tried to mislead everyone.Next you keep mentioning patents. You mention that your friend patented this hookah concept and started manufacturing it himself. You said that every part of this hookah uses patented technology from the base to the bowl. I dont think there are any significant patented ideas in this hookah. I think that your friend just got some design patents so that no one steals the aesthetics of the hookah but doesnt bring forth any new idea that has a significant impact in the smoking of the hookah. You said youll make a postvideo tomorrow explaining how the hookah works so Ill be looking forward to that because Id be really peeved if I find out this is a gimmick too.gtThis is one of the most smooth sleek practical lightweight and innovative hookahs out on the market.Rereading your post just keeps grinding my gears. You didnt even get the hookah until yesterday on the th in fact according to your comment you made this post  hours after you got your hookah.The funny thing is this might be a great hookah you know why? its really fucking easy to make a good hookah. All you need to have a good hookah is an open ended pipe that doesnt rust with two holes one for the hose and one for the purge. All you need to sell that is show that it works. You dont need to concoct this bullshit marketing scheme with buzzwords in order to sell it.gtThis hookah perfects the simplicity.......Dont bullshit everyone. Just make an honest post and let the product sell itself.Edit gtToday the hookah is amazing enough for me to post it here on rhookah.Literally today as in you just got the product today.,hookah,d16kcr2,8,t5_2qkma

You can remove the glass insert to make fruit bowls as well.And then theres the Ferris Bowl which has a lip that perfectly encloses a HMD such as the ignis or lotus so that it doesnt fall off or lose its place.I personally have recently acquired an Alpaca OG Rook which works like a phunnelvortex hybrid and the color variety and design as toptier.That said the harmony and the  feet will always be a solid addition to any bowl collection.  ,hookah,d1px67q,2,t5_2qkma

7255186,0,t3_4es085,Heres a copy pasta on mostly Shikas... Hookah   Check out this slightly outdated guide on hookah by price its still got good information in it.   But in a nutshell Shika hookahs have become a favorite if not favorite brand of hookahs for a variety of reasons. Theyre at a great cross section between affordability and quality. Most of the hookahs come in complete brasscopper  unlike many other brasscopper hookahs which are just shelled with brass and copper. While it will not rust like noncopperbrass hookahs the copper will still oxidize but its very easy to clean them off. Shika hookahs also often come with thick glass bases and washable hoses. Simply put  these hookahs will last you a life time if you take care of the copper and brass. Also worth noting that if it doesnt last you a lifetime any Shika v or above comes with a lifetime warranty.     The Accessories  Shika stands above KM for beginner smokers or first time buyers in large part because of the quality accessories it comes with. Rather than an poorly made Egyptian bowl and a unwashable hose that is frequently made out of recycled newspaper the handle Shika comes with the Shika Typhoon hose and the Shika Oblivion bowl  Hose  Mya Silicone Hose  cheaper alternative to the Dream Hose variants and just as high if not higher quality Bowl  Bowl Guide  Add the Sky Bowl to the top of the bowl list at the bottom of the guide Heat Management Devices   Why you should get one  Kaloud Lotus  Oduman Ignis  I recommend this one  MIG Razor Let me know if you have any questions and Id be happy to try helping!,hookah,d22v2oz,2,t5_2qkma
7269084,0,t3_4eyg6g,Sounds like a grounding issue. Basically you are getting zapped because a wire came loose in the burner and it is energizing the metal parts of the burner.If it has a threeprong plug it should not do this anyway as the third prong is to prevent this exact thing from happening as the ground is connected to the metal body of whatever you have plugged in and it routes the current back to the source through the ground because copper is way more conductive than flesh.I would toss the burner and get a ground tester just to verify the outlet is functioning properly.

For the record I did not threaten to release any information I said that I will review our logs for internal reasons. That would be irresponsible and childish. I also did apologize a few times on the phone. The bottom line is you asked for a refund and we issued the refund on the same day. What happens between your bank and your account is out of our hands.  It even shows on your screenshot that the refund was issued on the st of April. No need to further argue about this. Sounds like you have some personal issues with your finances but please do not blame it on our company.  I would appreciate it if you do not slander me or TheHookah.com.  We have been in business for nearly  years for a reason.  We have never taken anyones money.

7508158,0,t3_4i1kzk,Well I actually dont know how bad hookah is for you in the longterm but I smoke every day most of the time. Now before you say THATS HORRIBLE FOR YOU! well.. I know. Its also horrible for my wallet. But my problem is that I get stressed incredibly easily to a point where I cannot eat and have trouble breathing. Ive taken selfhelp courses Ive spent hundreds of hours meditating which admittedly does help me a little exercising and thought exercises. The only thing thats worked for me thus far has been smoking.So my setup is an Egyptian bowl one of the mediumsized or smallsized on a KM with a nammor hose both the hookah and hose get cleaned every  days or so bleach for the base lemon juice and water for the hose and the stem gets cleaned after every smoking session. I usually smoke two bowls a day but it usually winds up translating into  hours of sitting in place smoking and thinking about nothing.So heres what Ive found... health problems that have developed . I occasionally get a scratchy throat. Colds usually last an extra week longerIm guessing itll get worse if I dont get this under control.. but the thing is I dont have a physical addiction. I went two weeks without smoking and didnt have headaches or withdrawal symptoms or anything like thatbut there was this itching in the back of my mind a compulsion to smoke.Anyway I have no idea what its doing to me but I assume its bad. Itd probably be worse if I werent using natural coals and natural shisha I hate glycerin it tastes so bad but considering Im not a doctor I can only assume its going to heavily increase my risk of lung or throat cancer. TLDR I smoke too much. I get long colds and itchy throat. Be incredibly careful! oo But wont judge you if you do I do understand,hookah,d2vn168,2,t5_2qkma

8104360,0,t1_d4qwv34,Fluffy basically means put the shisha in the bowl without patting it down and without large clumps. What I do is when putting the flavour in the bowl I separate it with my thumb and index finger. If some flavour falls in which is too bigcan be separated more Ill take it out and separate it before putting it back in the bowl. Its OK to pat the flavour at the end but you shouldnt be squeezing it into the bowl. Unfortunately i dont have a picture but if you look at reviews for haze flavors they are usually packed fluffy. ,hookah,d4r041k,2,t5_2qkma

Its because they generally yield more consistent results. That and HMDs are just better due to even heat distribution. The science behind it is real! uPLAZABOY certainly does not need all this crap to have a good session but a good phunnel bowl a HMD and good shisha will go a long way in making his sessions better.

9327129,0,t1_d8y86fl,Yeah I have. The reviews I believe are getting at the air flow charcoal design being flawed for foil setups plus as I mentioned the biggest difference with wood is the ash but I forgot to specify that they ash more lol. Since they have their triangle peaks on the bottom you only have so little surface area on the bowl which makes them output less heat than traditional coals on a foil setup. This issue shouldnt matter though for you because as you mentioned with HMD you just need overall heat not specifically downward heat. Does that make sense? ,hookah,d8ya5zo,1,t5_2qkma

9788278,0,t1_daizrwx,Regarding the first portion  thats great news Nino!  I do hope you make it a more straight thru design because its already a phunnel design and the central spire is supposed to keep the juices from dropping down as is.  Now Im glad it was thought out but knowing manufacturing intimately the crevices in the neck are just the product of the external design and the result of the mold method you chose to create the bowls with.  Heres imho the true benefit of having the inside hallow and following the external design  as you take puffs to some degree it creates turbulence which helps create more volume of smoke with every puff.  Given that youre welcome to use that as a pitch as well.  You know I love ya and always willing to help towards your success!Regarding the second part  I attribute that to your ingeniously engineered clay material which I already mentioned and gave credit for previously.  Man Im proud of you and only look forward to seeing you improve and make more great products.  Cant wait to see you at the conventions in .

Both use similar amounts of tobacco yet one lasts an hour and half based on trusted members reports here and the other hrs depending on how its packed and whats packed.Increasing too much heat is just scorching the tobacco.  You want the right amount of heat which slightly varies from tobacco brand to tobacco brand and is controlled based on packing method as well as heat management.Edit the right amount of heat is also subjective based on the smoker so Im not omitting that fact I go by whether or not its producing clouds while preserving flavor without burn or ash or being overly hot.,hookah,db377b9,-2,t5_2qkma

Ive used a few MattPear hookahs before and they are wonderful. Unfortunately for me the base is a little too heavy and not as portable as id like them to be but thats personal preference.Im sure the brand has some influence on the price but the build quality and components used are great. Not too mention they make their hookahs in their own respective countries and not in China. Hence the price is slightly higher than some other companies that produce their hookahs in China. Which brings me to the dilemma of the MIG MiniMe. It seems to have everything I would want out of a highend build quality hookah.

Made sure it was a tight enough fit and not too big that it gets stuck or too small that it falls through. Goal is to scrape the stems inside.. Brushed away in both vertical and rotating motions.

11795784,0,t3_6899hg,Its not a great pack. The density of the tobacco looks okay but there should not be an empty ring around the tobacco. It should be evenly filled inside the whole bowl. When you leave spaces the air gets very hot and that part burns quickly which makes it harder for the heat to go through and heat the tobacco evenly. You have to fill the bowl so that it is properly filled and that the top is even with the rim. Use coconut coals only. I would actually pack it a bit fluffier but that density should work just fine,hookah,dgx3bv7,2,t5_2qkma
