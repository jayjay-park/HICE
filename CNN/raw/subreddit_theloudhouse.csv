7696169,0,t3_4kmvnq,TBH this one really wasntt that well written. I dont have anything against downer fics but here it just seemed to purposefully be edgy and dark without a good story.,theloudhouse,d3h063z,3,t5_39wzf
7911683,0,t1_d44gd16,I second this it helps that I usually catch Lunas musical references and that my favorite color is purple. If not for Luna Lori would be my fav from all the tender moments she has despite being the tough oldest sister.,theloudhouse,d45cj8f,1,t5_39wzf

8515836,0,t1_d65ti0h,Reminds of Jason Foxtrot from that comic strip Foxtrot hes only Ten yet they point out hes the only kid in his grade who really teases girls and is convinced they have cooties.,theloudhouse,d661eio,2,t5_39wzf
8898317,0,t3_4zm1o0,ArtIn general I think the character designs on this show are pretty great. I like how simple they seem to appear yet if you notice theres actually quite a lot of detail in them. An example would be shoes. As basic as they may look you can still tell whose belongs to who even the sneakers which are usually generic. Same for the backgrounds which I think successfully contribute to the newspaper comic aesthetic that I love so much about this show. The animation is excellent too very smooth and crisp.FashionI dont have much to say about this actually. I think the standard outfits the kids wear do a good job of giving an idea of their personalities I guess. And I know that its a cartoon thing to make them wear the exact same thing always but imo it only makes sense for Lola Lucy and maybe Lana.If I could change anything though maybe Id slightly alter their outfit every other episode or something. I absolutely love it when theres a change of appearance such as Loris date outfit which uViithree mentioned. It wasnt a huge thing her color scheme wasnt altered too much...  I really believe that we need more of that. Even something as small as Lana wearing a different colored shirt under her overalls or giving the others different outfits they wear at home and outside would make a difference. Honestly tho its not really a huge problem and Im aware that its a cartoon thing but since were talking about fashion here...Anyway Im curious to know what you guys think.

10905134,0,t3_5vlkte,This was an entertaining episode. It was hilarious to watch the houses borders be reconstructed with several unnecessary security measures along with Lisas troublesome habits. Also the LeniDonnie bit of courseThere were two points where I lold although both moments were kind of predictable. One was the part with Lenis sixpiece puzzle and the other was the one where Lana eats the dog food the way Lana delivered the line Mmm what is this? Chipped beef? was perfect to me especially with Lincolns wearisome fourthwall glance.,theloudhouse,de4scbz,2,t5_39wzf
10930318,0,t3_5vszxt,Decent episode not my fave. Not enough Luna. Leni and lori together made me want to see a road trip episodes of them. Also Leni has a watermelon purse and its super cute. Not really into daddy loud as much since they started showing his face. Dont know why I think I miss the mystery of the parents. This episode woulda been better if papa loud learned to not be an ass and keep the new car without being weird about it. ,theloudhouse,de7dvrm,3,t5_39wzf

11591136,0,t1_dg9ri9a,But I love the boatload of super edgy angst fics! sAnywho couldnt have said it better myself. Was expecting this to primarily be a Lincoln and Clyde episode so when the sisters came in to help them out it instantly solidified this episode as best of the week for me. Outside of the predictability of Principal Huggins motives which is par for the course for this show this was pretty much a near perfect episode.Not gonna lie as soon as I saw the Ace Savvy AU cast I fanboyed and shot this to the top. Glad the rest of the episode held up as well.Final rankings for me. Pulp Friction. Fed Up. Kick the Bucket List. Shell Shock  could be switched either way tbh. Party DownId qualify them all as good but some were better than others. Of course Party Down would be last it is a Lori episode after all and Im kidding dont hurt me please.,theloudhouse,dg9v3cb,5,t5_39wzf
