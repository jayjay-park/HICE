That said there were some things on the security track that I couldnt do at the time with the virtual gear  mostly licenses for things like antivriusSPAM.  I should have just read about them but it was fun.  The lower end SRXs like the  go fairly cheap on ebay.  Personally I think I will be able to do the JNCIEENTSP on just virtual gear. As for the license it is  days of use.  Then just spin up a new VM and repeat.  Not much to it just dont look for support D ,jncis,cye7aeg,2,t5_3b4ar
