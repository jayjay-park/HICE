Most days its actually a about the same as Shanghai some times hotter but the humidity is always higher.The weather is what people call Continental REALLY hot in summer and then kind of cold in winter. It should be about  in September.Its been between  and  degrees for eight weeks now here.And the infrastructure is not planned badly.. Its built bad. Stuff thats two years old looks ... Well and I mean the Metro is just not as good.,chongqing,d5sqixr,1,t5_2t6yt
