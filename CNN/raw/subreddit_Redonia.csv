2794791,0,t1_cnbv2e4,What about if actual acts of that god like genuine war or genuine love contribute to their power while forced ones detract from it. Like the god of war would grow powerful as a war took place he didnt use his power to start but if he needed a war between two peoples his power would weaken as it went on since he directly intervened. A god of love would be strengthened when two people fell in love but weaken when he had to force two people to love each other.,Redonia,cnlr9t4,1,t5_35hau
