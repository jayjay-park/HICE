1672,0,t1_ceej88t,Well you see I always exercised this theory. When they brought in his super leap I justified it by saying that he can swim at extreme speed where the density of water makes it much harder to move movement on land should be really easy and his reactions would be much faster as well as strength through momentum. Basically what I mean is that if you think about how much effort you put into bouncing off a wall in a swimming pool and how much harder it is to push off in relation to jumping or pushing off onland super leaping is really easy to understand. So to reverse the logic there by considering the logic in which super leaping was created he most definitely does have super speed swimming and it is extremely fast.Also the artwork of Aquaman and the Atlanteans movement through water tend to lend the impression that they are moving at humanly impossible speed add on to the fact that there is an issue the precise one Im unsure of where the guards briefly discuss how it is that he can go faster then them which means that Aquaman is a far superior swimmer than even the Atlantean soldiers.For a more scientific look I also found this on Comic Vine,DCcomics,ceemn7g,3,t5_2qlmm

I was instantly addicted to the DC multiverse and the Elseworlds titles. So this will always hold a special spot with me as my favorite.Next would be my favorite Batman title would be either Hush Dark Knight Returns or Arkham Asylum though that one takes a lot of interpretationAnd as far as one shots I can not recommend Kingdom Come highly enough.

68473,0,t3_1uox9h,I dont dislike Marvel and their characters but there are reasons I dont connect as much. When it comes down to it all of DCs properties can exist on their own. They dont require other heroes to complete their stories and mythos. Marvel was designed with being a shared universe in mind. Because of this some of their characters just come off halfformed to me. Take Captain America for example. His day saving at this point is contextualized through SHIELD and the Avengers. unlike Batman or Superman who go out and find problems to solve Cap has to be given his fights by someone else. Of Marvels franchises Spiderman The Xmen as a whole and Fantastic Four are the only ones Id really consider whole in a comparable manner. The others constantly lean on each other in a manner that often is just DEM. Marvels rabid fanbase can be extremely annoying. Probably the most annoying thing is the almost wordforword regurgitation of opinions. Its like Marvel hands out a pamphlet of vague emotionally appealing soundbites to say when someone asks why you like their characters. And these opinions must be built in contrast to DC characters because you cant just like a character apparently you have to like them at the detriment of another. I also dont like the overstatement of Stan Lees talent and impact.,DCcomics,cem840l,1,t5_2qlmm

438404,0,t3_1z3o47,Um it may seem a bit obvious but sales numbers. It is why they have so many bat family books. Even bad Bat family books are well above the cancellation point just because of their association of Batman. Geoff Johns Aquaman run was out selling Flash so now they are going to see if the sales of that title will be able to sustain a second one. Though Aquaman sales have dipped since Geoff left the title so probably a bit late in a spin off title and would have been better when he was on his peak. Also as you said Cyborg doesnt even have one yet Shazam will be joining the team and doesnt have one yet only other one WW has is SupermanWonder Woman so it isnt like she is carrying the title on her shoulders lone and has one of DCs big two in there with her. Then Hal only has Green Lantern because each Lantern book has a different Earth Lantern as the main character now.

But a black kid can choose black players or black comic book characters to look up to and thats perfectly fine? Lets even relate it to this post. If some white kid proposed his dream team of superheroes and stipulated that one of the determining factors was the fact that they were all white do you think that would go over well with someone like you?

523987,0,t1_cfzldkw,Not to mention that considering in the DC Universe New York City still exists that tiny little area is crazy dense.These estimates and information are all based on preNew  information.NYC has about ten million people.  Metropolis has about eleven million and Gotham about ten million.  I cant find any official population figures right now for Bldhaven although yes I know at this point the population is theoretically zerospoiler so lets be conservative and say two million people.  According to this map those cities are all literally next to each other.  Theyre so close that theres realistically no room for sprawl that doesnt touch.  So that would be a Megalopolis of about  people.  So in that area sits approximately twice the population of Shanghai the worlds most populous city.Thats around ten percent of the US population assuming this map is correct.Which its not.Multiple times throughout DC history it is strongly implied that Gotham and Metropolis are reasonably far apart.  Far enough that Bruce has to fly to get to metropolis in Hush IIRC.  Plus if all those cities were that close together Batman and Nightwing would have been out of a job.  I mean who is going to stand for Batman as the local hero when Superman is literally right there?  Dont get me wrong I love Bats but the average Gotham citizen would probably prefer Superman.Personally Ive always thought of Metropolis as being a bit further down the coast being a major coastal city in Jersey and GothamBldhaven as being further North maybe on the south side of Massachusetts.  ,DCcomics,cfztzyq,5,t5_2qlmm

MMs telepathy causes tension between him and the rest of the league who at that stage are still keeping their identities secret from one another.  This and another incident that is possibly due to his treatment of a foe or possibly a difference in their morals escalates into a fight after which MM is cast out of the justice league in a NO YOUR FIRED moment.  MM views the League as good but naive and also thinks that they are too autonomous from control who watches the watchmen.

Obviously these books arent in continuity any more and theres some minor ties to Infinite Crisis that might trip you up but if you like Superman and Batman and Superman and Batman together these have that. Recently released in some nice Absolute and compendium editions too.A oftoverlooked gem is Dave Gibbons and Steve Rudes Worlds Finest threepart series. This is also available in trade.

818864,0,t1_cgxbwct,Ill be honest with you I havent read any of Green Lantern New Guardians yet. However the general conclusion seems to be that all the Green Lantern books have declined in quality since Geoff Johns finished up his run in Green Lantern  New. Red Lanterns has been a fan favourite since issue  when Charles Soule took over. Batman is widely considered to be one of if not the best title DC is putting out at the moment. Batman and Robin hasnt been as good but it has had its moments. The Robin in question is Damian Wayne so you may want to start with Grant Morrisons run on Batman before touching the New  stuff.IN CONCLUSION Read Geoff Johns run on Green Lantern first and if you want Kyle stories read Green Lantern Corps beside it. It is all available in trades. Red Lanterns is a title spun out of Johns run on Green Lantern.Batman and Robin focuses on Damian Wayne so if you dont know anything about him you could go back to Grant Morrisons run. If you cant be bothered hes Batmans son. Make sure you know who the other members are AKA Nightwing Batgirl Red Hood and Red Robin.The New Batman is fantastic and you should read it anyways. ,DCcomics,cgxcvjz,3,t5_2qlmm
822182,0,t1_cgxotjy,Selina Kyle needs a feminine perspective. Ive met a lot of female readers who are really turned off by the New s over sexualization and the focus on body over mind. Why do you think Oracle and Batwoman are such good and well written characters? They remove that oversexed factor. Empowering women is a great thing. Sexually liberating women is a great thing. However when rape becomes a stock origin story or a stock comic book plot device and when the focus becomes about looks instead of characterization youre bastardizing your characters and alienating entire demographics within your readership. Is it wrong to have Selina Kyle showing cleavage and halfnaked all the time? No because thats her character. Is it wrong to show Starfire sleeping with multiple men and forgetting their names? Yes and no matter how the writer tried to control the damage later the fact of the matter was that they believed at one point for that to be acceptable. As a husband and a father I want my kids to grow up reading smart empowered women who are valued for more than physical attributes and I honestly believe that given Selina Kyles disposition and her attitude that a male writer can more easily cross the line between playful sexual manipulation and sexual promiscuityby a universal standard. ,DCcomics,cgxqfk0,-3,t5_2qlmm

It is currently one of my favorites. Especially how it is weekly since i usually forget alot of main events after a month. BatmanSuperman  New arc right? Im intrigued as this series has been quite good but I know nothing of it. Detective Comics  Manupal and Buccelato.  had a good set up and Im expecting it will be great. Cant wait. Green Lantern  I need to catch up on this series. I stopped to read supergirl and I keep forgetting to catch up. Will try to do that this weekend. Justice League   Still stockpiling this. Will get around to reading it soon. Futures End  I know absolutely nothing about this book so I will give it a go.This is going to make for a good weekend.,DCcomics,chb0fkp,2,t5_2qlmm

939438,0,t1_chb1zrv,The thing to keep in mind is the Wally that you like came about because of a reboot essentially and the Wally before crisis in Infinite Earths was nothing like the Wally that you know and good chance if you started from Wallys very first appearance and on you would not like the original version as the current New  one. But through several amazing stories through the years the character changed because of events he went through that made him into the character we love today. So I like it when a writer starts with a flawed version of the character because it makes for some interesting stories as we see the personal growth.,DCcomics,chb2isg,1,t5_2qlmm

I wouldnt call it just acceptance though.The women of Themyscira are isolationist.  Wonder Woman breaks though that philosophy.  If Superman is there to show us we can do better and Batman is about unwavering devotion to what is right Wonder Woman is about responsibility and true strength.  That we have a responsibility to work together and be involved in the world.  To gave that despite or own weaknesses requires true strength.

948872,0,t1_chc4ocj,No I honestly didnt approach this as someone who read the wiki and decided on the spot that it was sexist. As a product of the times I imagine some would see it as bold even audacious. Im not even gonna delve into Marstons personal business. Theres plenty of speculation about his tripod marriage and his predilection for domsub games but lets treat that as outside the realm of the character. The character is a warrior princess of an all female society tasked with keeping the forces of evil from overrunning the World of Man. She does this with a little golden age punchup so I suppose you could view it as empowering that a female character takes on bad guys in hand to hand combat. But its kitten with a whip sexuality. Shes empowered as a sexual being by being dominant. Still to get there she must first be castigated and tied up and we get panels of thought balloons filled with Gasp..sob..oh no! writing. Its not a woman being related to as equal or even superior to men but treated as an object. Her strength is in accepting a submissive role and then working her way to dominance. It is entirely prurient. The idea that her having emotions or weaknesses making her feminine or empowered doesnt really cut her away from the golden age pack. Its pretty clear that if Supes has no moments of self doubt hes so overpowered you cant create a credible threat. I suppose one could make the argument that a female character expressing any sexual identity could be viewed as empowering given the era but its still just tits and ass on display followed by forced sexualized bondage with a triumphant dominant tone to end the crisis. ,DCcomics,chc57er,5,t5_2qlmm

He has a visual style and distinct tone he captures with his movies that just work.For me Ive been waiting since  for his At the Mountains of Madness movie and every new thing he talks about pushes that further and further away from me.

Arsenal leads the Young Adult Titans name simply being a jab at the Teen Titans somewhat silly name. It would eventually become Young Justice.With Vibe Arsenal Bart Allen now back from the future farther into his life Wally is a TT and Ted Kord funding but leading into his new role as a hero. It would be wonderful wisecracking action.It would focus on the group becoming this threeway bromance with Kord kinda in the background. The arc Im thinking of is Booster kidnapping Ted and the Young Justice finding him. Arsenal would say something like Let go of Ted and Booster would simply go Opps wrong Blue Beetle sorry pal. They would go and find Jaime Reyes in the future with Booster. They would see that he eventually takes over humanity. They save humanity. Reyes is dead in the future. Kord is inspired to become Blue Beetle and then goes on whimsical time traveling adventures with Booster Gold. Reyes is still alive in the past though so he doesnt die yet.

1108291,0,t1_chu8o2v,For Blackest Night you can get by with just Blackest Night  and the Green Lantern issues. You can skip the Green Lantern Corps issues for that event.For Brightest Day you can just read the Green Lantern issues and skip all the rest. You dont even need to read Brightest Day .I would read everything on that list for Sinestro Corps War War of the Green Lanterns and Aftermath including the list in the last bulletin I posted. Since Emerald Warriors and Green Lantern Corps are both required for the War of the Green Lanterns youll want to read Emerald Warriors  and Green Lantern Corps  before starting New  Green Lantern to wrap up whats going on with John and Guy. And when you do start the New  try to pick up the first volume of Red Lanterns and New Guardians and continue on if you like them. Green Lantern Corps New  was the weakest of the bunch and didnt really add anything but the events in New Guardians and Red Lanterns are still being brought up in the current issues. Once you wrap up Johns run on GL with  New  GL pick up Sinestro. Sinestro just started and only has two issues out so far. Hope this helps and if you have any other questions just ask.,DCcomics,chu9qsn,2,t5_2qlmm

There were parts of it that were great parts that were good parts that were average and some parts that were just plain old bad... At the end of everything the crossover as a whole feels pretty inconsequential but it was a fun ride while it lasted. And maybe in an industry thats full of a neverending barrage of stories that will change everything forever thats good enough.    Edit Also you can find my reviews of individual issues here.

You can clearly see that the majority of the city is completely intact when Zod and Superman take to the air. Aside from that he saved the entire planethuman race from being destroyed I think that warrants a statue. Think about it the people of Earth know the story as alien lives among them gets called back to his people the alien goes peacefully to which the main alien general seemingly double crosses and decides to destroy the planet Kalel stops him. Also Im sure Lois wrote an article saying how hes been saving people for years. If someone with god like powers came down and saved the planet people would start to worship him like a god there will be naysayers sure but the majority of people will probably view him as the worlds savior. We also dont know how soon this sequel takes place I mean this could be a year or two down the line for all we know and Superman has really become a public figure. ,DCcomics,ci4sf8t,1,t5_2qlmm

Also dont forget that preproduction elements had been in place for all of Evans movies as Cap years in advance. This is a schedule being put together on the fly  as McWeeny noted preproduction is so far behind on Shazam being so soon after BvS nothings been officially cast no director etc. I think it should be noted that Drew does not say it would be impossible. Hes saying that this is a more ambitious schedule than Marvel has planned and Marvel has been planning this out meticulously at least since IM and that should leave doubt as to either the accuracy of the reporting or their ability to pull this off well. I want them to do well trust me. Id love to see a great JL movie I was into DC well before I read Marvel.

Unlike TASM who utilized a similar strategy when they filming we saw the suit outside the next day. So many are asking why would they put out publicity shots this early? Its not a lot to go on.

1407387,0,t3_2a96de,Most of the people Ive seen complain about either too many people in the movie or Batfleck are DC fans. Ive got no problem with either. However TONS of people talk about Nolan even Marvel fans its widely considered some of the best movies of the s so its not exactly forgotten as you claim. And yes some Marvel characters are based on DC characters but its a vice versa. It happens. A lot. But the simple fact is in terms of a unified universe DC has so far dropped the ball. That may be changing but up until now its all been solo movies which are good but people are comparing them due to the unified universes. Not a lot of people actually hate DC they hate recent choices with writers and creative teams. Theyre not hated but youre only noticing the bad that people mention.  Just relax and enjoy DC or Marvelor both like a lot of fans. Also both companies oversexualize women but DC is in my mind at the moment because I just saw a preview for the new teen titans and wonder girls boobs are huge and shes constantly flaunting them as a teen.

Im at the point now where Im cutting Marvel books regularly. This is just my opinion but I dont really feel like current Marvel floppies are very good quality both the paper and a lot of the art feels rushed. On the other hand most of the DC books I read feel better and look better Im not sure Marvel has anything as good as Detective Comics is right now with Manapul and Buccellato.

1578542,0,t1_cje22r3,Then I would recommend you not watch them. Because frankly its better to have variety. Marvel has the funsilly child friendly tone with humor and it works for them. However personally for me and other fans of the DCCU we prefer a more serious superhero story that has a realistic tone to it. I dont think movies such as flash will be darkserious however a movie about Batman vs superman should most definitely be somewhat dark as should all batman movies in my personal opinion.But this is the beauty of the comic cinematic universe at the moment is that you dont have to be forced into watching a specific genre that you dont like. Having DC be like marvel would lose them their fanbase including me as im not entirely interested in watching a child friendly batman vs superman with humorous tones. ,DCcomics,cje5cjy,0,t5_2qlmm

I have not heard much about Waids work on it aside from Tower of Babel but I must say I feel like I have enjoyed his work on the title much more than Grants. Dont get me wrong Crisis Times Five World War Three amp anything involving Prometheus was amazing. I guess sometimes I would just like a to read a Grant story like Batman amp Son where it is based a little more in reality and less about time and the th dimension among other things. Granted I have read a vast amount of Grants work in a little under  months or so I may just be getting a little spent on his style for the time being.

1808931,0,t3_2eyk7g,Top . Dick Grayson  He is just awesome.  He is pretty much Batman but emotionally put together.. Lex Luthor  Lex is one of the most devious villains in comics.  Anytime he talks he seems to always play everyone involved for fools.. Clark Kent  A god from another planet who just wants to help others and fit in with humans. A mythical being with the heart of a farmboy.  Oddly relateable once you get passed the invincibility stuff.. Damian Wayne   A petulant ass who is so fun to read.. Barbara Gordon  Her inner monologue is the best.Honorable Mentions Talia Alghul  If I had not read Batman Incorporated I probably would have included her.  Her relationship with Bruce I thought was extremely interesting but after Batman Inc. Morrison did a good job of making me hate the woman.  Not a criticism against Morrison he made me want to dislike her. Kara ZorEl  I had trouble picking between her and Barbara.  Kara is sometimes more interesting than Clark.Hate List. Amanda Waller  I have hated her in every incarnation ever.  It is not the actresses that portray her because I honestly think they nail the portrayal but I hate everything about the character.  If she wins anything I am not be happy. When Lex or the Joker win I sometimes get a little gleeful.. Firestorm  No particular reason but I always lamented every time the character has appeared when I am reading.. Hawkman  Probably biased due to the Justice League show.  Get Hawkgirl and John Stewart together in the comics and I will be so happy.. Kryb  I just felt very uncomfortable reading that storyline.  Probably the intention but I was happy when it was over.. Steve Trevor  Not hate but I do not get him.  I do not see how he helps the story.  He almost seems like a narrative obstacle for Wonder Woman just for the sake of having a narrative obstacle.

1904124,0,t3_2ge33x,I disagree he talks about wanting better representation of groups other than Caucasian however to hire someone based on the color of their skin is a terrible thing. It is to say we dont care if youre good if youre talented if youre hardworking you fill our minority quota and its enough for us.We need new people who are good authors we need not care about what creed race gender they are but if they can take us on a journey with the characters.Equal representation is a pipe dream in any industry because when the populace itself isnt equal in numbers its hardly likely without quotas to get equal representation.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.Who you know of course helps thats why college puts such emphasis on networking you need to make friends who can help you display your talent later.  Its unfortunate to say but no one has the time to read through every submission so when you have a friend recommend it it helps.On somewhat of an unrelated note his anecdote on feminism seems irrelevant and pandering trying to get people to side with him it really doesnt have much to do with comics why bring it up. His paragraph on racism was irritating its racist to say that you arent able to be racist because some group lacks something others have and when you put up barriers like that and give someone else power you are making yourself a professional victim rather than fixing a problem. ,DCcomics,ckimvsj,2,t5_2qlmm

Kate has been displayed as a hyper competent fighter and hero but in the most recent issue she lost her mask twice to joke villains. He broke up an engaged couple because of a homophobe all while treating it like some noble sacrifice where it really has all tons of unfortunate implications.

Give an entire comic line an M rating because you wanted to use a swear word once? Its not something thats necessary. I personally think its a stupid rule but it still stands on it.

Then you have the bottom line in all of this This a persons job and if you dont have good stories then people wont read your stuff which means you might be out of a job. Its not as black and white as you guys think it is its all grey.Lois is an excellent journalist she exposed the Superman story because as a public figure people deserve to know that this isnt the original Superman and its not like she exposed that he was Billy Batson either.The Red Robin story is more tricky its not an invasion of privacy as you put it because Red Robin was a public figure if she says this guy is Red Robin without giving up his actual identity as Tim Drake shes fully within her rights.

I also realize that Peter is more emotional of a superhero than others and has to deal with being a teenager etc. However the more emotional scenes seemed quite forced and featured a lot of overacting.

1981108,0,t1_ckrvt43,Good point with the rights to the Dark Universe stuff. Youre probably right so that means all the JL Dark Animal Man Swamp Thing plus other associated JL Dark characters will be on NBC. The only thing I found surprising is that NBC didnt also get the rights to Lucifer. Anyways Zatanna on the CW is probably out of the question because of the rights but I would like to see a Zatanna show be made at some point. As for a show with a female lead on the CW there could always be a Birds of Prey show set up. With the right writers and the right source material to pull from it would be awesome.Its not completely impossible for there to be aliens or cosmic characters showing up but going into space is highly unlikely. Itd be great to see an antihero show. Personally I would prefer a Deathstroke series or miniseries but Lobo would be pretty sweet too. If anything its safe to say that the CW will eventually expand the number of DC shows. Maybe if they get the rights to use Blue Beetle and Booster Gold then there could be a spinoff of that. Another strong possibility could be a Suicide Squad spinoff. Overall Im just hoping CW can expand the number of DC shows while still keeping the high quality writing.,DCcomics,ckrxad7,1,t5_2qlmm

1996979,0,t1_cktqxm1,Just as a general recommendation especially since youre not an artist go to your prospective tattoo artist with an idea of what you want the reference pictures you linked here and a general description like the one you gave us plus the antilife equation should be sufficient and hopefully the artist will be enthusiastic about drawing something up for you. He or she should have a pretty good idea of what will work on skin and especially what will work on your skin tone specifically and its likely that what you picture in your head going in will not be what you and your artist end up with. That doesnt mean that you should settle for something you dont want. Never settle. Just be open minded and if the artist youre consulting doesnt seem enthusiastic about your idea or they dont seem to have any original perspective you should probably keep looking elsewhere. My first tattoo turned out great and I attribute that largely to the artists enthusiasm and creativity throughout the process. I am also not an artist.

2065884,0,t1_cl2eyc6,Yeah but none of them are metahumans. The real reason is that literally every single GL story ever told has been written and read exclusively by humans and it happened over time. At first there was Hal then there was a time that Hal was busy so The Guardians sent a ring to find someone to save the day in his place. That was Guy Gardner. Then the same thing happened and the ring chose John Stewart. Then in the s when Hal went evil Ganthet thought in the past humans have kicked ass and then he went to Earth and just gave a ring to the first person he met a young artist named Kyle Rayner that was just coming out of the back door of a San Francisco club with his girlfriend. Then just two years ago Hal and Sinestro died and were sucked into the Book of Death and the ring then chose Simon Baz.So its important to remember that while writers might write rules for The Guardians its not The Guardians who create new Lanterns its the writers too. ,DCcomics,cl2f45n,1,t5_2qlmm

2123874,0,t1_cl9s5dg,I have no hard feelings over it. Like I said I woke up and read that comment and said Oh... well damn. That was a kick to the head! I really did appreciate the data you provided and have worked on it since. I still feel like my writing style isnt as focused as Id like it to be but hey... we write to get better. Ive been mindful of trying to write reviews that are less like a quick synopsis you can find on a publishers website.I believe it when you say youve gotten harsher criticism. It takes thick skin and the ability to try and root out the actual information being said in those harsh messages to make it into a positive. That does bring up another aspect of this I feel goes unseen in all of this. Mods probably get a lot of hate for doing what they think is best for the community. For that I really respect what you guys do. Plus you guys do fun community driven events like the weekly Jeopardy over at rcomicbooks. So brownies all around for everyone.And I appreciate that compliment about my analysis a lot! Thank you. I hope you understand where I am coming from and might have felt that way. Do me a favor though dont change. EDIT Just saw your edit. Thats good to hear. When uWuTiger brought it up I knew I couldnt be the only one thats only seen people say great things about this sub. Hoenstly I completely forgot about the acclaim I had seen over at rcomicbooks in the past until you mentioned it. Its usually near the bottom of the thread when I see it but its there. If uWuTiger feels there are issues its worth discussing to see if theres anything worth making note of and seeing what we can do to improve it. As a frequenter or rdccomics I just want to have a great place for people to come an discuss whatever is on their mind in regards to the comics movies shows etc. Variety is spice to life and you never know what sorts of things you might learn in the most unlikely places. Ive learned plenty of cool things from the comic related subs. Everything from about how the industry works and fun little insider stories I didnt know about to issues that people have with certain topics and how theyre approached in comics. Thats the stuff that drives passion I think. A place people can come together and talk about these topics candidly with all kinds of takes on whats being presented. Thats the stuff we should be facilitating. So when someone says were failing its worth looking into why they feel that way.,DCcomics,cl9shbu,1,t5_2qlmm

I stopped watching cause of other life priorities but Im going to get back into it because I heard its been getting even better.    Flash I didnt get the chance to watch. But my brother doesnt like it. Then again hes a huge Flash fan so he had high expectations. Im still going to check it out once I get the time.    Gotham has a bit of dark feel. I really like that it shows how corrupt Gotham really is. It seems to be focusing a lot on organized crime. Im curious to see how Penguin comes out by the end of season .

2211029,0,t3_2kfnsy,I dont have any hard data and Ill be assuming a lot.  I honestly wont try to predict whether or not comic book stores will die or not.  A lot of factors are in consideration however if only talking about one correlation between digital and print then I dont think theres a lot to worry about. Comics are pretty much a niche market.  People love the stories and characters evidenced by how profitable the movies are but the comic themselves are a vastly insignificant percentage.  However insignificant it is we are a passionate one percent.  The same people will come every week to pick up their books. And for most people reading in print is much preferable to digital and not to mention theres a collecting factor in all of this.  Digital has been killing it in other industries but those industries like newspapers dont have that collecting value. Comic wise going digital is more of a mainstream thing to make it more accessible. But for the hardcore fans form the dawn of time will still be passionate enough to get their books weekly. And DC is finding ways to make print a viable source of profit.  For example the demand for D covers is insane theyve killed it these past two years.  Theres no digital value for those. Again this is the collection factor of it.  People would rather have the art in their hands than on a tablet or PC.But its still a niche.  I dont see it dying people still love to buy comics and hopefully with the movies being so good that people start diving into them more.  But as a niche I dont see it becoming a real big thing either that were gonna start seeing mainstream comic book stores for example.But as I say a lot of this is conjecture.,DCcomics,clkviw7,5,t5_2qlmm

2237358,0,t1_clo3f44,gtGothams also good when you get beyond the idea of Gotham City without a fullblown Batman.This is what made me wary of Gotham at first. Usually the purpose of showing a preBatman Gotham is to demonstrate that the city was so completely and irrevocably fucked up that a psychologically damaged billionaire dressing up like a bat and kicking ass was the best solution. Doing that in a TV show format risks undermining that. If Gordon is too good at his job it means that Batman isnt really necessary after all. But if the bad guys are always winning then it makes for lousy TV. Also if we get a Gotham where no supervillains start showing up before Batman does then that means Batman is drawing out the crazies and making everything worse instead of better. So far Gotham is walking that razors edge pretty well. Gordon is being shown as competent and regularly wins smallish victories but isnt able to effect real change to the way things work in the city. Im really enjoying it so far but I remain wary.,DCcomics,clo8006,9,t5_2qlmm

Kenneth Rockafort yes he draws only uber chicks but still great work. Francis Manapul is a bloody genius. Gregg Capullo has upped his game time and time again with batman Ivan Reis is a boss. Jess Saiz is probably the best swamp thing artist on swamp thing. Mikel Janin great and consistent Pat Gleason Gary Frank JH Williams is the best Ive seen ever in dc his batwoman was increble. Nicola Scott Aaron Kuder man what a great artist made to draw superman  Travel Freeman so sad he drew to little Steve poug was also great Ben Olivers batwing was pretty cool Yannick Paquette This are the guys I think are great artists. ,DCcomics,cn0r653,1,t5_2qlmm

2748862,0,t1_cnfwrds,gtThis is probably a little obvious with the flair but Dick Grayson. He starts out the same as Bruce by seeing his own parents murdered but instead of turning into himself and letting the darkness define him Dick uses it as a motivation to help others by fighting crime without feeling the need to instill fear in his enemies like Batman.I remember this bit from Nightwings New  run.. He saw Bruce visit his  parents graves and have that gigantic paintings of them and Dick asked Alfred if Dick was a dick for not reminiscing the stuff that made him who he is that he moved on and barely looked back which i think led up to the Amusement park story..And that to me really created a massive contrast between Batman and Nightwing. Like they have completely different motivations and drives..Nightwing havent read Grayson yet is definitely my favorite DC character. Because of his way of coping which kinda reflects my own.. Until i read that part with him and Alfred i was split between Batman and Deathstroke.,DCcomics,cngj8gv,3,t5_2qlmm

2803403,0,t1_cnmio69,I find this to be true and further Ill say its been a driving force for me to try and improve my life and try to do more with it.  Because even just being lazy really is a kind of evil when you think about it in this perspective.By living in todays world it inherently makes one evil because we all need to intake resources however minute on an individual level.  Our sustained lives depend on regular the deaths of livestock or at the very least destroying acres of vegetation.  Even vegans need homes electricity warmth things which eventually lead back to some level of environmental impact.  Basically even the most wellmeaning person can try to limit their own footprint to its absolute minimum but even then they are contributing to global overpopulation simply by existing...So we all start out in the karmic red.  Its up to each of us to ensure that we contribute enough legitimate unquestionable good with our lives to at least overcome that and eventually hopefully become a good person and thats before we even begin succumbing to our own personal flaws and weaknesses which will continue to force the act of being a good person into a premeditated choice that one must act on in order to achieve it.,DCcomics,cnmqjpv,3,t5_2qlmm

I was fine with her costume at the start of the New  that covered everything too since that was still in character for her to do. It would make no sense for many women to dress like that but as long as it isnt out of character I dont see the issue. Many women in real life like to dress in a more revealing fashion while some prefer everything to covered. Comic books should reflect all ways of life including those changes in characteristics. I admit not as many men dress as liberally as women in comics but there are many men in real life who dress in revealing clothes but thats a different issue. ,DCcomics,cnn5l4m,3,t5_2qlmm

GL felt like it had more than one story and even those didnt pique the viewers interest. Even the tone was very confused.

Is this arc as good as Azz and Chiang? No but thats probably the best WW Ive read so thats a high bar. I didnt bail on SupermanBatman when Jae Lee left or when he joined for that matter because is Clark looks less like Clark than Finchs Diana who just looks more like her Golden Age self a throwback I can get behind.  Shes not perfect. So Wonder Woman is going to struggle and learn and fail and everything else a protagonist does in a normal story. The viral hatred all seems to be forcing Wonder Woman to be something she isnt. Yes Dianas a feminist icon but thats in real life just like Superman is a capitalist icon in real life. That doesnt mean that Clark Kent should get really into branding. I really dig this series. The conflict and confusion between being a Queen a God and a member of The Justice League.

3280734,0,t3_2xowpm,Batman chronology has been just weird throughout all of the New  from trying to cram almost all of his preNew  history into the  year timeline of the New  and now the very confusing interaction of the three Bat books you mention.  My personal take on it all is to stick Batman and Robin so far all before Batman Eternal and that what Damian is up to will be addressed soon in Batman and Robin or in the forthcoming new monthly Robin Son of Batman.  I like to speculate that him getting his own solo book will address his absence in both Batman and Batman Eternal.And as others have mentioned sometimes you have to just stop fretting over timelines and continuity and just enjoy the books.,DCcomics,cp28ay7,1,t5_2qlmm

For their films they are obviously going for noncomic fans for their target audience and they seem to be going for the audience that likes Transformers movies. This is with limited knowledge as weve only seen one film so far. But I think DC is gonna have trouble getting females and getting enough of families to be as successful as Marvel.

3400463,0,t3_2z57lu,I mean I get what youre lampooning but I dont think it is solely the fact that Batgirl is being victimized that people are upset about. As you point out there are a great deal of comic covers where male heroes are in some sort of distress. The thing that makes people uncomfortable is that the cover depicts a clearly terrified woman being put to considerable duress by the perpetrator of her previous sexual assault. Like say what you will about how terrible other heroes have had it I guess but why are people so stoked about an image of an absolutely terrified woman crying as she is held at gunpoint by the man who stripped her naked and photographed her? Sure the Joker is supposed to be terrifying but I dont feel like that is the best excuse really. Why is rdccomics as a whole so completely dismissive of people who might find the image disturbing? Why are people tripping over themselves to make fun of some imaginary army of people calling comic fans cisscum shitlords? I feel like the ones reacting in FAVOR of the cover are reacting to nonexistent criticism at this point and it is sort of frightening how gleeful their appreciation for the controversial cover is frankly. I understand youre making a joke here so I dont mean this as a criticism of you specifically OP.

3427237,0,t1_cpiwilm,I dont think Cavill really made it work though. I think it only seemed okay because his character was so undeveloped. Its not his fault its really the scripts. Hes not great in Immortals or the Tudors which are the only other things Ive seen him in but Im not sure if Daniel Day Lewis could have made those lines work. Why do all the characters just talk about whats happening without actually illustrating it? Because Goyer and Snyder suck at writing. I would say the agency thing is a problem because even without addressing the logical issues of Clarks appearance on earth its very explicit and a big part of the plot that Clark is the only Krypton with free will and can make his own choices. He then doesnt make any choices. He listens to his dad to the point of letting his dad die. He literally just accepts what JorEl tells him about his purpose on earth without formulating or even appearing to think about his own mission and purpose. Hes bizarrely passive and and this is compounded by the fact that he doesnt even seem to go through any character development. ,DCcomics,cpixic5,-3,t5_2qlmm

3433585,0,t1_cpjn0rc,This is what I just replied to someone else withgt Well while I understand that some people dont see it I dont know if thats a reason to say other people are overreacting or seeing something that isnt there.... As a woman who has experienced something similarly bad and who has friends that have experienced the same I definitely see it. The way hes holding her how helpless she seems and the feartears in her eyes plus the context of the Killing Joke and the knowledge of what Joker has done to her previously it all lends to the rapey vibe. When I look at her face I see the terror I once felt.gt However my feelings about the whole thing are that it is art for a story that is being told and that the point of the Joker is to instill feardiscomfort. So while I am uncomfortable with the cover I dont think it should be censored even if it seems somewhat to be for shock value.There are multiple issues here but the main one as you can gauge from my quote above is that the cover gives off a rapey vibe and has made many people in the comics community uncomfortable for a variety of reasons a that it seems like its being done unnecessarily for shock value it being the exploitation of rape or the fear of rape b Barbaras reaction to it seems out of line with how she would behave and c its bad writing because shes finally moved past this only for DC to throw her right back into the bad place she was before. You also have to remember that DC is trying to target a female demo with the recent Batgirl writing and so its probably not the smartest move to make something look rapey whether or not they have the right to in a philosophical sense to a community who has been conditioned to fear of sexual violence. ,DCcomics,cpjnkmn,6,t5_2qlmm

While he clearly doesnt like it he also doesnt get so pompous as to assume they have other options and even seems on relatively friendly terms with some of the girls offering one who had tried to help before a job with some people who need receptionists aka Wayne Industries. Later in the run after stopping a wanna be villain he sees a homeless man and gives him some cash later a plot point but still. Bruce not only wants to make these big changes but he also has the connection and understanding of some of the lower levels of the city and that you cant just punch or throw money at every problem to fix it.,DCcomics,cpvar86,2,t5_2qlmm

Maybe the US governmentUN convinces Superman to interfere in countries with dictators?

Half the movie was just teasing plus is future movies and making comic references.  Personally I loved them but I still couldnt help but feel like I had just watched a  hour trailer for phase  with some explosions thrown in.

Like they know what they are in a nonderogatory way. Now there are some who would try to start something.

3876694,0,t3_34ug6e,Sure it makes sense that could happen I kind of hope not though personally. I mean the universe they seem to be going for in this Man of Steel world seems to be aiming for as grounded as you can get with aliens flying around etc. Superman gets a costume because it seems to be a traditional Kryption wear hence the ship just making him one when he pops the command key in Batmans a billionaire so would invest in some decent and suitable armour for crime fighting Wonder Woman is from an island of warriors so she gets a some Amazonian battlewear. But when you come on to a lot of these Squad members theyre just people.Take Harley psychiatrist turned crazyfangirl in this grounded world they seem to be going for why would she have a full specially tailored outfit that at least visually looks you cant just buy in a store? Itd be the same as me or you going insane and becoming a villain we dont get cool costumes. Maybe Im over thinking and holding them too close to a grounded world they set out with.I kind of like the put together look of them all personally fits the world!

3966645,0,t1_cr8f710,That was mentioned previously by various sources but I cant get an actual official source. If you watch the trailer its pretty obvious that Superman exists in the Supergirl world but theres been no mention of him in Arrow or Flash and youd think thatd be sort of an important thing. Like... Hey has anything changed in the world since Ive been gone aside from touch screen phones? Oh yeah so theres this guy named SUPERMAN who can fly move around really fast shoot lasers from his eyes and is invulnerable. He saves people.Or...You cant be a hero Ollie  youre not Superman!Or...Flash...youre just as fast as Superman! Maybe even faster! You KNOW Cisco would have mentioned something about that.So if Supergirl is in the same universe thats a pretty gaping plot hole in my opinion. Superman is too important a character for the world to conveniently forget especially the characters in Arrow and Flash who are involved with the same sort of work. Like wouldnt Iris have looked into Lois Lanes reports on Superman and Jimmys sorry James photos of him when she was all interested in the StreakFlash and the other metahumans? Its easy enough to explain the absence of direct references to Batman by saying hes still just an urban legend. But Supergirl pretty explicitly showed that people know Superman so... why not in Arrow and Flash? They havent mentioned Gotham OR Metropolis but they have introduced Batman villains mentioned Wayne Tech etc. Supermans only real reference is that Man of Steel line by Wells which implies Superman arrives sometime in the future.Unless Supergirl is set in the future of the Arrowverse where Superman HAS appeared and now she is as well which would also mean the only crossovers could be time travel events and would be harder to do its not the same universe...,DCcomics,cr8fjjy,15,t5_2qlmm

Wonder Woman is explicitly stated to be Nubia Dianas twin made from darker clay from the precrisis era when comics could get away with shit like that and John Stewart is the primary Green Lantern.  Although there is a race swapped Zatanna the current theory is she is actually Conjura who is basically to Zatanna what Nubia is to Wonder Woman. Of course Bruce Wayne is still white still Batman or is he?gt If you havent picked up on the social commentary on the comic book industry yet go reread Multiversity  until you do NO DONT THAT IS WHAT THE GENTRY WANTS MORE DOORS INTO OUR WORLD. STOPIt should be noted that the Earth Bruce Wayne is never referred to as Batman on panel nor is he even referred to as Bruce Wayne he is just the Justice Leagues token white. On the official map of the multiverse entry for Earth  Batman is not even mentioned as one of the Earths heroes. Diana Hal and Zatanna have been superseded in popularity by their black counterparts why would Batman be any different.

The rumors about it ending are due to sites link baiting by titling articles DC ending New  and people not bothering to read the article to see they said DC is ending putting New  on their books since the name doesnt fit anymore. Batman Green lantern etc ended with major changes and when Convergence ends the books will be exploring those major changes. Supergirl will return around time of her show. Her sales have declined over time in New  but s sell and people will buy just because of the show so they will wait for the TV hype to build up and launch a number a new  and double the sales than if they just kept the numbering the same and continued.,DCcomics,crdney8,3,t5_2qlmm

The  for New Guardians is a team up of Kyle Rayner and Carol Ferris and is somewhere in between the GL  and the Corps  in terms of importance.

4039542,0,t3_36ruhi,The show is kind off based on the New  Barry Allen. In the New  Nora Allen was murdered when Barry was a child and his father sits on death row wrongfully accused of the murder. Barry grew up with police captain David Frye whose character they changed to Joe West most likely to have Iris have a relationship with the other characters in the show. Iris and her two brothers dad was an alcoholic and an abusive father which in turn caused the youngest brother Daniel to run from home and later become a criminal.The rogues are similar to how they are depicted in the show. Captain Cold is the usual leader with his stolen cold gun. Generally his and Heatwaves personalities in the TVshow are close to their comic book version.Golden Glider is probably the rogue who is most different in the show from the comics. In the comic books she usually acts as Colds conscience. Originally she was a former Olympic figure skater and had some special ice skates that formed ice underneath her which she skated on. In the New  she became a metahuman though they are not called that in the comic books through an experiment by Cold which fused all rogues Captain Cold Heatwave Mirror Master Weather Wizard and Golden Glider with their weapons. Since she didnt have a weapon she fell into a coma and became able to create astral projections of herself which she could make tangible for short periods of time.Weather Wizard is similar in the way that his brother died but in the comics they are latinos with his brother named Claudio instead of Clyde. Originally his brother Claudio invents a weather rod to control the weather which is why he got the name Weather Wizard since it looks like a wizards wand which Mark steals. In the New  Mark has fused with his weapon due to Colds experiment which causes him to become quite bipolar since the weather he creates affects his mood for example making it rain makes him feel depressed.Pied Piper usually uses a flute as a weapon and can use it to control rats or send out sonic shockwave attacks. He is not a physicist but a musical director in the comics. In the New  he has left the rogues since he started dating police captain Singh.Gorilla Grodd comes from an advanced civilisation of intelligent gorillas in a hidden African nation called Gorilla City. He is usually trying to claim leadership from his rival Solovar who is a peaceful leader. There is a lot of backstory with the gorillas but the big thing is that they can gain memories and skills from people by eating their brains and they have a religious connection to the speed force and speedsters. Grood usually tries to kill the Flash to gain his powers which he feels are his by right and to enslave all humans who he sees as inferior to gorillas. He also really hates bananas.Finally Iris West is the spouse of Barry Allen and Linda Park is the spouse of Wally West Iris nephew the first Kid Flash and the third Flash. ,DCcomics,crgqlck,17,t5_2qlmm

4045627,0,t1_crhchis,Iron Man  was a risk other than that I agree. As for MoS it really isnt a Superman movie. They didnt call it Superman for a reason. The movie is about Clark deciding to become Superman. The focus is on the man he is going to be and him struggling to find his destiny and his path. The repercussions of the battle with Zod along with his relationship with Batman are what I feel will push him into being a true Superman. When you think about it Man of Steel is brilliant in a way. The debate and discussion about whether or not he is a true Superman among the fans is being directly replicated in the movie. Thats always been an aspect of Superman as well. Hes an inspiration to the kids and an idol the adults in the comics just as much as in real life and what well probably have is him winning the public over at the end of the movie which they probably want to translate to the audience accepting him as well. The movie had issues but Im not entirely sure him not being Superman is one of them.,DCcomics,crhfk1y,4,t5_2qlmm

I think they adapted all the characters visually and characteristically really well except Parallax lol but as everyone else said the plotscript was the biggest let down. ,DCcomics,crso74u,8,t5_2qlmm

4368285,0,t1_cshshd4,With a little bit really not much of background knowledge you can start reading Green Lantern with Green Lantern Rebirth. This brings Hal back as a Green Lantern but also gives Guy Gardner a ring again. The upshot is we get all four Earth Lanterns back in active service. You can then essentially read Green Lantern Geoff Johnss run from No Fear the first story arc. The important events in connection with Green Lantern after Rebirth are Sinestro Corps War and Blackest Night but if you really want Green Lantern you can read all of it plus Green Lantern Corps from the same period. In between Sinestro Corps War and Blackest Night lots of it is buildup  background to Blackest Night. Read Green Lantern Secret Origin for Hals retconned origin story which foreshadows a lot of whats to come. Theres older Green Lantern stuff as well and newer and you can find suggestions for that in the sidebar and generally on the Internet if Johns doesnt appeal to you. A lot of people will suggest Azzarellos Wonder Woman which starts with issue  of the New  and runs to . I didnt like it I read the first volume and stopped and wont recommend it but be aware Im very much in the minority here. I like the s Perez reboot but you might find that dated. There are other runs on the character that have been wellreceived off the top of my head Greg Rucka and Gail Simone are supposed to have done good things. If undecided you can always  and in general  buy an issue or two of the ones youre trying to choose between. If its Perez or Azzarello you probably want to start with their first issues to get a feel of things. Other authors you can find suggestions in the sidebar or at rWonderWoman.Theres masses of Superman and Batman and I really havent read enough to give you suggestions. You can get them together in SupermanBatman preNew  or BatmanSuperman New . If youve watched the SupermanBatman animated movies Public Enemies or Apocalypse theyre based on early stories of SupermanBatman. Batman is meant to have been good in the New  I think but theres also a lot of very good older stories. Aquaman is supposed to have been good from the start of the New  I think but I havent read any of it or any from before so I dont know. ,DCcomics,csi1h3a,1,t5_2qlmm
4370649,0,t3_3b2sko,I think the Morrison volumes of action comics are worth owning too so really just skip the aborted Aaron Kuder era and get all but volume .For Superman volume  is alright but after Perez leaves the book it gets kinda shaky. I am personally a pretty big fan of Scott Lobdells work with HEl on Earth and that starts volume  and then I personally think its readable the entire way through to the present since the PSIWar HEl on Earth and DOOMED were all pretty good superman stories. If nothing else check out the most recent volume zinc the JohnsRomita story is same good.All of Batman Superman is wonderful and even if the story werent great it is the art is worth the price of admission all by itself.The Charles Soule era of Superman Wonder Woman also rocks  though the Mahnke era were in now has lost a step its still readable.SPOILERSwhats happening presently to have Superman in the T shirt is that he has recently developed a new power called the Solar Flare which allows him to do like a heat vision bomb. Its extremely powerful but leaves him with a reduced power set for some time after. We dont have  of the information yet as Superman  is supposed to show us that and it doesnt come out til next month we did get shown a sneak peak in free comic book day where the Fortress of Solitude rejects him after the use of a solar flare since without his powers he doesnt register as a kryptonian and his battle armor and cape are stripped away from by the Fortress leaving him just a couple scraps of his cape. During this time there is an incident when he is completely out of powers that he goes to take care of anyway and receives an injury which someone snaps a picture of and ends up on the news. Lois sees him the next day and puts it together and outs Superman as Clark Kent  though it is now being strongly suggested she had motives beyond just wanting to publish the big story.,DCcomics,csib2kg,3,t5_2qlmm
4372682,0,t3_3b39x5,gt     Who are some DC characters that would be worth getting to know?Aquaman The new  volumes  are worth getting. It relaunches the character and builds from there. I cant speak for Aquaman issuestrades beyond this as I havent read any.

4392766,0,t3_3bbyvr,This is the narrative I gather from interviews of WB execs Geoff Johns and Zack Snyder. I wont talk about preGL developments as I dont have enough evidence and frankly back then WB didnt give a shit WB wanted to keep Supes and Bats seperate franchises and not have them in JL or have them in JL down the line I know stupid. Berlanti and co were to start with GL with blessings from Johns and DC Berlanti and Gugenheim worked hard to crack a story and Gugenheim even wrote a screenplay they brought in the director he had other ideas he changed the script drastically but WB liked things from Berlanti and finally WB had to reign in the director to keep him on track and control budget too. GL and Flash were to be the stars of this DCCU At the same time Nolan had the idea for MOS but he was still working on TDKR so he tasked Goyer with screenplay and hired Zack original intent was to keep MOS separate as GL was gonna take care of JL. But Zack wanted his hands on more characters from the beginning he said many times in interviews that Superman was the key to JL without Superman JL is BS. So Zack decided to make a movie which would stand on its own but have enough evidence of a larger world. After the failure of GL it was clear that MOS is the only and perhaps last hope for JL in the foreseeable future. MOS was a hit and it gave Snyder credibility and more people in studio started listening to him Goyer became disinterested more superhero stuff burned out so he started doing Constantine and Sandman development. Nolan really didnt want to stick around as his goal was to make sure MOS was in good hands and was a success. WB is now basically following Zacks intentvision but again with lots collaborators which would take load off him. Another important thing that happened was leadership and structural change at WB previously leadership was divided by medium like TVmovie and digital but now it is Creative Affairs headed by SilvermanMarketing  headed by Kroll and Newline  headed by Emmerichsubcompany which mostly does small comedies or genre films like conjuring and occasional dumb summer movie like San Andreas and above all CEO Kevin Tsujihara. All these things happened after MOS was released circa August . Kevin is to certain extent a fanboy his interviews back when he was midmanager in DVD sales unit in  when he was asked Marvel making so many movies he said DC wont be behind! yeah back then but too bad he wasnt incharge! There is now a an intent of putting their premiere characters at the forefront and less feudalism and also a lot of input is taken from DC like Johns is a exec producer and consultant on all movies and is practically in control of network TV shows specially CW and now CBS Supergirl. But of course it must make sense financially they kinda have a flexible movie schedule and allow TV shows to die if they cant economically be saved. I would like to believe that due to backlash from Snyder and DC that WB resisted the urge to make a JL right after MOS and infact the world building will happen in  movies but mostly in Suicide Squad which ultimately is a good thing.Things are looking more streamlined and much more sane than a Year ago let alone  years ago. It also helps that the most known actors are in the least known DC film property. WB has done a decent job of PR talent gathering crisis management WW director swap and most importantly filling in the long gap via TV Now DC has legitimately  hit shows on  networks and another moderately successful IZombie show but which is a critical smash.,DCcomics,cskstio,47,t5_2qlmm

4447165,0,t3_3bzrok,I think the GLGA comics in particular are a great read for this subject. Even at his most liberal Ollie is a strong believer in the cando American attitude. Another worth looking at is Geoff Johnss Flash run which deals with union and proAmerican made values buy local buy Keystone. Theres a bit of an undercurrent of class struggle in Johns work especially his Rogues work.  Contrast might be his Avengers run Red Zone in particular where the villain uses American resources to further his own agenda and praises the American system for making it possible.I would recommend to a certain degree although Im not sure if its exactly what you need to take a look at Aquaman The Waterbearer for some Atlantean politics in addition to the Peter David run.Superman Man of Steel is required reading since it deals with his acceptance of himself as an American first Kryptonian second.,DCcomics,csr91uk,3,t5_2qlmm

Shit will be a slaughter for him if he does. Hes either using the kryptonite or atmospheric control like in MoS I doubt Batman will use magic. Then in this weakened state Supermans gotta fight a mechaBatman which makes it fairly even. At that point the fight will go anywhere as long as the suit holds together and Superman is still weakened. Also just because Superman has xray vision doesnt mean he cant get suprised by something I could find a source of Superman getting surprised by a trap or something theres undoubtedly a lot of instances of that in the comics.But again nobody is going to die its more likely both will be severely beaten. Superman might be the one standing in the end youre right. But Batman will probably succeed in showing that Superman CAN be beaten that he can be hurt if the world unites to do what he does in that fight.

But I dont get attached to characters based on their gender or sexuality their personalities and story arcs do that and it too often feels like those are taken away from when they diversify characters. Creating new characters seems to be a better option in most cases. That way they wont ruin etablished stuff and their creators can do what they want with the new one without making it seem too forced.

The Kid wanted to sell it to them but they went further and got a CGC grader in to tell him how much the collection was worth. When he kept saying this ones worht a few hundred  or few thousand the kid got emotional i think. It was cool to see so i started collecting since November last year.

4712115,0,t1_ctohpg7,Actually no it doesnt because the writers set out with the intent of growing Wally as a character organically. There were direct promises about their intent with the character that have fell through magnificently. And if your argument for Wally being a terrible character is Its fine Barrys more important. Then thats not an argument. These changes I spoke of would be better for Barry too. Instead of making irrational stupid decisions he does something out of the kindness of his heart rather than projecting his guilt because Iris played up to his orphaning and genuine interest for a diamond in the rough. Its sensible and good for both characters. Its not like it takes up more time for them to show Wally doing something good rather than criminal. Im not comparing Wally to the new Wally by pointing out racist caricatures and the qualities of a weak character with no inherent character qualities that justify his position in the story. Like I said you can divorce him entirely from Pre  Wally and dozens of problems about the characterization and interactions of the characters  are still there. This is a terrible hill for you to die on.Different writers will want to different things you should just let go. How about no? I am perfectly within my rights to criticize this team for a poorly constructed plot and series of characters. And finally we get to the crux. It depends on how they set it up. Remember when I said a character can subvert their core character qualities if the situation calls for it? Thats the problem here. The situation doesnt call for it. Its a mashed together series of mishandled force fed eye roll worthy conversations.I dont know why youre saying my examples dont back up my claims. You literally havent said a thing about my examples. The only thing youve said is that differences show contrast and I pointed out the lack of contrast and that Im hung up on New  Wally not being pre  Wally somewhat true but I went out of my way to show the problems regardless of this hangup. Like I said he  could have an entirely different name and it still makes no sense for them to introduce a new minority character as a racist stereotype nor does it make sense for Barry to take an interest in him nor does it make sense for Iris to try to force him onto Barry. I said all these things and you ignored them.Okay yeah you think its totally okay for Superman to just without reason or a cause through good storytelling to be a brutal sociopath because Thats just his character now deal with it. Like what are you on dude? My entire point is none of the changes theyve made in their new run are justified. Theyre dropped out of the aether and were expected to just go Yep that makes sense. I nearly went to the world limit giving everyone explicit examples of what I was talking about and youre just saying Nope youre wrong and no I dont have to say why. ,DCcomics,ctoi1h5,4,t5_2qlmm

Theres the famous example of the Mad Monk and Dala who he shot pointblank whilst they were sleeping in their coffins They were vampires in case you didnt know. He also hung one of Hugo Stranges Monster Men from a steel rope until he suffocated to death commenting afterwords Hes probably better off that way. Speaking of which he knocked Hugo Strange himself off a cliff to his death in the mid s. This one didnt stick though since Strange eventually returned in the Bronze Age. But he was dead for  years so I count it.He also had this special move where hed kick people in the back of the head while swinging on his batline breaking their necks and killing them. Hes machinegunned people pushed them out windows punched them into vats of acid and watched them melt and crushed a group of stereotypical Asian goons with a giant statue. Needless to say he didnt fuck around. The only reason Batman stopped killing was that the editors feared parents would be repulsed by it and stop their kids from buying the comics. Im not sure but I think a similar thing happened to the pulp magazines which were often bloody and sexual by nature.Batman doesnt kill but The BatMan did.,DCcomics,cttujtk,5,t5_2qlmm

Hell Im even behind in my comics  got a few weeks of DC backlog! Theyre all sitting in the iPad though which at least makes the stack more manageable Truth is theres been a number of things going on in MeatSpace that have been taking my time. Some of these Ive already mentioned but the upshot was that every time I was getting over one thing the next hit. The short list My fiancee and I splitting A bunch of crazy work deadlines and projects Various friends needing me  and it tends to distract someone if youre browsing Reddit while theyre crying  Trips to psych hospitals as a visitor Trips to the hospital as my Dad had a pretty close call.I havent been in a coma and certainly Ive been more around the Mod Mail than I have in public as that seemed more important just lots of things that have eaten into the chilling in front of the computer bloggingrantingshooting the poop about DCIve still lurked a fair bit and hoping Ill be around more now too.

5015531,0,t1_cupjyin,I actually think Tim is the worst Robin not the worst character or anything just hear me out.Dick has a strong arc of progression from Robin to Nightwing to Batman to Agent . His life serves as the archetypal role of Robin he went from sidekick to peer.Jason has his own arc that serves as the opposite from Robin to Red Hood. His life serves as quite possibly the ultimate failure he went from aspiring crime fighter to talented assassin.Damian has the role of Robin that he needed more than any other. He needed to be humbled and it needed to be done by someone not like him. His arc with Dick turned him from a snotty entitled brat to a kid who would give his life to save his family.Tim is the only one who never needed to be Robin. He doesnt fulfil that role the way the others do so I think him being a solo hero in Red Robin from the beginning was actually a good move for his character. ,DCcomics,cuqk87c,1,t5_2qlmm
5019285,0,t1_cuqk87c,Allow me to disagree with you on this.Dick was the first Robin. Hes the one everyone thinks about as Robin. When he left to go be Nightwing and leader of the Titans Jason was basically slotted in. Which is why there was so much Jasonhate in the s. He wasnt Dick Grayson and in many ways he was written as a punk. Damian is Bruces son. And in many ways is the heir apparent to the Batman legacy moreso than Dick or Jason or Tim because hes the one putting himself front and center to step into Bruces role when Bruce dies.But unlike the other  and matched only by Stephanie Tim made himself Robin. Its not that he deduced the identity of Batman and both Robins at . Its not that beat Ras. But he put in the work to be Robin. He stepped into a role that was once filled by arguably the most admired member of the DC hero community  Dick  and the legacy of probably the most tragic  Jason  and he earned the mantle. You are right though. Tim didnt need to be Robin but Bruce needed him to be Robin. When Tim stepped in Bruce was in probably his darkest moment yet. Darker than when Bruce was incarcerated for the murder of Vesper Fairchild or even the death of Damian. PostDeath In The Family Batman was Bruce at his most vicious.And this is where Tim diverges from Stephanie as the two Robins who basically earned the mantle of Robin  Stephanie constantly tries to prove herself worthy of the legacy of Dick Jason and Tim and starts a gang war. Tim doesnt just try to respect the legacy of Dick and Jason but also the legacy of Bruce. During the whole Batman Murderer and Fugitive storylines you see where he not only makes nods to the successes of the Batfamily but also its failures  the death of Jason Todd the shit heaped on Jim Gordon. Of all the Robins hes been the most conscious of what Batman AND Robin means. Dick was the first and carved out the niche. Jason basically joyrode the panties and cape. Stephanie used it as a way to get respect. Damian sees it as Peerage. For Tim Robin wasnt just to check crime in Gotham but a check against Bruce and a repeat of past mistakes.,DCcomics,cur0jqc,3,t5_2qlmm

Now Michael Caine has The Cider House Rules Dark Knight Trilogy which isnt high art necessarily but quality entertainment and various good films under his belt once more and the world is better off for it.

Like hes a museum curatorarchaeologist in his everyday life and hell go to art gallery openings and fancy dinners and operas and then an hour later hell be wearing a hawk cowl and bashing monster heads in with a mace. Its the combination of the Indiana Jones archetype mixed with the Conan archetype that just really do it for me. Also I really love silver age Katar and Shayera in general I love that they came to earth to learn and teach and do research and decided to be super heroes on the side. And I love their relationship they were totally equal partners they were the same police rank and she was every bit as capable and competent as him.

They were put together explicitly to make a rock paper scissors team. They werent characters that needed or organically grew into the Flash universe. They were created because the writers are too shitty to tell a good story within the universe so they have to create this situation for him including these terrible plot devices.

5283756,0,t1_cvmptko,Jay Garrick was the first Flash to be created by what was called National Comics at the time now DC Comics. He was active in the s primarily with his super speed coming from an accident involving the inhalation of heavy water fumes later retconned to be that the fumes activated his metagene. He fought with the Justice Society of AmericaThen in the s after a lot of books had been cancelled after the HUAC witch hunts DC wanted to revive a lot of these older characters for a new generation but with totally new origins. They didnt want the mystery men of the past they wanted more scifi rooted heroes. And so enter Barry Allen Allen would get his powers from a bolt of lighting striking him whilst he was handling a precise combination of chemicals in his crime lab. He was a police forensics scientist. And of course they had him on the JLA the new upgrade to the JSA.But DC didnt want throw the old Golden Age comics and characters away for good. Instead the JSA and the s and s versions of Superman Batman and Wonder Woman were moved to Earth while the s versions of those characters in the JSA  dubbed the Silver Age  would be on Earth. Thus began the DC Multiverse.And the first ever use of the DC Multiverse was with you guessed it The Flash In the story Flash of Two Worlds they established that there was was an Earth and Earth and that Barry Allen had actually been inspired to call himself the Flash because he grew up reading comics about Jay Garrick! Everything Jay did as the Flash existed as a story in the head of a writer on Earth.And after that moment there would a good number of universe crossovers as well as the endless creation of more universes resulting in an infinite multiverse.And then DC said this is getting too confusing continuity is messed up. And they werent wrong either. And so Crisis on Infinite Earths was published in order to delete the bulk of the multiverse and merge the five remaining Earths into one continuity. From  to  there was only one Earth. Though there was also an Antimatter Universe but thats another story. And again DC did not want to get rid of the JSA so instead they made them the mentors of the JLA. Jay was no longer fiction to Barry he was a hero from the s.From  onward the Multiverse did come back in Infinite Crisis but the JSA remained on EarthNew Earth the prime continuity.Then just recently in  the Multiverse rebooted this time completely restarting almost the primary continuity and Earth with the New  relaunch. All the JSA characters as a result were moved back to Earth but with st century origins. The current Jay is now a young lad like Barry.,DCcomics,cvn27nh,6,t5_2qlmm

5343479,1,t3_3o6kgb,Honestly I hate to be the first one to be down on this but do we really need a movie adapted from the overrated comic where the Joker fridged Barbara Gordon? This story popularized a completely unnecessary Joker origin story and it destroyed Batgirl a super competent woman superhero specifically in a plot to hurt her father. I realize that it makes sense from an inuniverse perspective but looking at it externally as we must Killing Joke is a story about treating women as disposable. Hell the best thing to come out of this story is Oracle and she isnt even in it. Alan Moore didnt come up with her!Now apart from the political correctness stuff I still dislike it on the grounds of the Jokers killing joke being neither remotely funny nor psycologically or philosophically interesting.

5807605,0,t1_cxgxtzp,Theyre both really good. As dmull intimated it all really comes down to what youre looking for in a Superman story. I love the more intimate approach taken by Secret Origin and as a huge Gary Frank fan the art is more preferable for me. However Birthright is great in its own right with lots a great set pieces and character work. Secret Origin only slightly edges out Birthright for me but I do prefer what was done character and story wise in the former than the latter.,DCcomics,cxgzlb8,2,t5_2qlmm

5821669,0,t1_cxin4mq,I know this is a stretch but I took a look at them. They are obviously rebels against the regime. The person to Batmans left looks young. This intermediately made me think about Robin OR JOKER...just kidding. But not much really clicked. I guess you could kind of see an R under his maybe her cant really tell jacket but then again that is really a stretch. The dude to Batmans right is bald and more of an adult dude. He seems pretty bulky as well. He reminds me of one of the mutants from TDKR. What I think is that in the main trailer you see people riding on horses. I think that may have been Batman dreaming about him Robin biggest stretch and his mutantrebel friends as a reference to TDKR facing Superman but as seen in the trailer with Bats getting a big beatdown by the Superman followers and then all of them getting imprisoned. Obviously this has some holes in it but this is as much as I could get from this.,DCcomics,cxiqv07,1,t5_2qlmm

However this drawn out secret wars event that has interrupted a few of the story lines i was reading kind of putts me off of Marvel I havent been reading Marvel for to long tbh. In terms of Marvel media ive really enjoyed the Captain America films GoTG and the Netflix shows but thats really it. I think im more drawn to DC because Im just more familiar with it. I grew up on Teen Titans Batman TAS Superman TAS JL JLU the tim burton batman movies even the Nolan films came out when i was in HS. I didnt really get into comic books till the new  reboot because it seemed so overwhelming to try to just jump in. but since then ive done some reading of some of the older stories. Overall I like the dc villains more. I like the more not matureness that ive felt in the DC verse. I like the DCAU more. I love Flash more then ive loved anything marvel tv has put out except daredevil. DC just feels more epic grander more mystical. though ironically two of my favorite heros of all time are captain america and spiderman. but i think as a whole ive liked more of DCs stuff then marvel.,DCcomics,cxttijg,1,t5_2qlmm

5939644,0,t1_cxy4dv1,I really dont think theres anything to worry about at least in the respect of having too many semicentral characters. At the moment it seems there are two major conflicts in the movie. BatmanSuperman and LexSupes. In fact BS could be considered a subconflict if Lex is manipulating Batman to fight Superman. Lexs plot is against Superman. Plan A is Batman. When that fails DDay is Plan B. I doubt we will see Zod alive again as himself. I think it would be a safe bet that Lex engineers Doomsday from Zods corpse. Judging from this interview Id take a guess and say Doomsday was created with the intent to make him a controllable Superman. Id take it a step further and say he has to cut DDays incubation short because his Plan A fell through. Because of this we might see him evolve in stages kind of like Frieza from DBZ.Bottom line even if there is a lot of conflict going on Lex seems to be the puppet master through it all.As for WW I dont think shes going to muddy the plot. She appears to be a strong supporting character. Lots of movies have those. Off the top of my head I think of Inglorious Bastards because I rewatched it recently. That movie has tons of significant characters. Some like Fassbenders character only appeared for a short time. That didnt take away from the movie though and I dont think WW will either.All that is to say I dont think theyre juggling too much for one movie. A lot can happen in a movie. ,DCcomics,cxy7ubr,7,t5_2qlmm

Supergirl is definitely more youthful and I kind of prefer that since I have been drowning in depressing shows for too long also she has been getting lots of attention lately along with JJ.

Hes saying that this is the idea people have of Superman who dont understand Superman and that idea is wrong. Yet the writer is acting like Yang is perpetuating the idea that hes refuting in his statement.    And the tirade about the DNA thing? Jesus fuck get over it. Shit like this is why I stopped watching Linkaras videos. If something that tiny can make you go on for a couple paragraphs about inaccuracy that says more about you than it does about the work.

6111068,0,t1_cyk5dpl,Hes been a bigwig at DC for a long time and in  he became copublisher. A lot of DC comics fans blame him for whats happened to DC over the last six years including but not limited to the whole New  reboot and the erasure of so many preNew  canonical details that a lot of fans held very dear. With regards to Batman specifically Cassie Cain and Stephanie Brown were basically erased from existence though Scott Snyder has been doing his best to bring them back into the fold Barbara was reinstated as Batgirl was previously Oracle which was a much more mature role and some people also blame him for denying Batwoman a happy marriage and eventually running that whole book straight into the fucking ground.Its sometimes hard to say if hes to blame for all of this or if hes just a lightning rod since hes copublisher alongside Jim Lee who many DC fans see as sacred but there definitely seems to be a strong correlation between DiDio and postFlashpoint ridiculousness.,DCcomics,cyk9kxu,12,t5_2qlmm

6142467,0,t1_cynpzt8,I disagree. DC was in a pretty bad place in the early s. Theres a reason there are so few iconic runs from the late s early s. You dont have to like him but Johns was a shot in the arm for the company. He basically saved the Flash and GL franchises did some of the better work with Superman of the decade revitalized Hawkman Teen Titans and JSA and wrote Infinite Crisis probably the defining event of the decade at DC comics. Identity Crisis is a contender but controversial Final Crisis is too selfcontained to have the sweeping impact.Rucka put out some good stuff Brubaker put in some quality work before he jumped ship and  Morrisons Batman run was great but none was as prolific as Johns. The only other creator who was putting out as many quality books at DC in this time frame was probably Gail Simone.

Its best to get everyone excited about it when we get to the episode that leads up to it.I think an Alien hightailed it to Central City and the STAR labs and Flash crew arent equipped to handle aliens so DEO and SG need to step in. In my opinion I think the lead in will start from SG then the crossover will air under the flash title Second hypothesis is that a metahumanbreach creature hightail it to national city so Flash and STAR need to intervene I dont think its likely that the DEO isnt equipped to deal with metahumans so why would they need Flash?

I actually thought the first issue was a cool way for the Flash to use his powers sort of like Waid having Wally play tennis with himself. The pencils are good imo but instead of liking the art a decent amount I actually like it a lot simply because its a rare case of Jim Leeishstyle art with modern digital colouring featuring the Flash. First issue had some splash pages that Ive been wanting to see the like of since I first decided to read Flash comics.

6680460,0,t3_474rnx,Honestly I dont think it could be properly explained with only a  year gap. I hate the short time periods for Batmans history and proteges. The same thing with the New  saying he went through  Robins in  years.Think about it Dick was  in S. Lets just say he was only Robin for another  years which is unrealistic. He should be Robin until he is at least . So at  he becomes Nightwing and Batman takes in Jason. That only leaves  years for him to train Jason Jason to be killed Batman to mourn for a while with no Robin Tim Drake to deduce his identity Batman to take in Tim train him and finally make him Robin.There just isnt enough time for all that to happen in  years. Dick should become Nightwing at  at which point Bruce takes in Jason. The Robin in S should have been Jason Todd. In my head canon he could be.Realistically I like to think Bruce is Batman for about  years before even taking in Dick. So he starts at  takes in Dick at  and they run together for like  years before he becomes Nightwing. Then Batman takes in Jason at about  years old they are partners for  or  years then at around  Jason is killed and Batman spends a few months alone before taking in Tim for about  years. Finally at like  he takes in Damien. Thats how Batmans lore should work.Not a  or  year old Bruce already having Damien like in the New . It doesnt even make sense if hes only been Batman for  years and Damien is what ? But whatever Im rambling at this point lol.edit I probably shouldnt have kept saying takes in Dick,DCcomics,d0abh08,3,t5_2qlmm

One that uses that strength to completely overwhelm the foe if needed but often doesnt. Characters like Superman and Shazam who seem like indestructible machines. Wonder Woman is as strong as them and smarter but only fights when she needs to. Flash is immeasurably fast as well.In general I feel that DCs power level is several levels above other comics.

7032370,0,t3_4bx0eb,Just got out of the movie theatre. As many others have already said the pacing was a bit off. I actually kept looking at my watch going  Theres nothing happening!. Wonder Woman was a joy! Henry Cavill is a great superman. Theres something no one is talking about though. This is a Bat who knows hes in over his head. You can see him recoil in fear more than once. This is a Bat who is unprepared for all eventualities  He knew nothing about Diana couldnt see his strings being pulled by Luthor and he sure as hell never predicted the rise of Doomsday. If he had realized that the Kryptonite spear was missing even for just a second Im sure he wouldve crapped his pants.In the end it felt like a Batman movie instead of Supermans.,DCcomics,d1dh2qi,1,t5_2qlmm

Have them be fighting and their whole story this movie be revolved around the build up to this fight. Meanwhile wonder woman has been keeping an eye on luthor and finds out about doomsday.

She started out in a low spot and chose to be Batwoman because she saw Batman helping people so decided to do the same but she isnt related to him in anyway beyond that. Of course they work together because they respect eachothers skills and batman has even offered her a spot in the team which she declined but overal she works on her own. There is something about her fall and rise that has helped me in my rough spots. I picked up the first volume of her  when I was really low and seeing a queer person choosing to become something great was a big help especially when I was questioning myself in both sexuality and gender in a somewhat hostile enviroment.To sum up what is likely a far to long and ridiculous thing I like her because Ive connected with her on a personal level. For general badassery? Shes a really good character for women the queer community and generally people who get themselves in low points. I love her ,DCcomics,d1f0o11,9,t5_2qlmm

7049248,0,t3_4c4wk9,uNtinos asked  gt Hey. Im really interested into getting into comics but Im very confused with all the canon rebirth and new  terms that Ive read online. The only comic book series that Ive read is The Walking Dead because it was so easy to get into it. Its issue  etc.. really simple. As of superhero comics Ive read only . The Joker The killing joke and Frank Millers The Dark knight returns. I had mixed feelings for the joker comic but I absolutely LOVED tdkr and the killing joke. Those comics are the reason that I wanna read more comics. As you may have already guessed Im looking for batman comics for a start and then I wanna read comics for the rest members of the JL like green lantern and flash in order to prepare myself for the JL movie D I know that dc completely rebooted their comics in  and the new  is the new universe? I like this idea since I can start with this newer take on the characters instead of starting with the outdated comics from the s. Is there Anything more that I need to know about whats Canon and whats not? I thought that dc was going to continue the new  universe for a lot of years but my friend told me that theyre rebooting this too? Something like dc rebirth or something I dont remember.

You do you.You specifically asked me this.gt What exactly is not well thoughout?So actually yes I am responding to things you wrote. gt  Its not just a different take its a bad take.Thats purely subjective. gt These new interpretations of the characters arent so new. Theyve been done before in various shades of grimdark in the comics from the s and s.Point me to a comic where Batman Superman and Wonder Woman are depicted completely identically to how they are in BvS. gt The movies are in some respects supposed to serve as introductions to people unfamiliar with Superman and WW beyond the iconography and vague popculture hints.Once again you assume that your personal expectations and beliefs about these films are universal and when they do not live up to those they fail totally refusing to look at the film on its own merits. I mean my point has been clear from the start. The people responding negatively to this film are doing so because it doesnt match their expectations of what this film should be and lash out against it because of it. Anyone in either this or the rcomicbooks thread who has attempted to dispute this has only ended up proving that belief correct in the end. Not one of you have actually attempted to criticise the movie beyond Not muh characters.,DCcomics,d1grkbb,1,t5_2qlmm

A new blue Flash from the future has come back in time to fix a horrible mistake perpetrated by Barry Allen  THAT HAS TO BE WALLY RIGHT?!?!Im the rabidest of rabid Wally fans and even I have to look back and laugh at all of that. People were and still are really caught up in the want to have Wally back so badly that they inject him in everything they see as a potential way for it even when its stuff like turning him into a mass murdering villain. Trust me when I say I totally get it. That last one with the Blue Flash was the worst because it was also announced that Wally was coming back in that issue so people got REALLY riled up before getting REALLY disappointed.

When it comes to the general publics perception of super heroes the tv shows and movies are far more capable at making them cultural icons than the comics ever could.  I love the comics but there was simply no way they could ever reach the same audience a Saturday morning cartoon in the s could.  If you never read a Spiderman comic you knew the friendly neighborhood spiderman song.  Hulk and Wonderwomans live action tv shows from the late s did so much work towards cementing them as household names and I feel like every  year old fan of the Xmen movies can trace the origin of their fandom to the s cartoon.

And Gotham Academy and Batgirl and maybe even Starfire?

Geoff Johns had been writing it since  Id suggest you either read all of that or pass up on it.If you do want to read Origin stories read Batman Year One by Frank Miller for best Batman origin story Superman Birthright for best Superman story.

The thing that was a drag about the series is that it got pulled into Snyders bullshit crossover stuff with Death of the Family which I personally felt was a boring turd. And the search and eventual return of Damian is a million more times hype than anything Snyder did in Zero Year an overly long unnecessary origin that worked because Capulo and the rest of the art team were the real stars of Batman or Court of Owls which has a dumbass ending that supremely disappointed me because its basically the same long lost family member twist Snyder pulled in the far superior Black Mirror.Batman amp Robin for what I like my comics to be is way goddamned better than Snyders writing on Batman.,DCcomics,d314h4l,3,t5_2qlmm

The bittersweet pain among men is having knowledge with no power because... because that is paradoxical and um... thank you for coming. From the speech at the party. Watch his face and his hands tick as he becomes frustrated. You can feel the intensity of his frustration. Have you ever wanted to rip your hair out? Have you ever been moments from impulsively sayingdoing something bad that you had to try really hard to compose yourself? Watch his face hands body language and the way he speaks. Hes great Lex Luthor Do you know the oldest lie in America Senator? Its that power can be innocent. Lex Luthor See what we call God depends upon our tribe Clark Joe cause God is tribal God takes sides! No man in the sky intervened when I was a boy to deliver me from daddys fist and abominations. I figured out way back if God is allpowerful He cannot be all good. And if He is all good then He cannot be allpowerful. And neither can you be. This clearly shows how he isnt a mustache twirling onedimensional villain like some people here like to say. He doesnt trust this all powerful Alien because the world has shown him that the all powerful cannot be all good. It cant be innocent. The bittersweet pain among men is having knowledge with no power....Lex is the pinnacle of humanity in his eyes. Hes a young genius that put the effort into getting where he is. Hes powerful in a human way smart rich and influential. Then here comes Clark a God almost quite literally All Powerful. A being who didnt work for his Power and someone who challenges his power very easily. Superman is a threat to Lex. He has reasons for not trusting Superman and its out of fear and jealousy.I loved every moment he was on screen he was definitely one of the highlights of the film. He fcking played Supes and Bruce like they were children. He had all the power. He outsmarted Batman FFS. He got the government to hand him Zods body. This is Lex He doesnt need to be physically imposing. Lex is defined by his view of himself the world and the threat of Superman. Not his physicality If they were to recast him or explain him away as not the real Lex itd mean that the ones in charge dont have confidence in their vision and worse they have no artistic integrity. The Jolly Rancher scene?...Grannys Peach Tea?...I cant wait for his return in JL because he was great in BvS,DCcomics,d3qe39h,26,t5_2qlmm

7893347,0,t3_4nekvt,Ooh this ties into my personal and what Im guessing to be unpopular fan theory that the  Teen Titans cartoon is canon to some capacity to the Bruce Timm DCAU.Flash Wally has this Kid Flash costume in his Flash Museum. There is no mention of Barry existing in this continuity especially since theyve amalgamated Wally and Barrys stories into one. But there is another item in the museum in this same episode a Jay Garrick helmet. So perhaps Wally was a sidekick to a retiring Flash when he dawned the yellow and red. But where does Teen Titans come into this?Well we also see Michael Rosenbaum voicing Wally West in another DC cartoonTeen Titans but as Kid Flash in this exact same outfit. This is only one of several ties an adult Speedy from the show same voice actor and design except older appears in the JLU episode Winner Take All. Dick Graysons Robin and Nightwing designs on Teen Titans are very similar to the DCAU ones. The Teen Titans are name dropped a few times in the DCAU itself like on Static Shock. But all of this can just be simple nods and explained by the fact that Timm produced both series right? Sure but this also solves one big narrative issue why did the Justice League never show up to help in Teen Titans? Its because the events of the Teen Titans take place before the Justice League ever formed. No Justice League no intervention. By the fact that of a Dick Grayson that is still Robin and a Wally West that is still a Kid Flash and the fact that the League didnt form until after Dick had become Nightwing and Tim was Robin we get further confirmation.This has always been my head canon and no one can change my mind. ,DCcomics,d43aazj,73,t5_2qlmm

They should have made two comics. One to sort out all the continuity for diehards New  Endgame or something and then a oneshot Rebirth thing without all the inside baseball stuff as a simple jumping on point for new readers.  ,DCcomics,d4pap90,7,t5_2qlmm

New  Superman will be in a shadow. Every other character would be in a shadow. The world itself might become more complacent. Two Supermen? Well then.At worst the real Superman of that world could develop a Lex Luthor complex believing that because of Old Superman he is stuck under a shadow and the world isnt giving him the recognition he deserves because he is also unable to do anything as impressive as anything Old Superman can do.PreFlashpoint Superman is a father. He was raised by nonDCEU Jon and Martha Kent. He helped the world quietly as much as he could but he probably didnt want to stymie the development of the new Earth and its people.

Even though its called Tower of Babel the actual language tower idea fell flat for me. It was totally a Rad Al Ghul idea but I just didnt find it that plausible for the JLA.Again Waid did well with the characters when they had to reveal each of their identities to each other but the whole six dimensional beings thing seemed a bit weird.Kingdom Come he did amazing with dealing with the characters and how they aged but I wasnt sure about the nuke and prison thing.,DCcomics,d5ewjvr,1,t5_2qlmm

Views on this board reasonably differ and really rather good sales by the normal indications. I suspect the crossover will be rather good spinning out of three good books. You shouldnt need the back issues for the crossover. Amusingly King is being pushed as its writer when Steve Orlando is being brought on specifically to manage it and I think he came up with the idea. King is DCs best hire of the past while even if his Batwork is yet to reach his expected standard. His last Batcrossover was mediocre at best though.,DCcomics,d5ps47r,1,t5_2qlmm

8399128,0,t1_d5ra4fw,I agree to an extent but I feel like the way Dick talks himself through situations is much different than Bruce. Dick looks down on himself in a way and seems more human when facing difficult and life threatening situations. i dont want to get into the details of the Black Mirror for those who have not read it but I do believe this is a good Dick story. His mindset is not comparable to Bruce and I think the story would have been much different with Bruce behind the mask. When you think Bruce is on his heels you typically see he had planned it all along. With Dick he is constantly on his toes and seems to be facing surprises. I found it very aligned with other Dick stories and even more comparable to how he acts as Nightwing making rash decisions fighting next to Bruce.edit spelling,DCcomics,d5rfrf6,8,t5_2qlmm

Comiccon undoubtedly increased this anticipation which can be seen through various google and social media metrics. As for box office yea at the end of the day thats what matters however the likelihood of people seeing more movies with the DC tag on it or the SS tag on it because of poor quality in the past can and will definitely impact the box office in the future just look at F.,DCcomics,d633idq,1,t5_2qlmm

I was born in the wrong hemisphere.As for my OTP it already clashes completely with canon and its kind of really embarrassing to say because again one of the characters is a glorified OC......HarryDaphne.Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis are Slytherins from Harrys year who dont do anything in the books so the fandom sort of took it upon itself to make them into actual characters. They are both good Slytherins and best friends Tracey being the fun one and Daphne the serious one. Some people get it wrong and pair her with Slytherin!Harry which doesnt make sense because the whole point of the pairing is for Harry to be very Gryffindor and her to be very Slytherin without being evil so they can be oppositesattract without it being problematic.I can go on and on about this.,DCcomics,d664fs1,1,t5_2qlmm

8524751,0,t1_d675c2g,I might be wrong.  But I dont think I am.  I talked to a few people on the way out of the theater and the mood seemed pretty jubilant.But that was just my theater and I live in an area with a lot of laid back people.  I loved BvS but I could tell it was going to have problems the moment Batman fired his machine gun into a car exploding and killing people.  I liked that part of the story.  I saw what they were doing.  But I also knew at that moment a lot of families were not going to see this movie once that word got out.I dont think this movie suffered from the fundamental errors that were made in BvS.  Another error with BvS was it really was a Batman movie.  People wanted to see a more fleshed out movie with a better reason for Batman and Superman to fight.This movie wont have that problem because most of the people who go to see it are not going to even know who most of the characters are.  So it will allow most viewers to get to know the characters and identify with them without thinking I wish they had been more true to the comic and all those arguments.That is why I think the public is going to gobble it up.,DCcomics,d675mws,-2,t5_2qlmm

This will give you a good idea of her origins regarding her mother and the JSA which is briefly revisited every now and then during BoP Batgirl Year One  supporting character but it sets things up for things that happen later in continuinty their team up as the Birds of Prey Green Arrow by Mike Grell supporting character doesnt appear much in costume but has great interactions with Ollie. Starts with Longbow Hunters and then continues into the ongoing starting with Hunters Moon Birds of Prey various one shots and minis collected here Birds of Prey vol   recently started being reprinted starting here  IMO This series is the best writing youll ever get for Black Canary and Barbara Gordon. I highly recommend reading through at least Chuck Dixons run first  ish issues and Gail Simones run next  or so issues after that. Its mainly a team up between her and Barbara Gordon Oracle and former Batgirl where Babs gives her the intel and tech support while Dinah is on the field as a onewoman specops army. More additions are made to the team later on mainly Huntress and Lady Blackhawk.  Green Arrow by Kevin Smith Quiver and Sounds of Violence   issues featuring the resurrection of Oliver Queen and his reunion with Black Canary and other friends and family. Also has a funny sex scene with the two of them. Green Arrow and Black Canary Wedding Special set after final  issues of Green Arrow vol  included in Wedding Album with the first five of the ongoing Green Arrow and Black Canary   Black Canary and Green Arrow superheroing as a married couple. Stop after  after that its shit because they split them up. Birds of Prey vol    brief series featuring her return to the Birds of Prey following that stupid shit regarding her and Ollie separating Black Canary and Zatanna Bloodspell  short out of continuity comic thats quite fun Green Arrow vol  the one from the recent Rebirth relaunch  First comic since  that features Dinah that is actually good. If reading this remember that this is after the new  reboot and this is when DC finally allowed Dinah and Ollie to meet and become a couple again took five fucking years for DC to wisen up,DCcomics,d68utie,2,t5_2qlmm

Theres so many characters who already help Batman in his war on crime was there really a need or want for another? To be honest I feel as if Dukes role should be filled by Tim who seemed to do a lot of the same things when he was Robin.

8794972,0,t1_d75150w,Id actually like to talk about a couple of things in response to your points here. . Youre right. Damians death mostly took place during the time Zero Year was happening. Which is actually part of the problem. Snyder largely abandoned the mainstream DCU for over a year in order to write an aboveaverage but still tooweak origin story for Batman. During this time huge things were happening in the DCU and in Batman comics in general but Snyder chose to avoid them to do his own stuff. He didnt even handle the fallout from his last story Death of the Family instead making other writers deal with it in their own stories.. My problem is more with the shape of Snyders stories themselves rather than the lack of Damian within them. Damians absence is just one problem. If Damian just hadnt shown up in Endgame because he was off doing his own thing that would have been fine. But he wasnt present in the run in any meaningful way. Hes supposed to be Batmans partner but the book thats supposed to be telling the story of the main events of Batmans life would have us believe that his son and all his older sons only shows up every couple of months and even then doesnt do anything worth mentioning. Damian doesnt help his father wrestle with the issues relating to their family in Court of Owls. He doesnt help Bruce fight the Joker in Endgame. For some reason Alfred thinks its acceptable to completely shatter Bruces family in order to keep him in the dark about his past as Batman in Superheavy. Snyders weird pseudouniverse just doesnt line up with the world as it should be in the rest of the DCU and its disrupted the wider Bat Universe.,DCcomics,d751bs7,1,t5_2qlmm

8828984,0,t1_d78xoa3,gt Perhaps its a possibility that theyll add it in later or is that not something theyve ever done with the trade catalogs?Oh absolutely! This is actually quite possible. The trade catalogs come from the publisher Hachette. Every now and again things get added or removed from the catalogs though its not super often. Hell just with the most recent catalog they added Wonder Woman by George Perez Omnibus volume  which wasnt there when the catalog was initially released.Also these trade catalogs come out really early. As we get closer to the dates well start seeing DCs solicitations. This is another opportunity for DC to add things that werent in the catalog to their release schedule. The trades still come through Hachette so they usually have to be announced at least  months in advance meaning October  is probably out of the question but we may well see this final trade before May .Also theres the possibility that DC has something planned perhaps one final special to send the series off something that should be collected in a final volume.Dont give up hope.

Barry was one of Batmans few close friends and he moreso than maybe any other hero showed the least amount of respect or acknowledgement for Wallys time as The Flash. Certainly the least of the JL members. I actually think its great characterization. Bruce lost a sort of like minded analytical smart hero and friend. Someone who ran Central City the way he could only dream of protecting Gotham and saw him replaced with his loud often obnoxious act first think second surrogate son who couldnt hold a torch to Barry at the time of this writing and that sentiment seemed to never fade. Here we see Wally basically begging Batman to come help him out with what Batman knows is a lame copycat. He both knows Wally can handle it and doesnt want to deal with it or Wally. And several writers wrote it like this. Multiple JLA writers Johns WML heck McDuffie did it a bit too most anyone who wrote a Wally Batman interaction that was deeper than Wally cracking a joke or Batman giving an order.I know we like to see our favorite heroes in the best light but I think it makes sense that all the JL dont get along swimmingly doubly so in this case.,DCcomics,d7a27am,7,t5_2qlmm

8980908,0,t1_d7r9cnb,Thats not how those positions work. Cinematography and directing have some overlap but its a completely different ballgame. Cinematography is working with the director to get his vision across on the camerawork. Its a very very very technical job dealing with the slow process of picking camera lenses and settings and dealing with lighting equipment to get the lighting just right which can take forever usually. Directing is talking with the actors to get them to read the lines just perfectly so it fits in with the narrative and the scene and the character the director is trying to portray from the script. Two directors tackling two different scenes can make something wildly different. They also can manage every single other facet of the set. From what food they should serve to the costume design and more. Geoff Johns and Alan Moore are writers with no experience in dealing with directing or working with a camera. And Geoff Johns is more of an overseerwriter in these movies. Like a producer basically. None of what you said makes any sense. The best way to see if someone knows what the job roles are for these things is if anyone ever says Snyder should just do cinematography instead of directing that means they have no idea what those terms mean. A director can have passing knowledge of cameras and lighting but its usually more of academic knowledge than practical knowledge. Same with costumes or anything. And Alan Moore definitely would never direct. It just wouldnt work. ,DCcomics,d7rd9cf,3,t5_2qlmm

It was based on the previous Cyborg series by Walker.  The alternative Sarah Charles from a parallel universe cuts out the heart of Vics childhood friend Ron Evers this happened a few months before Vic becomes Cyborg and replaced it with a Cybernetic heart.  this Cybernetic heart gives him powers similar to Cyborg.  His heart is cold and he becomes a hired assassin like Deathstroke.  After Vic becomes Cyborg Ron sees Sarah with Vic and vows to kill her when she least expects.

With DCYou and with Rebirth he is able to either convert his mechanical body into an organic one or is able to make it appear so atleast. Ive not read past vol  of Cyborg for DCYou and im picking up issue one this Wednesday so it might have been retconed since but before DCYou Cyborg did not have a penis I still dont know why this is a problem to you does it actually matter if he has a penis or not its not as if were going to actually see it,DCcomics,d81fhor,4,t5_2qlmm

9093218,0,t1_d8338hd,To many he kinda does feel dated but they dont understand the complexity of Supes character and the many things hes been through both fictional and bibliographical to shape him into the character he is today. Also lets not forget that Superman was the first comic book super hero to ever be published Not sure about plain text novels Sherlock Holmes? maybe but hardly qualifies as superhero I guess these kinds of characters dont work in plain text. Growing up and being present in the lives of many through the generations Superman has always provided the mold of what someone should strive to be weather it be male or female Superman defined the American way and the american spirit throughout his run in WW and then things became more boyscouty in the s when the CCA rose into prominence and watering down many of the superman stories and making him out to be a mere propaganda piece but none the less has become the character we recognize today. I cant imagine GoldenAge superman on the screen smashing things without justification and flying err leaping crooked gangsters and politicians in the air hundreds of feet etc. I am an old fashioned guy and I think I am going to like this Superman and especially because I am a little tired of the depressing superman in the movies. Christopher Reeves has been my favorite but I also squeeze in Tom Welling too.,DCcomics,d84uxeq,1,t5_2qlmm

Lets face it the Flash does really well for a CW show but its not high profile enough to warrant the problems sharing a star would entail.The show hovers around five million a week thats nothing compared to the audience of a movie. The show doesnt get played everywhere and its add confusion to whats going on. Barrys fighting Zoom this week on the show but somehow he manages to help the league fight Braniac in the movie. Itd be expecting people to keep up with both the movies and the shows and thats a lot to ask of a casual fan. The shows predate the movie and its kind of ridiculous to shove something thats already doing well into a new continuity thats much more fantastical. Itd be brining a lot of unnecessary baggage and confusion.And Marvels not doing well with it either. Theyre in name in the same universe but in practice theyre not. Especially because now the shows fall under Marvel themselves and the movies are under Disney.

I will say try different buying options if doing physical copies since usually if pre ordering from a LCS or site they give discounts so if not doing that already then may save you enough money to add another book.,DCcomics,d8oupmq,1,t5_2qlmm

There were so many lines in the book and those captions with tons of text I felt like they took away from things a bunch of times and bogged down the book. Manapul seems to rely on captions far too much for my liking. Like the big spread after page  where they all show up in the past. The art clearly showed you everything and conveyed pretty much everything you needed to know but instead of letting the art do its job so many captions were jammed in there. Half of those couldve been cut and itd have been way more effective. Instead of writing those long speeches I wish Manapul wrote in scenes which showed some of those aspects he was telling the readers about.,DCcomics,d8ylrin,10,t5_2qlmm

9335607,0,t1_d8zbbl6,But that doesnt make any sense to me still. The problems are still there.The whole point is that he can never cross the line again once its been cross. I mean in Red Hood Jason Todd even says that he doesnt have to kill Dent or Penguin or anyone else just Joker. And Batman says that he cant because he knows that it wont stop with just one. And in Injustice God Among Us Superman says to Batman One Death to save Millions Batman We dont get to choose who dies. It always starts with one. Thats how Justification works. But once you justify something once you can do it again and again. It becomes easier. Right and wrong Blur.So DCEU ant use Red Hood Story because that wouldnt make any sense. And if the Joker won. Then why does Joker care about Batman now? Also now that he is a killer it ruins the relationship with Joker and Batman because Batman always wants to kill the Joker but he doesnt allow himself to. Now its like yeah why doesnt he kill the Joker?He killed a lot of henchmen but the Joker who kills hundreds of people is still alive. If its so easy to just go back to not kill why doesnt he just kill Joker and go back to not killing? Please I would like to know your thoughts.

9343008,0,t1_d909w68,So Manhunter was published from the mid to late s.  It ran for five volumes all of which are worth reading but it was unfortunately cancelled like...three times during its run.  Luckily fan outcry and editorial sympathy was able to keep it going much like Omega MenShe is a federal prosecutor named Kate Spencer who grows tired of seeing violent and dangerous criminals being let back on the streets.  Kate decides to take matters into her own hands and becomes Manhunter.  This is complicated however as Kate is a divorced mother who has to make time to care for her son between her job and vigilantism.Its a great series with very real and relatable characters with family struggles.  It is superbly written Manhunters design is just awesome and its a tragedy that it was both cancelled and isnt in print for more people to read.I believe Kate also appeared in part of Simones Birds of Prey and Gugenheims JSA.She definitely had a series of backups in Dinis Streets of Gotham also written by Andreyko.  These were solicited in their own trade but like a number of books scheduled at the time The New  happened and it was unfortunately cannedYes the same Andreyko that wrote that god awful Batwoman run.

9432746,0,t3_59uvuu,My only real gripe I had and I understand why it may have been too difficult to translate into the movie especially considering this originally was meant to be a tiein with the JLU animated series was that in the comic book the superheroes realized they couldnt fix the world because the fundamental law was that in the Crime Syndicates world evil always triumphed over good and the heroes kind of resigned themselves to that fact. The idea of the parallel world extended to the fundamental laws of reality. Which was kinda interesting.But it might not have been as appealing to end on that note really.Also the ending with the Crime Syndicate being arrested at gunpoint always seemed a bit...too easy. These are men and women who can throw buildings. Even with nukes would Earth really be willing to nuke their own moon? Wouldve been better to see the the CS maybe lose their powers or trapped in a Phantom Zone to give it a more resolved ending.All in all thought it was really enjoyable.

I am sure there exists literature on how to best ask people how much they agree with something in a survey but as a layman I think your options are reasonable. It is not a linear scale from  to . It is one disagree option and  different degrees of agreeing. So you do actually have a middle option if you are on a spectrum of agreeable.That being said I am not sure what you hope to get from question . Of course I strongly agree that all other things being equal everything should be improved. I dont know why you would not other than having a vendetta against DC or DC fans. The problem here is that improved means something different to every single person responding to your survey so everybody is in fact answering a different question here.,DCcomics,d9zpjni,1,t5_2qlmm

Leto on the other hand is not that.  And it isnt because of his look  it doesnt help but I dont think it should hinder him it is how he was portrayed in Suicide squad.  If I had to name the main problem with his portrayal it was his motivation in the film which was Harley Quinn.  I could go on about this but I dont want to turn it into a long rant so in short he shouldnt have cared for Harley as hard as he did because it made him look like a whipped dog that without her hes nothing.  ,DCcomics,da4l840,25,t5_2qlmm

9705467,0,t1_da96o06,Im glad someone brought up the covertops stuffs The covertops justification was one of the reasons why I really liked YJ and season . I really liked the show even though the awkwardness and some of the character interactions had me rolling my eyes sometimes. But I just couldnt get through season  very easily. I just felt they lost what made season  really good. Instead of the team having a creative justification for its existence covertopsteam training they just became Justice league light in season  and IMO thats REALLY boring. Also it brings in the issue of how can the main villainconflict be big enough to be threatening but not too big to have to bring in the JL? The season  answer to that question was just to get rid of the JL in pretty cheesy frame job subplotline and have the YJ team become the defacto JL. Wasnt very creative to me.  Also they just kinda doubledalmost tripled the team size and I really disliked that. I love underused characters getting screen time but I felt it was too much. With season  similarly to the old Teen Titans show it just focused on the main cast of  characters which allowed the show to give good amount of time to develop every single one of them pretty well. Season  felt like a lot of the characters were just kind of there to exist and give some oneliners every now and then. I dont know adding characters is all well and good but I didnt think that half of the new characters really did anything and that if they were taken out it wouldnt have changed anything. Im conflicted about season . I love the show but a large number of creative choices made in season  makes me worried that the issues I have from that season will continue. ,DCcomics,da9enpt,4,t5_2qlmm

The entire appeal of Batman on the Justice League is that he isnt the strongest in that sense. Superman or possibly Jonn generally has that honour. You would I think be much better served by mental strength and strength of personality. You can talk about the strength displayed by an eightyearold in shaping and realising the mission of Batman. You can talk about the strength required to come back from Knightfall and No Mans Land. The strength of purpose that means he cleaves to his rules as tightly as he does. The strength of character that dictates his decisions after Tower of Babel. That sort of thing.

9861718,0,t3_5gjfvh,Starfires original characterisation is body positive. She loves her body and encourages everyone else to love themselves especially in the s run where she constantly reminded Cyborg that hes not a monster even when he calls himself one. She dresses for herself and her costume is supposed to reflect her Tamaranean heritage  a species that a needs sunlight in order to fly and b doesnt see nudity as anything taboo and doesnt care what other people think of her. Her biggest trait was her emotion freedom the same emotion freedom which helped loosen Dick Grayson up and allow him to make the transition to Nightwing. Sex was only mentioned a couple of times with her and only after itd established she was in a loving relationship.Her backstory was had her being sexually assaulted and tortured for five years during her time with the Gordanians as a slave. She had her body and consent taken away from her and thats why as a character she really emphasises the idea of making ones own choices whether its what to wear or how to live your life since when she was a child that choice was taken away from her. All of this ties into the body positive confident character.All of these traits are on the edge between fan service. I mean on paper she could seem problematic. But its really the execution that makes the difference. Wolfman used her as social commentary Why does the western world cover up naked bodies which everyone has but glorifies violence? Why do humans spend all of their lives hiding their feelings behind lies etc? Shes an emotionally honest character who kept on asking questions like those in order to highlight some things in our society that were a little odd. But at the same time he didnt let that define her character and still emphasises how loving and caring she was as well as her other traits. Johns run had the exact same character although she was still recovering from the death of Donna Troy who was practically a sister to her.RHaTO was off. They sexualised her in every pose she was in took away her loving personality and did add hints of it later though but the damage was mainly done. The Starfire solo took away her intelligence and instead of the social commentary we got Kory doesnt know how to eat a watermelon hahaha!!!!! which was a mess. The solo had some really weird moments where Kory was told she should dress to cover up her body in order not to distract men which is  against her character Connor and Palmiotti used her cartoon characterisation which is really only  of her original traits but still tried to comment on her sexuality and the result was Kory acting like a child whilst simultaneously wanting to be naked all the time...it was really creepy. Her characterisation like all characters depends on how well the writer knows her. And unfortunately some writers Lobdell Connor Palmiotti etc dont understand her.

All I was saying was if you needed an explanation for why aliens looked human ad hoc like in the do universe you wouldnt necessarily have to come up with some new in universe divine explanation and instead you could use that its theoretically possible in the real world though very unlikely but Id say that line of reasoning is a decent explanation for a comic book.,DCcomics,dawcgzo,1,t5_2qlmm

9889408,0,t1_davuown,I was thinking Starro. Theyd start on Supergirl Starro would show up and swiftly take over Superman and a bunch of other people ala the Batman Beyond episode. After getting easily defeated by the Man of Steel shed realize shed need some help Kara and Jonn who would end up in this continuity being resistant to Starro mind control because of some quirk of Martian physiology jump to Earth but sadly Starro follows them because it has taken over some people who know how to get through the Multiverse. So then in Flash and Arrow they fight off the Starro invasion of Earth. Then finally in Legends of Tomorrow the team modifies the Waverider for a bold trip back to Earth where eventually we get a CW version of this cover Id imagine Supergirl could take Wonder Womans place Ollie could be Aquaman and I guess Ray Palmer in his Iron Man style ATOM suit would take the place of GL. Least you think this would be too expensive for the CW they could probably make it work by having the first episode be almost exclusively Supergirl characters perhaps with the Earth characters showing up at the end again and have the Legends of Tomorrow episode be basically the Legends the Supergirl Cast plus just Ollie and Flash no Diggle Felicity Cisco Wally TomCavanaghOfTheMonth etc. ,DCcomics,dawm2j9,2,t5_2qlmm

10111648,1,t1_dbpj0q0,I never said that zack snyder is better than hitchcock or kubrick or anything. I said he Filmmaking styles are similar to what those  are which he rely more on visual to tell the story. BvS do have a sololiques in the opening sequence of BvS where he addresses about the beautiful lie which foreshadowing about his own feeling of powerlessness  and his world weary state for being an active vigilante for  years. The dialogue in BvS is subtle because you have to read and understand the lines clearly and they are not really that clear even if it is for the monologue. Take example like this oneAlso dream sequence are meant to inform you about the phycological state of the character. Not just for foreshadowing purpose. For example like Bruce Wayne ManBat nightmare scene and the knightmare scene.There are plenty more thing about BvS like it has a powerful commentary about post  philosophical and ideological debate about those in power vs those in powerless relationship between gods and humans and finally how the media affected our perception. Edit Pretty much the entire sequence of the opening scene beautiful lie is basically is to inform you about the character state of Bruce Wayne in BvS movie ranging what fall is fallen to a beautiful lie,DCcomics,dbpk2ti,0,t5_2qlmm

10188606,0,t1_dbyl2uj,DC I think does consider it a second skin. Nearly all the material outside the show depicts Beyonds mask as having a lot of facial detail. You can see all the curves of his face.The toys are exactly the same.And of course you can see his teeth on the show. You can see him smile on the show. The lack of detail on the show is an art style but even all the beyond comics linked to the show originally have more detail in the mask. So yes its supposed to be a suit so advanced that its a second skin. Now of course the logistics of this mask has been something other writers have been trying to tackle.Right now the mask is like a mix of holographic and nano tech. ,DCcomics,dbyxo4g,5,t5_2qlmm

Aside from the first story arc the whole thing has almost felt like some insiders only story.

Now what I really liked is the backstory exploration of the other two members of the Trinity. Baixi was trained at an academy which makes sense given his demeanor.

10300141,0,t3_5nhjnn,Well they would not be changed by Flashpoint. Convergence and the assumption was when a new timeline forms the last one is erased. So Braniacs shtick was he would bottle cities before the planet was destroyed and Convergence was just on a bigger scale where he would bottle a city before the timeline was destroyed.  Though with the end of Convergence it is more of an assumption that we have a hypertime situation where all timelines now exist. So there could be a Multiverse A that is the postFlashpoint timeline and then a Multiverse B that has a preCrisis timeline and so forth. And since Morrisons follow up to Multiversity is Multiversity Toothey have used the infinity symbol to represent the oo in too then it is most likely a case that there is a bigger multiverse than what we know out there.  As far as Wally there is a reason that the running joke with every Flash question is speed force. Being trapped in the speed force pretty much gave him preFlashpoint memories. So he is remembering preFlashpoint Lois and Clark and not New  Lois and Clark.  As far as Supergirl it is just the usual new creative change. The did the same thing to Batgirl and not only was it before rebirth but before Convergence. A new team came in and wanted to do a new tone and made Batgirl come across a lot younger than she had previously.  ,DCcomics,dcbkrtm,1,t5_2qlmm

10368054,0,t3_5og6zg,This is really good. Its actually making me wish Lobdell had a Batman or Gotham Knights book though I like Batman and Tec right now and All Star exists because of Snyder. His Bruce is actually really good hes the one who is playing Bruce as an outlaw and rather more self aware than the permanently grim and apparently lawful Bruce that has been present post Morrison. Bruce really hasnt had a lot of good stuff since like Inc.Ill disagree with OP and say Lobdell is entirely a better writer than Snyder but I dislike Snyders writing more than just about anyone on this sub. Lobdell does the retrorebirth story very well because Rebirth has also coincided with not writing things for the trade and a new era of recompression. Lobdell writes in the neoClaremontian way that was the norm awhile before decompression came in and shook everything up. And I think the time is more than right for a return. Fewer more frequent books fit that a lot better I think. Better editorial oversight rather than randomly changing things means Lobdell can do his own thing. I honestly think his Teen Titans though it would have been controversial just for the retcons and redesigns was largely ruined by a change of editor and more editorial meddling as a result.,DCcomics,dcja4ns,2,t5_2qlmm

Because this could just be really REALLY bad if its not written well.gtbut it was a bit jarring having them profess their love for each other and then just going on about their business at the end of the day.The I am Bane arc makes it sound like people get basically destroyed in the fight with Bane so I could see them getting together at the end of that arc. Like Selina gets pretty badly hurt and needs to stay at the manor for a while. Then they get used to each other being around and just go from there.But yeah Id like it if they at least let Bruce and Selina actually date for a little bit.

Even if his cape is Kryptonian the blanket he was wrapped in in some stories his outfit is made of Earth materials which means theyre susceptible to damage. The armor makes sense because it doesnt get damaged from attacks. He still has parts of his figure exposed which fits with the invulnerability. Though even there he isnt  invulnerable. The whole story line of Death of Superman was that hes just incredibly powerful and only a being stronger than him can defeat him. ,DCcomics,dd42wpj,4,t5_2qlmm

If it was true intellectual challenge then would have to let batman knows of his plan and still beat him kinda like what riddler always try to do. Its all moot anyway because batman would always use his gadgets and skills to beat bane not shear strength. Thats why I dont understand the point of all of these vs things with batman. Half the time he cheats because he exist to protect people not to prove hes the best fighter. If cant beat them in hand to hand combat hell use his wits and tools to win.

10603335,0,t3_5rrq2w,I personally found it to be quite interesting. The first arc involves Earth  and shows a young Superman and Batman getting into a fight only to be transported over to Earth  where they learn that their counterparts work together and are the best of friends.Of course this all has an effect on the two of them and even more so on Clark when he discovers that Earth  Supermans parents are still alive whereas his own are dead.Batman also discovers that his Earth  counterpart is married to Catwoman.Its a wild ride. And the other arcs arent half bad either. Unforetunately it suffers from the same problem all the Superman titles suffered from repeatedly crossing over.But I personally made my way through the entire thing and enjoyed all of it.,DCcomics,dd9niw3,6,t5_2qlmm

10901108,0,t3_5vqh63,I also think Batman is better than Tec even speaking as a big Kate fan. I enjoy what Tynion is doing but its honestly just okay cape stuff though I mean the Victim Syndicate wasnt very great at all imo. The first arc had the benefit of great art all throughout and the novelty of lost Batfam characters working together but honestly even then the writing wasnt the best. Tynion has a very basic grasp of team dynamics that leads to pigeonholding characters into certain group tropes. The dialogue for all that people berate Kings tends to come off expository where it doesnt need to be. I dunno after the first arc it just feels serviceable and if it werent for Kate and Cass Id probably not be following it.I like Kings Batman mainly because Im interested in the themes that hes exploring. While hes said he wants to lean more towards blockbuster action I think the ideas pertaining to Bruces mortality and how that affects his psyche which in turn affects his relationships and mission are even more entertaining. Not saying I agree with his take fully hes one of those Bruce is the mask people which ehhh but I like the way hes presented it.

11032197,0,t3_5xj3xb,Identity crisis was one of the first DC trades that I ever read and I loved it at the time. Now many years later and with a deep understanding of the DCU Im a lot more conflicted by it. It really changed the direction of DC comics to become more inline with the grit of Marvel but I think a lot of the magic of the DCU died with this story as well. It really is one of those things you have to make your own mind up about. Infinite Crisis attempts to fix some of the issues Identity Crisis created and it somewhat succeeds. Its an alright story but its also incredibly important to DC continuity and is a must read just to understand almost everything thats come afterwards including rebirth. ,DCcomics,deih37t,3,t5_2qlmm

11080654,0,t3_5y3vyk,That was the original plan actually.The Nightwing mini series wouldve definitely been different to Dixons run. Nightwing and Starfire were a fairly popular couple so after the wedding had actually gone through longtime fans wouldnt be happy if DC broke them up and so theyd probably stayed together. Dick and Babs wouldnt have happened at all and neither would any of the sucky retcons that were introduced mainly because that was something that was introduced in Dixons run for a single Dick Grayson.Youd definitely have a different Dick Grayson though. His links to the Batfamily wouldve been much weaker than they have been in recent years. Personally I think that if they had married they would have stayed that way a couple of writers might have even explored the children route as well all of the other original Titans ended up with kids and the plan to get Dick married etc seemed to lead him in the same direction.,DCcomics,denzdbk,2,t5_2qlmm

You have a guy who is capable of writing such a big events  whether good or bad doesnt matter as much as those should be heavy action focused rather than be of great quality and you have writers who are trying to patch everything up  with their good stories but still not knowing where the future events might take their characters.

Yeah check out this section on the wiki thenAnd the comics dont really work like the movies especially in the modern age  origin stories are sometimes retold but for the most part everybody just sticks with whatever origin they got in whatever their first appearance was. Ditto for meeting villains and stuff. The world has been established for decades upon decades so even though there are continuity shakeups and stuff everybody already knows their supporting cast and readers already know the origin stories so writers are generally just playing in the sandbox that was built years ago.

People are always complaining about not knowing where to start so they tend to have a marketing campaign so people know it is a jumping on point. Well it depends on what you want to read and even then not much. As you can imagine it all depends on the writer so you would probably want to start with Rebirth Superman since most would consider Tomasi to be telling a better story than a lot of the New  writers on Superman. But if intereting with Justice League then most would agree Johns New  Justice league story is better than Hitchs Rebirth Justice League. in other words as you can easily imagine it comes down to writers more then which jumping on point the book comes from.,DCcomics,dfquyoc,5,t5_2qlmm

He can learn faster Flash folks can do the same  it was often shown as a hobby for Jay Garrick..  Although never really quantified his solar powered enhancements have often been shown to include his think abilities.Any difference between super intelligence and Supermans abilities is insignificant and probably comes down to hair splitting semantics.

It really wipes out the feeling of reading something about an overpowered alien who is always gonna win any fight it especially did after I read  the Dark Knight some  years ago.

11622734,0,t1_dgd5m8x,Well Im glad you are liking Supes! Definitely try and fill in the gaps you have the family aspect of the book is such a wonderful move and really adds to the characters!If you want more good Superman action Action Comics is definitely the way to go one of my favourite books right now especially since it has one of my alltime favourite Superman writers on it right now Dan Jurgens. If you want some more SuperFamily stuff Super Sons is wonderful so far its only  or  issues in but is still great!Trinity is another cool book I enjoyed the first arc by Manapul and Im interested in seeing where this series goesRed Hood and The Outlaws is a real fun book great action cool storytelling Jasons dry humour and Bizarro is one of the cutest characters to read in this book! I love the Dark Trinity angle that they took with this book from the get go. An imperfect Superman a not quite Batman and a bloodthirsty angry AmazonianTitans and Nightwing are also high up on my recommendations I can never get enough Dick P but yeah those are some real cool books Nightwing has a storyline currently that features Damian so we get to see the DickDamian partnership again and it references when they were Batman and Robin and it is real cool.Batman is also pretty good Tom King is a pretty capable writer its just difficult when youre following on someone a lot of people consider the greatest writer on the series ever! I personally prefer Detective Comics right now because the larger focus on the BatFamily especially Batwoman and Orphan Cassandra Cain. Its a different feeling Batman book which is good for me!Those would be my main recommendations based on what Im reading! ,DCcomics,dgdg4yk,3,t5_2qlmm

11763535,0,t3_67ut7u,Other people have given you good info on the Flashes but you seem kinda interested in the Robins too and theyre some of my favorite characters so I thought Id give you some info on themDick Grayson The first Robin. Dick was Batmans first Robin and created the title. Hes quite adept at acrobatics and stuntwork as well as all the other things that come along with being trained by Batman. Hes also a natural leader having started the Teen Titans and eventually even becoming Batman for a short time. Once he felt he had outgrown the name of Robin he took the name Nightwing to become his own man and do things outside of Batmans shadow.Jason Todd The dead Robin. He became Batmans second Robin after Batman caught him stealing the tires off of the Batmobile and decided to recruit him. He was always a bit too aggressive and impulsive and this culminated in him disobeying Batmans orders and trying to save a woman who he thought was his mom. This turned out to be a trap by the Joker who beat him mercilessly with a crowbar and then blew up the building hed left Jason in. Jason later returned as a bit of a villain named Red Hood who believed Batman wasnt going far enough and started killing villains. He later became more of an antihero even working with the rest of the family on occasion.Tim Drake The Young Detective Robin. Tim became Robin after he was clever enough to discover Batmans identity. He was different than the others in that he wasnt someone who was orphaned and taken in by Batman. In fact originally Tim just saw that Batman needed a Robin and tried to get Dick Grayson to retake the mantle. However Dick convinces Tim to do it instead. Tim is the most analytically minded of the Robins and imo is the most like Batman in his detective nature. He eventually took up the mantle of Red Robin when Batman died dont worry he got better because he believed Bats wasnt actually dead and tried to solve the case.Damian Wayne Batmans son. Damian is the current Robin. He was first introduced during Tims period where we found out that Talia Al Ghul daughter of Ras drugged Batman at one point and they had a child together. He initially struggled with his dual identity as an Al Ghul and a Wayne but eventually overcame it and decided to be fully on Batmans side. When Batman died Damian became Robin with Dick Grayson and they still have a strong older brotheryounger brother vibe.Theres many others in different continuities but these are the main ones.,DCcomics,dgtfch8,6,t5_2qlmm

11779900,0,t3_6812zh,Batman despite what most people have said within rebirths first year is really really good. Especially the pay off from the recent I Am Bane arc which is culmination of the first three arcs. The whole run so far has been incredible action romance emotionally charged scenes from Bats point of view.Superman also is an awesome run to check out too. I wasnt much of a supes fan until I read the rebirth run. Lot of family stuff between him Lois and Jon. The third arc was especially good as it had a lot to do with the supermen of the multiverse being a nod to Grant Morrisons Final Crisis which is my favorite damn DC event hands down.Green Arrow was great from what I read. I dropped it after the second arc because I had to cut down the number of titles On my pull list but over all it was awesome.Flash just recently started getting really good with the last two arcs. If youre a fan of Barry Allen you might really like this one.Green Lanterns isnt necessarily street level but theyve been almost exclusively earthbound until this next arc where theyll be in space with the cast of Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps which id also recommend if youre a GL fan.

Hed already have a plan for taking on Damian and Damians training as a child only goes so far at this point theyre both approaching their potential  minus what theyd gain from experience. ,DCcomics,dgwz7r0,1,t5_2qlmm
