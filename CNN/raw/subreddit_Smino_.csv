11233793,0,t1_df548os,he shouldve included songs from Blkjupter on Blkswn and there were a few filler songs that werent all that memorable but otherwise one of the best albums so far. More Life is shit though Im saying that with a strong hatred against Drake. I havent given it a full listen through but Im guessing its shit. Lemon Pos Goose shouldve been on the album tho that shit bangs too.,Smino_,df5c2pz,2,t5_3i4fw
