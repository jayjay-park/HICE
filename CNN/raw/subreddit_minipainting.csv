1147272,0,t1_chxvyq8,I think part of the issue with your OSL is too much of the strong yellow on the legs. With OSL you have to remember that your object is not the only light source it is not a flashlight in a pitch dark room. If it was the only light then it would cast a hue across the entire model but with OSL we want to get the look of a colored light source that is diffusing across a surface in addition to a neutral light source. So you dont want to think about what a yellow light would do in pitch darkness which is similar to what you have. Instead think of a yellow light in dim room. It looks like you used the same yellow on the lava as on the leg foot and jerkin. You want to remember that the object should be the brightest hued spot on the model. If you go set a lamp on the floor and look at it you will notice that the lamp is much brighter in respect to the color the lamp is giving off than any of the surfaces it is lighting up. You want your model to reflect that. The next time you try OSL try a  gradient with  being the brightest and only directly on the object. Where you have yellow on the base half the legs half the jerkin and a third of the foot you should do your  and . It should be really the saturation of the base area now that is not the object itself i.e. the flatter surfaces directly next to object. Then your  and  would be the orange you used I would try putting that on everything else you have as yellow now and half of what is orange. With OSL less is always more IMO but I agree with poopadoopaloop that it looks quite good. I think the skull on the left would be a perfect example of OSL if it was as close to the object as the bottom of the giants kiltjerkinskirtloincloththingy.Also your MM loos really good Looking forward to see your next piece.

1960659,0,t1_ckpe6bv,Often with brush on and sprays meant for canvas or worse furniture never ever use krylon sealer on a mini the mixture is very thick and bubbles or drips even with light coats. Ive used brush ones quite a bit from high priced canvas sealer diluted multiple thin coats to stuff meant specifically for minis. Even with those quality a few thin coats of Dulcote look better that the most careful Ive seen of brush on. Its just tailor made for the job and despite its name it dulls the colors the least of everything Ive ever used.I will still use brush on gloss for wet or shiny objects for effect but for the main coat I use Testors always unless I leave it uncoated as a display piece.,minipainting,ckpgm9a,2,t5_2scss

Wash with Vallejo Game Ink Green thinned to  Repaint all but the shadows with the VGC Scorpy Green thinned   mix of VGC Scorpy Green and VGC Livery Green thinned .  Start painting the first layer of highlights.   Add a few drops of VGC Moon Yellow to that mix and do just the highest highlights.

3143834,0,t1_conoikf,Yep. Easiest way to handle it is to make whats called a wet palette google it. Otherwise yes you can just add water... you might also want to consider getting some flow medium GW has one in their line of paints if you like those in particular. Basically if you use water to thin the paint and get past a certain amount the paint wont flow correctly onto the model... it will instead start to bead up... and thats not good... so thats why you would use the flow medium. But for the most part youll be fine with just water. Youll want to thin your paints down until theyre roughly the consistency of milk.  Youll notice a huge difference when it dries... no more gloopyness and it gives you more time to work with it on the model... i.e. for making gradients and whatnot.  If you havent already make sure to prime your models before you start painting them.. that makes a HUGE difference too.

From the Model Air line I just have the most common colors and a good selection of metallics. You can absolutely use both lines for airbrushing or hand painting in fact I highly recommend using the Model Air metallics for hand painting rather than Model Color metallics. When using non airbrush paint for airbrushing youll just have to thin your paint out more than normal  no big deal. ,minipainting,cotxci3,2,t5_2scss

3378977,0,t1_cpdf9ms,It sounds like it might be the techniques you used dont scale very well and because this is a large model it can be a bit more work getting the contrast. You can still use a standard drybrush and wash process but its more selective. You would build the wash in layers starting with complete coverage and finishing with just washing the deepest recesses and the same idea to the drybrushing.A good trick on larger models is to block in the base colours with a light and dark shade. You dont need to blend them too much as the wash and drybrush will do that for you. ,minipainting,cpdffww,1,t5_2scss

The first burst of air from your airbrush will almost always spatter droplets of paint out this is why you should point it away from your model depress the trigger and then go to your model while you still have air flowing through the brush.And next time actually describe what the problem is this is the most confusing post Ive seen in a while.,minipainting,ct9uzwu,1,t5_2scss

4763071,0,t3_3fpk67,Lighting is a bit rough but youre off to a good start. I would recommend doing some highlights that are closer to the colors of the things youre painting as opposed to drybrushing everything. Drybrushing tends to look good on completely flat surfaces Space Marine pauldrons for example or on very textured surfaces think like sandpaper texture. Also if youre just getting started its worth pointing out that black much like white is a very hard color to paint since it is hard to get good shading or highlights respectively. Its good for the first couple of models though! ,minipainting,ctuxh9l,1,t5_2scss

4887498,0,t3_3hs2jz,I put any paint that Im going to use for the long term in a dropper bottle with some DISTILLED use it water.  The sealed bottles keep it form drying out.  When I apply it how thin I put it on the model depends on what Im going for.  If its the primary base color Ill put it on thin diluting a bit more and cove it in  coats. If Im doing something secondary I might shoot for  coats witht he paint thicker. If I see brush strokes Ill put on a coat of heavily diluted paint and kind of massage them out. rubbing with the bristles.  Basically when in doubt go thinner.  AS for the materials Distilled water is cheap and fine. I much prefer it to tap water.Future shine floor polish is better than water for purposes of pure thinning. It acts as an acrylic filler and is better than just water. Flow aid is good if you want to use paint as a basis for a wash or use it for a base color but a little darker as a basis for a shading.  The Polish or Flow Aid helps it get in the shaded bits and along with some good dry brushing makes a figure pop out.Ive had issues with different branded paints not playing nice together and balling up. This is rare though. So my kit is Pure Dis water For thinning and washing brushes. water  shine mix for thinning and making cheap washes.

6344150,0,t1_cza3hib,This is where color theory and really understanding the debths of various colors can help. Color is not linear especially in brown. I would reccomend researching hue tint tone and shade. Additionally understanding how the balance of color mix in a brown can present different types of brown can really help in particular. You may have  browns that are the same shade of brown but look completely different as one may have more yellow or more red for example.After learning up just a little about how this works you will never look at color the same way especially Browns.Nearly half of my paint range is just different types of Browns with different shades tints and color mixes.  Even with that many variations I still find myself often mixing in to get some more push into a particular color influence on my Browns.On top of all that trying to familiarize yourself with an ideal brown shadebasehighlight combo for different things like fur leather wood mudd can be a challenge because what actually looks realistic does not seem too intuitive till you look closely at the source and see for the first time again what brown things actually look like.For example if your painting a leather bag hanging off your minis belt  you can see I used a reddish brown base with an orange ish brown highlight. Two different colors of brown used to seem more like leather rather than just stepping up or down in shadetone.The picture is not exactly the best example but the only mini I had from my early junk bin with a satchel on it.Discovering the different types of Brown combinations to make realistic leathers in say a leather jacket vs a hard leather shoulder pad or the leather in a belt can be a fun little challenge of observation and application. This will also apply to Browns in fur and wood that are not just a uniform gradient of one type of brown.There is literally a rainbow of color variations in brown Alone. Hope this helps you with your Browns.,minipainting,czarcsc,5,t5_2scss

6391550,0,t1_czf5err,The finer tip is a great help for me to see where Im applying paint. On really small scale a big belly will get into the way of the surrounding details and touch on the side if I try painting the pinhole of an eye which is deeply recessed in its orbit with a  brush I always touch the lower eyelid with the side of it. You can eat your soup with a ladle but I think that a spoon is more convenient.Im well aware that all professional recommend a simple  or  but Ive always used       and  depending on the job at hand. The width of the line is not linearly dependant with the pressure applied and the wider the brush the more nonlinear it is.

6891626,0,t3_4a4plw,There are actually four common materials that Im aware of Metal This is traditional. Good detail but heavy and can be hard to work with and may chip or bend if dropped. Youll definitely need to prime these before painting. Metal minis also tend to be more expensive than plastic ones. Hard plastic What Games Workshop uses. Worse detail than metal but lighter weight and therefore somewhat safer if dropped a short distance. Can be easier to work with. Often but not always cheaper than metal. Soft PVC plastic What Reaper Bones uses. Worst detail of all but still pretty good and better than any minis were a few decades ago. Incredibly durable can be thrown dropped stepped on or run over by a car without damage. Very easy to customize and dont need primer though advice varies on that point. The cheapest option. Resin The best detail of all but also the most fragile and often the most expensive. Hard to customize as the dust from cutting or sanding is highly toxic. For beginners or people who want to use minis for DampD or whatever I suggest Reaper Bones since theyre so cheap and durable. In fact their Learn to Paint Kits are a great purchase for a beginner and theyre cheaper than the paint alone would be so you get the brushes minis and instructions effectively for free. I find its also a fantastic material for big minis like dragons. Once you get more skilled and especially if you start thinking about competition painting metal and even resin minis will likely become more appealing for their higher level of detail.,minipainting,d0xhf74,3,t5_2scss

7150527,0,t1_d1qvwzf,Awesome! Thanks for these tips Ill definitely apply them to my next attempt especially the water dilution for more thin coats.The graininess on the blade and the miniature itself is a byproduct of the d printing process that Hero Forge uses. Some printed angles had more texturepock marks than other areas.I used a brushon primer I bought at my local game store. I do live in a humid state and the white sprayon primer I bought from Home Depot was doing that exact clumpingchunky texture that you described so I soaked and scrubbed the mini I tested on with some Green and bought the brushon white primer.Brighter colors are the goal! The borrowed Citadel starter set was a bit limited in its colors and I didnt want to burn through my friends paints with mixing white with everything on a pallet. I also think I went toooooo heavy with the only shade wash in the set which was a dark earth tone. Im hoping to maybe purchase my own lighter colors and add some highlights before doing a clear coat or something.,minipainting,d1qxy9l,2,t5_2scss
7152630,0,t3_4deiof,Looks good. I like the color.If you dont mind a little constructive criticism those mold lines on the gun arms are killing the effect of the miniature. It breaks immersion for the paint job. A hobby knife would scrape those right off pretty easily.Take a couple steps back from the miniature on the table if the paint job looks a little muddy from  ft. m.  away then I suggest adding contrasting edge highlights and put a black line around structures that get lost at distance . Like some of the structures on the back adding a thin black line in the crevices will really make them pop especially if you add an edge highlight.We as painters tend to see the models up close for so long that at least I do forget that these things will often be seen from a few feet away. So to make the paint job to really pop out at distance the sharp contrasts are important.All in all looks good. I really dig the color scheme and the Robotech models.

7567729,0,t3_4iyinb,The main things to remember with primer are that the model should be well cleaned first with some decent dish soap rinsed thoroughly and then left to dry completely and that the primer needs to be left to cure for quite a while if you want a strong adhesion.I typically leave my primed models for about an hour or so before I start applying paint but if its a metal model I leave it overnight since paint chips off metal models with very little force.As for getting regular paint to adhere more my One Unusual TrickTM is to add a drop or two of varnish to the paint mix along with my thinner and for games workshop paints specifically I prefer to use a Matte varnish. The Vallejo varnishes are reasonably durable and I find that it makes the final paint layer more resistant to wear once everything has fully dried although I find that I have to counteract the varnish with a roughly equal amount of thinner since the varnishes can end up making paints thicker.,minipainting,d32ewzw,1,t5_2scss

Get a layer or two of paper towel cut to the size you want your palette to be and cut a piece of baking parchment to fit over it. Build a kind of tray for your palette out of aluminum foil. Add enough water to soak the towel press the parchment down onto it let it sit for  minutes and youre good to go. Keeps your paint wet for waaaaay longer and the parchment shouldnt break down and release fibers like ordinary paper would its tough stuff.The biggest trick there is getting parchment without wax or silicone in it.

Press it onto the felt until it kinda changes to  damp  You can keep a teensie bit of standing water in the tray to help keep the felt soaked.

I have however switched to Vallejo Acrylic Polyurethane Matte Varnish since I bought an Air Brush but Army Painters antishine is a whole lot matter.Anyways you need to be very careful with this kind of spray varnish to prevent clouding. Only spray using short burst while moving the can around pay attention to the spraying distance and avoid spraying in humid weather.Also avoid spraying your miniatures outside in the cold especially with metal miniatures. The paint or the varnish might crack because of the temperature differences.,minipainting,dbds4yv,1,t5_2scss

10510599,0,t3_5qh27s,I use ZapaGap. If its something thats particularly difficult to hold in place or takes forever to cure I use baking soda. Baking soda acts as an accelerant to cure the zap much faster. Ive also seen it used to replace broken and lost pieces of ceramic figurines by sculpting it. I just have a small cup or bottle cap with baking soda in it nearby when glueing. Try to have as fine a powder as possible because clumps will make things difficult. Heres my technique. Apply a small amount of Zap to the piece youre glueing then touch that piece to the spot youre glueing it to so that theres glue on both sides.. Make sure youre holding piece in such a way that you can touch it to the baking soda and then securely hold it to the model as youll need to do this very quickly.. Touch the piece very lightly onto the baking soda so that theres a thin layer of powder on the glue then quickly attach it to the model and position it the way you want.

10652109,0,t1_ddenyf0,Thanks for explaining how you can tell the paint was overthinned. Now that you mention it I can see the problem. I will have to try less thinning in my next batch of models.Overall what do you think about my first attempt? I am hoping I get better but as I mentioned I fairly happy with this as a starting point. Since I am currently fairly happy unless the new colors make things way better I may just leave them the way they are. I only have  models painted to this level. So I still have lot of models to go before my Start Collecting box is completely painted. ,minipainting,ddeolpq,1,t5_2scss
10654236,0,t3_5sg4fa,Ive had success with any paint designed for modelmini use. Citadel included. Vallejo and MSP from Reaper are good choices as well. The pros for citadel paints are a large color selection that obviously pairs well with their figures and can make it easier to follow their color suggestions as well. Cons are their paint pots arent the best it can be hard to get paint out and bad seals can lead to paint drying out sometimes. They also tend to be little more expensive than other brands. Ultimately just go for whatever colors you need in whatever brand. As far as brushes go I am not a fan of their line. The base coat and drybrushes are fine for that purpose but for any detail work I feel they fall flat compared to better brushes. I just recently got a Windsor amp Newton Series  and cant recommend it enough. It holds a ton of paint and the point is amazingly sharp. Get some brush soap to keep it in good condition and you wont need another detail brush for a long time.,minipainting,ddewi1c,2,t5_2scss

11379566,0,t3_62b0ek,Interesting. Cant say I know exactly what it is but I imagine itll be to do with pigment size or something like that.

Id suggest if you use texture paint to just glue them together beforehand. This will make the rock not stand out as much later. Also if you use texture Id suggest the newer stuff GW came out with in the large bottles. It uses rounded beads rather than sharp grit in the formula allowing you to use an older brush to push it up to the feet rather than relying on the sculpting tool for all of it.And when you drybrush the base you can also drybrush the feet a little to build up a dusty look making it look like hes been stomping around the badlands. ,minipainting,dg95qeb,2,t5_2scss
