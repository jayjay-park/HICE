3333001,0,t3_2ya0nv,I work hard to avoid ruminating but it really depends on what you mean by negative thoughts. Negative thoughts are fine just note them and move on. The idea is to notice when youre treating yourself poorly just like youd notice if you said these things to someone else you cared about. You can explore the feeling associated with the negative thought think of it as a more mindful way to note the thought.Thinking is necessary and important. Its future focused and only uses the past to figure out how to move forward. Often though it can lead unproductive negative thoughts or worse rumination. So be mindful of what youre doing and note it when its not productive.Negative  That didnt go well. I dont think Frank thinks im doing well. or Why cant my son just sleep through the night.Ruminating  emotionally charged thought were I repeatedly think over a situation. I cannot believe I said that. Frank stopped listening to me after I said that I think he may have written me off.  How many times have I said something like that? I should just quit Ive lost credibility.  Or If my son doesnt start sleeping through the night Im going to go crazy. How many days has it been since I slept through the night? All I need is  hours in a row...  How come my wife never seems to wake up. Is she faking it?Thinking  Analysis of something or working on a problem. Its not repetitive or emotionally charged and is productive. My presentation didnt provide sufficient context to the audience thats probably why I kept getting those questions. I was defensive when I spoke to Frank Ill explain to him what happened at lunch tomorrow.  Next time Ill will have someone review my presentation first. or  I think my son is waking up in the middle of the night because he gets too warm. Should I try turning off the vent in his room?Its easy to assume youre thinking when youre just ruminating.  The way I tell the difference is by being mindful of my emotions.  Am I feeling stressed anxious angry? If so then its not productive and I need to be noting and letting go.,Mindfulness,cp86sam,2,t5_2rhel
3681510,0,t1_cqbe4jm,To answer your question you are not consrantly holding your attention to the routine. You are noticing how you feel mundane about it you are aware of how it takes you out of the flow. THAT is mindfulness. You are right on track. The trick then begins at least as i began to see it that nothing was mundane anymore. Everything was something incredible to be experiuenced and noticed and for lack of a better word loved because it exists. I hope that did come off like a hippy it happens sometimes. But the point is when you notice your attention slipping dont admonish yourself for it just let it pass and return your attention to what you are doing.

6458083,0,t3_443vpl,One of the Headspace sessions directs you to recall a time someone said something negative to you then instructs you to make that the object of meditation. These seem like similar ideas. Id point out however that the purpose would not be to build numbness. Rather its to become well acquainted with those feelings build compassion toward yourself andor the speaker and ultimately to recognize the true nature of the thoughtsfeelings motivating the abuse and your response. It may seem like six in one halfdozen in the other but while the difference is subtle its powerful. Id liken it to the difference between a child learning to ignore the ghoulish figure in the corner and recognizing it as the shadow of your bedroom furniture,Mindfulness,cznb50t,3,t5_2rhel
6533755,0,t3_454gj7,Me and you havehad similar issues it seems bit maybe slightly differing reasons.For me it was time. Time to learn and grow. There are likely personal things going on which give you these emotions. Maybe general feelings that there is so much you want to do in life that you are missing out. And maybe you feel like you are a strong person and could well be but usually find yourself opting out of situations or seeing potential commitment and being away from it before you even get to it basically because its easier and makes your life more carefree.With all these things this thinking can affect the way you behave in relationships. It can be a mix of jumping in too quickly to begin with on top of finding easier just to move on especially on our forward moving and disposable world that can make this happen.I keep sayingyou you you but Im really just trying to say the things Ive noticed happening to me. If you feel like any of this applies to you feel free to say we can have a discuss about it if you want. Im  yo and I havent settled yet which Im happy about but thats different to this but theres alot of things Ive learnt thats stopped me from trying to jump around or feeling like I had to put wanted something else as I used to when I was around yo,Mindfulness,czv5500,8,t5_2rhel

6757989,0,t1_d0hz4hc,Interesting I hadnt even thought of neuroscience like that but it makes sence. I did alot of googling last night about pseudopsychology peer reviewed studies common misconceptions etc etc basically it seems right now no one declines the effect mindful medition has on stress and anxiety as it helps cope with rumination. But some studies suggest the effects are similar to anti depressants. Similarly some studies suggest no other benefits other than helping with rumination.There doesnt seem to be a census on mindfulness all that is known is that it can help but at what level is highly debated. Right now the  main issues seem to be  money. Basically its going to need to come from government if we want a very large study that is nonpartisan to prescription drugs or the believers.  The way in which we can measure  results which Im now realizing is neuroscience is some times suspectible to subjectivity or scientific methods that may debated in science community.,Mindfulness,d0ibzem,1,t5_2rhel

7317044,0,t3_4faym5,When you walk walk. When you shit shit. When you work work. If you dont like your work I imagine negative thoughts arise frequently while you work. But if you practice singlemindedness the opposite of multitasking theres really no room for the negative voice. Just like we return to the breath in meditation  you can return to work if your mind wanders. There is a subtle pleasure in focusing intently on menial tasks and it involves a little bit of play and a little bit of challenge. The challenge is entirely selfregulated though and it requires full awareness not boredom or passivity to activate. For example watching a boring TV show might be more interesting if you task yourself with memorizing the name of every character that appears in the episode. It might not be useful after the fact but putting a little joy into your work day is easy and will make you feel like you are spending your time more meaningfully.

11760441,0,t3_67t3em,Mindfullness teaches me to be content. Not with mediocrity. Just. Content. I want to watch a cartoon. Old me would freak out at what an irresponsible slob I am and how I am almost  and still act like a child. Mindfull me is content with who I am and I want to watch a cartoon. Now that all my energy isnt drained from beating myself up over the cartoon Ill go for a walk. Because Im content and I want to walk. Whereas old me would be stuck to the couch after watching the cartoon lamenting that Im just a wasteful potato who will never accomplish anything in life. When you are content you just sort of do and you dont rationalize so much. Whats the point of anything? Thats an existential debate to have every now and again with a good friend over a nice bowl of weed. For the other times less thought and more doing makes me happy. Funny thing is letting life happen is when I accomplish more. Because when Im mindfull of my negative chatter and have cleaned it up Im content. And when Im content me just sort of does whatever she decides she wants to do without worrying or doubtful thoughts to hold me back from doing. Some people find joy in chasing success or doing well in their career. Its what they do. Its all good there is no one way to live. Just be dude.
