1117671,0,t3_26vz3m,I dont know anything about it from a teachers point of view but I  know two students who went there. One ended up at U of Illinois and the other at University College London  a very wellregarded university. I think they liked it well enough.Futian District is a good location in Shenzhen and the school is not far from the border crossing to Hong Kong. I think the owner of SCIE also owns Green Oasis primary school in Shenzhen.,shenzhen,chvc826,2,t5_2qk15

2273428,0,t3_2l9elx, Its super easy all you need is a new sim buy a number and prepay a package for a month. Get an unlucky number no s lots of s pretty much for really cheap. Unfortunately almost none of the sales reps will speak english. Ask a friend to go with you that can speak with them. There are kiosks in almost every mall and it should take at most  mins to get everything done. Skype works with zero problems. Yahoo isnt blocked but I have no idea aboit messenger. Just checked Viber website is indeed blocked.,shenzhen,clspqlt,2,t5_2qk15

5134335,0,t3_3lb7sd,Ive been in Shenzhen for a month now visiting from Toronto. I was shocked at how few people speak english apparently its because young people flock here for service jobs and dont end up learning itfinishing high school.
