But I dont even know when they are doing something purposefully or not and theyve really contributed to people feeling that way. I remember back in the ... Gamma event I think it was one of them said they wanted people to be excited not panicked by the game and lack of information  tactics etc. Yet they continue to deliberately panic people. Were not falling for it as much  but theyre still doing it and we all know it now. We dont know if they are lying made a mistake confused had an inter office snafu. All plausible. But they arent honest and clear with us so we have no way of knowing whats just them stuffing up which is human and only the second event of this length in this game. Or whats yet another tactic to get people to panic buy. They were selling token generators. We know they do this. But what dont know is if they went a step further and we probably never will.

Then I would work on getting to rank  so you can  shot lvl s. Pretty much you always want to be fighting the highest level thugs that you can  shot to be the most efficient. Obviously there are exceptions like gathering specific materials to upgrade characters or rank up robotsagents where you will need to use multiple troops to kill an even level thug. They may rebalance the thugs to be  shottable by their equal level counterpart troops eventually but I think you are meant to use multiple troops to kill the first set of thugs that drop the new materials like going from rank  to  and from  to  so I dont think those will ever be  shots.,avengersacademygame,d3eiiua,6,t5_3e93v

7815824,0,t1_d3ufbuz,But thats what theyve done on every event so far.Event starts things seem manageable.  People struggle to figure out what they should be doing and how they should be doing it.  Make a spreadsheet try to figure out the timing and get into a groove.  Feel like this is going to be okay.Event ramps up New challenges drop.  Things seem to shift.  Spread sheets have to be adjusted.  People start to feel stressed.  Start counting the days left and what is still due to be released and begin to feel behind.Event kicks into high gear  Suddenly there are multiple goals.  People who havent finished unlocking content from previous stages now feel like theyre scrambling.  At this point a sale often appears encouraging people to buy shards and get bonuses that will help them.  This tactic works because people are now eyeing the generators and premium characters as a way to get themselves caught up and getting the bonuses helps take the sting off of that.Event nears end Many people are behind or feel theyre behind.  The number of one star reviews on Google play start climbing.  People are frustrated that theyve spent an extended period of time and often money and now feel like theyre not even going to get the prize theyve been working towards.  Criticism on twitter facebook tumblr and reddit begins to climb.A few dayshours before event is supposed to end Sudden bonus.  Short on tokens in AbombRulk?  Crate drops with some thatll get you over the hump!  Cant make dossiers fast enough for Pepper?  Suddenly the requirements are cut in half or further.  Cant fight Ronan past a certain level because he keeps wiping out your fighters and you cant get them trained fast enough?  Suddenly health packs are raining from the sky.Event ends Way WAY more people have gotten through the content then thought they would just a few days before.  All the frustration and player focus on bad design and stress inducing lack of communication disappears.  All people remember is that they got what they wanted to get.  They end the event satisfied and feeling in most cases grateful that TinyCo was so benevolent as to give them at additional hand up at the end that allowed them to win.But the pattern is pretty established by this point.  This isnt them helping out when they realize that the difficulty was accidentally set too high.  This is them willfully creating a playing experience where the player becomes so invested in the end goal that when the stressfrustration reaches a high enough level that theyre willing to exchange real money to alleviate it.  And then once theyve collected money from the players who canwill play to relieve their stress or ease their way they relax things for everyone else to prevent people from rage quitting.This has to be carefully balanced.  They cant let the PtP players feel cheated for having ponied up early in the event nor can they let the FtP players leave in droves because they stood no chance of actually succeeding.  Thats why releasing things in waves is helpful because it maintains a constant state of pressure the clock is always ticking and theres always something else waiting in the wings.  If they released everything the first week and let people get through it at their own pace the fear of falling behind and keeping up wouldnt be half as high.But breaking balance?  They have done that with every event.  Im mostly FtP Ive picked up a few premium characters because I like them and because I want them on my campus.  A few days from the end of the GotG event there was no chance I was going to get Groot.  Id run the numbers I couldnt train my fighters fast enough to get past the Ronan wave that would allow it.  The clock was against me.Once they started dropping medpacks?  I ended that event with all free characters and one premium character fully leveled all but one of the bobbleheads and all the items including Ronans cell.  Theres no way I couldve gotten half of that without them breaking or rebalancing the Ronan fights.If they dont do it on this event Id be shocked.  If you check the pages outside of Reddit people are really upset about not getting Bucky.  Even though hes billed as early release and they will have a chance later players who dont know to look here and on other forums for help god knows I would not have had a CLUE on this event without the other posters here thank you ALL spent a lot of time lost and behind.

7872510,0,t3_4n2aig,Daft thing is nonevent premium characters are dirt cheap to upgrade. I managed to get past  shards at the end of the Civil War event thanks to the Academy chests you could spend Vibranium on. So I bought SpiderWoman and immediately got her up to rank  which didnt even cost  Gold. Could probably rank her up fully if not for the need for books and Maria Hill is waiting on my quad so shes higher priority.Theres no reason event characters should cost more to upgrade than the permanent store characters. Since some cost nearly  shards being four times the costs of SpiderWomans upgrades would be fair enough  but in reality the event characters are more like  times the cost.,avengersacademygame,d40xxs0,3,t5_3e93v

7889258,0,t1_d424x41,Unless its done subtly I dislike the idea of adding characters solely for representation of a group of people. I feel like if you add a character and then glorify their sexuality gender or race then that makes them stand out as being different which ends up hurting the issue more than helping it as they are singling out that character and probably creating subconscious stereotypes in people. If they are going to add LGBT characters I would rather it be because that character is a good character that just happens to be LGBT not an LGBT character that just happens to be good if that makes any sense. One example of a game that manages to simultaneously portray homosexuals perfectly but also treat the m like dirt is a game called Fire Emblem Fates. There is one character named Niles who is is bisexual in the game and he can marry both male and female versions of the protagonist. The thing that they did with him that was right was they made it so that his relationship with a male protagonist feels the same as his relationship with a female protagonist which is how homosexual relationships should be portrayed as being normal relationships. However what this game did wrong is they made Niles the only homosexual male that you could marry and they also made him only able to have a homosexual relationship with the protagonist and no one else and even worse then that they made a lesbian character that couldnt even marry any females and who gets drugged and tricked into seeing the guy shes being paired up with as a woman through the drugs to get her to like the guy. So yeah Fire Emblem portrayed some aspects of homosexuality well but many more really terribly and so many people were displeased of this treatment which is why I think that TinyCo would probably end up doing the same thing with an LGBT character. So that is why I feel that when they add the dating feature they should make every character able to be put in a relationship with whoever the player wants as that would show support for the LGBT community in a good way and also characters who are already LGBT would have way more options for romantic partners,avengersacademygame,d42tqby,1,t5_3e93v

7978343,0,t1_d4ctxha,Out of curiosity is this your first event? I think everyone goes through the trial by fire of buying a generator only to realize theyre useless after the fact it sucks but its a learning experience. I had this same reaction during the Pepper event in which the generators became completely useless after they nerfed the hell out of her requirements. Heres a tip for the future about how TinyCo runs their events so you wont feel the need to stress and buy anything initial event release the requirements seem impossible prompting players to panic and buy generators or premium characters that are advertised as helpful but the help they offer is actually minimal because if they give you too much of an advantage you wont buy more stuff.  Players grind through the first part of the event FP is only slightly behind the PP unless theyre whales and everyone is like Oh hey this isnt so bad its kinda fun! Then TinyCo releases more content it is about ten thousand times more difficult and complicated and usually with a new required items along with a new generator or character that will be helpful for the new items. They are hoping that players who feel they are already behind will panic again and buy the new stuff as well.  Near the end of the event the complaints are rolling in everyone is pissed and TinyCo decides to play the repentant abusive boyfriend and nerfs the requirements. Everyone talks about how kind and generous TinyCo is and how they never meant to hurt us it was all an accident! And TinyCo ends up raking in the cash and smelling like roses. My advice? Dont buy ANYTHING unless you want it purely for the decoration or because you love the character. Wait until the very end of the event and if youre behind you can usually boost a few things for a fraction of the cost of generatorscharacters. ,avengersacademygame,d4cuad9,13,t5_3e93v

Yeah thats bullshit.Heres a little trick Dont collect all your missions at the same time the game is less likely to give you a mission featuring a character that is already doing an action.

8102357,0,t1_d4qq80g,Mobile games havent really had fraud claims or lawsuits against them...mainly because a lot of them are free to play and you cant really complain about free games. Its not fraud then because no transactions took place.Paid players on the other hand have more weight in complaints because they can sue due to microtransactions taking place. Yet its rare because people who play the game usually just badmouth them online and if its bad enough lots of players complain the game becomes unpopular and eventually the company folds under.Which is why the games reputation matters. TinyCo is working with Marvel to do AvAc. If there are a lot of complaints I think it will not only affect their bottom line in players revolting but their reputation will be tarnished and Marvel might end their contract. TinyCo knows we knowbelieve we have TinyCo staff on the subreddit SpiderGwen to not be a premium because she is included on the loading screen and past experience has shown us that premium characters are NOT on the loading screen.A massive revolt will happen if she does turn out to be premium and TinyCo tricked us into believing she wasnt loading screen and never sought to correct our misconception on that.Which is why I dont think they will pull SpiderGwen is premium trick on us. ,avengersacademygame,d4qs0og,0,t5_3e93v

8171512,0,t1_d4yxbmh,Im in an even more delicate situation with my prospects scientific research is heavily funded by the EU so will take a big hit. Fortunately our college in the university has direct ties to the US and Switzerland but if things go downhill elsewhere in the field there may be a rush for work in the places that are doing well and have nonEU connections. We have some degree of long term protection compared to other sectors because of how funding works but its still not good for long term prospects.UKIP are just insane. Their manifesto for years on end was simply to leave the EU most parties would be putting out massive documents not single sentences. Guess its a bit like Trump being a Republican most of his party want nothing to do with him but hes there all the same. Farage has tried to quit before only to have his party refuse his right to resign. Things might be a bit different now although theyll stick around in some form.Some areas will be better than others but ultimately it only takes one person with the wrong mindset and you have problems.

Girl power and all that but I hope May wins. She seems more sane and reasonable for a conservative. I havent heard much about the Corbyn situation recently.So now dead bodies are being found by PokemonGo players. A girl was hunting down a water pokemon in a river and found a bloated body. They think its natural causes. But there are bound to be murdered bodies being found soon. lol. I need to buy me a fitbit. I am definitely walking around more. My AC was out for  days in f heat and it was cooler outside. My brothers room other side of the house has a window unit so I halfway camped out there. Had to get a new compressor for the outside unit. We really need a whole new system but thats k. Moms going to need a loan from the bank to cover it. We also need to plan to do it in the winter when we dont need an AC and we can make due with space heaters.Im starting to find patterns in the PokemonGo game. I keep finding Pokemon in the same specific areas that I now know where to go to get them. But one keeps sending me to the edge of my property and I dont want to go on my neighbors land like that. I have a bay in the backyard and Im hoping maybe I can get some water pokemon there...but Im not sure. I tried it the other day and there was nothing. Maybe I need to wait  minutes for them to generate?Btw since I live so far out there isnt any of the pokemon stations so I had to buy Pokeballs. Only got  bucks of coins. Im also probably going to buy that damn gear. But thats a long ways off.But all thats sort of taken a backseat to things in Dallas. Im  hours from there got family in Plano but no one we know was involved or anything.Im just hoping the peace and love towards cops from protesters and vice versa continues.

8489774,0,t1_d620iqv,In the past  hours the walking disaster that is Trump got worse.Word is that Manafort is no longer managing Trump as Trump continues to go after the Khans and Manafort is just basically phoning it in now. Staff are despondent. And now Trump allies are trying to plan an intervention Hah.Oooh even the kids cant control Trump Man this is a trainwreck.gt In all the world of Republican operatives insiders and elected officials has concluded  rather too late in the game  that Trump is an unmanageable mess who can only win the presidency if Julian Assange Vladimir Putin or a prosecutor somewhere destroys Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.gt This election is going to be decided by outside events said a patient but perhaps overly optimistic Trump adviser. If that is we can figure out how to get the candidate to use them.Then there is what happened on OReilly last night.Trump doubling down on the rigged election frontThe Trump family stance on sexual harassmentReince RNC head has been absolutely pissed about the Khan issue. And Trump not supporting the Speaker has just been icing on the shit cake. There is OPEN discussions within the RNC on how to proceed if Trump drops out. A They cant make Trump drop out because he has the official nomination B Trump would have to make an announcement of quitting the campaign C The RNC members would then through a complicated process nominate a replacement. But can you imagine Trump dropping out?On why the Speaker cant stand up to Trump and now since Trump has said he wont endorse him if Paul Ryan unendorses him it will seem petty.Trump spokesperson Katrina Pearson went full truther with blaming the death of Captain Khan on Obama and Clinton...even though he died during the Bush Administration back in !More on why Trump wont release his tax returns speculations on ties to the Mob and Russia others.Tea Party Republicans are losing in primaries Corey Lewandowski went full birther on CNN last night.And for my god this is fucking disaster news today on MSNBC it came out that Trump asked  times in a one hour briefing last year about why if we make nukes we cant use them.Luckily we have a provision in the constitution about taking away the power of mad Presidents Bad news it takes a little while and Trump probably already launched the nukes.gt Article II Section IV reads Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.gt The th Amendment was ratified in  as a clarification to Article II Section  Clause  of the U.S. Constitution. The th Amendment deals with the succession of the Presidency especially at a time when the sitting President becomes unable incapable or unfit to perform the duties of his or her office. It also establishes procedures to fill a vacancy left by the Vice President. It is essentially a safeguard against a president who runs amuck or who goes insane or who cannot fulfill his or her duties as commander and chief and leader of the union of  states. Switching sides to the Green Party front the VP went after Bernie amp his supportrs and Beyonce.Now for good news. Republicans are coming out and saying they will not vote for Trump. Some are even saying they will vote for Hillary. Women Republicans are more forceful like what Meg Whitman didVoter suppression laws are falling like dominoes. In the past  days laws have fallen in Texas North Carolina Wisconsin Kansas and North Dakota. This is setting up for SCOTUS to help with the rest...possibly.Arizona might actually be in play Khizr Khan is not backing downThe DNC has made news over shakeup in leadership But this is typical and its mainly the ones who got in trouble over the email hacks.Hillary smartly is staying quiet. Doing her rallys putting out ads but basically not making the news.Btw this is the new Priorities USA ad DangerGod its been less than  hours since my last reply to you and so much has happened and yet I feel like Im still leaving out a lot.

For AvAc characters really good Loki stuff in Kieron Gillens run on Young Avengers followed by Al Ewings Loki Agent of Asgard. As a side note for a nonsuperhero comic the same team that did Young Avengers does The Wicked  The Divine. I LOVE it.

I have a feeling itd be more Defenders oriented wherein like the GotG event you unlock each member along the way. Daredevil Jessica Jones Luke Cage Iron Fist Kingpin is your Big Bad with eventual cell and maybe an opportunity to buy Claire Temple PatsyTrish Walker and maybe Nuke unless hes another villain.And if were really lucky maybe that event wouldnt happen for another week or two.Otherwise my vote is Hawkeye.,avengersacademygame,d6b31b3,1,t5_3e93v

Something Ive also noticed is that both Pep amp BK need  books each while the new ranks for Wasp amp Loki need much less around  each.At least for the big event ones use their own materials amp currency which wont detract from yours.

The octobots situation was painful at several points.But in Hells Kitchen there seems to be a spend shards to progress approach that is getting difficult to ignore. Im caught in a cycle where  types of ninjas have leveled too quickly to fight without a power attack but power attacks are dropping so slowly Im using them faster than Im getting them. I cant get enough masks to level let alone fight Punisher...unless I spend shards to buy them. I dont mind buying things like costumes or characters or even generators sometimes but it feels deeply wrong to have to pay just to continue to fight.

I wish I had known about the game much sooner but I didnt and theres nothing I can do about it. Returning popular characters as premiums is a poor way to fix the issue of people not being around for events. Im asking for the same opportunity to earn a free character that they gave people the first time. Im not asking them to just give them to me but I should have the opportunity to work hard for them.I absolutely refuse to support this business model. Its just asking for TinyCo to make more events like Daredevil where the grand prize is unobtainable so they can charge us an absurd amount for them later. Maybe you dont see it yet but this is going to make it pointless to participate in events. Why should the pp people work hard if you can just fork cash out for them later especially if theyre going to be cheaper than sharding the event?,avengersacademygame,d80gwmg,4,t5_3e93v

Refusing to pay for something youre enjoying and can actually afford is basically asking other people to work for free  something I doubt OP would be happy to do.  Were paying for the experience of playing not to have things that last forever  if thats what they want they should go buy a console game instead.

Im very aware theyre not like their counterparts but I still get to not like them because theyre still bad on some level. Or just because I dont like them! Theres also hero characters Im not fond of in the game. Characters that are bad in childrens movies also get punished so thats not really a good argument. Im not taking it that serious  I just like discussing things learning other peoples opinions on them. No hard feelings.And I didnt understand what you meant thats why I asked. I didnt mean to sound judgmental on that question my bad. English is not my first language nuances are sometimes lost to me.Im not saying you shouldnt like these characters at all! Or that they cant be good! This is just how I would like to enjoy the game myself. If you do like the bad guys thats cool! The game is obviously not a one size fits all and thats fine. But we should be able to talk about what we do and dont like about it right?Edit also Im curious where you think I morphed something to my own views because all I did was ask what you meant by your comment.

Its just Rulk ABomb and a story character when it was already hard enough before.Its just... no fun and Id rather focus on the main game now until the next event and save my moneyshards.,avengersacademygame,dcjl679,8,t5_3e93v

10439937,0,t3_5pdjwp,You know I wonder if actual human Captain America is the one powering the Destroyer armor and thats why hes not in any of the conversations. Humorous cameos aside it seems odd that TinyCo missed the opportunity to have human!Cap interact somehow with RoboCap. Like... I cant imagine that when we get Jocasta that she wont interact with Wasp.I dont actually know how it would work since hes presumably doing it against his will... but hmm... Unless this is some plot to show Tony that not all robots are nice and how dangerous they could be particularly when Tony is on Caps side this time around? This would assume that Cap doesnt see Ultron as a threat which is counterintuitive andor Cap is trying to destroy Ultron from the inside so to speak. It could mimic Lokis actions during Hells Kitchen after a fashion  pretending to be working for the enemy. Maybe Fury ordered him to.Although all in all if this is true it seems like a missed opportunity for a future character announcement... Unless thats Ares?,avengersacademygame,dcrfyr2,1,t5_3e93v

10757140,0,t3_5tr5sc,I think personally the event wasnt so much as bad as it was extremely unappealing since I literally....dont care about any of the characters in this event. I mean even Dctr Strnge I was eager to get the bonuses amp get Mordo  Voodoo.That being said it was an improvement on the system made in previous events  like they reused the system from the octobots but they made it...less annoying. Sure the grinding is awful but if you set your alarm clock for the right time you can get all the stuff I did even without Luckys ten arrows which...didnt help me on the long run but at least i got him lol. I mean the event itself was really boring but when was the last time weve had an event that wasnt boring? The game has gotten really formulaic in the last...ish events and its starting to get tiresome. Obviously they are not going to stop giving us events now that they have seen how much money they can make out of them but I do wish we would have a little more time to breathe inbetween them. Maybe a story updatethe ranking thing was awful though but i never really cared about levelling up characters especially when i can do that later anyway. and hawkeyes voice...lol i cant even remember the last time i played this game with the sound on,avengersacademygame,ddpioog,1,t5_3e93v

11459803,0,t3_63jpmr,You dont need to keep him in the costume for the bonuses hopefully.If Odin is strong against Poison he doesnt help out next week is a sound idea.  As the cycle keeps rotating Week  and Week  will also fall into the same aspect under that ideology if Week  bosses rotate every streak.  The benefits week  for the costume is combat stats being one level higher to me People liked x stats who got him but I think we forget fp called an audible such a boost was not cool and kind of a slap in the face to them for not getting the costumes which werent easy and during the AForce based off RNG and didnt have a buy option just a grind faster option to try and get it.  Reduction on craft time for a needed item if you dont have Hank I dont think blaster show up on the mission board is always nice in my opinion since you save time.  I usually have downtime this week due to running out of salt but if the Pym Armory ends up needing to make multiples of different items couldnt hurt.With around  hours left Id look at the spreadsheet and think about if its feasible and what youd need to do to get it.
