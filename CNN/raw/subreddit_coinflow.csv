108995,0,t1_ceqjs18,gt Meaningless you are assuming content can be provided within the limits of a  character post or external link.Id say thats a pretty accurate assumption actually. If an external link cant facilitate the sharing of some given piece of content Im not sure what can.gtThats a very dictatorial approach to force upon content creators. You do not know these people and their requirements. Consequently it is dangerous to push your unfounded beliefs as dictates upon others.No the dictatorial approach would be to change the rule instantly and delete all offending threads. Opening a discussion about the proposed rule change is kind of... the opposite of dictatorial.gt A simpler rule is  If a post can go in rjobsforbitcoins it should go thereThe problem is that the meaning of this particular phrasing isnt actually clear to someone whos new to the subreddit. To you and me it makes sense and sounds reasonablebut to a new user who may very well be wondering exactly the question whats the difference between rcoinflow and rjobsbitcoins? this wouldnt be helpful at all.,coinflow,cequap3,1,t5_2zlcw

144176,0,t3_1vqhjz,First off NetVend looks really cool I think that you really have something there.  Seriously that is a great idea although I think that you could use a ELI on that post.  Next I think that this audio blogging platform has big potential if it is in a cloud based functionality that is if anyone who has a website can easily hook in via API.  I am also thinking that it would work better if you could use it in the context of video.  Tips in streaming videos are already really common in stuff like chatroulette the porny one.  So I could see this being a lot more useful in something like video game steaming.  I dont see the audio steaming being as strong because audio alone isnt as strong I feel that it is less engaging.  ,coinflow,ceuupec,1,t5_2zlcw
173654,0,t1_cey75ta,This would be a good thing to investigate I feel like if rgirlsgonebitcoinrgirlsgonebitcoin can get a spot this sub should be able to! Is there a minimum subscriber requirement?,coinflow,cey7n8c,1,t5_2zlcw
200703,0,t3_1w2vo8,My suggestion if you want subscribers you need content. This sub is quiet  this thread is still numbe  when I hit newThe best kind of content will be posts tagged T with genuine offers. That will bring people flocking here. ,coinflow,cf1aw95,1,t5_2zlcw
