81234,0,t1_cendptr, No but I wont breed anything until I have kept the geckos for a while  I am just asking this now so I know what I am getting in to well in advance. I will definitely be keeping this as just a hobby. Okay Ill have to check that out. Do you have any recommendations for a good one? What do you mean by reasons? ,herpetoculture,cenoeci,1,t5_2tnhp

2024197,0,t1_ckx3c6h,In my experience columbians arent as bad as argentines can be. Then again it all depends on the individual. One of the best things you can do is buy a couple  care books. Youll learn a lot from people that work with the animals professionally. Its definitely worth it when considering a very big investment like this.Most important thing is to just be  prepared to build a big ass custom cage or drop a lot of money on a manufactured one. It needs to be strong with a big footprint.Also have you considered monitors? Savannah Ackie Timor there are quite a few that could substitute a tegu. I guess I just prefer old world.If youve got any other questions Ill do my best to answer. Ive kept pretty much all the big lizard types except iguanas from Nile monitors to tegus,herpetoculture,ckx49xi,1,t5_2tnhp

2505644,0,t1_cmlkvru,So far all the pictures are from cell phones.  I wish I could say they were crazy filters just bad cameras with horrible color fidelity cropped way too close for the quality of the camera.  I was playing with adding shadows after a discussion with a pro photo on Boa Genome Project page but the results were dismal using the cell phones built in tools.A DSLR is the next upgrade so far all money has been spent on husbandry and animals.  We have a local photographer who will be doing studio photos some time soon.Up to now most sales have been at local meetups or reptile shows so photos were not needed.  ...but we are all too aware of just how poor the photos are.  We mostly just post for discussion groups and forums not sales.  ,herpetoculture,cmlmjq2,1,t5_2tnhp
5386634,0,t1_cw01e3h,Yeah ya gotta breed em though theyre too damn expensive to just keep buying.  I go through a  xsmall ones a week or so ,herpetoculture,cw07bc1,1,t5_2tnhp
5465530,0,t1_cwa9p9i,ok good! He seems happy he also loves it when I take him outside to slither around out there. I really try to make sure he gets some enrichment at least!And yeah when I can afford a bigger tub Im hoping to expand his setup a bit this is just the biggest plastic tub I could find for now that wasnt like  inches tall. They had a few underbed containers that were bigger in floor space but they were super shallow! But if you have any suggestions Im more than open to them!,herpetoculture,cwa9uer,1,t5_2tnhp
6216801,0,t3_40qajk,My Cal King has been refusing food since midnovember and Im not too worried about it. I consulted a few of my more experienced snakekeeping friends and they all said the same thing as long as you monitor the snakes general health weight behaviour scaleseyes etc and see nothing of concern its not a big deal. Kingsnakes do naturally want to hibernate and some may be triggered to do so just by the change in daylight hours. Ive been offering mine a small rat fuzzy his favourites every few weeks just to see how he reacts and he has negative interest pretty much runs away from it but other than that he has been perfectly normal active and looks healthy. If he still wont eat at the end of January when daylight hours have picked back up Ill reassess but as long as hes active and not losing weight Im not stressed.Edit He finally ate something but now my BP seems to be refusing. So it goes.,herpetoculture,cywa7vz,6,t5_2tnhp
