What humans are good at is either  or type questions.If we wanted rd party candidates or a better system you would need to setup a series of runoffs each vote is between  people. It would work just like football  basketball  etc. If you want more information on this read the book the honest truth about dishonestly why we lie to ourselves. it has a chapter that explains at how we are very bad at making choices when a rd option is given.To summarize when given  options people will choose mainly between the two options that are closest to each other.Imagine you were going to buy a car you have  gas cars and  electric car you are looking over. The studies basically shows that in the vast majority of the time a gas car will be chosen more than . Even if the electric car is BETTER in just about every way people still choose the gas.

While their presence can have an indirect effect on crime rate their intended function is not crime prevention. Crime prevention is a mythical fairy tale fantasy. We can never prevent all crime. Therefore in their unending quest to achieve the American fantasy of crime prevention the police have increased in number and military hardware. No matter how much they increase crime will still occur. Meanwhile the people they are supposed to serve suffer the consequences of a bloated police state.Get back to the basics police enforce law they will never be able to prevent  of crime. It is impossible.Who prevents crime you ask? You and I do because we unlike the police are the only group with the ability to be virtually everywhere. Responsible citizens stop crime from happening or stop attempted crimes in progress. Police come in and capture criminals of attempted or performed crime and enforce the penalties of the law. That is all.,ronpaul,ci63a83,4,t5_2qh0r

A charter was a written statement of the Authority that British Government granted to the Governor of a colony and the liberties it granted to his subjects.gtBecause these charters were grants of freedoms the Americans at first had struggled to keep them. British Government of course had a right to withdraw its grants and sometimes it did so.

5772075,0,t1_cxbwtw8,Already. Lets take everything you just said in kind. Preface You seriously sound like a Trump supporter not someone who was a Ron Paul supporter and now support trump. Almost every point you countered with was Well. I agree with him. Congratulations. That doesnt mean that the rest of us agree on those same issues. So Im going to take each of your points and respond in kind. gtI support it can you explain why I should not support it? Mexico will pay for the wall he says so whats the problem?Alright. First example of the I support it. Why shouldnt everyone else? Because its fucking stupid as hell. Its a waste of money. If both illegal immigrants and drugs want to find their way into this country they will. Plus if we look at history  another country tried this Wall idea and we see how well it worked. Ill let you figure out which one.gtCan you please provide proof where Trump said that he and ill quote what you said All immigrants to be registered into a database and monitored and his reasoning for that registration and monitoring of the ENTIRE immigrant population is due to religion. Please note ive seen every speech watched  of his television appearances and have read several of his books including Crippled America his newest.Congratulations again. Youve seen  of his speeches read his books and still agree with him. Now I know that youre actually a Republican masquerading as a Libertarian. There is a link to a story during a Press conference where Trump was talking about immigration. I will give you the point that he never said anything about a database or being for it but when asked about it  he didnt dismiss it either. In politics you have to read between the lines sometimes. gta person who believes that a particular race is superior to another.... You said yourself youve seen all of his speeches. Youre trying to tell me the man is not racist against the middle east? Saying all of em are terrorists and wanting to bomb the shit out of them? Youre trying to tell me the man is not racist against hispanics? Likening them all to gangsters and rapists? I guess if we go with the literal definition of Racism. I can say that all Russians are warmongers and drunks. Im not saying Im superior to them so its not racist. I can say that all blacks are thugs and robbers because I dont believe that I am superior to them therefore its not racist. You used google and thats fine. I used MiriamWebster. Also  Like a true republican you didnt mention the SECOND part of the definition listed on both Miriam and Google Racial Prejudice and Discrimination.  gtLong winded explanation of why Trump isnt antiwoman.... Champion of Women. Riiiiight. Allow me to put a few points.  Trump  on his twitter  unreported sexual assaults in the military  only  convictions. What did these geniuses expect would happen when you put men and women together? I guess that can go after men. Saying we are incapable of controlling our sexual desires. The numerous times throughout the past decade where he has insulted female reporters calling them ugly saying they had faces of dogs and calling pumping breast milk disgusting. Seriously man. If you judge a woman only by her looks  youre misogynist. More recently During the debates he implied that Megyn Kelly now I dont like her either was on her period during the debates and thats why she was going after him. But sure hes a champion for all women. gt Youre wrong on this. Corporate Business TaxAm I? I will give you points. I was looking at something he said back in . His current tax plan would be cutting the corporate tax to . Still. Were cutting the corporate tax from  to . Im cool with tax breaks for the lower and middle classes... but why Corporations? These people are already rich and were making them richer. Not to mention that his view on the taxes has flipflopped probably  or  times in the past  years which is troubling. I personally prefer a candidate who has been solid across the board. gtI also believe its a hoax. A hoax is a great word to describe global warming. You could also go with conspiracy theory. .... REALLY? I guess if youre a flatearther and believe that NASA is also a conspiracy global warming is a hoax. But then youve got bigger problems. But sure. Scientists around the world who are all reporting in the same thing  that our planet is warming  and its most likely due to human interference is trendy. gt As opposed to buying the oil from the middle east? I think drilling our own oil here would lower fuel costs here for Americans. Why is that a bad thing?I mean if youre down for still being dependent on fossil fuels and not seeking out BETTER forms of RENEWABLE energy  thats fine. I personally look at focusing on bettering the technology for electric cars completely eliminating all need for crude oil from the middle eastour own shores. It has nothing to do with doing it on our own soil or not.gtLiterally every position he has is brilliant.This is why I cant take you seriously. The man would turn the country into a Police state. More NSA monitoring Large Government Closing the Borders Ignore the fact that we were once immigrants. Strong Eminent Domain Big Government again Plus all the things I listed in this comment. A few more things looking through the comments on this thread gtYou think freeways and shit would exist without it? On eminent domainNo one is arguing that its a necessary evil. However invoking it for his own propertiesthe Keystone XL Pipeline is bullshit. Eminent domain is one of those things that you need to ride the line with one step in either direction and its terrible. gtAgainst Muslims.See the Racism comment I made. I dont think theres a word like Racism for religions  but hes antimuslim. Pretty outspoken about it. Hes allowed to be antimuslim but the second he starts acting on it  It goes against that whole freedom of religion thing in that one document... oh yeah. The Constitution. gt If we would have had Trump in  he wouldnt have gone into war with iraq he was against it that war caused the destabilization of the middle east and it caused the rise of ISIS.... Yeah. He would have just Bombed the Shit out of them. Civilians be damned. gtut I bet in November when Obamacare kicks in and we have Syrian refugees smearing their Muslim shit all over our majority white country I bet youre going to feel a lot differently.Well. There ya go. Thats why you agree with Trump. Youre on the same grounds as him. How was that not flagged as racist? Because theyre from Syria? Tell ya what. Do everyone a favor buddy.

Private business and free enterprise would always do a better job. Whereas Bernie Sanders wants more government involvement further expansion of federal social programs and agencies. Ron Paul wants to remove entire federal government agencies and programs which are unconstitutional objectively wasteful and obvious failures.
