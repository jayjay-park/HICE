95101,0,t1_cep8909,I think some Cignall shops sell them if you have those up there or maybe a head shop but seriously they give a weak hit and my mates ones leave sticky brown shit round your mouth it collects at the top for some reason and he has to wipe it all the time.

7341895,0,t1_d2bb9kt,You are not segregated.. You are not in any way doing anything other than sitting in a park getting high. There is no positive way the media can report this and the only conversation that it will start in the wider community is that we have nothing to do but get high in a park on a Monday. When you act like fools it hurts us all as it makes it much easier for people to think we are all fools. As someone else pointed out no one got drunk at the anti lockout law protests. They put their drug using desires below that of their desire to see their cause succeed. All you have shown is that we are more interested in getting high than having a meaningful legitimate protest. ,ausents,d2cq1u6,3,t5_2tdnb

Also the further north you get the harder to find and more expensive it becomes while Adelaide due to more relaxed growing laws has some of the finest cannabis in the country. Thus is coming from a Victorian and we are renowned for thinking we are the best at everything. Its more bountiful in Victoria but we have a lot of low quality mass grown cannabis on the market as well. ,ausents,d4e3s99,5,t5_2tdnb

A small few LPs have their shit together and produce top quality products there are a few very large corporate entities and a bunch of very regular quality producers most of them charge above street price for an interior product.

I just organised some yesterday. Anal suppository for cancer  each. These are  thc cbd extractions. Thats a fair price and sure as shit cheaper than what legal medical canna companies will be selling it at. Also keep a micro grow of a cbd strain under fluros so you can gift cuts to people. Keep cannabis a cottage industry not a corporate one. Heaps of good cbd strains out there. Heaps of testing kits to see what is in your product and sydney uni tests oils and tinctures.

11164270,0,t3_5zbtxp,With Vapes cheapest isnt always the best. Be prepared to pay a little more and get a quality unit. You wont regret it. With a decent vape youll get better AVB that you can cook with and youll also get potent reclaim. Cheaper vapes often burn the AVB and the reclaim can be difficult to harvest.I recommend the Mighty by Storz and Bickel but they are very expensive. They will last a long time and have great warranty support. A company named Boundless started making similar vapes at a cheaper price recently. Check out their CFX model at Ausvapes.Lastly there is a new vape by Vivant called the Alternate that has just hit shops and is getting good reviews. It is similar to the Crafty. I bought one last week for . Ill do a review soon.,ausents,dexgi8a,5,t5_2tdnb

Unfortunately if you were looking to plant outdoor now in Melbourne its starting to get too cold so the plants will become frostbitten so youll have to wait until later on in the year again. The good thing about growing indoors hydroponically means that you can control the enrivonments and so all year round growing is possible.,ausents,dgeyeoa,4,t5_2tdnb
