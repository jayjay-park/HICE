10685200,0,t1_ddhghqa,Hrm. I already have two cat trees. I figure it is entertainmentattention hes after because once I hit him with the squirt bottlewhich I hate using and he hates when I use it he finally came over to play with the toy I had in my hand. Ive got a basket of them and I might swap to a food giving toy since that seems to be one reward he likes. He enjoyed the little ball track I got him but doesnt play with it a ton maybe I could get a more stimulating ball to put in it?. He used to play fetch but he specifically loves very stiff crinkly balls and hes managed to play with two untill they turn into crumbles havent found the right stiffness again. So I might resume my search for those.,catproblems,ddi3j21,1,t5_2t8fv
