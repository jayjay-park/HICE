4866413,0,t1_cu7wg0f,Thank you for your reply! I am really pleased with this communities response. I aspire to be in the position you are. It is something I plan to work towards until success. I am not sure about the caths. The last time I was in the hospital they asked me several questions about going to the restroom and it seems my bladder clears itself out and I just pee. I dont know if thats still bad or what not. I thought the pain clinic I go to would write me a prescription for them but they didnt even schedule my next appointment until I called to verify the time. You dont have an appointment tomorrow.  Anyhow I want to ask and I hope this doesnt seem rude but has there been a change in the way you were approached romantically since your accident. You may very well be married but men and woman still vocalize their affections and I am wondering if you are hit on often or if the chair gets in the way. I make no assumptions and hope I am not offensive. ,spinalcordinjuries,cu7y5wr,2,t5_2zeh7

7320761,0,t1_d295j48,I put off stretching for a few years but spasms only get worse. My best advice is dont try to get into it force it to become habit. Early morning before getting out of bed middle of the day if possible and again for going to sleep. Your legs need this. IMO it really isnt optional if you are serious about reducing spasms.,spinalcordinjuries,d2abj6p,1,t5_2zeh7
9374273,0,t1_d9477zk,For me I just feel like I am going through hell. The trajectory of life available to me now doesnt appeal or excite me at all. So I just chill try to reduce discomfort and just wait until my card is punched.,spinalcordinjuries,d9497la,2,t5_2zeh7

10268651,0,t3_5n0dz6,C quad...I replied to a comment below with brettapproved.com for finding accessible restaurants venues and vacation spots but a very useful app I use on a daily basis is Rowmote Pro. Im not sure if it is only for Apple products but I have it on my iPad so I can control my mouse and keyboard on my computer without having to set it on my lap. My legs would spasm a bunch whenever I would set my laptop on my lap because the computer would get too hot. You can even use dictation through it to take advantage of talk to text.,spinalcordinjuries,dc80ajm,1,t5_2zeh7
10281151,0,t3_5n6vp8,I had some friends order and ship some of my favorite foods from back home and it made a world of difference after being stuck eating hospital food. Even something as simple as ordering a pizza could make your friends whole night if you cant make the trip out to see him.,spinalcordinjuries,dc9fauw,1,t5_2zeh7
10561777,0,t3_5r8w9u,Yes. I literally cannot find anything to be exited about look forward to or work towards now.The accessible or adaptive versions of my passions just dont do it for me.,spinalcordinjuries,dd5aoxm,6,t5_2zeh7

10941815,0,t3_5w94kv,I think you just gotta accept that the depression sadness and anger is part of you now. People often ask me what am I doing to be happy. The truth is nothing. The kind of view happiness I as a luxury. So much of my energy is dedicated to just trying to sustain this life. I dont get to think about doing XYZ cool things. I have to constantly solve problems that involve my limitations. The money I make isnt even mine its my disabilitys money. I have to stash it away incase something important breaks and buy a wheelchair van.  People will tell you that it down to prospective. Its always about perspective. I think its a load of crap. I typically find that there is are type s of people who do well. Those are the family types. The people who live for having good relationships and people who were not separated from something they love.Now dont get me wrong. I dont have anything against relationships. They are great. At the end of the day some of just dont get life fulfilling satisfaction out of relationships.Theres another guy I knew who sustained a spinal cord injury and he pisses sunshine and shits rainbows.  He is a writer. He did not get separated from his passion. He told me this. I got over the depression when I realize I was mourning over things I would never do anyways. I was never going to run a marathon or climb mountains. When I realize I was mourning over things I would never do they got easy.I know he was trying to help me out but this really just sadden me. Why? Because not a few days before he told me that I had put all my mountain climbing gear Craigslist. Some of us are happy. Some of us can fake it. Some of us are miserable.I can tell you this. Trying fake it or act like I am not miserable makes me feel worse it depresses me more. ,spinalcordinjuries,de8kkis,3,t5_2zeh7
