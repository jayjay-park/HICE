3673411,0,t1_cq8c2kg,I used Bentley Pointools to get the flythrough and Vegas to do the finalizing and effects. Bentley requires a license but I think you could get a trial without a watermark. You can also try Autodesk Navisworks but you would need the Simulate or Manage licenses Freedom will not render.Do you have any particular programs that you use? If you like you could send me some data and I could put something together for you.,3DScanning,cqazr6n,1,t5_2vqjh

4167387,0,t3_38iehg,This is a passive camera no IR lasers or projectors meaning it can work outdoors but it cant work in the dark. Stereo cameras have been around for a long time PointGray had one a decade ago and have never been very good. ZED seem to have done a good job but Im irked that they dont offer any raw data samples to download. That is a big red flag IMHO.,3DScanning,crvagct,3,t5_2vqjh
5134196,0,t1_cv4seq1,What would be really cool to see is integration between the scanner and some sort of software to determine the usefulness of a scan. Apparently ZampFs new software can suggest recommended positions to scan next. If you were able to marry the software with an autonomous track style cart and have it drive to the suggested scan position every time then there would almost be  chance of failure. The nice thing too is that the ZampF software while suggesting your next location also stitches everything too so when you get back to the office you have a lot less work to do.I hope to be meeting with the sales guy from ZampF in the next month or so to test out the new X scanner. Im really interested in seeing how well the suggested next scan features works. Could potentially save a project if someone really green goes and does a scan.,3DScanning,cv4v1m4,1,t5_2vqjh
5203586,0,t1_cvd1gaq,I almost forgot to mention both of these scanners dont work well in direct sunlight either so make sure when you are doing scans that its in the shade.,3DScanning,cvd849o,1,t5_2vqjh

5819819,0,t3_3uwmya,If you go through google maps a lot youll see they have scanned the basic outline of the Earth with photogrammetry for some years now. I only wonder if they are using user maps browsing data and computers to enhance their computation of the photogrammetry. For instance as you are browsing google maps your computers browser is rendering part of the world in D is the data then being transmitted back to google? and are they using yourour computer power to improve the accuracy of the world mesh?Maybe Tango is for the medium level d scanning for inside buildings I could see to increase their ad revenue streams they would D scan everything.,3DScanning,cxii4j6,1,t5_2vqjh

6529985,0,t1_czupqg5,Dont forget to inquire about tracking as well. I know even with the Artec scanners some items that should only consist of  scans have to be done in  because the scanner cannot stay on track very well. It isnt a big deal if you have a powerful computer to align everything back at home but can be a problem for quick alignments in the field on a Surface Pro or any other laptop.,3DScanning,czur30c,3,t5_2vqjh
6647506,0,t1_d06bxjq,Its likely they used photogrammetry not a kinect. I mean I dont know what that stupid video is about  youre right thats not when they scanned it. They probably dont want to reveal their real tactic.,3DScanning,d06wroj,1,t5_2vqjh
6940226,0,t1_d12ww6b,Thats a good point! With laser scanners your second hand sellingpurchase options will limited. Using off the shelf photography and presentation equipment will make it much easier.,3DScanning,d1305j2,1,t5_2vqjh
