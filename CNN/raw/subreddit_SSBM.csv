1025287,0,t1_chkniqi,I have made the decision to switch to Ice Climbers. I was playing around with the common ones like Fox Falco Captain Falcon and Marth and just couldnt get a feel for them. I played with Ice Climbers and fell in love with how they move and how they smash. The two characters that I plan on using as my main and secondary are going to be Ice Climbers and Mario. Ill still use Kirby when Im playing with friends but you were  right. Hes just the worst character. ,SSBM,chkty49,1,t5_2so9j

2071864,0,t3_2il1it,First of all I love you prog thank you for all the amazing things youve done for this community. Im a late bloomer when it comes to competitive smash living in some remote little country with barely any other players. It was you and d that played a huge role in captivating my interest.The thing for me is how can they justify replacing melee with smash so quickly? It will have had about  months of players developing the scenemetagame which is just way too little for any real display of skill. Evo is not E. Its not supposed to be a commercial event that showcases the shiniest and newest stuff. Its a hardcore gaming event that should have some integrity towards the fanbase that it builds upon.I do not hate Smash at all. But acting like its a competitive title just because Melees fanbase turned Melee into one is just downright offensive to all the people who worked their asses off including you. It has to prove its own worth and this takes time.,SSBM,cl36gyj,15,t5_2so9j

Nevertheless Im willing to bet most people in this sub support you no matter what but you wont hear this type of statements in twitter and such because thats just how the internet works. I appreciate you trying to bring a civilized discussion to the sub dismiss the blind haters and thanks for being a great public figure for melee.

2219717,0,t3_2khyet,Its pretty interesting to see how people are starting to use edge cancels more effectively specifically with Falco I know Zhu uses it a lot to try to get to the other side of battlefield after hitting someone with a bair for example. Saw PP do it in the first game once...the small things you notice in Melee that are just so cool. Mango does it at the  minute mark to avoid getting edgeguarded as well. PP hits nairshinedair twice as someone who rarely plays against spacies because there are very few in my area and no Falcos seeing stuff like this is great. Im still at the stage where Im grinding tech skill more than matchup specific knowledge still so my input probably isnt very valuable but alas...I feel like PP uses the angled ftilt a lot more than other players something I think he said in his AMA. Did it twice in the second game. Dash attackup tilt feels so oddly janky but it works with Falco. Another thing Ive realized great players are really good at doing is using weak hits as combo extenders. Which is really basic probably but its something I feel I personally really need to be cognizant of when playing think of the third stock kill on Mango in game . I like Tophs commentary in this set. He seems more restrained than usual. On a separate note....I wonder how we can improve discussion participation. I think theres value to discussing pro matches and user matches Id hazard a guess to say that user matches are probably going to be closer to the average skill level of the readers here but theres a ton of high level stuff to learn from pro matches. Maybe have discussion prompts in the post accompanying the match or just do one game? Having prompts like lets discuss PPs punishes in this game or something like that? ,SSBM,cllz9gx,2,t5_2so9j

2249166,0,t1_clponx8,. The hack pack doesnt exist for GC yet. The hardest part of ledge dashing is to make sure you have the most actionable invincibility frames possible. I think the earliest you can drop is like frame  after grabbing the ledge which is under human reaction time so if you want to do a frameperfect ledge dash you have to just know the timing and the only way to do that is just to practice it over and over. You can practice by spawning a flipper in training mode and putting it by the ledge and trying to ledge dash through it. Yes ledge dashing is done by wavedashing after dropping from a ledge. . Shffl uair is a bit slower than nair so more players will be able to react and punish it. If they do opt to block it a crossup shffl uair will be safe. But really I think you should save uair for juggling Marth. Unsolicited tip to start try playing a more grounded neutral game against Marth. Understand exactly where his fsmash range is and just dash dance outside of it. If he whiffs a grounded move run in jc grab uthrow uair. If he jumps either stuff it with nair or dash out of range and then nair him after. If he wave dashes back just move forward and dont give back the space he just gave up. He cant wavedash back forever. Sometimes Marth will try to wavedash forward to grab you or hit you so you may want to throw out some defensive nairs in place or fadeaway nairsdairs in place when you think he might try to run up. Again Im not a Fox main so take my advice with a grain of salt,SSBM,clppwfp,2,t5_2so9j

2474285,0,t3_2nvlwm,EDIT Just to be clear this is a small statistical analysis of best performing smashers unlike the MIOM who is the most skilled.I think this is a very interesting debate so I did a bit of analysis on the performance of the big names at majors my reasoning being this is where smashers are likely to perform their best. I couldnt do it for all tournaments and couldnt really factor in EU tournaments sorry Leffen but I tried to account for how meaningful each of these majors were by assigning each a coefficient. The  tournaments I chose to be majors were Apex  ROM  Pats House  SKTAR  MLG Anaheim CEO  Kings of Cali  EVO  and The Big House . It is hard to define since some tournaments have enormous attendance but not the big names e.g. Fight Pitt V and vice versa. Plus some of these tournaments are qualifiers for the major majors but to discount SKTAR  and others would be unfair on many who put in great performances.Anyway the list came out as thisIn picture formor as a tableNo. | Name| | Mango | PPMD | Armada | MewKing | Hungrybox | Leffen | Axe | Hax | Lucky | Plup | Westballz | Silent Wolf | Fiction | Fly Amanita | Colbol | PewPewU | Shroomed | aMSa | Abate | Kirbykaze | SFAT | MacD | The Moon | ZeRo | Zhu | ChuDat | DJ Nintendo | SJ | Nintendude | Eddy Mexico | Ice | Chillin | Ken | KoreanDJ | HugSI dont expect this to agree with the MIOM list since theyll be accounting for all tournaments including EU tournaments and looking in a more qualitative way trying to get a feel for the smashers year but there you go.Things I agree with hereAxe th Plup high.Things I disagree withFly not higher maybe Leffen gt Hbox I was surprised how it turned out to be nowhere near as close as ArmadaMK. sfts rating is kind of... artificially high due to the MLG format. I fully expect Armada to get  over PPMD for the MIOM list.Ive thought about trying to do a more full analysis by including many tournaments and somehow weighting them based on attendance and prize pool but that sounds like a BIG task.,SSBM,cmhiysg,14,t5_2so9j

2485429,0,t1_cmiz1kp,  Laudandus ShiekFormerly hailing from the Midwest Laudandus has been making great strides in his game since moving to NorCal. His drive to improve is selfevident with his recent results at The Foundry as well as at national tournaments such as The Big House . Look for big things to come from this Sheik main as we move into the  season.  Scar FalconGone are the days in which Scar used to place Top  at regionals and nationals. Although Scar has moved on to other life endeavors the most electrifying man in Melee still performs well at his locals and makes his presence known with his emphatic commentary and funny community stories.  Trail ICs GanonAn oldschool Ice Climbers main Trail also employs a strong Ganon secondary that he opts to use for certain matchups. Although he doesnt attend many local events you can still find him at some nationals including Evo  and TBH where he placed just one round outside of the top .  Lord HDL Marth LinkHailing from Puerto Rico Lord HDL places at the very top in his local scene along with ExcelZero. Although hes known in the USA for his Link proficiency he has also picked up a strong Marth to overcome Links weaker matchups such as Sheik.  Lucien ShiekA hidden boss in Norcal who is well known for his meticulous spacing and fundamentals. Although he is busy with other life responsibilities he shows strong performances at nationals despite not playing in local tournaments.  Tai MarthOne of the long standing veterans of the Arizona region Tai has a very crisp and technical Marth that can punish his opponents very hard with sleek wavedashes and aerials.  Gravy FalconGravy turned heads when he made a four stock comeback on KoreanDJs Marth. With a strong drive and dedication to spend countless hours in the lab Gravy made it payoff with an appearance in the top  of The Big House .  DruggedFox FoxUnder the radar by many Druggedfox can still compete with the best defeating Colbol at Tipped Off . He made one national appearance but was a noshow on day . Its hard to judge where his skill level is at but hes a player that no one wants to play early in a bracket.  Tope SheikTope has demonstrated what it means to play a nononsense defensive Sheik with strong tech chases to a generation of Sheik mains. Although his best days are behind him he can be seen seldomly in the MDVA region placing very well at the local tournaments.  Arc MarthArc is an innovative Marth main from Austin Texas. Recently he gained notoriety for his big wins over names such as Toph DoH DJNintendo MacD and Hax. His extensive work on pivot tech has grown popular on Smashboards and he is largely credited with its growing use.,SSBM,cmizfk1,15,t5_2so9j

2521837,0,t1_cmnq9ic,Thank you for your answer! I really do need to play more Melee. Ninety percent of my time in the lab is spent in PM working on Kirby or Ice Climbers. When I do play Melee I usually just bust techskill practicing Lcancelling wavelanding and desynching approach options. When I first learned how to play Melee I learned Mario because I felt he was pretty basic of a character to learn and because of A Rookie and ScorpionMaster. I switched to Ice Climbers when I saw Wobbles Evo matches and ever looked back. It took one Falcon combo video to really change my mind on who I wanted to play. I just decided I was gonna get good at Falcon and spent a ton of time with him. I think that Ice Climbers will really teach me patience when I play because right now I have none. I just rush in with Kirby in PM. If I get hit I get hit and go from there. Its pretty much that way with every character but Ive noticed it doesnt really work.gt...or even one youre better at.Im pretty bad with both honestly. I really dont know the games mechanics with the characters as well as I do in PM.After giving it a couple minutes of thought and really thinking about who lets me play how I want its definitely Ice Climbers. I love desynching Ice block or blizzard into grab handoffs. Theres just something about playing Ice Climbers that I dont feel when Im playing Falcon. I know that they will end up teaching me something about how I play and how I should play to better myself. Ill still play Falcon Ill nead him for teams but Im really just gonna focus on ICs.

2571227,0,t3_2p7slr,Falco gets to pick whichever map he wants against Falcon because PS FD Yoshis and FoD all favor him. Battlefield doesnt really favor either character significantly and dreamland is better for Falcon. As Falcon against Falco I usually ban FoD and FD because those are the worst. We usually go to battlefield anyway because spacey mains are usually afraid of taking Falcon to Yoshis for some strange reason. If Falcon doesnt ban Yoshis you should take him there. Yeah knee will kill you at like  but the stage is so small that Falcon has no room to breathe. Pokemon Stadium is probably your next best stage followed by battlefield. If Falcon wins game  hell ban FoD most likely so you should just take him to FD. Theres no reason you should ever have to play this matchup on dreamland his only favorable stage unless youre in finals.About the Yoshis fear thing though I think a lot of spacies especially old school ones are randomly afraid of Yoshis for no particular reason. Theyre just afraid of dying earlier and they blatantly disregard how many advantages spacies get on that stage. Besides if you go offstage on other stages to where you would have died on Yoshis you probably wont make it back anyway if the other player isnt completely stupid. Yoshis is just a generally misunderstood stage in general. As a spacey you should NEVER ban Yoshis unless you know that its the other players favorite stage. I guess you could ban it against Marth if youre just too uncomfortable on it in the matchup and would rather go to FoD.,SSBM,cmu74oi,7,t5_2so9j

Mango and PP havent attended any event so far and both have only one that is within driving distance of where they live. I think it is extremely unlikely that Mango or PP fly to another tournament to try and get into advanced bracket so they are not likely to make it in. It has also been said many times that mango doesnt really care about apex. Hbox CAN beat leffen at paragon. I dont think its that likely but it is possible based on bracket with Armada and a stacked lineup that he ends up outplacing leffen.

2601969,0,t3_2plxjl,I actually faintly remember an old compilation video released in the wake of the old falcon RR in memory of NessNoob RIP from Pound IV in  I believe. The video played to Drakes Forever ft. Kanye West Lil Wayne and Eminem and featured gameplay from Scar Hax Silentspectre and Darkrain. It was really cool because each falcon main had footage that corresponded with the lyrical styles of the different rappers versesScar  DrakeDef the main showboat of that era he had the most stylish combos at the time. Hax  KanyeHe used to be described as cocky back then and you could definitely tell when he was feeling himself you could hear prog and waffles amongst others mention that Hax became unstoppable with that New York crowd behind him.Silentspectre  Lil WaynePeople for sure considered him the weird one since there was always a distinctive type of jank to his playstyle that somehow managed to work out.Darkrain  EminemHad a very aggressive and technically overwhelming falcon. It could almost be described as angry with how fast and relentless it was. Keep in mind that this was from  so these generalizations dont really apply with the current players iterations but it was still a very awesome comparison of the top falcons of the time. Sadly I couldnt find the video anywhere it may have been deleted  so Ill just post the song here so that anyone who remembers that falcons from that era could definitely relate the playstyles of the falcons to the corresponding rapper.,SSBM,cmy7rbz,4,t5_2so9j

SleepyK gives a really good explanation of this in this video The video is long but you only need to watch the first  minutes after the linked time to get the answer to your question. The whole video is super helpful too.To expand on what he says Basically you can think of the game as a giant flow chart. Every microsituation represents a nod. In every microsituation you are making a decision even a decision to do nothing. In some situations you have lots of arrows or options leading to another situation e.g. when you are standing on the ground in actionable frames. In other situations you have few arrows e.g. getting shield pressured by Fox. Lots of arrows lead nowhere e.g. countering after you upthrow a spacie as Marth. So in each situation in which you find yourself or in each situation you find other players in videos in consider everything they can do in those situations and which ones are fruitful and which ones arent. ,SSBM,cn0wodx,1,t5_2so9j

I  know that the main problem with lasers in this mu is them screwing over your shffl game utilt always does a good job that already but I dont think this MU will be considered absolute trash once Falcons start to pump up their tech skill. Namely every move should be smash DIed and every laser should be powershielded. Perhaps the MU can get toned down to  in Falcos favor then. Ive been ranting about this a lot lately. The fact that powershielding projectiles consistently isnt considered an absolutely necessary barrier for entry in friggon  is ridiculous imo.

2877727,0,t3_2t2rjv,This is not a very good question in that its vague and hard to answer.  But I think I can still give a couple pieces of advice.  First of all you should basically never get shield grabbed.  That means you messed up.  All of Falcons aerials can be safe on shield.  Make sure you do them low to the ground or space them at their tip the latter is generally preferable but sometimes if you see an opportunity you dont have time to space yourself perfectly.  The other piece of advice I have is that you should try to get grabs.  Though it is VERY hard to grab someone who is camping you it completely ends the camping situation and you get them by the balls.  Moreover if someone is playing highly defensive then you arent under any real pressure to make something happen so you can take your time and try hard to find the right place to go for a grab.,SSBM,cnv76h4,18,t5_2so9j

Platform cancelling a quick attack from the ledge is also an option but very advanced and something that takes a lot of practice and is unique to each stage. You do need to be really good at ledgedashing with Pikachu because its such a good option for him.One important thing to know is that if someone is not giving you any respect at the ledge whatsoever you can let go of the ledge and drop down a bit double jump and then up air as you rise so that you get the semispike frames of the move and if theyre standing at the edge in range itll send them over your head and down reversing the edgeguard situation. Once people have been hit by that a couple of times theyll probably give you a lot more respect at the ledge and hang back a bit more. Ledgedash Usmash is another viable respect me tool once you can do good enough ledgedashes to have some invincibility to work with though Axe particularly favors ledgedash grab and does that a lot more. Backthrow is especially devastating to Fox if you get it right at the edge from a ledgedash.Pika can struggle to escape corner pressure without invincibility as he doesnt really have good hitboxes to force his way out but when hes hanging off the ledge hes actually much more dangerous than most characters to approach and you shouldnt have too much trouble once you have some of the more advanced options down pat.,SSBM,cr03jgq,2,t5_2so9j

3951331,0,t3_35pzs8,How do people feel about alternative stagepicking rules? In particular Ive been thinking about a bo ruleset like this  neutrals Yoshis Battlefield Dreamland  counterpicks FD FoD Pokemon Stadium For the first game each player strikes  stage order determined by rps. After the first game the loser gets to ban  stage then the winner gets the pick the next stage. DSR applies to counterpick stages only. So if you previously won on Battlefield you can pick it again assuming your opponent doesnt ban it. But if you previously won on FD you cant pick it again for the remainder of the set.I see a couple motivations for a ruleset like this. The first is that FD should really be a counterpick stage. Its an extremely polarizing stage that changes the game a lot and has a big affect on matchup spreads. FoD is whatever but I dont think most people would mind moving it to a counterpick. The second is that this lets us have bans in a bo even with a small stagelist and DSR otherwise you kinda run out of stages. I think that having at least one ban is really important given how much stages can affect a matchup. No free wins on extremely onesided stages.The main cons are that the DSRcounterpick rule is a little complicated FD or FoD actually is occasionally struck to in some matchups and it might slightly hurt characters who really hate platforms e.g. ICs or slightly help characters that really love them e.g. Yoshi Ganon. In general itll also lead to more games on the neutral stages which might limit variety a little due to their similar platform layout.Theres also some interesting strategy on how you use your bans which could be a good or bad thing. As an example imagine youre a Fox facing a Marth and you win on Battlefield. Do you ban FD and potentially face two counterpicks to Yoshis or do you ban Yoshis eat a probable loss on FD and then limit his second counterpick options?Overall I think its a slightly more fair ruleset but one that will result in slightly less variety of games including mostly eliminating a couple of really interesting but fairly onesided matchups Marth vs. spacies on FD.EDIT Also you could totally add Mute City as a counterpick since the ability to ban a stage means that people can avoid it if it really skews a matchup. Major plus.,SSBM,cr6ooy7,13,t5_2so9j

4381067,0,t1_csjh186,Ive used claw ever since picking the game back up about  years ago. Its never been anything but comfortable for me but I didnt have any muscle memory to break.The nice part about coming back to the game after not playing it for many years was that I spend some time thinking about and optimizing how I wanted to perform various actions on a controller. I had been a mostly PC gamer for quite a few years and hadnt played much on any console for a long time so I had almost no existing muscle memory or comfort with controllers.From that perspective claw was a nobrainer especially since I planned on maining Peach. Otherwise theres way too much stuff put on your right thumb anything you can do to reduce its workload is worth it.

4427349,0,t1_csoqs92,yeah I forgot about Forward thanks for the reminder.Id put Forward in the same category as PC and PP in terms of playstyle. Forward was not hyper technical like Shiz or Westballz. He was basically the PC Chris of AZ at his height relying on good reads and spacing. He advanced the laser game a bit and played based on the float like a butterfly sting like a bee tactic of approaching with lasers into rush down and then run away lasers immediately after to keep his opponents completely off balance and forcing them to thread the needle to get in on him. PP has perfected that tactic nowadays but also focuses heavily on dashdancing which he criticises many falcos for not utilizing due to overdependence on lasers but Forwards influence on PPs style is clear even PP told me so in conversations back before he was a top player but other than that he was just a solid player.

4496572,0,t1_csxfjqv,Yeah I didnt think the PSYSBF idea through very well lol.Like Ive already said though this isnt directly a balance attempt. Its an attempt to remove degeneracy from the stage list. Theres absolutely no reason for FD to be neutral and it doesnt make sense for my characters best stage to be a counterpick while the stage that he doesnt have a functional neutral game on is somehow a starter. I have to burn a ban in every single set ever in a stage where my character sucks really bad and they dont have to worry since my strong stage isnt on the starter list. Yeah I play Falcon but I dont think that should invalidate my opinion. The stage list is plainly and overtly biased against my character lol.I also kind of think that Peach has a much easier time in general and that the current stagelist is really good for her since shes generally pretty strong on FD and is always good on FoD. In fastfaller matchups stage striking is generally biased towards her and the starting stage is probably going to be FDFoDDreamland all of which benefit her as a character. She also has waaay easier of a time winning game  vs spacies than Falcon Puff or Sheik since she has an answer to them on FD. Slightly nerfing her stage striking doesnt seem like an issue to me since none of YSBFDL are overtly bad against spacies and Armada always strikes there anyway. ,SSBM,csxg707,1,t5_2so9j
4499128,0,t1_csxot1w,Why dash dance? I mean her aerials are quick and your range is long so you cant really dash out of a laggy attack and back in at least not as well as you can out space her. You just want to keep space against her really when you dash dance you lose options in favor of staying noncommittal and mobile but its really hard for puff to get in on Marth when he can use all of his ground options to sway at puff. Im not saying never dash dance against puff but I feel like if youre playing neutral that way your giving puff more holes to get in close and Marth cant get her off once shes in. If you dash away and plan to dash back in she can follow you be within your range so you can no longer threaten with quick tipper moves and hit you with her fast aerials. Try checking out PPU vs hbox and see what he does in neutral. Your goal really is to swat at her until you hit her up then juggle her so she cant get down,SSBM,csxrpy2,1,t5_2so9j

4560158,0,t1_ct5dy9b,I think its this if not . Yoshi as I mentioned above has fantastic options for separating and killing Nana dsmashdtilt and also egg. After that its just a matter of using double jump armor well. Anyone with great air mobility is going to do well against IC Peach mostly and Yoshi certainly has that with his djc and armor.Edit I stand by this still. The videos uPsyRex posted show for the most part that Yoshi trumps IC. Another thing that I didnt mention Yoshi is the only character in the game who can parry grabs. While many of ICs grab setups involve other moves like neutral B or down B that still lowers the danger of getting grabbed considerably in comparison to every other character in the game.,SSBM,ct5fbo2,1,t5_2so9j
4560215,0,t1_ct5eybt,Egg lay is pretty good for separating them especially considering that Nana wont mash out if shes caught. Dsmash and dtilt are also pretty difficult for ICs to deal with.

4587203,0,t1_ct8p96x,I disagree with players disliking each other being a bad thing. Leffen has caused the most upsets and improvement in the scene just by coming out and running train on people and being a dick.Players straight up dislike each other all the time in the FGC because that shit happens. People dont play nice because theyre both part of a community people shit talk and have differences and dislike each other often because they just dont get along because some people just dont get along.Just because everything isnt love and kumbaya doesnt mean its bad for the community. Its really just when dudes go crazy or take it too far.Like good example Bushinstyle vs Marq Teddy in SF. Bushinstyle calls Marq a no name scrub and Mark doesnt drop a single game against him in their whole set. In the last match hes trash talking as hes fucking the other guy up and does a ninja ass finger thing at him. Those dudes hated each other and it was hype and fucking nuts.Example of when you should call a stop to it is when Noel Brown beat the shit out of this other MvC player who was sleeping with his girlfriend and then he got arrested. That shits clearly too far.,SSBM,ct8tcxu,10,t5_2so9j

4603376,0,t1_ctanyyq,Falcos worst matchup is Fox? LOL. Falco and fox go . Every fox player I know loves playing falco and every falco player loves playing fox its like goku vs vegeta they both have the tools to destroy each other. I would argue falco vs peach and falco vs puff are  which is absolute blasphemy to the spacies cant possibly have any bad matchups circlejerk that has existed for a long time but just ask yourself what can falco actually do to puff? Lasers dont work very well especially since she can crouch beneath them. You cant edgeguard her you cant combo her you cant shield pressure her killing off the top is far harder with falco than with fox and if you get rested your chance of recovering is far worse than foxs and if puff gets falco off stage hes basically dead . Puff is basically the perfect falco counter based on all of her properties. anyone who says thats  isnt being realistic. If one character has a harder time killing another character than that character has killing them thats called a bad matchup. Would anyone honestly say falco can kill puff just as easily as puff can kill him? The peach matchup is just as bad for many of the same reasons. falco cant combo peach effectively because peach can spam nair to combobreak by trading with falco. falco loses every trade with peach because she has far superior recovery so if they both hit each other just as hard peach still wins in each instance. peach can combo falco more effectively than puff peach can chain grab falco she can edgeguard him effectively she can float over lasers. Falco can barely edgeguard peach as well her umbrella outprioritizes dair and unlike fox falco cannot nair into upsmash or upthrow into upair or waveshine into upsmash so he has no guaranteed kills on peach the way fox does. every single stock is a struggle.both peach and jiggs thrive on horizontal recovery and die from vertical hits. falco specializes in horizontal kills while his vertical kit consist of shine towards the top off a platform which is hard to hit and dtilt which has too much startup lag no range isnt safe on shield and cannot be comboed into effectively on floaties. clearly not a  matchup hence why falcos in general have so many issues facing peach and puff. the entire reason most top players who play falco hate playing the matchup and pickup fox is because its so difficult not because its  or in their favor.Id also argue that MarthPeach is  not in marths favor like everyone says for some crazy reason. And MarthPuff is like  at best. He has very few tools to kill them with at any  which is why you see puffs and peaches living so long against Marth. Because of that I feel FalcoMarth dual mainingwhich I do is not very good because they both have amazing kits for dealing with most characters but cant handle the floaties the way fox can. PPMD performed exactly how I expected him to against HBox due to both characters having IMO a bad matchup when he is clearly a better player. Theoretically if two players are of even skill the player with a better matchup will win provided they dont kill themselves. So if one player is better than another and still loses it is a definite sign of a bad matchup andor killing themselves.,SSBM,ctauc9o,11,t5_2so9j

I talked with Mafia and the conversation was pretty much about me not doing the things I was doing before to get myself better and I agreed with that.I got th in my pool which I wasnt so happy about but afterwards I bought a new pair of shoes venues in a mall and I realized this was just like any other tourny so I felt pretty good for amateur bracket. Doesnt really matter how well I do Ill be coming out again next time so theres no reason to feel bad about it especially because Melees just a cool hobby.I got nd in the amateurs bracket beating people who I havent beaten yet before too. I got in via winners side and a friend of mine whos tag is Bugatti got the better of me in both sets of GFs.

4720286,0,t3_3fkrrs,I do think she is the most underdeveloped of the top tier characters honestly. Im not going to pretend like I know what it takes to push her to the next level because I dont but when players like Plup are beginning to get top  at Evo we can infer the character is moving in the correct direction. She is able to play very well against spacies and Marth which puts her in a very good position but like you said shes a noob character which is why I think a lot of people who begin with Sheik switch to a Fox or Falco thus leaving us with an underdeveloped Sheik meta. Hopefully though Plup KK Shroomed and please please please God let him keep playing Sheik MewKing continue to develop a character and get her to that next level.

4762594,0,t1_ctuum6s,Honestly though Borp is a pretty bad role model.  He is absolutely limiting himself by not incorporating more of the conventional techniques in his play.  I mean its fun to watch him play and its cool that he has a trademark style like that but hes actually nowhere near the top tier of players well below top  and however good he might be with his current style he would be better if he mixed in some of the technical stuff too.  Hes just not giving himself as many ingame options as other players.  Its kinda like being good at playing basketball with one hand  its still pretty cool but youre never gonna be as good as someone equally skilled who uses their full set of tools so to speak.  From someone who played casual melee for a long time and casual brawl for even longer the technical stuff is soooo fun and rewarding to learn.  You can absolutely do it all it takes is practice and determination.  Eventually stuff thats way too hard for you now will become easy!  I mean you should play the game however you want and do what seems cool to you but I would highly recommend trying to learn the technical stuff and incorporating it into your practice routine.,SSBM,ctuvbd2,14,t5_2so9j

4792079,0,t1_ctyjtfm,The idea of Dreamland being bad to marth is at least  years old. People kept repeating themselves and it stuck. In my opinion platform height is a very very weak argument marth has enough room to dance around there which means he still can combo his foes as well defend himself. People also say that marth doesnt have kill power in dreamland without tipper but marth is essentially an edge guarder and he should do it very well in dreamland.    Too bad marth meta goes through a stagnant state since forever pretty much like sheiks meta was before the Sheik Fabulous  Plup Shroomed Kira and Druggedfox.

If you hit all the buttons and your character only jumps you hit LR too early as trying to airdodge while in the jumpsquat animation does nothing.    If you hit all the buttons and your character leaves the ground before air dodging then you hit LR too late.

It makes me feel helpless when I dont have that direction for my practice.If youre at the point where youve been labbing and playing for a while you probably have a list of bad habits you havent actively worked on.Bad habits often become a significant obstacle to other parts of your gameplay which might be more refined.The next time you play you should focus on making a list of bad habits. Just spend around an hour  games.            Over the course of those games there should be patterns that arise of mistakes you often make. You should be actively looking for those patterns of behavior. As soon as one enters your mind write it down or type it into a text file with as much context as you can remember. Who What When Where and why stuff Context is key so when you come up with multiple key part is multiple solutions you can passively think about it until the situationcontext happens again.

The only currently demonstrated ways to really get around with yoshi and actually approach at the high levels use a lot of wonky platform movement to keep your approaches vague and ambiguous. Shield pressure on the other hand is really hard to deal with.

If you can do running upsmash or jumpcanceled grab then you can do shine upsmash and shine grab. You just put a shine out before you JC the upsmash or grab. Its possible to do JC upsmash with the cstick as well. I just hit up on the analog stick and then up on the cstick relatively at the same time. Really you do the upsmash like  frames later because you have to enter jump squatknee bend first. I still have yet to get SHDL down. I heard thats it less of getting your thumb to B but more of a rhythmic timing but I cant confirm since I cant do it consistently. Try switching to Y if you havent already.

4983960,0,t1_cumqaxh,It kinda depends on what the Fox likes to do. If you have a read on his movement you could go for a fullhop uair covering the entire platform. You could wait for him to go to a side platform and fair or uair him. Fox doesnt really have a good way to come down from that position unlike Falco. If he wants to come down with an aerial you can dashdance grab whatever he tries. Try DDing near the inner edge of one of the side platforms. If he wants to come down more safely he has to do it somewhere where youre not covering. Either he has to find a place where youre not covering because youre bad or he has to bait you into moving somewhere or being in lag somewhere and then he can come down somewhere else. I think the optimal thing to do is wait and react. What exactly do you do when youre waiting and reacting? Why isnt it working? ,SSBM,cumr2xg,2,t5_2so9j

5192218,0,t3_3lwqm7,If I actually want to be a top playerwin tournaments is there really any point to playing any character other than FoxMarthFalco? There seems to be a consensus growing among a lot of players that as these  characters continue to optimize their play other characters like Puff Peach and Sheik will fall further and further behind.But what is even the basis for this? Other people are saying Shiek is on the rise that Falco is falling behind nowadays. I think PPMD has Shiek at rd on his tier list. Mango thinks Falcon can take supermajors and go all the way while Armada just doesnt think Peach has the tools to truly compete at the top level. I understand tier listsmatchups are very dependent on opinionsubjective and that they fluctuate with the metagamebut to what extent are they objectively true? It would seem player matchups matter more than tiers especially at the top but at the same time well likely never see a Luigi or Samus or even another ICs main get Top  at majors. Is this because of the caliber of player using these characters? Or is it simply that the character isnt good enough?Even looking at videos a lot of the time say Armadas Peach gets beaten by Leffen or PPMD for example Im not really seeing something inescapable or a Street Fighteresque vortex or just a shrugyourarmswhatcouldido scenario i see the same thing when a Fox beats another Fox or when a Marth beats a Falcospacing around their offensive options keeping favorable spacing reading what options the opponent wants to use and taking those good options away and so on. Usually when hightop level players lose its general reasons or holes in their play or variancenot really characterspecific reasons.Am I way off base here?  ,SSBM,cvbuss1,3,t5_2so9j

For instance if Kiras projected to play a lot of Sheik players he might have a very deep run.Hugs gt Druggedfox  KirbyKaze gt The Moon gt Zhu  NintendudeHugs Druggedfox KK and The Moon could all potentially make good runs. Hugs is consistent. Druggedfox has the highest upset potential imo. The Moon could also upset some players but I think his peak is lower than Druggedfox. Zhu and Nintendue are consistent but they rarely upset people they are expected to lose against.Some other random thoughts Professor Pro for  seems like great value to me. Dizzkidboogie at  is interesting but risky. Cactuar at  is also interesting but Im not sure if its worth the risk.

Basically DL forces you to work harder for punishes and you lose alot of ability to punish but neutral is so far tilted for Fox on YS that it makes up the difference with ease. Although you have to work harder on DL if Fox is on point you wont get much chance to work at all on YS.

Every top BW player stuck with SC when it was released yet BW viewership began plummeting after the match fixing scandal and those viewers wernt going to SC which had even less viewership. MSL went from having a bank as its sponsor to the Korean mega upload clone Big File and folded right after the match fixing scandal came out. It was huge.

5459281,0,t1_cw9abev,I know what you are saying but you have to understand something natural talent doesnt not get you very far. People may point to one example here or there and say Well that person barely plays and they are soo good.  times out of  they are referring to an amateur who is better than they are at something.Ask Azen how many hours he puts into the games hes naturally good at. You wont get  hours a week. Youll get like  hours a week maybe more.Listen to the Blur and Tafo talk here They go on for an hour talking about the fact that a lot of people say they want to be the best but few actually do what it takes to be the best. You may have gotten the techs down but have you really applied your knowledge to the neutral game. If I gave you Fox and a random top tier and placed you at different positions on a stage could you make a decision based on that positioning? Could you adapt that decision to what your opponent does? Do you adjust your approaches based on how your opponent responds? Do you notice what your opponent decides to respond with? How about punish. Do you get  everytime you get a solid hit? Do you capitalize on all edgeguarding opportunities? Do you let up stage positioning when your opponent is coming back from the ledge?The essence of my questions is not whether or not you know how to do your techs do you know why and in what situations to do your techs? You can dash dance all day but if you arent paying attention to my positioning and dont react to what Im doing Ill hit you every time. So why do you dash dance? What can you do defensively and offensively out of a dash dance? When is a dash dance effective and when are they not? These are all questions based around one technique. Imagine asking them for all the techniques you know. ,SSBM,cw9h3zd,1,t5_2so9j

5497702,0,t1_cwedc92,His bair and upair both kill and if you go offstage his gimp game is the typical really good dumb lowtier punish game. His bair is also really safe he gets a frame advantage on shield for using it and its really big. This is why Peach is debatably his worst MU though because none of those moves are effective at killing HER since she cant be gimped and she can live forever from bairs and upairs.On any stage with platforms Kirby definitely does have setups to kill. Backthrow can be mashed out of but it still catches people offguard a lot since its faster than all the others. Yeah if theyre waiting for it then it can be countered but preying on lack of cognizance is still a legitimate strategy and backthrow setups continue to work on people that are experienced vs Kirby. Its like how Lucky and Westballz still get grabbed all the time by HugS or how PPMDs throw setups still work despite not being as guaranteed. Kirby can backthrow gt bairupair a lot of characters at kill percents or backthrow gt uptilt x? gt platform techchase upair. If you force them to tech on a platform Kirby can reliably techchase into an upair on every stage except Dreamland and sometimes battlefield. Without platforms he loses some setups but he can still confirm into bairs and continue pushing offstage into his edgeguard game. Even disregarding grabs he still has uptilt and ftilt to get positional advantages into eventual kills.Falco can be killed because Kirby can still get him into positions where pretty much every recovery option can be covered though it gets progressively more difficult the higher Falco actually is. You cant say that Falco will just never go offstage though just because of how fast big and strong Kirbys bair is. Ftilt can also push Falco into more precarious positions.Kirby can flowchart edgeguards vs sheik just like Fox or Marth can. Kirby has bair and upsmash which can both hit Sheik out of the endlag on her upb.Marth is actually really easy since he has inescapable edgeguards and genuine kill setups. Platform techchase upairs are super good vs him dtilt and dropzone invincible bair are both inescapable since Marth cant space his upb outside of the range of dtilt. Falcon is easy to edgeguard like literally every character in the game.Not a ton of characters reliably confirm into kill moves on Puff. Bair and uair will still kill her and fishing for them in neutral is still pretty safe. Kirby can force her to commit a lot since his ground game is genuinely better than hers in a lot of ways particularly crouching. If she overcommits or does something bad then you get a free aerial.Fox and Peach are really really hard. You can edgeguard Fox but hes the hardest character for Kirby to put offstage since Kirby cant do much about his movement and the hitboxes he can put out. Peach just wont die ever and her own neutral is really effective at shutting Kirby down.Air speed doesnt matter much. A lot of people compare Kirby to Puff I guess since theyre both pink and round and have multiple jumps but Kirby is actually a lot more similar to Sheik. He should be on the ground more. Her air speed sucks too but shes still toptier. Kirbys speed is really not comparable at all to Zeldas since the difference between his average dash velocity and Zeldas is about the same as the difference between Sheik and Link. His wavedash is also really good and can be used in pretty much the same way Sheik uses hers to get good grounded movement. Wavedash gt tilt is a huge staple of Kirbys neutral game and can be used to cover a pretty good amount of space with a genuinely good hitbox.Like yeah Kirby sucks shit. Hes still lowtier. Saying he cant kill anyone or that he doesnt have a neutral game is not why hes bad though and really isnt true.,SSBM,cwedt9f,7,t5_2so9j

To punish there your opponent would need to be very close from the start which rarely happens. If they do youd usually opt to intang fair them instead of attempting the ledgedashstall at all.Its one of those techniques which seem overrated  until somebody learns to do them with absolute consistency and shows otherwise.

Battlefield Platforms could help out with combos well any playformed stage could do that and its also a pretty neutral stage.  PS Big area for CGs.  The biggest problem usually said is Dreamland but even though fsmash doesnt hit up tilt still hits.  And when theres wind when CGing also a decent space to CG if you walk forwards and Foc is DIing away the wind would push him back making it easier to CG. Or he could DI behind.  So yeah. Is there any stage obviously bad for Marth?  Or do I just sound stupid?,SSBM,cwrykcv,1,t5_2so9j

If theyre running ads I think they are think of it as a way for the best players of this game to generate ad revenue by playing friendlies against each other upstairs partly to warm up and partly because they can.Also have you heard everyone on commentary talk about how amazing this event is for them? From their perspective everything is great so theyll come again if its done again and we get to see them next time.

5614225,0,t1_cwsz81z,LIke I said it depends the criteria you choose. Only tournaments results. Are first places more important than consistency ? Are some tournaments more important than others ? Which player is the best on a good day ? A lot of different ways of ranking players.One thing is sure. Armada is number one right now. No one can dispute that. The rest is debatable. Personally Id put PPMD second. He has done very well in the few tournaments he went to. BUt if he does not win today it might change. The sample is small so it can change fastHbox has proven he will be in the top  in almost every tournament he goes to not matter what. He never loses against people he should win against something very important that leffen still cant do.leffen is fourth in my list because of that. BUt there is no denying he has greatly improved and should be higher on this list next year if he can keep up.mango is fifth. He has not been very good this year and has been upset often. BUt at his best he is still a threat to any of the top players. And finally mewking. Mentally he is weak and has a hard time keeping his composure. But he is still very good. At the top of his game he is in the top  no doubt but it rarely happen. ,SSBM,cwszywl,-5,t5_2so9j

Basically Puff wins when they are on the same plane Doc wins from below and they can both contest each other when Doc is above uair vs dair. Its basically  whoever is playing better that set will win. Doc can rack up some mean damage at low s has a really good dash dance game full hop drill shffac uairs dthrowgtaerial combos pills can be good if spaced right jabgtgrabdsmash usmash is a good option for reading puff coming down Doc is also hard to rest and if they whiff a rest the punish is godlike. Puffs bair can be tough to deal with though and you need to focus on constantly moving and maintaining center stage. Doc kills puff early and with good DI Puff doesnt kill Doc that early. Puff is usually relatively safe offstage. Doc cant really go out and challenge her without huge commitment but Doc is really weak offstage. Doc is way better at the ledge since he has an incredible ledgedash and can gain back center stage pretty safely. Theres a lot of weird nuance to the MU and its hard to say who wins. I think Doc wins the MU slightly but I could be biased since I do pretty well vs the Puffs in my region. But its def not a lopsided MU.,SSBM,cxfbeou,3,t5_2so9j

5837353,0,t1_cxkrngk,I like the bulk of what your saying but I would definitely like to confirm you are oversimplifying slightly. Although the entire set is intense competition there is in reality still a clear difference between the level of mental intensity between whats going on during matches and whats going on during a counter pick. Although this was not your main point I feel like thats the biggest point you base your argument off of. Although not the same thing Ill make a comparison of my own I played soccer for many years in high school. The coach says a lot during the match but it really did not have any impact on my play. I was far more concentrated on what was directly going on rather than the what people were saying on the sidelines. During halftime however no timeouts in soccer if you arent familiar I was very attentive of what he was saying but not nearly on the same level of mental intensity as when I was on the field. Even in other eSports such as League of Legends you can speak to your coach between most sets. TLDR I disagree and think they should be treated differently. I understand where you are coming from just adding my  cents to the change collection. ,SSBM,cxksyg6,3,t5_2so9j
5838697,0,t1_cxkyjse,Ok so I am failing to see why coaching shouldnt be allowed at all if it encourages the growth of the game at a competitive level.These are tournaments competitions if you will. It should be in each competitors best interest to improve themselves and push the envelope as much as possible.Sure it could feel bad or unfair if a low level player sits down next to another low level player when that player has a coach. If they lose because of the advice given that simply means they werent good enough to win. Now they can even ask the coach what was said and hope for tips and even if youre out of the tourney you can play friendlies. Better luck next time.I guess what I am trying to say is that players should seek to improve themselves as much as possible before hindering what others are doing in their pursuit of the same goal  which is in line with having coaches around.,SSBM,cxkzaon,-4,t5_2so9j

PewFat and UGS are big deals but other than that there is no set in stone defined team that you look at them and think they are a solid unit. That isnt really avoidable at this stage though unless you lock teams partners but its not practical.Another personal preference thing for me as both a player and watching is I HATE when teams finalssemis is delayed until another day or later in the day.

5946672,1,t1_cxz2pnf,For a broad generalization they are kinda similar and u said pretty much the same thing as me. MK and Westballz both work around different kind of traps and setups. They arent exactly the same bc MK is working for the grab while Wes works for a shine but that is where character comes in. Both players obviously adapt constantly during a match but both rely on their set plays more than other top players. The obvious and inarguable similarity they have is their reliance on their superior punishes.Changing timings is universal at high level play and a trademark of falco in particular bc good laser approaches depend on changing timings. MK is undoubtedly adapting his timings constantly too. Also Westballz change characters a lot aswll so either u didnt realize this or chose to ignore it. Thier results vs Armada seem to reinforce their similarities even if they dont prove them. Both despite their high level seem to be hard countered by Armadas style. This is hardly a new idea though and if anything can be attributed Leffen and Armada himself rather than the rest of Socal.So yeah.....I dont know what u think I dont understand.

Picking up new characters can hurt your peak level of play for a bit as its harder to maintain more than one up to par with your main especially if youre not used to it.  I wouldnt suggest dropping Falcon cold turkey but by the time you hit  years of tournament play I think its pretty healthy for most players to pick up at least  dual main and dabble into the other top tiers in friendlies just to learn how they work.  Not casually either  learning them seriously but not with the intention of legitly using them outside of friendlies.  If fox is the first that clicks for you then great.  If its someone else dont force yourself to play a character that doesnt fit you just because they fit your matchup spread more ideally.

6029364,0,t3_3y230k,I honestly think that the PAL version of the game is less balanced at the very least its more debatable than people seem to think. I feel like the whole PAL is more balanced thing stems from the fact that Fox was nerfed. That in itself might be a good thing but theres more than just one character in this game and pretty much all of the other balancing changes are super questionableIf Fox is apparently so broken in NTSC then why did they nerf Sheik the hardest? If Falcos considered the second best why was he tweaked so little? Why didnt they buff horrible characters like Mewtwo and Zelda? Why did they nerf Mario Ganon and Link when they didnt nerf Doc Falcon and Young Link?Also most people consider the PAL characters to be less interesting. The punish game is what makes Melee so exciting to watch and yet thats the primary thing that the devs messed with. They nerfed combo starters like Sheiks down throw and Foxs dash attack combo extenders like Falcos weak down air and Falcons soft knee and combo finishers like Foxs up smash and Marths down air. These changes might not make a huge difference overall but they definitely make the game slightly more neutral based this is especially noticeable in Sheiks floaty matchups.,SSBM,cy9yw0u,6,t5_2so9j

6060792,0,t3_3yfe07,As others have said the OP isnt very predictive but rather a collection of common wisdom. Now here are real predictions.  looks like it will be a bigger year Esports wise than ever before. This means more tournaments and more money.  was the year a LOT of players closed the skill gap between the Mortals amp the Gods  will be the year that a new gap emerges but I dont think that the players will be the same faces we are used to seeing. CharactersWith larger prize pools secondeigth place will be a lot more profitable. I think we will see a lot of midlevel spacies switch off the volitile glass cannons and towards safer characters like Shiek amp Marth. Heres a weird opiniom for you to debate I actually wouldnt be surprised to see a few more Pikachu like DJ Nintendo as his tools are similar to Fox but his recovery is Godlike. It will be a pivotal year for Falcons viability too. If SJ or Wizzrobe dont hit a top  in  I think the game will completely leave Falcon behind. Wobbles will make ICs more relevant again. RegionsHere is another controversial prediction. I predict the decline of California as the best region in the world. Heres why and why not. Cali is the house that Mango built. They are flashy aggressive and seemingly untouchable at ttimes because of their fantastic ability to dominate the mental game. These players are often prone to EXTREME gambling and will often risk stocks trying to extend combos and neglecting guaranteed things like Chainthrows because they dont look as cool. Now Mango talks a big game but weve seen him try to incorporate new tech into his game like Shield Drops and Im pretty sure Ive seen him chain throw this year despite his outward stance that he refuses to learn the tech so we will see if Im full of crap here. But O dont think it is a stretch. Westballz has the biggest consistency issues of any top player he has some BAD losses on his record. As Phil puts it Beating Westballz does nothing for your resume. The Norcal trio stayed at nearly the exact same level despite being sponsored. As other regions get better I worry that they are not improving at the same rate. It feels like I am seeing less of Lucky in top s as well. And Mango himself had a rough year with some of his lowest placings since his rise to prominence. Meanwhile Europe and Florida are growing strong and we are seeing surprising placings coming out of midwest players. I dont think Cali will ever be irrelevant dont misunderstand me but the all or nothing attitude has to go and consistency needs to be their new mantra. PlayersI think this will be MKs last year of high level play. He needs to drop that fox and go hard with Marth. He needs to polish his neutral and stop relying entirely on grabs. He has gotten opened up a lot this year and I think a practice session or two to learn PPMDs neutral options would win him a Major. Speaking of PPMD. He has been hitting the doctor and getting treatment. I doubt he will win Genesis  but I think he will be back in full form sometime during the year. This is very dependent on him attending tournaments. Gone are the days where he can skip  months at a time and come back to win. Im from NC so if you dont see anymore posts from me it is because PPs boys came to my house and strangled me with a controller. Plup Hbox Armada will all have strong starts in  coming off hot win streaks in the latter half of . Wobbles amp Leffen will have strong summers after they shake some rust off with a few tournaments. Overall I think  will be the most explosive and back amp forth year in Melee. I do not think we will see several months dominated by the same players. I think coaching will get bigger and sets will be traded back and forth between Armada amp Hbox until other players start to build up some steam and shake up the status quo. Edit Drugged Fox Wizzrobe amp Wobbles will have the biggest rise. My prediction is Cali players other than Mac D I like his mindset for remaining prominent will have the biggest fall,SSBM,cye2bui,2,t5_2so9j

6120336,0,t1_cygdr4w,Dont wanna go super in depth but Ill mention a couple things.gtWhy do you continually state that Falcos laser centric neutral is better than Foxs DD centric neutral for all of these matchups like its some kind of fact? I say like its some kind of fact because it straight up is. A dash dance is extremely powerful because it provides ambiguity in both defense and offense but it does have certain limitations. If I am on one of FD and Fox is on the other I really dont have to consider his dash dance yet as I attempt to take stage. However someone like Falco forces me to consider his lasers well outside of my attack range. The difference becomes even more obvious when you consider that Marth and Falcon are both dash dance heavy characters. Against Fox they can liberally assert their range and go toetotoe with him in the DD game. Falco can significantly reduce their free mobility and coax harder commitments. There is a reason someone like Mango says Falco gets to dictate the pace more than Fox.,SSBM,cylbho6,1,t5_2so9j

6127994,0,t3_3zh2zv,Mango is the mixup master. On shield and in his approaches he has no conceivable patterns or habits. He mixes up timings recoveries and DI to perfectly react to the situation.Armada is the punish master. With both Peach and Fox I dont think there is an argument that Armada doesnt have the best ability to take stocks off a single hit.PPMD is the neutral master. Efficient movement and picks the safest option every time. His punish game may not be the cleanest but every move he does keeps him in an advantageous position. He is willing to take every stock at  because he knows hes still at the advantage and will win neutral.MK is the edgeguard master. Dropping an edgeguard against any character is rare for him and even if the opponent gets back on stage they just get put back off again or get juggled back into another edgeguard.HBox is the setup master. He forces his opponents into so many bad decisions and causes tons of mistakes in order to win. Its become a part of Puffs gameplan at this point to force errors and immediately punish and thats part of the reason why Puff isnt liked. It doesnt look like hes outplaying his opponent just that his opponent makes mistakes and he capitalizes. But he definitely forces those mistakes to happen.Leffen is the composurefundamentals master. He gets  stocked at every big tournament it seems yet he still manages to clutch out many sets even when seemingly hopelessly behind see Paragon Orlando or Beast V. On top of this although he may not excel in any single field he is the most complete Fox taking notes from every notable Fox main before him and combining it into one. Play from Chillin Jman Silentwolf Hax and MK all can be found in Leffens style of play.,SSBM,cym6tr1,21,t5_2so9j

6134586,0,t1_cym3efl,I think you are just being straight up obtuse now. Throws typically dont have SDI. Guaranteed regrabs  guaranteed hitboxes. And  relevant characters? What does this prove exactly? Hardly  characters in the game are relevant to begin with. Marth Peach Pikachu and Fox can all chaingrab fastfallers and Ice Climbers Sheik Falcon and Samus too all get big returns off their throws. Fastfallers clearly face this form of punishment with more frequency.gt...? what? All the fucking time lol.Again it is easy to just ignore context. Given character x means any given character. So sorry but no we dont see Falco Peach Falcon Sheik etc. throw gimp Marth under  as often as a fastfaller. Even Pikachu who probably has the best throw gimp game on Marth thanks to reverse uair and his low angled bthrow doesnt have a SilentWolf  minute  stock to show for it. Marth has weak recovery options but he doesnt have the low weight or fast fall speed to physically be gimped as easily as FoxFalcoFalcon. gtSheiks followups on Marth at  are way better than Fox at . I specified the upper limit to Sheiks follow ups not the literal discussion of what they can physically do at . Marth can realistically escape further punish at  whereas Foxs life is on the line ESPECIALLY on the edge where Sheik can bthrow him and possibly kill him off one read. Again this goes back to evidence in high level play. We usually do see Sheik get more off a grab vs. a fastfaller than a Marth its just that Sheik gets those grabs off Marth far more often. ,SSBM,cymxrzi,1,t5_2so9j

6295471,0,t1_cz4zywu,Timothy was dozing off. The dim glow that shone on his feet indicated that it was at least  oclock. It wasnt long now until he could go home and fix himself a big bowl of pasta while watching the VoDs of the latest Smash at the Foundry a Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube tournament. He hadnt had many customers today which wouldve made him feel a tad sad    some ten years ago but he had gotten used to it. Suddenly he heard footsteps approaching quite rapidly on the otherwise quiet stone floor of the church. Someone climbed into the cubicle next to him. Through the screen Timothy could make out it was a thin man before this person drew the shade back to its place. Timothy had never heard the shade make a sound quite like this as if the piece of cloth itself was afraid. It intrigued him and immediately woke him up from his drowse. The curious part of Timothys soul became aroused. He tried to take a look at the man sitting next to him but with his head hung low the only thing Timothy could make out was how pitch black his hair was. He wished he couldve seen just the tiniest bit more of this creature sitting by him.I have done sin father spoke out a quiet voice that sounded like it was being tortured by thousands of tormented souls. We are all lambs of God sinful and in pain. Speak and you shall be forgiven my son. Timothy recited the words as he had done many times before. Though it had been a while since hed voiced them with such concern. It wouldve been obvious to even the most simpleminded mongoloid that something was severely wrong. The man sitting nextdoor didnt say a word. The only things Timothys ears could perceive were the strangers hurried breath and his own blood rushing through his veins spurred by his beating heart. Timothy spoke out trying to keep his voice as calm as possible but not quite succeeding God forgives all my son. What weighs on your heart? The man held his breath for a second as if gathering his courage. Then he spoke again with that same voice that sounded as if it had just heard it had been condemned to eternal damnation. This time it made Timothy shiver from his head to his toes making him glad of the dimness of the box that he had cursed just a second ago. My life has been very fortunate so far said the stranger. My parents loved me no one bullied me and I was never struck by great misfortune. The man took a slight pause. Yet I still did it. Sin lives inside us no matter the circumstances. Its existence is inevitable Timothy proclaimed. He heard a single sob. It has infested our kind and lives inside us all. Only Gods mercy can cure us of it. Timothy heard more sobbing with each word he said. I was playing a game of Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube with my friend spoke out the man eventually He said he wanted to try something fun. Calling it a test of patience he chose Pichu against my Ice Climbers. By now the voice had degraded into a mix of sobs and whines barely audible. Through the screen Timothy could see glimmering streams of tears flowing from the mans eyes. Then it hit him. Before Timothy could utter a word asking the man to stop the coalhaired creature had already continued on with his story Id just lost  friendlies in a row! I was salty! What could I have done?! Timothy couldnt speak as if his body had been petrified. The horror had grown his eyes to twice their normal size and paralyzed him otherwise. All he could do was listen to the hell that he knew was about to be unleashed on his ears.AND I WOBBLED HIM ALL FOUR OF HIS LOWTIER STOCKS I WOBBLED AWAY!!!The man rushed out of the confessional box leaving Timothy sitting there struck. He couldnt understand what had just happened to him. He felt betrayed by the society the world and by his God. He cried tears of wrath and made a vow I will wobble no man no demon!,SSBM,cz582d3,32,t5_2so9j

Next time you play that many grueling sets youll think to yourself Ive experience worse and youll power through. Overtime youll realize that what used to fatigue you is trivial. Ways to improve it include sleep eating well staying hydrated exercising and making sure you practice full focus mode for long periods of time not only in tourney but in training too. If you play friendlies for  hours one day try going full tryhard and see how long you can keep it up etc. Just trust that its something that youll improve at over time. ,SSBM,czjw9pd,6,t5_2so9j

6430303,0,t1_czk601h,I feel to your mashing A point that most Foxes and Falcos that dont immediately dash out of a situation are mashing jab most of the time to setup a smash attack kill or start a combo though they can get away with it more often due to their speed. So its not like using a similar strategy with Luigi is a bad thing. Something thats been said in this thread already is that fundamentals transfer to any character. For example if I play Luigi to a point where I cannot push the character any further then switch to a better one its likely that Id have a stronger neutral game than most people who just pick up a spacie from the jump. Its definitely subjective though.Also you can learn how to play Melee with any character. If anything youd learn better with a handicap.

6448840,0,t1_czm94uw,Just in the first  seconds you get hit with a handful of approaching nairs. Nair is unsafe to approach with you can call it out with a run up shieldgtgrab or just out space it and punish. You opt for dash dancing but you dash dance unsafely not actually staying out of marths range and get hit by it.   you really just threw out a knee here and at this point in the match I wouldnt say you have enough data to make ballsy call outs like that. Blea just reacts to you flying in and throws up the shield and then the grab leads to a stock. Lesson learned Your threat zone isnt that big he had time to react to that approach.   right here he throws out a fair and you punish the lag with nair. This right here is how youre going to be getting the majority of your hits in this mu in neutral at least.    again this knee came from across the stage. Dont throw hail marys he just reacted and utilted  You dashed away and successfully baited a nair but you dashed back into nairs range and got hit by it. Just pay more attention to your spacing make sure youre dash dancing on the fringes of marths range.game  I would attribute the loss entirely to just being to aggressive. Play more reactive and less proactive skipping game  because it perplexes megame   got hit out of a yolo dair. If youre gonna swing at least make it fast a nair or an uair. dair got stuffed before it even came out.  that grabbed whiffed cause you were late after the get up. Now he didnt have to roll there grabbing there isnt a bad idea per se. Had he decided to hold shield that grab would have worked. but what youve conditioned him to do at this point is take the first defensive option available because youve only played at one speed. had you previously punished rolls in that situation or at least waited and attempted to bait something he may have questioned it and considered holding shield longer.    good punish on the nair try to bait stuff like that out.I really think your biggest problem is neutral. You just throw out too many moves. Next time you play try not to throw out any hit boxes that you dont have an explanation for. Now obviously you cant just camp until you get a free punish but when you do approach try to base it in some kind of read or at least a confident guess. Say to yourself he always dashes back in this situation or he doesnt hold shield when were in this position even though Im within range to hit him etcOther things you might work on your punishes could always be better try to micro space you do a lot of big dash dances but no little ones. theres a time and place for both.  when you do short hop knees you start the knee early so that it comes out at the apex of your jump and its super unsafe on shield. What you need to mix in are later knees that hit closer to the ground so you have more shield stun to work with. Low kneegtjab is a lot safer than high kneegtdoesnt matter you already got shield grabbed.  ,SSBM,czmcmew,2,t5_2so9j

Always try to hold downaway on fthrow or downin on dthrow to avoid his followups and hold away when youre getting hit. That said you do seem to have survival DI down pretty well as you were surviving to the good high percents expected from Peach in this MU. You dont seem to have a developed flow chart for the punish game. Peachs best combo starters in this MU are dash attack and dtilt. You use dash attack a lot but its main use is to knock Marth out of the air while dtilt is used more to catch him coming in with a misspaced dtilt or when hes landing with an aerial. After that uair is the best move to continue the combo. Last thing I noticed was that you throw a lot of turnips but dont use them effectively. Learn how to use them to start combos like turnip gt nair. Simply throwing them doesnt do a whole lot of good unless Marth is on the ledge.,SSBM,cznvhrv,2,t5_2so9j

When you say new players you dont mean people who dont know what the different buttons do right?Nothing should be off limits imho. You enter a tournament to compete and see how you will do against others. Holding back because someone is new or picking a different character basically says youre out of their league. If you stick to your main and destroy them it shows the same thing. Youre out of their league. The only difference being that both of you learn less than if you tried hard.If youre new and cant deal with people outplaying you and you stop playing then you dont have the right attitude for melee.

6603469,0,t1_d028sy4,I actually think it heavily depends on your playstyle the Pikachus playstyle and how theyre interacting rather than there being cookiecutter stage picks. Pikachu has pretty balanced pros and cons for every stage similar to Fox thanks to a combination of good mobility killing power both off the top and via edgeguards and good recovery. For every disadvantage a stage gives him he usually gets an advantage in trade.Smaller stages means less room for Pikachu to run around which hurts him because hes pretty dependent on bait amp punish as he cant win hitbox wars but the tradeoff is his pressure is harder to get away from once hes in which is threatening for Falco whod probably rather just keep resetting to neutral after getting a few clean hits and abusing his advantage there. Small stages like YS and FoD also have the drawback of allowing Pikachu to get you off stage much easier Bthrow Dtilts and stray Nairs can easily result in you being knocked offstage pretty early.On wider stages you wont be thrown off the stage as easily reducing the impact of his edgeguarding and you can force him to play at a slower pace. Youre less likely to be overwhelmed out by stray hits and pressure but he gets more room to bait amp punish which could be worse if you usually have an aggressive playstyle.In terms of blastzones the best combination for Pikachu in most matchups is a low ceiling and wide horizontal blastzones so he can abuse both his vertical kill power and excellent recovery. The most unfriendly stage to him in terms of blastzones following that logic is FoD and the most friendly to him is probably Stadium. However hes also pretty good at getting edgeguards so in matchups where the opponent gets more mileage off killing off the top than him Fox his preference for ceilings reverses and hed rather have a high ceiling instead as it hurts his opponent more. An obvious example being that Axe takes Fox to FoD often.The other thing to consider is platforms generally the less platforms the stronger Pikachus punish game. This might seem weird with Axes preference for triple plat stages but its true. Platforms kinda suck for him as he cant get anywhere near as much off of Uthrow or Nair when his opponent just DIs to platforms and techs so usually his combos are cut short. His punish game is a fair bit stronger on Stadium and massively stronger on FD. Platforms do help Pikachu deal with Falcos laser game though and generally play neutral against him which can have more of an impact.So yeah to sum up before this gets too long pretty much comes down to playstyles imo. If you play aggressively and they are whiff punishing you a lot try a smaller stage. If you feel like you cant keep him off you and are being forced off stage by fast hits you cant react to easily try a wider stage and shoot the gun some more. If they are using platforms really well to play neutral against you maybe try Stadium or by all means FD if you think they arent an MKtier chaingrabber. For Falco you probably want high ceilings in general as you dont depend on vertical kills as much but you can get some great kills off the top with ShineUp B on YS.,SSBM,d02cqdh,4,t5_2so9j

6738101,0,t1_d0g66l4,I mean in this case its obviously a joke. But Mango is definitely up there in the fox ditto hes had Armadas number in the Fox ditto for sure. Leffen and Mango are probably not going to play the Fox ditto because Leffen has no counterpick against the Falco although he could always force the fox by beating the Falco but I find this unlikely.If we go back in time Mango was undoubtedly the Fox Ditto Master. He has always been amazing at the matchup people confuse not liking it with being bad at it. Some of his earlier sets in the Fox ditto were a wash considering it was his first time playing the matchup at a high level in a long time. But hes accelerated in the Fox ditto since then.In conclusion I wouldnt say that Armada or Leffen can securely say theyre the best at the fox ditto over Mango,SSBM,d0ga0ic,-4,t5_2so9j

6749141,0,t1_d0hdycv,The concept that Im disagreeing with is not the best multigame player thing. Its taking that type of listing and then asserting that it takes precedence over skill in one game like MK is better overall at smash bros than Armada just because Armada doesnt play Smash . Or worse that Zero is somehow the most talented player of all time even though when he was playing melee even top  players could destroy him. Its fine that he bodies people in smash  but that has no bearing on skill in melee and the two games are so different they dont really work well with combining them. ,SSBM,d0hf1wk,1,t5_2so9j

6764925,0,t1_d0idvmy,Foxs upB looks like this in terms of hitboxes. As you can see its not super disjointed but it moves a decent amount from frame to frame. Your nair doesnt exactly have a lot of disjoint either though so you need to do some shenanigans to give yourself some. If you double jump back and immediately nair you can take advantage of hitbox interpolation to stretch the hitbox down and forward which should give you a greater chance to overlap just your hitbox with his hurtbox when the game updates to the next frame. Moving up also makes Fox move less relative to you which further increases the chance that hell move into a position where your nair hits him but you dont get hit by Firefox.,SSBM,d0j30yv,1,t5_2so9j

Your only john is MU knowledge which you know is a shit excuse because really you got outplayed hard.Add to that the frankly idiotic mindset that some players have that everyone below Puff on the tier list is onedimensional and can be beaten with a single supersimple strategy and youve got yourself a recipe for a lot of salt.  ,SSBM,d0qtvxb,3,t5_2so9j

6898354,0,t1_d0y41u3,So Ive always felt in Bo Fox beats Marth but Marth beats Falco. However in Bo its even for both. Falco is better on DL vs Marth than Marth is on FD vs Falco slightly while Fox is slightly worse on DL than Falco and has a second CP of YS or PS depending on playstyle while Marth basically only has Fd and a style CP. FoxFalco Ive felt is even in Bo but Fox is slight advantaged in Bo. Fox can run over Falco on smaller maps where he doesnt have space to laser and I often see Falcos running it back to the starting stage usually battlefield which typically tells me theyre slight disadvantaged in stage but I cant see why that would be. Must be preference but idk. ,SSBM,d0y8war,5,t5_2so9j

Multishining for example  youd have to shine dash jump cancel your dash then shine on your first airborne frame wait til youre grounded then repeat the whole process. Itd be  frame slower done perfectly but way way harder.You couldnt shine jc grab in place which means if you wanted to shine grab your spacing would have to be pretty impeccable with shinedashjc grab or youd run through them.

6978978,0,t1_d17e40o,gt Im saying that most of those things you complained about can probably be beaten with a better defensive game. Of course they can thats why its not a  matchup. Just because it isnt  it doesnt mean the worse character cant win. If the statement fox has objectively better neutral punish game movement recovery and shield pressure is true then the matchup isnt . So if you want to argue those points thats fine but dont just say sheik can do it and therefore its . Defensive options can beat a poorly approaching fox sure. Now that fox starts laser camping you. You now have to approach or take free damage.Your shield pressure consists of perfectly spaces fairs that leave huge openings for them to escape. Your shorthop leading to that fair is the highest in the game and you have sub par aerial mobility so this approach is easily recognizable and also cannot be followed up on if the fox just decides to run away.Lets say the fox doesnt shield and takes the hit. You better hope they were above  or else youre getting waveshined to the edge of the stage and downsmashed off. Maybe he also sees your approach and uses his superior speed to move under you in time and juggle you.Okay lets stay on the ground as aerials arent working well. You can approach and wavedash back to try to bait an approach from fox but fox has a functional dash dance whereas you dont which will objectively give him the advantage in any horizontal footsies on the ground once again this isnt a free ticket to a win but it is obviously an advantage. Once again any dash attacks or tilts are going to end with you off stage if theyre below  so youre committing to one option grab. And when only one option works the fox knows what youre going to be trying to do. ,SSBM,d17em07,1,t5_2so9j

He would have to figure out inputs and uses for all techs if he wants to use them.

7136792,0,t1_d1p4554,Warning Moderately lengthy post on Hbox as a personplayer based on observations at Pound. It has some spoilers.Say what you will about Hboxs playstyle he is a standup guy who embodies melee and smash. Here are some notable highlights which I think prove this. His set vs infinite numbers while onesided shows he can appreciate the underdog struggle he lived it after all. Him dancing while being wobbled to  was super classy and crowd service we all needed. His smacktalk is always on point whether its Reggie a fraud or Swedish Delight the new threat hes able to have fun and not come off as disrespectful or awkward. Its not easy walking that line while being a complete tryhard in your playstyle. His fan interactions while perusing the venue were a great sight. I think I saw him sign a pair of boxer shorts with falcon on them?! SmashGD exhibition. His reaction to getting rekt first stock of the set was awesome and both games were close. He still stuck to his word and went ness game three and met his maker. Smashgod has a sick combo game on floaties probably because his brother mains peach. his reaction to mangoHax game one was just the same as ours. He was next to the stage flipping out. So often you want a match where you will play the winner and try to focus and take mental notes but this was not he case. He was screaming and jumping and ripping his hair out of his head. The dude loves this game and thats something you dont always get see on twitch alone.,SSBM,d1pdisf,6,t5_2so9j

7232773,0,t1_d202sa8,Heres a post I made about the Puff matchup that you might find helpful. I think the general gameplan you have is headed in the right direction but youre a bit too afraid of her defensive options. When shes Bairing right above laser heights shes not really approachable or punishable but as she lands on the ground you can potentially lock her down and approach her OOS game isnt that strong if you avoid grabbable aerials Falco actually gets a lot out of grab vs her so Laser gt grab or laser gt shine gt grab is really strong. If shes spending all her time above you dont be afraid to maneuver your way under her if youre directly under her in a great spot to defensively Utilt her descent or to threaten a full hop Bair  Dair  Uair  shine or something depending on her . Also attacking from platforms can be pretty good. If shes floating in the middle of battlefield above lasers and you can jump waveland on a side platform then SH Dair towards her in the center or laser gt sh Dair her towards the center from the platform you can be in a great spot to threaten. Basically attacking from directly above or directly below is pretty strong vs Puff. ,SSBM,d20baho,6,t5_2so9j

7257976,0,t1_d232cow,I think this is close but ultimately wrong because you can play defensively or offensively from ahead or behind. If you are in an advantageous position offensive options will push your advantage but carry a higher risk of losing that advantage while defensive ones will maintain that advantage but do nothing to extend or capitalize on an advantageous situation. If you are at a disadvantage defensive options will mitigate that disadvantage but will on their own not create situations through which you can gain an advantage over your opponent while offensive options will allow you to recoup your losses or even create an advantage over your opponent but run the risk of snowballing into an even more disadvantageous position.  ,SSBM,d236i03,2,t5_2so9j

Despite my arguments that a perfectly spaced and timed Fox shine could beat out parrying he held steadfast. Now obviously Yoshi doesnt run even with the cast and isnt the best in xx.

I see a lot of people asking which shield drop method straight down vs notch is optimalbetter to practice. Im just now starting to practice shield drops am I wrong in thinking that theyre both worth practicing for different situations? For example if Im dash dancing on a platform and they come below me I can use the notch method to potentially block an attack or even just come down with a dair. Additionally if a Marth upthrows me onto a platform and I get to an actionable state I can shield a upairutilt then use the straight down method to fall through. Are both methods useful?

7375080,0,t3_4gccwm,Went to a tournament on Saturday wanted to share my experience.I dont get to go too often to tourneys so being able to go to a larger one that was in my home town was great. Went to a tourney called EagleLAN the turnout of top players was a bit sadalthough the actual number turnout of players was pretty good  players entered Melee ColbolPlup had wanted to go but you know where theyre at and Ghatzu couldnt make it either because his ride slept in so the only top player there was Porkchopsstill really freaking good.So I played pools and as it was a smaller region and no really top players were there I breezed through my pool. I get into top  and first game of top  is against a Peach player. I actually really enjoy playing against Peach and this peach player really pushed me he had really good spacing punish game and so I made sure that I made all of my punishes count too. WonLostWon on Dreamland Fountain Yoshis respectively. Looking back on that fountain game there was a lot of things I couldve done better as I did get stupidly caught a few times into the tumbler but overall did good.Then I played against Porkchops he was really good however what surprised me more was that I was able to mantain pretty solid footing vs him. I kept it close each game at  stock however his punish game was too good and Im not used to fighting good Falcos offline. Porkchops knocked me into losers then I fought against my longterm rival Barraca and in tourney hes eclipsed me I need more experience in the Marth MU and hes really good vs Fox and Im bad vs Marth so it always makes for a rough time not to mention he was on fire that tourney. He lost to Shamunt and I lost to him but I wonder what wouldve happened if he won that game vs Shamunt and I got to fight Shamunt I would like to say Im much better at FoxSheik than FoxMarth.Played some friendlies too KeepSpeedN and SmashMac were thereDSWs brothers and theyre fun to play against. In doubles both of them were extremely difficult to kill since they both protect each other so well. KeepSpeedNs Fox is actually pretty good it is unorthodox and really really old school but still plays pretty well. I feel if I played against it a bit more I would understand how to fight it but it was strange. Felt like a blast from the past he does fullhop nairs in neutral and fades them back or forward depending on your position doesnt do thunders not too much dash dancing either he would just react to what you do and move only then instead of thinking ahead so it felt a bit weird to play that. His Falcos pretty similar too doesnt use the modern style of Falco so it felt really cool to play him. SmashMac plays Doc and so you cant ever get off stage vs Him or hell just cape you he does this pretty slick thing where hell go off stage and reverse cape you it looks slick but you definitely cant cover too many options that way lol. KeepSpeedN also complimented my Fox later saying that I remind him a lot of Colbol so that was pretty cool!Anyways I had tons of fun and it was a great experience. Its a shame that I dont get to go to more tournaments but the times I do I make sure to soak in a lot each time I go. Being the completely hidden boss of SWFL is a nice feeling but I realized I could be so much better but sometimes balancing real life and balancing gaming is too tough and as much as Id like to get better at smash I cant devote the time I used to anymore Thanks for reading my extremely long writeup on EagleLAN it was really fun participating and I hope to do it again soonand I hope to make it to CEO too....,SSBM,d2ghu81,9,t5_2so9j

7378720,0,t3_4gal21,IMO puff is quite hard to play. The optimization you see from hbox is incredibly hard to pull off. Puff is also played very differently from most other characters like marth and fox in how she approaches neutral since her main form of movement is in the air and shes not necessarily trying to go for the things they go for such as dash dance to bait out a response.The other problem is that puff is played quite linearly especially since IMO hbox is the eminent puff right now and hes so hard to emulate. Its the same way how people struggled to emulate MKs style of sheik and marth back in . The way puff is played at low levels involves SO many stray hits and interactions in neutral that for the puff player its like playing smash  a little bit though she can edgeguard super well and thats fun.For those looking to find diversity in puff look for videos of Tekk and . They both play puff pretty brilliantly though they dont have the results or rigor of hbox.,SSBM,d2gwqpw,2,t5_2so9j

I think this is one of the reasons Sheik is generally considered so lame and that dair is one of her hypest moves.Riskreward  Falcon comboing into knee offstage is much riskier to miss than Jiggs comboing into fair offstage. Also why rest is one of Jiggs hypest movesAnimation  this ties back into windup but yes some moves look more violent than others.Novelty  guaranteed stuff that weve seen a lot before isnt as exciting custom combosrarely used moves are.,SSBM,d2jgvde,8,t5_2so9j

Basically if you barely DI behind Marth at certain s its impossible to tell if you need to do standing grab or a turnaround grab.

However you dont hear the commentators overly praising one team and then showing dislike for the other. As you have said its hard to show genuine emotion whilst being hype and most commentators are good at that. Its the balance that some commentators including myself can struggle with.

7572019,0,t1_d32v79j,Fnatic is probably the biggest org left however there are a lot of second tier NA organizations like Echo Fox Optic Gaming and FaZe that from my understanding would make decent sponsors acceptable salary  travelling expenses. I dont think picking up a smasher is as bad of an investment as you make it out to be. The FGC is kind of a special group and reaches a niche audience of people who may not tune into the LCS or Valve majors very often also the average age of fighting game players is higher than those of League or CoD players so one could argue the FGC is an entirely different market. A smash players salary is considerably cheaper in comparison to a  man roster and thats not to mention things like gaming houses that these teams need to really maximize their capabilities. Investing in a fighting game player is probably a reasonably safe investment when considering an esports athlete and with melee on the up and up I would not be surprised if we see a few more organizations in the mix before the years over.,SSBM,d32wguf,10,t5_2so9j

Obviously even some of his basic approaches and techniques are relatively hard to consistently execute and Im curious as to whether or not id be better off starting with someone easier to play at a low skill level or if I should continue to grind out fox. I spend a decent chunk of time grinding basic tech every day shuffling approaches waveshines shine followups etc and Im liking it a lot but Im obviously still far from consistent yet especially when it comes to applying it in game.

If I remember correctly its caused by the ledge boxes sitting out too far so its possible to go past them before your characters ledge grab box is active despite hugging the stage lip.  Ledge grab boxes are up and in front of a character so on Battlefield if they become active after an upB ends or you start descending or something when youre already touching the stage lip the boxes that need to overlap into order to trigger ledge grab wont touch.,SSBM,d3lfeiy,9,t5_2so9j

Downward angled ftilt sounds super useful in that case youre right. Ill need to practice spamming bairs on stage and spamming bairs from the ledge especially in those situations. About the running shines I think for whatever reason I was trying to do them but I kept getting stuffed by uptilt so I just stopped doing them that set. Ill just need to get better and experiment with knowing which situations are openings. Correct me if Im wrong or if theres more to add but in general I know that when my opponent is running awaydash dancingnot challenging my approach I can get a running shine but run awaywalk away up tilt is such a counterintuitive option that I dont have much experience with since I dont play the fox ditto often. Usually when my opponent spams uptilts I would think to space a bair but this opponent in particular didnt spam them. Immediate shine you said during uptilt clank would beat his uptilt? In that case is it possible to running shine the ending of an uptilt?EDIT ftilt ! utilt,SSBM,d3tgh5x,1,t5_2so9j

I dont think this would even make any of the low tiers tournament viable it would just make them a little less shitty to play in the matchups that are already extremely onesided. Honestly I dont even think that adjustment would change the tier list.I think the idea of buffing low tiers worries me after playing PM its so hard to buff a character without making them into a giant gimmick. Somehow even adding ledge snap to falcons sideb kind of messes up his character for me part of what makes him such an interesting character is his weak recovery options which add to his all or nothing playstyle.

We usually have the expression that the playoffs is very very bad for our heart. But its just an expression you know. But still when its very close ad you want your team to win your heart starts racing. If you told me  years ago that I would someday feel the same watching melee a game i had never played before I would never have believed it. So here I am watching nne my favorite player beating hugs. So hype. BUt then he had to face mewking. Mewking never loses to Falcon so even though I believed in nne I did not truly think it wa possible.BUt then I start the set and its so fucking close and my heart starts racing. And then the possibility that nne will win became very very real and It became even more stressful. When the set finished my heart was beating so so fast. After  or  min I started to get very worried something was really wrong. I thought I was gonna die from hype. Can you imagine. Fortunately after  min my situation became more stable.

He has gotten way closer to beating gods and top level players than Sj recently but hasnt clutched it out. He has had crazy close sets with MK and a really impressive set against Mang recently.

7985972,0,t1_d4cspza,The thing with Peachs upB is that the hitbox is so big and I didnt really have a problem sweetspotting it each time. I dont really think Peachs upB is difficult to sweetspot tbh. And there is some leeway when it comes to perfectly sweetspotting. Her grab box just needs to be range of the ledge for it to grab and her grab box is decently large so I was able to get the grab on the th frame nearly every time I tried. What it comes down to though is your opponents skill level. If you dont think theyll sweetspot then you can try grab ledge or shine them as theyre upBing but at that point its pretty much a read. ,SSBM,d4dp6ad,1,t5_2so9j
7999443,0,t1_d4euxg0,Its one line in C and it doesnt double system requirements. But it has nothing to do with how much code it takes to get it to work. The hard part was figuring out the theory and figuring out that this was an option in the first place. And it does need to be a thing in order for players to test it. If we had no website or Discord it would be limited to like  people randomly asking their friends to play. It wouldnt reach the amount needed to actually find a match reliably. And we did not want to wait until this can be an added thing to the main branch. That will take too long. Plus we wanted an alternative community anyway. We have different rules different ranks different everything. Nothing wrong with having another option. If people dont want to use it then they dont have to.

8071402,0,t1_d4n9iqw,Yes refresh rate is a part of total display lag but a monitor with low display lag will not always have a lower total input lag than a display with a slightly lower refresh rate. Im not trying to prove that a CRT will ALWAYS be faster than an LCD or LED panel. Im saying that modern monitors running at hz will not always have less total input lag than CRT monitors running at hz due to added processing.

Link is heavier so like Samus  Gannon  Captain Falcon he cant take a beating from the higher tears at lower percents where they are able to combo But then come back in full force. YL doesnt have that option and things like a grab from Falcon sheik  or a pillar combo from Falco can spell certain death.

8341893,0,t1_d5ka1k3,Yeah I know what youre saying.  Samus can try to UpB the Dair or Nair or whatever you use but its not as safe myself and most of the Samus Ive spoken to prefer to wait for the shine  but thats just me and a few others there arent many Samuses in my region.  Yeah I was trying to say that if you double shine the shield and they expect another double shine then you can shine grab instead and they cant react in time to UpB OOS to beat the grab if they expect another shine. But I see what you mean.    If you look at the UpB hitboxes on Samus    then youll see that the hitboxes cover a lot of ground so if you try to space around it then you are far enough back that it opens up a plethora of other shield options for Samus because the range makes them safe.

They are both objectively bad matchups but I honestly dont know which is worse at this point. My record is worse against Falcon but Im not a top or even high level player. Needles really hurt Samus by crippling her recovery but Falcon can punish anything unsafe on shield with a knee or two and set up for a really early edgeguard which he can finish by going offstage.

Uairgtnair doesnt combo at the end of the chaingrab. Fthrow wont even send you off stage with good DI. gt punishing turnip pulls is kinda weird because when she ducks shes too low to get hit by the first hit of nair so drive by stomp is your most used option here which has a pretty long startup.I think dash in grab is better. ,SSBM,d5ld2rc,1,t5_2so9j

Borps sheik dilutes his approaches to either run up shield grab or run up dash attack. The strategies which defeat one will lose to the other and vice versa. So when youre playing him he forces you to pay attention to the circumstances hell use one or the other if you want to win neutral.The beauty of borp isnt that he gets away with all this jank its the simplicity he turns this game into while still being able to win. Honestly i could write pages on how he plays. ,SSBM,d5plvgc,22,t5_2so9j

8422551,1,t1_d5ubxs2,ya I guess Im biased with Marth but Im not really sure what to nerf. He doesnt really have any overtly stupid shit except kind of his grab but Foxs grab still reaches  as far when you factor speed into it. Really all I buffed on him was killpower though giving him a handfull of kill confirms throw mixup on floaties dair for high percent confirms on fastfallers and a kill move to use in neutral like spacey bair. I didnt buff anything about his neutral game. My changes werent designed to make characters worse they were designed to either make them more difficult or remove degeneracy like Sheiks free dthrow techchase on Falcon.There are also a lot of indirect nerfs to Marth. Removal of pummels hits him the hardest since he has the least damaging throws pummeling gets rid of like  throws on the FD chaingrab nerfing ASDI down hurts him more than it hurts Fox overall especially in the head to head RAR hugely benefits spacies and Sheik relative to Marth easier shielddropping is a lot worse for him than the other characters etc.idk much about PM the Ice fair just looks cool and Samus doesnt really have a super great aerial that hits in above and in front of her.edit got rid of nair change decided that was a bad idea.,SSBM,d5ud02i,0,t5_2so9j

8695422,0,t1_d6sipsj,K so most people say movement is the most basic fundamental of melee since you need to be able to make your character go wherever whenever. Without proper movement basics dash dance ff wavedash short hop Lcancel and other techniques waveland SHFFL ledge dash wavedashing to ledge you wont be able to play neutral approach or even punish appropriately. Most of the advanced stuff is dependent on character for example SHFFLnairs for pikachu fox or invincible wave dashing for certain characters but the basics will help you get set up. Without them its extremely hard to win neutral since youll get punished for no lcancels and dash dancing and wavedashing will trick you into punishes due to misspacing. Movement is easy to practice but hard to use during a real game since most of it is muscle memory. Just practice and play more and youll be able to move well.After movement I would say neutral is the next most important part because if you cant land a hit youll never be able to punish arguably more important than neutral itself. Approaching and spacing is part of neutral. You cant really learn neutral aside from spacing practice or cookie cutter approaches from playing against AI so youll need to play against people more. This is because each approach will be different depending on the situation and if you keep approaching the same way youll get read and punished. You improve neutral by playing against other people more and by practicing spacing and different approach options on your own.Finally punish game. Im a low level player but the one thing I notice about people better than me is that they get off way harder punishes than I do. Most of it is due to experience they can read how I will react to getting hit setting up for a larger punish or they know the proper flowchart for a punish better ie if I do X then they do the best option Y. I find it really hard to get optimal punishes because I dont know how my opponent will usually react and just try to punish on reaction with  preparation. You can probably improve this by watching pro players punishes or by reading guides and of course by playing more.    Most of this stuff is in the wiki or can be found by googling so I would suggest looking at that. And watching pro players vods can be helpful but imo its really hard to learn and appreciate anything when youre a low level player since so much of what pros do is hard to understand until you get better. Just keep playing with others and youll get there.,SSBM,d6sk3q9,2,t5_2so9j

I was on the area to the right of the pit and unsure how to proceed. When I got close to the slanted wallplatform that protects the pit he would run up and fsmash through the wall then return to pulling turnips. Can I stand on top of the platforms and attack the turnips or something?

9154339,0,t1_d8cbe7e,Scar talks a lot about it in commentary. I wish I could remember in what video he gave a pretty detailed breakdown of what it means to him.The way I think of it is that it is a situation where both characters are very close to each other and have a lot of immediately threatening options and it usually follows after one or both players make a mistake or some Melee mechanic shenanigans occur. Here are some examples I would consider scuffles Falco tries to do an approaching dair but it phantoms. You Marth tried to SDI it but since it phantomed you got a dash input instead. Now youre both thrown off balance and will do some sort of gut reaction to try to feel safe again. Falco might AC bair or roll. Marth might run away or shield. A Peach will always dsmash lol.Another example might be Fox uthrows Sheik onto a platform where she techs in place. Fox tries to read this by jumping to the platform and landing with a bair but he mistimes the bair. Now theyre both actionable at similar times in an uncontrolled mixup situation neither expected. What the Samus player probably meant was that your gut reaction to being in these kind of tense situations is to dash dance. But since youre so close that doesnt always work or since you dash dance every time you always give your opponent the option to retreat rather safely. Marth is really bad in scuffle situations because of the nature of his moves. Instead of dash dancing trying to wait for something to punish. You might be more proactive and go for grab a fair wait in crouch or maybe even go for an fsmash. Its important to study these situations so you can be aware of the mixups from each character and how they interact so you dont choose your panic option every time glares menacingly at Peach players.,SSBM,d8cdn1j,14,t5_2so9j

Yes if you know Marios tool enough youll have a better grasp of what his approach and options are but that depends on which option the Mario main is gonna use what is playstyle is whats hes looking for in neutral. Most situations can be played differently even though low tiers have more limited options. If you recover a certain way as fox because you know i can cape you doesnt mean i was gonna cape you and maybe you will die for this.

You cant just throw out a skill level insult as a counter to my argument its totally irrelevant. And you clearly dont understand my comment. Im not talking about the result of a failed backdash when Im talking about less than th of a frame Im talking about what causes it. Its a polling issue. The game reads inputs multiple times a frame and sometimes you might be unlucky enough to miss the last poll of the frame. Im no kadano but I know thats a fundamental part of the cause. Because this is such a small window it very rarely happens.Furthermore I believe the consequences are being overblown too. Even if you lost an entire  frames every time which would be inconvenient its not like you can be punished on reaction for it. Its simply too small of a window for your opponent to intentionally do anything about it.Heres my overall point these are hypothetical numbers but Id say failed backdashes happen like  of the time you try to do it.

Theres nothing wrong with having influence and using it to advocate a platform. Not once have they forced their viewpoints on anyone. Their rankings are the most accepted because they are the best weve got right now. For all of the bitching about west coast it on me which mostly come from people who are too stupid to realize its a panel composed of people from different regions and not just tafo all other attempts at objective rankings dont really have the sample size that they need to be reliable. Thats why we use them.Im still failing to see the issue with signing their friends. Its a small community most people at the top have known each other for a very long time. You cant say that any one of those players did not deserve to be on the team. And even if there was an example who cares. Nowhere is written that hiring someone to represent your brand needs to be someone that is not your friend. MIOM felt that a partnership with those players would help their brand and would help those players and so far theyve been right every time.You seem to take issue with them having influence over the community and I just dont get that.

10119963,0,t3_5ktcd7,I wouldnt really call this new its a combination of dashgtwavedash and the fact that all characters preserve their momentum after exiting a wavedash or waveland which are already known. For example when falcons tech chase on reaction they use dash wavedash to cover more distance than just regular wavedash allows since youre moving during jump squat. And when dash dancing marths use a wavedash back then dash the other way as a bait since they retained the momentum in the opposite direction of their dash they pretty much go nowhere. Also if anyones ever seen Zain consistently PC drop to the edge he uses a wavedash into walk to ensure hes walking at max speed from the wavedash momentum.Edit i guess though the momentum transfer is much more noticeable on bowser since hes so slowedit  cough cough thanks for downvoting me ,SSBM,dbqn019,11,t5_2so9j

10121960,0,t1_dbqw31h,gt So the Bowser guy named Synnett which posted a video earlier explaining fortress hogging found a new tech where you can walk after a waveland and you will use the momentum of waveland and walk at the same time but you will not suffer the landing lag beeing  frames for Bowser i labd the tech further and combined it with wavesurfing bowser can cover half of BF if done right with  KoopaDash. Heres an example  also bowser can do lagless ledgedashes with this tech. We tried to replicate said tech with every character we did not accomplish the replication it seems that this is an only bowser tech! For more Bowser goodness or if u just wanna help develop the character join our discord server! I can only assume that this was your original post and your edit was made later. Nowhere in this post is there any hedging or skepticism about the tech. There is also no evidence that you put in the effort to confirm the lag reduction. You literally stated that this tech eliminated the  frame landing lag from Bowsers wavedash even though it is really obvious in the video that Bowser is in lag while he is sliding.What is even more bewildering is that no one investigated this further even though this is the era of XX where everyone has access to debug mode.,SSBM,dbqwct1,5,t5_2so9j

If you are already used to thinking that way then it is easy to figure out how to have good defense as well. Like you would think last time I tried to tech after the first hit and got hit again before I missed the ground which led to me taking a million percent because I couldnt tech any other hits. So next time Im in the same situation I will wait and tech after the second hit to get away. This is how anyone should be thinking in order to improve at the game no matter what your playstyle.

10273830,0,t1_dc8jmrw,If he shields three of your airials in a row and goes for the shieldgrab afterwards aswell its pretty safe to say that hes going to shieldgrab your th one aswell use this to your advantage and land behind him without an airial and grab his shieldturnaround utiltshine his grabjump OOS.Make sure you space yourself outside of the Nair OOS and if he is on to your tricks and tries to backair you when youre behind him CC the bair and if he doesnt do the bair you can react to a roll with a laser perhaps. Theres alot going on in the first match but this was the most specific thing i could think of practice safe airials on shield incorporate some shine OOS and wakeup shines when he dashattacks your shield or whiffs a grab on your getupsrolls also practise baiting out his shieldgrabs then punishing hard your goal is to get her offstage and theres no better way than to bait out a shiledgrab then fsmash her face. This can be accomplished in many differend ways but my favourite is the empty hop towards them and then waveland back gt charge fsmash its pretty risky but you can do the safe version and not charge the fsmash and instead reacting to the grab and throwing out fsmash when you see it if she is at low percents a good dair gt utilt gt late dair is a good way to get a combotechchase started.Aaaand now Im rambling hope any of this helped.

If something induces lag the lag begins from the frame at the start of which it prevents you from acting.So in the case of NIL it doesnt prevent you from acting on any frame. If you do jump gt NIL on a platform where youd be actionable in the air on the landing frame you couldve potentially djd on that NIL frame but chose not to. Then on the very next frame you can already act. Theres no point at which the landing prevented you from doing anything. ,SSBM,dcdxx68,1,t5_2so9j

That refers to  notes spread evenly across two beats if you are in a time signature where the quarter note gets the beat. Its irrelevant though because I think you are coming up with DD sequences that feel hard and practicing them. Which is great. Heres how I practice DD I go to fd and start by dding across the whole stage and back as many times as I feel is necessary. Then without ever breaking DD I pick random spots on the stage and move my character to that spot as quickly as I can. Finally I practice micro spacing retreating and approaching with my dash dance in tiny increments. Then I repeat the whole thing and integrate various fox trots as seamlessly as I can.,SSBM,dcjh9wy,1,t5_2so9j

Those  sports have  majors worth the same points wise but the prestige of winning those titles vary slightly based on history Ex Wimbledon is the most prestigious,SSBM,dcvkqya,3,t5_2so9j

Melee will still grow from EVO and the exposure to smash in general.EVOs not that great of a tournament especially for rankings because of the Bos. Maybe people will see that now.Kinda looks like the EVO staff are just making a bad business decision since we bring in better viewership numbers. Whatever. Thats on them and again Melee will be absolutely fine.Good on Smash  for having larger registration numbers for two years running.

This tricks them into putting a shield up and destroys their mobility. Heck you can even just do a bunch of empty hops to mix up. If Im too far away to hit Falco I always put up a shield when I see him jump and its a really bad habit because of how exploitable it is.TLDR Your lasers get powershielded because you are predictable about how you shoot lasers.

10535524,0,t1_dd29xgn,Magus made a post about it. The way jab resets work is if it does  or under it can reset. Then based off of that if it has  frames of hitstun or fewer the character will be forced to do the slow optionless getup whereas if it does more than  frames of hitstun then they can choose between roll either way get up attack A has to be hit frame perfect here tho or if nothing is input they do slow getup.One instance I like is peaches jab. It has WDSKB weight dependent set knockback just like shine. On spacies and lighter it will always be option tap reset but on anyone heavier than falco it will always be optionless.,SSBM,dd2bggv,1,t5_2so9j

Im not saying that other games dont have exciting combos its just that Melees are much more easier to notice.

It can get messed up pretty easily depending on your controller or the games input polling. Because of this polling your controller might miss a back dash randomly even if you have a great controller. To avoid it you have to enter the dash range on your stick within  frame.

Luigis throws are great at separating mostly because bthrow is strong and has a hitbox to hit the other climber but his other throws are fast enough to be mixups fthrow to delay the hit on their shield uthrow for the separationinvincibility pummels etc. Luigi dair and late nair are safe on shield against Icies due to their bad reachoos gamesliding back when blocking. Almost every one of his relevant moves are great for separating andor gimping Nana and his combos do not struggle with the Icies combo weight. Due to his weight and floatiness Luigi is difficult to handoff blizzard and jabgtgrabdsmash can be naired out of with good reaction time Icies strong upair doesnt kill until  with no DI on Battlefields top platform and he cant be dthrow dair regrabbed even without the SDI.Definitely a winning matchup without wobbling.

11278749,0,t3_60yxed,Yup. Its censorship and not at all you jumping to asinine conclusions.First off theres no censorship. We have the DDT for discussing tons about smashbox and how shit Hax is and the boxx or whatever the fuck you want to talk about. We have multiple threads open on the front page where you can post links to whatever person is saying that someone screwed someone else over. The only reason Im removing posts is because it has gotten to the point where I dont give a shit about the smashbox or the bxx anymore. All Ive seen is people spamming every single link that pops up about the smashbox polluting the subreddit with shit that this sub is not about. This sub started out as a place for people to improve at melee thats it. Id be lying if I said that direction hasnt changed and I recognize that now we function as a more niche hub from rsmashbros for talking just melee with people while keeping the community small. So when you come in with bullshit like mods are abusing their power cause Hax is a prominent figure you just look like an ass.But I recognize that people want to discuss this so heres what Im going to do. Im going to setup automod so there is a weekly discussion for solely smashbox related discussion. Itll be stickied at the top of the thread and itll pop up Thursday mornings. That way you guys get a visible dedicated thread to discuss all the goings on. And Ill even include something else. If you guys have a link that you think is important to the discussion if you tag me saying its an important link I will add it to a list of comment stickied links that automod will add to the top of that post every time its put up.Youre kind of a dick and I hope the community gets the info it needs on the pros and cons of smashbox and how to handle the allegations of hax and his relationship with the Hitbox team.,SSBM,dfafhcs,1,t5_2so9j
11280163,0,t3_60wb5w,Very disappointed with Hax but I hope he just got in over his head with the business side of things and he didnt have any of the malicious intents that the author believes he did. But its easy to see that he did have some shitty behaviour and he is an adult so he should be blamed for it.As someone who cares a lot about the legality debate of boxstyle controllers I am disappointed that there is even more controversy coming out of this situation.

The switch to Hit Box will mitigate travel distance while maintaining the arcade button layout hes been familiar with for  years.Again this is his opinion not necessarily my own.

Hax practiced for  hours daily with the BXX and still struggled to fully transition to his top form. I dont think many people will be able to commit the time to reform their muscle memory. The arcade controllers have clear advantages but I think the disadvantages can only disappear in theory. In reality it will take many many years if it happens at all.

He likes to float threateningly when recovering and fades back when he sees his opponent try to jump out there to hit Peach out of her float barely dodging the hitbox and then making it back safely onto the stage. Id say good solutions are to either read the fade back wait out the float or laser pressuring Peach to get back to stage as fast as possible.If youre a spacie then you can shine the turnip back at Peach as she has trouble dealing with turnips thrown at her in the air. A lot of characters have moves that swipe through both the turnip AND he aerial like Marths fair or you could even catch the turnip and then immediately throw it back at her if she isnt too close to you when she throws the turnip,SSBM,dg7v1qe,2,t5_2so9j

I would say its debatable that only things with no counterplay should be banned because usually overcentralization is the standard i.e. overly powerful in such a way as to warp the game around it as the OP says.

You may not win against the Ganon playing Fox but unless your plan is to always play Sheik for that matchup the better plan for long term improvement is to play Fox and get better in the matchup. Both you and your opponent will be playing seriously so its the perfect time for you to really learn the matchup and not have to rely on a secondary. Even if you dont win youre still getting valuable experience that will help you get to the top level. I dont count that as throwing away your money. Unless you count going to a major where you know you wont win money a waste as well in which case I have to disagree.,SSBM,dghufla,1,t5_2so9j

Does this mean Axe is even better than hbox or are there confounding factors?Sure arguably Axe is better than Hbox he too carries his character.

I may have been caught by surprise since Im not used to people abusing  leads this guy would hit something and run to the other side of the stage and spam missles.
