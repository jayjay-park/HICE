5229068,0,t3_3mmesd,Theory TimeThe tape in that scene is being recorded not played back. Its a Sony Recording Walkman meaning it is possible to record tapes on it. The music does not begin playing until the screen has already gone completely black. It establishes that this is a different scene compared to the ending of Truth by scattering guns and whatnot around the room. By the time we get to that in Truth the room is practically empty with the exception of the MSX player. It purposefully does not tell the player when exactly this scene takes place simply saying its Just another day in a war without end.Now something that must be established is that this tape IS being playedrecorded within Diamond Dogs. You can see the default DD emblem on one of the guns in that room.Two things that seemed weird to me. In Truth you take the tape out of that FOX cassette holder thats shown next to the Recorder. However as Big Boss puts the cassette in and the recorder on the shelf you can see that cassette holder right there.  Why is Big Boss face mostly covered? Part of me feels like its just to create a certain mood for the scene but at the same time it still seems odd.However all of this can be thrown out once you look closely at the recorder and notice that the play button is pushed down not the record button. Even if you wanted to itd still be a bit much to say that the scene was lying. ,NeverBeGameOver,cvgal9t,3,t5_3a0h7

5292034,0,t3_3nhew1,Did you guys forget the Red Band Trailer?A Rival Living a Lie  Revolver Ocelot. When does he show this rivalry to either Venom or Big Boss in the game? Never. Yet this post gives that line perfect coherence. One of my theories is that this is just someones Either Zeros or Ocelots manipulation and that the whole game is Venom remembering things the wrong way. If you already know that Venom hallucinated meeting up with Paz And even Ocelot is describing Venoms OWN CONDITION Which could be either a leftover of Medics memories or Ocelots own speech why would you trust anything ELSE that Venom sees throught the game?The Cassette Tapes lay out Zero being a good guy in the end... But when has ZERO or CIPHER for that matter EVER been the good guy? HE IS NOT. Do you think the Kazuhira hamburguer tapes are a fucking joke? THINK AGAIN. Language codes information codes to suggest to control to INDOCTRINATE. Words.can.kill.Days ago i also pointed out that it wasnt Huey who betrayed you. This theory proves my beliefs Either he wasnt lying the whole time or he is just the guy who cried wolf wolf wolf and when the big bad wolf did come nobody believed him. But he didnt betray you either way. Ocelot can break anyone left and right incluiding Huey yet Huey still keeps lying? I mean since everybody at Diamond Dogs believes that DD is a Dog and not a wolf Except um well...Ocelot? Hell they might as well think that !Do we really think that the guy who we know for a FACT is absolutely against Nukes would allow for a biological weapon that would infect  of the population to be unleashed unto the world? Sure thing fuck the fact that a private military force that runs a base in the caribbean has a Nuke but hey i guess biological weapons that are worse than nukes are just damn fine!Think again.Lest we forget this is exactly how Kojima does things.

Most advanced metal gear yet I took it out earlier in the game in what was probably the least memorable metal gear fight in the series.  And fwiw I was coming from a narrative perspective. it would have been underwhelming for it to end there.  its not poignant like mgss hell mgss final fight was arguably the best in the series and its scope was much smaller.  I hated MGSs ending and even it had a much more emotional punch than what was shown of Mission .  . What we saw of  closed only one plot thread and opens up another with the cryptic WTC shot.  What about the motherbase spy? what about kaz? Mantis? Questions about huey okb zero? etc.  Leaving off on mantis and Eli surviving the island napalm is underwhelming as fuck and not really ending quality of metal gear.

Maybe this has already been pointed out but literally the only thing you can do on the walk between the helipad and the elevator is play a cassette. All other things are disabled in the iDroid menu. Except cassettes. Perhaps there is some way of deterring his ability with soundcassettes?Huey also says things very strangely during the mission as if someone is either answering him or changing his mind but no one we can hear is. ,NeverBeGameOver,cvpldb5,1,t5_3a0h7

5565661,0,t1_cwmpw7y,gt That whole bit about  raises an interesting question If BB is in Foxhound and cant do anything without getting censured by Cipher or America how does he establish Outer Heaven in ? The timelines pretty clear that BB established OH and not Venom. Perhaps he has a little more room to breathe than we initially thought?The whole point of Venom is to take care of and do things that Big Boss cant. Big Boss could have sent one of his cassette tapes to Venom and be like hey there is a good plot of land here you should do this and make this and bam. Big Boss establishes things and controls them from the shadows. He is a manipulator just like how he was portrayed in MG and MG.gtVenom more or less stumbles onto Skull Faces plan while trying to locate a stinger missile platform. Big Boss didnt send him to DD for anything remotely resembling revenge he was sent to rescue Miller and build up Diamond Dogs. This idea that he sent Venom in to seek revenge by proxy is just spreading misinformation.Miller straight up says at the start that they are doing everything for revenge. Hell before even rescuing Miller Ocelot is directing you towards revenge pretty hard too. If you fail here we lose our shot at revenge.Everything is to build the base up and make things stronger so that you can figure out who was behind it and then strike back.It also backs up what Big Boss himself said in MGS That he and Zero fought Proxy Wars with each other. The System and Cipher is Zeros Proxy. So who would be Big Bosss? Venom.gtyou can here.I think demon mode and the horn represents guilt too. I think he is guilty for following along with original Big Boss or allowing original Big Boss to do his thing as long as he has had. gtBig Boss and ignore everything he says in MGSV about building a better futureVenom talks about building a better future. Big Boss says it once to Venom. Big Boss has a track record of lying to his subordinates to manipulate them into doing exactly what he wants by telling them what they want to hear.  gtVenom takes over Outer Heaven and Big Boss sends in Gray Fox and Solid Snake while giving Venom the information he needs to capture them.Ok riddle me this then. Why would Big Boss send his best men in for no other reason than to be captured by Venom? What exactly is his objective here? Misinformation to fool the world they dont have a nuke is the stated intention sounds similar to MSF send in an inspection but hide the nukes so they report back that the base is clean except if they want to spread misinformation and make it seem like there is nothing wrong with Outer Heaven and get people thinking that there is nothing to be concerned about going on there why ruin the whole thing by capturing Gray Fox? Or even being hostile in the first place? They could just arrange for a peaceful willing inspection. Or they could set it up so that Gray Fox surveyed the area and Venom prepares it so that it looks like nothing out of the ordinary is going on. But instead Venom Captures Gray Fox and you believe in this crazy convoluted shit that Big Boss sent in Gray Fox to be captured so that he could then send in Solid Snake to be captured For what purpose? Why? ,NeverBeGameOver,cwmyyoy,1,t5_3a0h7

5841583,0,t3_3v840j,Hi great observation!!I see there are some people who are a little confused still though so maybe Ill attempt to clarify it if that might help at all.Normal version GZTPP scene we all accept and believe  Big Boss rescues Chico and Paz and heads to Mother Base.  He looks outside the helicopter   As hes going there you can see he has NO scarring NO burns NO blood and his sneaking suit is very blue still.  Then Big Boss does his thing at Mother Base rescuing Kaz and gets back in the helicopter.  You can still see at this point he is very much unharmed except for a little bit of blood or something on his left cheek.  Then they escape mother base and the Paz explosion happens which the OP linked from GZ   See?  Before the explosion his face is perfectly fine its only as the fire blasts him back that the blood and marks begin to appear on his forehead.So what do we conclude from this?  Big Boss should ONLY ever have those cuts and burns AFTER the Paz explosion.  But then you see the problem right?  Big Boss is shown with the scarsburns from the Paz explosion looking out his helicopter!    That picture the OP posts.  You can clearly see the marks of the explosion and you can see his burnt sneaking suit which far more black and rubbery than it originally was.  That is postPaz explosion Big Boss no doubt at all.  So the question is why did Kojima show a Big Boss with all the scarsfire damage of the explosion in that cut cutscene??  Its clearly implied to us that immediately after the explosion a helicopter crashes into them and they crash into the ocean.  So how is Big Boss just staring out the side of a functioning helicopter in the cut cutscene  I definitely identify with the OP here.  It seems like that trailer clip is telling us theres an alternative version to this story.  A version where the Paz explosion happens but the helicopter and Big Boss survive with just minor injuries.  At least for a short amount of time.One thing Id add to this is that after you beat Ground Zeroes the main menu shows scarredburned Big Boss in the helicopter   Maybe that was meant to say more than we originally thought?Keep up the good work guys!  o,NeverBeGameOver,cxlcwl9,21,t5_3a0h7

5865815,0,t3_3vle46,The problem with applying Occams Razor to an NBGO type of problem is that a ruse by its very nature is designed to deceive. It comes with all manner of hidden factors or it wouldnt work. To even get close to accuracy in a hypothesis when there is a real ruse you have to make more assumptions than Occam would ever be comfortable with.The fewest assumptions will always be in the hypothesis that rejects a ruse is even happening. But ruses do occur sometimes. I therefore conclude that Occam should never be applied to ruses whodunnits or any kind of problem designed for entertainment purposes. Such puzzles are usually meant to subvert expectations and frequently use red herrings to trap thinkers who are too reliant on such a principle. Of course it is also possible for a solution to feel like a contrived cheat if it strays too far from the established rules of the setting or genre.

5887675,1,t3_3vwj0y,Um no if Kojima were not allowed to speak because of his contract del Toro and Reedus the outsiders to the company would not be granted special privileges which would allow them to officially confirm the cancellation in theirs. There is no way in hell anyone agreed to nondisclosure but somehow the two Hollywood celebrities were forgotten about. They signed a contract too when they signed onto the job. Kojima is remaining quiet of his own accord.  There is no evidence he is not talking out of a contractual agreement with Konami.Why did Konami take the video down and ban use of Kojimas name? Well considering they did pisspoor follow through enforcing it it was for the same presumed reason they removed his name then put it back on the box to get people talking about the controversy. They immediately dropped it perhaps because it seemed silly but then why continue down this path of banning Kojima and preventing him from speaking? There is no rhyme or reason and the controversy makes no sense in the grand picture.There is no ruse without this clash between Konami at this point. If you believe the TGAs were not part of it youve literally accepted a contradiction. If there is a fallout between the two parties you can forget about chapter  and whatever else.All of what youve posted is your own hearsay. You cant deduct what you have from what youve shown me and claim it to be infallible because there is a severe lack of context to all of these occurrences. Konami remaining quiet in some places and not discussing Kojima could be equally interpreted as an effort to minimize details to conceal a lie in a half truth like newsspeak. ,NeverBeGameOver,cxreozd,1,t5_3a0h7

5906199,0,t1_cxtpw06,Theres also the reason that Kojima simply meant to do this...and I say this because theres too many unanswered questions loose ends. Too many deliberately left in when theres so many options available to change the game to remove the thread altogether.      Take Kazs eyes for instance. If he meant to answer that question but couldnt  why not just make Kazs eyes normal? Its so simple I am certain he meant to leave it in. So why no answer or explanation? Well either he never meant to shed light on it for whatever reasons or he will...eventually.       Then we come back to why so many loose ends? The number of mysteries about this game and its story must be higher than the facts we know about it by now. The mysteries ARE what MGSV is...AND THAT is why I still wonder if theres something more coming. Its either coming or an amazing opportunity was unfortunately missed.          As for looking into the game itself well to be honest  that part is done sort of naturally within the community of fans I think. People invested in the story and just playing the game will automatically think more on the story as they come across it again and again.

Your previous comment said removing his current arc from MGSV would be more in line with his characterization which is totally not true his current arc of rebelling against Diamond Dogs is way more in line with the Liquid we saw in MGS then him just passively staying at the base. You also dismissed his entire arc as him being a whiny bitch baby which is giving it very little credit and ignoring the entire purpose of much of the games story. He wanted retribution for some perceived wrong that Big Boss inflicted upon him and he let it consume his entire life and define him as a person.

This place has gone downhill a lot since Konami officially started tweeting about disarmament. I will admit that I actually enjoyed the postVGA ruse arguments.

Now that Kojima is gone and left without mentioning anything about a ruse it just seems pointless to keep arguing about it.

I mean had they not shown mission  as the phantom mission on the collectors edition would we be so sure that significant content has been slashed. I also agree with your other points. Based on what we have seen in trailers almost all significant story elements were done back in . That and the fact that the ending scene with BB on the motorcycle was shown by then too indicates that the game was not made in chronological story order. If significant portions of the game were cut thered be some proof in much the same vain that if any significant content was still undiscovered wed know by now because secrets almost always get leaked.Finally the game seems too polished for it to have been significantly rushed. Youd figure if a game as big as this were to be rushed out there would be a lot more bugs and glitchesIn a nutshell I guess Im saying that the facts dont add up for me to come to the conclusion that the game had significant content cut in order for it to be rushed to market. Now I hope there is an elaborate payoff most likely associated with disarmament that proves this was an intentional part of the experience but the other option is simply we got the game Kojima intended for us to get as is.,NeverBeGameOver,cyiq4rp,3,t5_3a0h7

I skipped to the correct times.Watch the bottom of the screenTruth ending Huey interrogation Happens right when he says Skull face Awakening Look how it turns on when Ishmael is in focus and back off when the camera pans back to Manonfire Skull face helicopter  Look at the bottom right when his weird speech starts.

The reason I say that is because when it fires it does so on level with the tunnel as if its aiming with precision You say its unusual that it doesnt check on what happens to them next but I cant say I see whats so strange about leaving an ambulance  the driver of whom the pilot is possibly aware he killed or so it would look like I imagine  to the roadblock they have positioned up ahead especially if the helicopter is indeed stationed where it is to prevent any witnesses from leaving the area. That would suggest that if the catastrophe going down at the hospital isnt what grabs its attention after blocking the tunnel then it has to look out for any other possible escapees. Alternatively it was on its way to the hospital and blocked off the tunnel to prevent anyone else from using that as an exit leaving the occupants of the ambulance to the roadblock.gt Theres also no fence or gate that Ishmael drives throughThere is. As I said its the road leading to the tunnel that has it. When Venom and Big Boss are making their getaway they narrowly avoid two fire engines and veer off the main road through what I now see is a closed gate onto the road leading to the tunnel where they meet the helicopter which is either stationed around there to keep an eye out for people like them making an escape or was on its way to the hospital.Thats all I see happening here and thats putting little thought into it my point being that this just doesnt bother me the way it bothers you. Its not something that bears so much thinking about and coming to some weird conclusion based on it and other supposed inconsistencies.gt Theres also nothing in the truth tape that says Big Boss is the only person who can protect Venom.Well Im sorry but this is just common sense really. Ignoring the fact that Big Boss is actually fine with the idea and that this therefore shouldnt be a problem in the first place their intention is to sneak their way out whilst Big Boss takes Venom as Ocelot says through his final paces. Considering that they use everyone around them as their shield the only logical conclusion that exists is that Big Boss is the only one capable of doing this. Notice too that whenever the opportunity arises Big Boss gives Venom a little bit of training starting when the onrails section ends Ocelot picking up where he left off later on.,NeverBeGameOver,d19kn0a,2,t5_3a0h7

7725981,0,t1_d3kalvj,Jeff Bridges is a good choice for an older Big Boss in his s etc. Although Bridges is one of the best actors there is in my opinion he lacks the Rough Rugged Voice for a big boss.  Richard Doyle the man who voiced BB in MGS was amazing. Such a manly rugged voice for a character like BB so unless they use technology to up the ante sort of speak for Jeff no way. Clint Eastwood has a harsh solid rugged voice .  Have you seen The Hulk movie st one with Eric Bana. They had that General Ross played by William Hurt.  Grey hair etc looked like a BB but the voice was soft. Same as with Sam Elliot as Ross in Hulk  and Cap America  civil war looked like a BB yet the voice will not work. .I guess we can have Keifer Sutherland play as Venom Snake in a movie since he voices him and would go hand in hand but all in all. We have real life actors who look like or can be made to look like the characters of MG series yet the voices will not do. I would say Angelina Jolie for The Boss.  William Hurt can pay a good Ocelot. I guess you can stick Channing Tatum or Chris Evans as Grey Fox. Sean Bean could have easily played Liquid Snake back in his early days since he has the look and the British voice. How about Quiet?  lol just get the real chick who voiced and played her in teh game Stephanie Joosten. Get that dude that played Chris in the Resident Evil movies and that Duece Bigolo movie as the gigolo to play as Vamp. I know that the most important factor of making a movie based on a video game is the correct Director. I give you examples of what I mean and I am sure you will agree with me. Take Terminator  and  directed by James Cameron. Amazing movies by a Great Director.  Then comes the rest of the Terminator movies which were OK  some worse then others but nowhere near as good as the original. Now if Cameron directed all the other T movies and used the original actors and new ones I am sure they would have been great. Same goes for actors. Sometimes its not cause the movie sucks but cause the director sucks Take example of the actor Jack Black.  Funny guy.  He was amazingly funny in the movie Shallow Hall which was funny as shit. Yet other movies with him he is not that funny. So obviously it was not him but the director of the movie.   Take the Farelly brothers who made the great classic comedies  Dumb and Dumber Shallow Halls Kingpin etc Those movies are funny as hell yet I must agree that the directors have lost their touch in recent years.  Same goes for actor Ben Stiller.  Funny as fuck in Something About Marry yet not so funny in other movies which were directed by other directors etc. I am a Christopher Nolan fan. I have only seen his Batman trilogy movies and I find them amazingly great.   Now the batman vs superman movie although great in the CGI and stuff was ok nothing great but i bet if he directed it it would have been awesome.  So now lets take the movies that were based on video games and find out why they sucked donkey dick or at least were fun kind of  yet later seen as a joke. I guess I will start with the st video game real life movie i seen and work my way down.  SUPER MARIO BRO.    Now this steaming pile of you know what had its funny moment especially Dennis Hopper who played king koopa? Was hilarious.  But None of them looked like the game characters or even the pipes were missing stupid story and just shit all around.   STREET FIGHTER  with Van Damme.    Now to this day I like that movie A LOT. Not because it portrays the characters correctly or as such but its a funny ass comedy movie with hilarious quips and stuff. Raul Julia as Bison was funny as hell and its just a funny movie.  MORTAL KOMBAT  and ANIHILATION .  Those movies I have seen as a kid when they came out and were amazing but now as an adult they are garbage. Same like those American Ninja movies that were once hailed awesome when seen as a teenager yet bashed as adult for its cheeseness and stupidity yet I still love American Ninja movies.   Even the new street fighter movie chun li legend whatever was made as a more Adult realistic version and still was SHIT.  RESIDENT EVIL movies.   Ok now the st RE movie as a stand alone zombie flick is awesome if you remove the resident evil title and name it something else but since they based it on the game and did not follow the story etc it was shit and the rest were more shittier.   cannot remember any other movies based on games ive seen but what got me is that all of them never followed the story as same as in the game. Sure you can say well we played the game and now they made a movie with the same shit as the story for the game so its boring. Ummm. no. Not if done correctly by a good ass director. If your gonna give a horror movie to make to Farrely Brothers who make comedies it wont turn out good etc. So now back to MG series real life movie. If i was some super billionaire I would try to purchase the rights to metal gear or at least have Konami collaberate with me etc and I would hire no other then Kojima himself to direct a metal gear movie. With of course Harry Williamson to do the soundtrack etc. The best part would be is I would make all the canon mg movies just like the games were released.  I mean i dont know.  Like for example Metal Gear Solid for PS story and action between Solid and Liquid would be awesome especially if done as a real life version of the game.  The movie would be around  hrs long I guess and if done right by a good director it would be great. What I do not want to happen is have a metal gear movie made as like some stand alone story. Solid Snake must infiltrate some base where they making a  meteal gear and the leader is some renegade douche bad guy not any one of the villains from the game etc.  Ok sorry i talked to much. Guess I love to conversate.  ,NeverBeGameOver,d3ke1nj,1,t5_3a0h7

7996074,0,t3_4oqtra,gt Also Ocelot says in one of the truth tapes Its what he wanted.Right but heres the thing. As you pointed out Venoms coma is induced. Yet in the opening to the truth mission we see Big Boss immediately fall into one when they barely manage to save his life. The only reason Ocelot phrases it this way is because for his own safety he wants Big Boss to go along with the plan. Notice that Ocelot only says this after Big Boss expresses doubt. Yet Venom doesnt get a word in because he has yet to be pulled from his own coma. Its a shallow way of reassuring Big Boss that hes making the right decision and it works.gt If Venom Snake truly is a parallel to us players it would make sense for him to agree to become Big Boss just as we players agree to play as him in The Phantom Pain.I really cant imagine why youd say this when one of the series biggest messages is for you to choose your own legacy and MGSVs ending directly contrasts the moment Solid Snake tells Raiden and the player this with the reveal that actually you never had any choice and your entire identity and the legacy you might have pursued has been swallowed up by one man Big Boss.The problem with this theory is that there is nothing except whats obviously a fabrication of Ocelots to back this up. There is no reason why they wouldnt have made this clear if it were actually the case though it would go completely against a rather crucial message of the series if they had. That being said I do agree that many fans probably smirk along with Venom when theyre called Big Boss although this too is pure manipulation on Big Boss part if you listen closely to the message and not a good thing. For example in comparison to Solid Snakes message to Raiden and the player that they should follow their own path Big Boss tells Venom and the player that this story this legend its ours which on the surface sounds like a nice thing many players reading this entire message from the perspective that its Kojima speaking to the player. Yet it isnt true nor is it a positive message because once Venom is dead the great heroic Big Boss takes all the credit for everything that Venom did a man who is completely forgotten and permanently erased from history. Whereas Solid Snake is grateful for all that Raiden did and apologises that he didnt have much if any free will Big Boss offers no such apology in his own message and is only grateful in that he cheated death and has left his mark.,NeverBeGameOver,d4eu286,8,t5_3a0h7

8156168,0,t1_d4x1s3d,Exactly you can see it here immediately followed by Kaz and Venom firing seven shoots which happens regardless of whether you shot the gun during the small window that you were in control of or not. So this all adds up to me now. The gun is unblocked during this episode called from the folder where its listed as a collectable in order for it to be equipped and is limited to only three shots because thats how many the player can actually fire before control is taken away from them once again. Combine that with the weapon lacking the proper sound effects if you try to use it outside of this scene and not being held properly in Venoms hands nor having a unique UI icon and this actually explains everything for me except that a flashlight and suppressor can be attached although even then I wonder whether or not thats some kind of default option for all the guns except perhaps for the unique water gun?,NeverBeGameOver,d4x2huo,1,t5_3a0h7

Try explaining to your boss that the only escaping vehicle in an entire complex goes by you and all you do is shoot some missiles at a tunnel behind it when you engage it. When it could very likely be big boss. Or at the very least get information out about the whole operation. Then on top of that conveniently a helicopter arrives just as you wake up. Seriously in what world do you think a soldier ignores his primary objective because his forces are engaged with a hostile force somewhere else. Especially when that primary objective is right in front of him. On top of how they deal with Big Boss later when theyre fighting Sally and double tapping every single person in the entire complex. This idea hed just leave after finding the ONLY ESCAPING VEHICLE because on the other end theres a roadblock which he either never checks to see if they got you or doesnt make sure youre dead which is kinda important seeing as the roadblock is dead and you could be you know Big Boss almost outside the AO and almost free. But nah im sure he just ignored you and then a helicopter conveniently shows up  minutes later when volgin is blowing them up left and right only to be blown up by third boy in front of you.

Or maybe you genuinely dont understand Kojimas quote?Its not hard to understand Metal Gear games are about Nuclear threats cold war political stuff stealth conspiracy spying mechs betrayals mentors vengeance etc of course some of this stuff isnt realistic at all but there is a frickin difference in making a game about all this stuff with a little bit of hey heres a zombie facepaint or hey heres a type of enemies that look or act like zombies. However its totally another to make a whole games subject about zombies alone and doing their best along the way to fuck an already convoluted storyline into some alternate reality wormhole bullshit teleporting Mother Base to...

And sometimes the people that seem like theyre on LSD on here do come up with interesting perspectives. And yeah been a contributer back since it started... NBGO has lost its warriors pride... Back then I darent contribute much because there was such high level discussion on coding and stuff going on. On top of that besides a shit post thread I think a coordinated effort to analyse different cut scenes here would be better... A fair few including myself already do quite detailed analysis... But a central point of what has been covered would be interesting maybe even a list of things to include in your analysis e. G.  Obvious like mission and characters any visible filters any lens flare effects and colours a scene description... Even if just the people already doing their own research and nothing else wed still get through the game fairly quickly. IN terms of the color theory Im even considering starting a spreadsheet and including timecodes of effect type of effect color of effect. And what is happening on screen. So you could highlight all the occurrences of one particular effect and see what if anything they share. If nothing than fair enough.

9304711,1,t3_57vvrn,And we probably have to Disarm all nukes before we can get Outer Heaven. True Outer Heaven cant happen until after disarmament. We are frozen in time until that event happens. After that the timeline will move forward. I am not here to preach to you about disarmament. We all know what needs to be done. I just wanted to say that there is probably more content waiting to be patched in after disarmament is achieved. Of course they wouldnt put anything about it in the games files. Just the cutscene. As you can tell that is not motivation enough for people to disarm. But why not tell us about it to motivate us? I suspect they dont care because this gives them time to finish development on what they are working on right now.After Disarmament Outer Heaven happens. Solid Snake. Norman Reedus. I suspect that Konami and Kojima had a plan. TPP and GZ is the first part of that plan. The second Part of that Plan is what comes after disarmament. Metal Gear.  The third part of that plan is Metal Gear . At the end of the Truth mission we see the in the mirror the Outer Heaven logo. The logical thing to assume is that Outer Heaven is what comes next in the timeline. Now as a long time Metal Gear fan I know this means something. A new fan to the series would probably not even notice the Logo. Even if they did would they understand its significance? Would the truth ending have any meaning if we did not see the Operation Intrude N tape? What if the tape and the logo change were completely gone from that scene? Well we would pretty much have the same cutscene we see earlier in the game. It was to show us that Outer Heaven comes after the truth. After the end of the game Outer Heaven comes. To a new fan thiswould be an old  bit game. If a new fan happened to do some homework and bothered to google metal gear outer heaven and wanted to see what that time in Big Bosss life looked like they would be greeted with an bit video game that you really cant buy anymore. Even if you bought an old console or emulated it would you really want to play it?  You would probably get really bored and never finish it. Sure you can watch it on youtube but again you would have to care enough to watch an hour of two of game play speed runners normally skip dialogue and really what new fan wants to do that? I am sure there are a few but not many. What those younger new fans need is a Metal Gear they want to play and they want to watch their friends play. All the new fans are happy with this game. As a long time fan I am disappointed as of right now but I am confident there is more to this game after disarmament waiting to be unlocked. .I think that Konami and Kojima had TPP developed faster than we were lead to believe. Photos of TPP we shown as early as .I believe Kojima Showing us Reedus at the end of PT was a trick. He was actually showing us Solid Snake. And Death Stranding was another trick showing us Snake Again with longer hair. I mean sure it could just be that Silent Hills was a real game they were going to make that got cancelled and then Kojima left Konami Started his own studio and decided to make Death Stranding instead bringing reedus back and Del toro back..... But nah. I think Kojima is still using reedus and Del toro because HE NEVER STOPPED WORKING WITH THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. TPPs story is not so important. The bigger message is the same message all Metal Gear games have had. Kojima wants a world free of nukes. He knew TPP would be our Phantom Pain.He made the game so we would have nothing to do but disarm. That is all that is left for anyone to do.  And we have to live that way until we achieve Kojimas dream.  A world without nukes. And that world is where Outer Heaven exists. After Disarmament Outer Heaven has the worlds only nuke. Once we get that Nuke count down to zero and then develop single nuke we will be living in the same timeline as Outer Heaven. I suspect that around the time we got PT. Work was being done on a Metal Gear remake in the Fox Engine. Showing Norman in PT was a little nod from the future Solid Snake. I have long suspected that Death Stranding is Kojimas little Nod at Metal Gear . Same Solid Snake from the game Metal Gear  But now in Metal Gear  he has longer hair. I suspect right now Kojima is Working on Metal Gear . I think his primary focus was the Metal Gear  amp  remakes and that is why TPP is the way it is. We are left in this shit hole until we disarm. Kojima amp Konami are not too worried about Metal Gear releasing because it just buys them the time they need to work on Metal Gear  aka Death Stranding. So we have until whatever death strandings release date before Kojima curses us all out for not achieving disarmament. I suspect Metal Gear will be patched into TPP once Disarmament is achieved. I think it will be DLC. I suspect Metal Gear  Death Stranding will be  a separate game we will have to buy at the price of a normal AAA game. Sorry if this post is messy. I hate how small reddits comment boxes are. I know this could be completely wrong and  what we see is what we get but I have to give Kojima way more credit than that. I really dont think he would leave TPP like that if he didnt have something more to give us. And really we cant say that is what he did until we complete Disarmament. Only once we have achieved it can we say for certain that there is nothing left. So too all you negative people you can say to leave or to get over it this is it. game over move on. but the game is not over. The game is not over until you complete disarmament. If you want to leave the game then leave the game. But dont tell anyone that you ever beat the game because you didnt. Anyone that says they have beat this game is a liar. If you give up that is fine. But the game has beaten you. You have not beaten this game until every last nuke has been disarmed. Dont be mad at me. I didnt make the game. Is what I said about Metal Gear  amp  being remade true? well you cant say for certain until you beat this game first.Until then Konami is still making money off this game so I am sure they dont mind too much if you take your time to achieve disarmament.

I mean have you read it? Youre the one that responded to dm correctly say that  isnt about what some people here act like it is by trying to defend it because the game draws some influence from the book which strongly implies that youre one of the people who havent read it otherwise youd realise that that was a pointless thing to say. As for not contributing I think youll find that whilst I didnt address your main post I was responding to you and defending dms point of view about Chico and Paz and even threw in my piece about how Chico cant be Venom.gt I was talking about the tape typo and yea I already knew you would think its an oversight thats your answer for everything you cant answer in this game.Its a fucking subtitle and that is absolutely the most sensible conclusion. What do you expect me to say in the face of such an obvious explanation especially one thats backed up by other users saying that the typo is consistent across other languages except the Japanese version of the game?gt The themes make sense but the in game explantations for a lot of things are not as seamlessly implemented as they were in MGS.Example?gt There are tons of things in the game that dont make any sense if you accept that the medic is Venom Snake and it makes what the themes Kojima was trying to convey to the gamer feels forced again you have to accept plot holes oversights etc. for the Medic to be Big Boss.Like what? Youre not giving me anything to work with here so I dont understand how this isnt somehow made blatantly obvious.gt Again to accept that is to accept a ton of plot holes and inconsistencies.I dont know what part of my post youre responding to here but again youre not raising any points man.gt This right here is the problem ...You know whenever the likes of you make a total fool of yourself by repeating these same sorts of lines to anyone who has no interest in joining in on the echo chamber or making things up I cant help but wonder if you realise that so much of this could easily be turned back on you. Like why do you get so upset when someone isnt posting the way youd like them to about the things youd like them to when any fan of the series is welcome here? Why is your answer for your fairy tales always lazily there are no facts only interpretations as if you understood the quote correctly and no other players did and why do you say the game makes no sense when the theories youre making make no sense or create bigger plotholes than the ones you believe are already there?gt You seem to get bothered no matter what the theory isNo I ignore the vast majority of them and move on with my day. Look at the past week or so of my history if you really like. Pretty sure youll find that I mostly make posts correcting people on certain points or elaborating on something theyre wondering about in topics that personally interest me or when I see the opportunity for an interesting discussion like when I responded to you about dms appealing perspective on Chico and Paz and that just...didnt happen.gt I have no problem of presenting a counterpoint but you have a stank attitude bruhI mean you literally presented none in this post whatsoever so I dont really know what to make of this conclusion.

I think we need to analyze every decision on whether it gives us a positive or negative after effects.essentially im thinking the same thing except with big bosss words youve written your own history. who do we think on a personal level would actually be a good fit to join our ranks instead of letting kaz tell us whos tough or experienced or whatever.one more thing on a similar level ocelot tells us to do stuff kaz tells us to do stuf and kaz gets orders from someone in which tells us to do stuff... perhaps we need to write our own history with those as well? food for thought.peace,NeverBeGameOver,de7micn,3,t5_3a0h7

11048033,0,t1_dek8gki,what is interesting to me is how Kojima is saying the secret is hidden in the trailers and he is scared people might figure it out. If this is a new IP like we are supposed to believe it is then what secret could we possibly figure out that is so major to the game? To me this backed up even more in my mind that DS is going to be directly related to Metal Gear and PT. I mean lets look at some games that are New IPs. Horizon Zero Dawn for example. There arent really any secrets that can be hinted at that people could search for and try and figure out because it is a new IP with unknown characters in a never before seen universe. You honestly couldnt really hide anything worth talking about in trailers for that game because since its a new IP nothing would have any significant meaning attached to it. All you can really do with trailers for a game like that is give an idea of what gameplay will be like an idea of the setting and give a very general idea of what the plot will revolve around. So if Death Stranding is a new IP with new characters that we know nothing about in a completely new universe that we know nothing about and shares no connections with Metal Gear or PT then wtf could Kojima possibly hide in a trailer that could be of any importance? ,NeverBeGameOver,dek9xjp,1,t5_3a0h7
11079545,0,t1_denoxp5,Joe why do you still come here? Scratch that why do you still post here rather than lurk? Your findings are better off on Twitter than here. At least theres civilized discussion there. Hell my brother stopped coming here and he was the one that introduced me to this sub.Its pointless when all people will do is downvote because of apathy and pessimism. Seriously people here dont deserve you. ,NeverBeGameOver,denuu9x,5,t5_3a0h7

11487651,0,t1_dfy341o,On PC you can open a users steam profile. Most nuke users have underdeveloped MBs or an espionage score of zero. I have yet to spot a profile that only owns MGSV. They usually own less than  games though. MGSV being the only Konami game. This is normal for throwaway steam accounts.I suppose you cant view profiles on console versions?,NeverBeGameOver,dfy4gzb,6,t5_3a0h7
11563795,0,t1_dg6qe8y,RE Quiet and Ocelot not being playable in the main gameI wonder if its something to do with how the games programmed? Can the player play as a character thats not like Snake that is all of the playercharacters Snake and otherwise are the same character with different pieces attached? I know MGO is a different executable so maybe it has different code to allow for that  and we know how adding code to a project thats lost its original team goes!,NeverBeGameOver,dg6rezl,1,t5_3a0h7
