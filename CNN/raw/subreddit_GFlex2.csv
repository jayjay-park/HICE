Well if you hear anything more about the UK Flex having the software update maybe the price difference makes trying it more worth it. Let me know what you end up deciding,GFlex2,cq28h5d,2,t5_37byf
4545674,0,t3_3dbj96,I love mine but I feel like Ive got the  out of a million that doesnt overheat. I switched from a galaxy s. Good screen good battery life easy to use and I always get questions about my phone. Ive had people basically just come up and ask me if its a curved phone or broken. I love mine but I feel like mine is the odd one of the group.,GFlex2,ct3lwu1,1,t5_37byf

8006240,0,t3_4ot9ya,My Flex  has never done that. I would try disabling all bloatware such as ATampT stuff. I have a funny feeling that its an app thats restarting your phone for you. It may help to check the permissions of each app on your phone and see which ones have the ability to perform a restartcycle the power. Also run software update to see if any updates are available.,GFlex2,d4fz6pc,1,t5_37byf
