11401809,0,t3_62ja8c,There is none. I live in a small U.S. state and there was literally one bar in the entire state. And it closed a few years ago.I think it might have reopened recently but its too far for me to go to. Id have to go to Boston to see any good bars and I dont even think Im into that kind of scene. So alas I just go to straight bars and discreetly check out guys and sometimes gag when a gross townie hits on one of my female friends.,GayMen,dfodpzd,1,t5_2s7e5

11774418,0,t1_dgun6g7,gta simple feelgood movie instead of artsy heavy films burdened by the need to convey a tragic messageSorry I focused too much on this part. Still they were all good movies.By the end of Henry Gambles Birthday Party Henry has the makings of a happy relationship with a friend despite his father being a conservative preacher. But its a high school romance and as I well know they dont necessarily last forever.Theyre all much better than the kinds of depressing movies you mentioned. ,GayMen,dguny8y,1,t5_2s7e5
