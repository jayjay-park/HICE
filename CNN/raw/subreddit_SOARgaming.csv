6464273,0,t1_cznr6ym,I for one would be down to start earlier on Saturday and Sunday but I know that I may not make it on time to an OP on Friday if it started any earlier. It would be nice to accommodate everyone but the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few here. Im no exception so if everyone wants earlier OPs on Friday and thats what happens well.. Ill just have to be late.,SOARgaming,czny83u,3,t5_3a5dr

9741262,0,t1_da9q2ii, limiting FT size. Not to be too hardcore milsim here but there is a reason they limit team size irl. Its the most efficient way to do business. Also prevents the FTL from getting overwhelmed.,SOARgaming,dadtn3d,2,t5_3a5dr

11035514,0,t3_5xkjd6,R. SanchezJ. KahnRecruit Good First Op with this group I was very excited.  I liked how the radio communications were split.  Being new I did not want to have to worry about talking to command but just focus on squad level coms and teamwork more on that later.  I enjoyed the squad size and working together.  The members of Bandit were pretty chill and were ok to talk frankly with.Bad Nothing to really say bad as far as the Op went more personal reflection on what I can improve on.  When bandit made it to the first objective Bandit lead kahn and the second in command Ryan got killed leaving Tait Reynolds and I without leadership.  We didnt know at the time that Reynolds was experienced but was just feeling out the group sneaky!.  For a few minutes I felt like a lost puppy until we got our bearings and devised a plan.  Being this was my first Op I was pretty lost as to what to do for a good portion of the game after I was killed.  It was not explained to me that I could get on a helicopter for reinsertion if I died but Griz helped me out when I messaged him.  It would be nice to have a written briefing or objective list to refer to.Other Once I figure out the Mods that SOAR uses I feel I will get much more out of the Ops.  R. Tait TayTay and I spent a few minutes messing with things after the in game debrief which I think will help for the next Op.,SOARgaming,deiutqa,7,t5_3a5dr
