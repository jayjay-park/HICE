1239054,0,t3_287tjr,No doubt.  It takes quite a bit of time to build a game although the design process does take up quite a bit of that.  In  Skyrim was released we should expect them to be developing the next in the series... although we should not expect it next year. seems reasonable.  Theyre sitting on a gold mine it doesnt matter how good or bad the game is it will sell like crazy.  I do hope they keep up their prestigious quality we expect.,nextelderscrolls,ci90d4v,7,t5_2vbsy

If you do some stealing he becomes more of a thief. All the actions add up and he develops the different traits complexing his character. ,nextelderscrolls,clihzdi,-1,t5_2vbsy

3265691,0,t3_2xbdns,The only thing I am worried about is that multiplayer is not something you can just whip up in a day. It seems like to me it takes a ton of time to do a good multiplayer. If they tried to do it in ES it would be even a bigger challenge than other games. If they do introduce multiplayer what do they not do because of the time they spent on multiplayer. Do they take a longer time to make the game and what do they have to water down in order to make everything seamlessly work with tow different characters?? An MMO is one thing but this is something different. Is it worth it? to some yes to me no.,nextelderscrolls,cp0ikms,2,t5_2vbsy
4454841,0,t3_3b7y5y,Funny enough because gamers just know what they want Skyrim went with a perk system to allow for character freedom. It is the first game in the series that did not require starting over to try a different style of play. Athleticism was nothing more than a stamina buff pretty much everyone would have leveled by virtue of running not much point in keeping it. Acrobatics would have been cool although Skyrim is bit too clunky for it even though the roll perk was included in Sneak.  In addition Skyrim had  skills and  perks compared to Morrowinds  skills and  perks and Oblivions  skills and  perks  most of which were being able to cast stronger spells  perks you couldnt choose. Mercantile was separated from Speechcraft in Morrowind and Oblivion which was redundant. The former was meshed with the latter in Skyrim via a perk in Speech three to be exact  Three perks replaced an entire skill that counted towards the max seven if you were playing a custom class.Although the schools of magic are vague in the lore Mysticism was one of the more obscure ones. Skyrim did right by the lore by meshing it with the soul gem perks in Enchanting and the general necromancy stuff with Conjuration as necromancers have to be skilled with soul trapping which is a mystic spell. The spell absorption was worked into Restoration and Alteration via perks and the telekinesis and the detect spells were moved to Alteration. The additional weapons skills in Morrowind could be mentioned but for what? Morrowind had no perks. They just added more things to hit creatures with. Not bad but not great either although it probably is the former as Skyrim included axes long blade onehanded blunt weapons maces and short blades daggers and gave them perks. That knocks Morrowinds skills down to  leaving unarmored which is a magic specialization and it just happens Alteration has a perk for that. Medium Armor was split into light and heavy in Skyrim which leaves one at  skills for Morrowind. Handtohand also available in Oblivion was included in the Heavy Armor skill tree and the last remaining are Athletics Mercantile and Acrobatics which I addressed totaling to  skills...technically.Skyrim could have added some spells  even though they did  and some weapons but the notion Bethesda limited player choice in that game is unfounded when they essentially have the same skills as the previous games save for Daggerfall. Those specific enemy skills seem neat.gt I also think that areas should be deleveled like they were back in morrowind as its just so satisfying to get your ass kicked then come back later and kick their ass.It is also satisfying to be reminded other NPCs can kill you just as readily as you can kill them i.e. scaled leveling. As for the rest for as long as crafting is not necessary as I do not want to spend my doing something that is inherently grinding the quests are meh as I create a story rather than limiting than the games limit my experience the combat system could always be improved and the guilds...I actually agree with you.,nextelderscrolls,css7rxi,3,t5_2vbsy
4933800,0,t1_ctqweco,Actually we already do. Saadias urn can be found at some place which means Kematu killed her and left her there in Skyrim. I think the sentence was already passed and Kematu lied in order to convince you to give her to him would make sense considering you go through an entire dungeon and kill all those bandits for some woman you just met. Kematu was playing it smart and it was Saadia who was lying. Its possible Kematu was going against orders but why? He knows how to paralyse someone so the only explanation is her sentence was already passed.,nextelderscrolls,cugg0rj,1,t5_2vbsy

5499239,0,t1_cwcqpy3,Id rather a smaller area was done well with detail than two provinces not done as well. I think there is a lot that can be done with a desert province in terms of scenery as there are lots of different types of dessert E.g dune deserts like arabia in the centre cold deserts like the gobi in the north rocky canyon like american westerns with large rock formations maybe savannah in the East where the province boarders Colovia and maybe scrubland deserts such as the Kalahari or the ozzy outback. Perhaps they could even have a saltplain like Bolivia. I think a good comparable would be the red dead redemption map which includes a good variety of terrain in a small area. ,nextelderscrolls,cwekvoo,2,t5_2vbsy

5829308,0,t3_3v20xl,It would definitely be nice. I think it can even be expanded for example a mercenary is probably not going to follow you around while you are doing the Dark Brotherhoods dirty work likewise a Dark Brotherhood assassin is not likely to follow you into a battle with a group of Orcs unless you are their trusted leader. On the other hand they arent likely to turn against you. Just walk away. Or inform the Jarls or whatever the town leaders will be called men in the earlier case.,nextelderscrolls,cxjqxy5,10,t5_2vbsy

6788678,0,t1_cy603fx,I know this comment is old but I think that a game in this setting would greatly benefit from a guild questline being about a group of renegade Altmer intent on toppling the oppressive Thalmor government possibly replacing the Dark Brotherhood questline. As much as I have enjoyed the Dark Brotherhood in the past the same four guilds Thieves Warriors Mages and DB have grown tiresome.

9872032,0,t3_5gosrx,I was thinking yesterday about how underwhelming the Bosmer racial ability Beast TongueCommand Animal really is. In Morrowind you could command an animal for  minutes and in Skyrim it got reduced down to  minute. I dont remember the strength of the ability in Oblivion.Making Command Animal permanent for Bosmer characters would be an interesting uptick in the utility of the power as long as the animals susceptible to it dont trivialize the game by being too strong.If Beast MasteryMonster Taming were made into skills on the other hand it could function similarly to Fallout s Intimidationstyle perks but I wasnt really in love with that mechanic.Alternatively it could be a process by which you have to defeat the animalbeastmonster several times in succession in order to break and rear the creature. Might make for a good excuse to introduce whiptype weapons into the game. In combination with more sophisticated NPC relationships the system could be designed to let you take charge of a whole pack of predators by asserting dominance over the alpha but that would need serious balance considerations due to force multiplying spells and effects such as Rally.I like your thoughts on developing riding into a skill but it would probably be one of those skills that only gets any use on the overworld. Inside dungeons I dont see the devs allowing mounts to accompany you. That said if they were cognizant of the skills inherent limitations they would do well to build around them. No room to ride a horse in a dungeon? Spend a point and bring him as a pack mule. Own multiple horses and have a great amount of spare cash? Invest your resources into the expansion of your own private fasttravel network. Not much for jousting because spears are never coming back?
