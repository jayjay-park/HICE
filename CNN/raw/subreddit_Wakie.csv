2262335,0,t1_clqyeuq,I set alarms  times a day for pain medication and one to wake up plus an optional one for meetings or if my care assistant is due to visit.The medication ones are important but my phone just times out after a minute if I dont acknowledge e.g. if I was in the loo in the garden answering the door... and even if I do I might hit dismiss then get distracted and forget. Whereas someone saying hi! go take your meds right now! have you got them? would really hit the spot.Also as a disabled person who needs to rest a lot the short answer is more often than you might think!,Wakie,clrcfjd,1,t5_34b6y
