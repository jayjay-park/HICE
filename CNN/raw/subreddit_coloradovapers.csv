1816449,0,t3_27b6x0,I love boulder vapor house but Ive had a few pretty bad experiences there to be honest and would like to find a new one. There is one guy Kurt who keeps me zoning back because he is knowledgeable and friendly but not the owners as much. Steamspot was never very enjoyable to me it felt like I was rushed in and out. I was going to try mistery because of some of their juices but Ill have to try some favorites first! ,coloradovapers,ck82crk,1,t5_2z27h
