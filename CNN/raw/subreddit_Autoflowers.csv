3462199,0,t1_cpmwfac,If I was purely interested in efficiency I would stick to one strain but this is more for my medical needs and I like variety.I keep it fairly simple I pop a new seed into a root riot cube when the oldest of the current  plants goes onto flush for its last  days or so. This means there is always  buckets on the go. Dont overthink it too much I could plant  seeds from the same strain and they end up finishing over a month apart.Remember Autoflowers are always grown from seed unlike photo were you tend to use clones. This means plants from the same strain  that came from seeds off the same plant can be wildly different.If youre just starting up and intend to grow  Autoflowers at once plant  on day  pop the third and fourth when the first starts budding up a week or so after it shows sex. The nice thing about not being tied down to light timings is that you can harvest a plant when its just ready all milky white trichs or wait an extra couple of weeks for them to go mostly amber and have something much higher in cbd.thc converts to cbd as it ages strain depending.There are plenty of ways to influence the time period of an auto the main  things I do is decide when to switch to flowering nutes and whacking them under a very red dominant light. If you have limited space switching to flowering nutes early can be super useful. ,Autoflowers,cpmwz4b,1,t5_2zy2h

Quite a nice smooth smoke.Id want to check the trichomes and then decide what to do but Id feed her anyway. Use the bloom not the grow the calmag will help with uptake a bit so you might as well use a little. Hope that helps mate but you need to look at the trichomes to decide if youll feed again after etc and next time try and get hold of a Pk boost or some high P guano to use and your bud will be a lot fatter.

4324688,0,t1_csd3edx,Yup. Fiddling is the downfall of many a grower. Find a method and master it dont be swayed by what others are doing as it looks fun or clever etc. Unless youre consistently screwing up of course.Mixing nutes is easy as long as you dont buy into some crazy system with a hundred bottles and remember to let tap water air and adjust pH after adding your nutes. Follow the guide to a point be cautious and start weaker than recommended though dont be afraid to give good dosage if they ask for it. You just dont need half of what the smug shits in the hydro shops will try and sell you. Heres my line up for autos when Im using nutes...Dutchpro A and B bloom Dutchpro multitotal Dutchpro Explode. Thats the main line up I dont even bother with veg feeds with autos. I use Plant Magic Evolution foliar spray when theyre babies as its gentle and wont burn but gives a nice little boost in veg and then a product called Blakjack from Growth Technologies its just a fulvic and humic acid source and its pretty damned good too I use that once a week and in flush for the first week.

4422127,0,t1_csnwm0o,Im on my fourth and Id say LST for sure my last one stunted for a week and fell over so I stuck with it pegged it down and it turned into a beast itll double your yield without a doubt. It matched my other two for yield and they had no problems. Ive done a lot of experimenting with the ones I have done trying different pot sizes same one all the way through varying from L to L lighting times and feeding. The last one I thought was going to be a write off what with it stunting so I pushed it really hard with the nutes and LST and it bounced back really well and gave me g. My advice is to start as soon as possible my latest was started after one week this is the earliest Ive started one bent it over to  and it was fine as itd stretched a bit which was what I wanted. Its now  weeks with much more training and I have  main colas on a plant no taller then  latest is Vision AK auto freebie worth a try to experiment on.

4437106,0,t3_3bt1ei,sounds like your on the right track if you are getting everything sorted in your head before you start. and i think the one plant is a good idea as you can really focus on it and learn what works and what doesnt without confusing the issue with multiple plants and strains and other varying factors. im sure you will do pretty well and there is always some one on hand here to help. the first thing about nutes is its very unwise to follow a shedule unless you yourself have made that shedule for your specific strain and set up. also the best way to feed is when the plant needs it and only then and you will be able to easily pick up on that if your diligant to changes and research them quickley. i would advise going for an organic soil. i also use biobiz at the moment and dont have any complaints. the texture is good its a mix of sorts and i have always thought that with it being higer priced stuff they are more likley to be diligant regarding quality control. which i think is important as u dont want to pop your bean in soil you find the ph is out on or they have missed adding an ingrediant for what ever reason and sold it anyway. etc. also soil is said to buffer ph a little making it more resiliant to feeding mistakes than coco. also if u can keep it organic biobiz claim insert comment below bongsaubob mod the bacteria in the soil will maintain a neutral ph even if your feed is out a bit. its a claim. might be BS. i havnt had any major problems with the soil. like the others said feeding will depend largley on pot size i have to give mine a ton as i use .lt pots. ideally u want to get lt and make sure its full to the brim when u plant the top is widest and the soil will sink u can loose a lot of pot size if u plant  inces from the top in a tapered pot much wider at the top.  there are no roots in the top inch usually so try and fill it right up so you dont end up with an effective lt pot from your lt. a bit more about feeding. if you know your watering at ph. you dont need to add anything really until the bottom one fingered leaf starts going yellow assuming no other symptoms. its a good idea to take a photo when that leaf is nearly all yellow and u can see the three fingered one just going pale and starting to yellow. then feed at  dose or less and take a photo again at the same time each morning and just compare them and try to gauge the rate of progression. from this you can decide how to ammend your feed next time. dont worry if that next leaf is then all yellow. just up feed to  dose or more and do the same again. plants are like buffers and they have a tollerance range. stay within tollerance and it will buffer which in terms of nitrogen means you loose a couple of leaves from teh bottom up. its better to under feed and let the plant buffer to a certain degree than to over feed let it go toxic it stops taking up water then you have to flush etc. much better to go under feed and let the plant buffer as this doesnt slow the growth too much. . .having said all this i am finding i hard with autos to get the nitrogen right. it was easy with photos. sigh. as the grow gets to about  weeks you might need to add some bloom feed but again let the plant tell you if it needs it. and again gauage the dose in the same way . hope this gives u a little to think about before you get started.  good luck,Autoflowers,cspzdez,1,t5_2zy2h
4508711,0,t1_csyoxe4,Yeah cheers for the suggestion guys but I feel like Ive got the gnat problem under control. It happened around  days after my plant sprouted and I applied fungucide and some insecticide and put sharp sand over the top. Ive seen around  in the past  days. I kind of expected to as the eggs that were laid at the time have had time to develop and turn into adults. I just wanted something to reassure everythings going to be fine and I was able to find some ho so Id rather use that.

4736382,0,t3_3frx3z,they look really good man such a shame about the disturbance with family. i wouldt advise transporting them at that stage unless its a neighbor or something or fully legal. not worth the risk. like bob says  is there no way u can hide it? how long are they staying? with them being autos if its a day or two u could leave them in the dark and turn the lights back on as normal when they leave. not ideal but they might finish off ok. i have not tried this but at that late stage in the grow u will be flushing anyway i would have thought amp it might even expediate the ripening process. as for when they will finish and if its on time. do u know what day the first pistils appeared. i have a couple of  week strains in at that mo and the first pistils appeared at day  and i do expect them to be mostly finished about day  although they will be under ripe i do tend to chop then and get more of a head high. my last kush it was day  the first pistil appeared and it was as fat as it was going to get by day  when i cropped. the current one i have in went into flower at day  and i do expect it to finish  days later later due to that but i do think that by the day before they are due to arrive it will have a lot of the bulk it just wont be ripe or fully filled out which is a shame. but u might be able to get some sort of yield. ,Autoflowers,ctrkbg7,2,t5_2zy2h

The strongest Mephisto strains right now are Alien x Triangle lab tested at  THC and the newly released Artisanal strains Skywalker  Bears OG Sour Stomper and Grape Crinkle. My personal favorite strain both for pain relief and growing is their Sour Hound. The Fantasmo Express is also awesome and a plant I can recommend but Id especially recommend Supernatural OG  A cross between Fantasmo Express and Mephistos Alien OG.   Toofless Alien sweet and Tyrone Special  auto Sour Boggle  Green Crack  are also gorgeous unique plants that are powerful Mephisto mainstays as well.   Auto Blues and Sour Blues are bred from a couple of Mitchs favorites but Id recommend to wait a few months  Mitch is in the F of backcrossing them to a fine Livers clone. ,Autoflowers,d36l5l2,2,t5_2zy2h

7828449,0,t1_d3vs0nx,Firstly I wish your were my dad. I love your parenting style and this will be the parenting style I adopt should I ever have children.I would not be opposed to my child using a CBD medication  with little to no THC if they needed it. I would not want them smoking until ideally .  preferable. More research needs to be done on cannabis though and for that we need activism.In regards to your comment about Ive seen people smoke heavily. I think humans have always had this issue of staying frozen in one place in time even without any mind or body alternating substances. Its part of human nature can cannabis exacerbate things? I think it can make things worse or make things better. Just depends on the person. Im sure youve seen people smoke cannabis all their life and lead successful lives.Its all down to the person this is why if cannabis or any drug becomes legalised and money that is made from it should go into rehab clinics and programmes. We need a better health service in general but thats for another day.gt Cannabis isnt harmless. Its a lesser evil but still a potentially life ruining substance. Discussion is vital but only if we posses all the facts.Truer words could not be said. Thats why I will be pursuing cannabis activism in the UK even though I know I am benefiting positively from cannabis effects in the here and now what about in years to come? Nothing should be taboo in the world of natural science we should study everything in nature every way possible. Having rules in place that stop this from happening is potentially stopping our understanding of the universe.Have you seen the TV show Weediquette? I recommend it to everyone now. It is procannabis but its a very good journalistic piece overall imo.My uncle sounds very similar to you. He has a wife  kids one is  the other . He has been smoking since he was a teenager now late s. But has never denied his cannabis use both he and his wife smoked when they met. She has since stopped he has continued. He is a codirector of a company previously started other businesses and sold them has grown cannabis in his garden. He like you also keeps it from his kids. He has not grown since his first child and avoids smoking around them. I think his eldest will likely be coming to him about cannabis in the next few years. Thinking about it my uncles parenting style is similar to yours.I really hope that cannabis legislation comes in soon so that parents like you can keep doing what you are doing without fear that the police will come knocking about their grow. I hope your kids release what a fucking great dad they have.Trust me though for people who have only ever experienced darkness  cannabis can be a light.,Autoflowers,d3vzg9a,2,t5_2zy2h

9463656,0,t1_d9fjxww,Specifically that feed isnt ideal but itll work. Autos have mildly different requirements but are basically exactly the same as a photo. There are no elements that either one uses over the other. They dont like being fed too much early on as this can cause stunting as theyre not able to recover before or during transition to flower but thats about it. The exact same nutes will feed an auto in exactly the same way they would a photo.  Derivation is the only difference between feeds some are immediately available in the pot while others rely on some biology to help out. In the end though elements are elements and its not really much different whether an organic or salt based feed. The plant cant tell any difference auto or photoperiod. ,Autoflowers,d9fl2j6,3,t5_2zy2h

11280508,0,t1_df9fgi3,Id give u a link but Im on my phone and cant figure it out. Google Mephisto genetics. You can search strains from there. Ive heard good things about their seeds and recently ordered from them. Ordering was easy and got my order in about  weeks. I have not planted anything yet gotta wait  months because of work vacation etc. So I cannot comment on the quality.,Autoflowers,dfamnn8,1,t5_2zy2h

11299840,0,t1_dfcszbm,Super! Thanks once again Henry. The pump is a crazy bubble machine! I have it only opened  and its just on the verge of too much with a single medium airstone. Once I add the other G with my RQS Quick one it should be a bit more manageable.,Autoflowers,dfctj8e,0,t5_2zy2h
11301669,0,t3_61a3qs,I see slight heat stress edges curling up and maybe a bit of N deficiency pale leaves but nothing too serious. Also be careful on how much youre watering. Looks a bit droopy but nothing it wont make it through. Looking good though. Happy growing!,Autoflowers,dfd0zyv,1,t5_2zy2h

11361959,0,t1_dfj4ezs,I find the grow strong if anything not made my mind up on the bloom yet. I know that they have changed the recipe and its become thinner so maybe weaker. Ive still not finished a grow with them yet as I was using chem nutes and biobizz before this. So far I prefer biobizz but REALLY want to like these more. ,Autoflowers,dfjuuqp,1,t5_2zy2h

11367351,0,t3_626v2w,It looks like some water with nutrients fell on the leaves and they got chemically burnt... If it hasnt spread maybe its that... Edit maybe a Mag deficiency? ,Autoflowers,dfkgtzn,3,t5_2zy2h
11372189,0,t3_62aaue,I wouldnt flush that its fading already. Just dont feed it on its last  days or so depending on medium.    Theres also lots of new calyx production check trichomes on calyxes and dont blindly trust the breeders estimate. Good first grow so far congrats!,Autoflowers,dfl0lp0,6,t5_2zy2h

11445061,0,t1_dft9yfs,I got  more seeds of white crack and if it smokes anything like it grew Im going to do a full tent run of them by summer !,Autoflowers,dftacwu,1,t5_2zy2h
11445816,0,t3_63d15c,I have the exact same problem. In my instance I keep going in the grow room and exchanging air manually by opening the garage doors. Thanks fuck Im nearing the end of the grow month off. Right now Im not willing to shut down any lights or dim anything. Fuck that. Ill ride the babies through the thickest of shit. Im not letting them down.So yeah a temporary solution is to try to get a more frequent air exchange of the space your tent is in. The external room is a weather microbubble. Controlling that can help.But honestly... the only real solution is air conditioning. I know a lot of hobby growers dont wanna hear about it but if youre set into doing it allyear around air conditioning is the only viable solution. Unless youre ok with riding the fucking summer out with one puny joke of a W CFL. Enjoy smoking that one lone bud.Edit And shopping for an air condition unit is a bitch. Some just cant handle the noise. Some dont like the monthly bills poking out of that asshole. Some just dont have space. And some just cant afford it cause this fucker aint cheap. In my instance I can do without if I dont even think about growing over the summer. But others dont accept the idea and I get it. Summers a juicy insatiable very lucrative and productive season. A lot of pussy. Wait what?,Autoflowers,dftdfz0,1,t5_2zy2h

11447705,0,t1_dftkyx5,basically its just the lower buds are left on the plant and the top ones harvested first. The lower buds are then left to flower for another  weeks or so. He says in the comments underneath Try it Afghan Kush Ryder was an autoflower and it was regenerated.Honestly just start a new grow its not worth the time.Some had tried it works but not great nor it is perfected.,Autoflowers,dftl5rd,1,t5_2zy2h

11657884,0,t1_dghen62,Yeah its worrying when they are all lanky and airy but you just gotta imagine them fat and then wait . Sound plan I can see the logic! Id personally do less plants next time though and maybe train them a bit more and defoliate so there is less bushiness like you said. I can imagine the taping up becomes tiresome after a while haha.My first grow got me about g so I reckon youre going to whomp that . Top draw mate nice one.,Autoflowers,dghfozd,2,t5_2zy2h

11769365,0,t1_dgtv0n0,It really depends. Veg nutes would just confuse it if you didnt add too many.  If this is just on a lower leaf and you are towards the end of flower it can be the natural cannabalism of the plant to pull every last stored nute out and push it into the buds. ,Autoflowers,dgu373h,2,t5_2zy2h
