9270439,0,t1_d8ogbuq,Hey I made a larger GIF today and exported with  settings for comparison.Heres a link to a zip file with them.One is with the legacy export system on lowest quality  one on highest . very little difference if any with very similar file size and one on the new system.The colour is off on the ship in the legacy system but the overall colour is off in the new system. I dont know how much help this is but I find it frustrating that youve a fantastic GIF capture program but I can never get a good GIF exported from it.,screentogif,d8r3fks,1,t5_30g4p
