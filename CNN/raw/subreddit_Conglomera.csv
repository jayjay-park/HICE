3159322,0,t1_copg38x,Mathmatical sense isnt a concern for me as long as it has consistent internal logic. The problem then becomes we have to create that consistent internal logic. What makes the planet move around its star? If gravity then why doesnt the half dyson sphere just get sucked into the star? What is keeping the people on the planet? What is the force of gravity on the planet and is is consistent?Some people like to circumvent this and just wave their hands and say Magic but Im not a personal fan of that. An internal logic makes a universe make sense. If it doesnt have internal logic then you might as well just have the characters do anything they want.Changing something as large as the physics of the universe brings up a ton of questions and I dont mind answering those questions if I feel that the decision will bring something to the universe but Im not all about creating a weird universe just because its weird and neat.,Conglomera,copgmqx,3,t5_36wzc

3232091,0,t3_2x4vv5,The Gremlins HoardEver had an item thats been inexplicably lost? You look everywhere but you still cant find it. Obviously its been taken. You didnt lose it the gremlins stole it. Thats what you tell yourself but I bet you never realised that its actually the truth. But where do the gremlins take it and what do they do with their new possession? Well to find that out youd have to catch one of the little buggers and make it talk. Thats not so difficult gremlins hate salt and will spill the beans straight away if threatened with it. So youve caught your gremlin and threatened it with salt. It straight away offers to take you to its hoard. You agree and release the creature. It wont run away gremlins always keep their promises. It will lead you down twisting passages through the earth deeper and deeper until you reach its hoard. And what a hoard it is made up of all the objects anyone has ever lost. Looking closer you see that beloved toy you had as a child or perhaps that pair of reading glasses that mysteriously disappeared. So you do what anybody would you take back your stolen items and return to the surface. But heres where you learn about the gremlins other hoard.You see the passage down to the hoard is labyrinthian made up of millions of twisted pathways that go round in circles or finish in dead ends. And although the gremlin promised to take you to its hoard it said nothing about guiding you back to safety. The labyrinth is also jet black devoid of all light. You would spend the rest of your short life stumbling around in the darkness desperately searching for the exit. Meanwhile the gremlin follows you at a distance salivating at the thought of its imminent meal and red eyes glowing with excitement. Then when you finally succumb to starvation or exhaustion it will take you to its second hoard the skeletal collection of fools who followed the gremlin into its unearthly labyrinth. And there it will finally have its well earned meal.Remember this tale. If something is lost without hope do not attempt to search for it. Its not worth becoming part of the gremlins hoard of bones.,Conglomera,cox0foz,6,t5_36wzc

3501638,0,t3_301vkf,I wrote this last night after a fun conversation with uLeVentNoir about the rogues of the Rahi Vasa Company. Let me know what you think. Until we develop human cultures further Im referring to the port city in the Bay of Plenty as The Harbor.Map for referenceDamn those Ravaco bastards! Duke Rassalon yelled pounding his fist on the desk in front of him. Thats  reports of attacks in the last  weeks alone. Theyre getting bolder. Theyve even got the Ferrymen worried now!Before him stood Councillor Mako the Dukes Head of Harbor Affairs. Mako was a Huilean from the islands to the south whose family had migrated to the Harbor when they heard of the trade opportunities there. They were very competent traders and as such rose to prominence rather quickly. Mako had used his newfound influence to climb the ranks of nobles all the way to his current station. He was rather proud of himself for that and had a tendency to seem a bit pompous because of it. But today the Duke was in no mood for that.Your Grace the people are well aware of the ahem terms weve negotiated with the Rahi Vasa Company. Theyve never been ones to violate a contract and they keep the Kings peace within the city limits.Terms snorted the Duke. Bah! Its practically piracy is what it is! Trade with us or else. Meanwhile they squeeze every last copper they can out of a deal and seize the goods of anyone who refuses them. Oh sure they behave well enough under the eyes of my watchmen. But meet one out at sea and youre bound to leave with a lighter purse if you leave at all. Tell me why we suffer these fools traditions again?Sir you know that the Ravaco have superior naval technology. We outmatch them only in numbers and discipline. Any attempt to move against them would see heavy losses on both sides. Not to mention the revenue they bring in to the city. As Ive said before the taxes aloneTaxes! These brigands are robbing my citizens blind and you bleat at me with that same old tale of terms and taxes? Ive heard enough. Youre dismissed Mako. Send for Councillor Haama on your way out.Very well Your Grace Mako said retreating with a neat bow. Now was not the time for pomposity at all. The Duke was more upset than he had ever seen him although for good reason. The Rahi Vasa Company had been making their deals more and more onesided lately and no one seemed to have an explanation for it. Despite the terms of the Kana Vasa treaty it looked like the tension between the two island territories was about to come to a head. Mako wasnt quite as worried though. As he said the Ravaco werent ones to go back on a contract. They had a queer sort of moral code but they stuck by it. No one knew that better than him. After all it was his dealings with the Company years before that had helped to establish his family as one of the premier merchant families of the Harbor. It was through that familiarity that he was able to negotiate with them so well and fund his rise to Head of Harbor Affairs. Not that he could tell that to the Duke. If he ever found out it would undo everything he had worked so hard for.He wont find out thought Mako. He cant. The contract was ironclad. The Ravaco will keep their word. At least as far as Im concerned. The Duke however will have to fend for himself... ,Conglomera,cpretqy,3,t5_36wzc

The thread listing canon proposals is a great idea.For when we submit full stories then would the story become canon automatically as long as it remains within the framework of canon?

4147413,0,t3_387tii,Hospitality for HeroesIn the desert Nomad land there is a anger lurking in the sand it was the old evil that drove the nomad to become nomads. A desert dweling creature lurking benith the sands like some kind of desertfish. It search out its prey and then they attack an entire stim of them jumping up on you and consumes you draging you benith the sand.By staying mobile the huge amount of vibration made by all the pact animals and wandering people created a background noice that made it impossible for the sand devils as they are called to find the nomads.This naturally ment that building cities or permanent settelment was out of the deal until they showed up.A group of trained desert fishes using specalised tools they keep the sand devil population low enought to allow permanent settelment its a dangerus job so all cities let them stay in their cities for free. There are a good number of guilds nowadays devoted to the sand devil fishing the most famous group the Red Eye is one of the first groups to devote to this and have a base in the city of Kelnor at the center of the desert.,Conglomera,crt0r3n,2,t5_36wzc
