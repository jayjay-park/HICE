3761191,0,t3_33h7m2,I have heard this band and like some of their songs but have not listened to them a whole lot so I dont know anything about all this. I just looked at the Wikipedia page and I am confused. It looks like they disbanded in  with a farewell concert and everything. Then there was a new band in  with only one guy from the original band. Now there is an entirely new band in  with no one from either of those bands. Why are they Audio Audrenaline?,ChristianMusic,cql05dv,5,t5_2qlkq

7169847,0,t1_d1t4cjj,Ive use Spotify a bit but I spend most of my music listening time in a rental car its KSOS or iTunes. But Ill definitely look at the artists you recommend. Im not all THAT hard but Im definitely more of a rock guy than a pop guy. I like the stuff Kutless did on Strong Tower.

8149399,0,t3_4quvbm,Interesting. I love their new stuff but its not the NEEDTOBREATHE I originally fell in love with. The sound is definitely inspired by the Brother remix which given the massive success isnt a bad direction to move in.The lyrics for this song and Happiness especially are definitely written by the Brothers Rinehart but I feel this sound is an attempt to be more marketable. It sounds a lot like they got Mr. Kearney to produce or work with them. That wouldnt be a surprise given their track record of touring buddies and the album theyre promoting. Taylor Swift The Heat Third Day The Reckoning Gavin Degraw Rivers in the WastelandThat being said I dont know why they are moving in this direction. Perhaps the MUMFORDlike acoustic sound reminds them too much of their past at the moment or maybe they collectively wanted to try something new.Either way from what Ive heard their new album is good. Its just different.,ChristianMusic,d4w80ma,3,t5_2qlkq
