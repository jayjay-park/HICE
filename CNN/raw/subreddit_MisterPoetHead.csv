2143170,0,t3_2iroru,As someone who knows about going to college lived in the conditions they are talking about now on the news... I can say yes I agree with Bill that working hard can get you out of a situation BUT you cant get out of the situation alone you need to bring your friends... Thats kinda hard to do when your friends are out there doing the stupidest of shit to get money... You cant tell someone to work hard and expect them to work hard for it... they have no reason to work hard because they didnt ask to be put in a situation where they have to do bad in order to survive. This affects their mindstate OH I TURNED INTO A BAD GUY I DONT Need education now I just need to keep doing bad to survive... Honestly did no one learn anything from going to church? If you see a man that somehow made something of himself from nothing did that not somehow inspire you to be a better person to think why? What if? Nothing at all?,MisterPoetHead,clc8tx1,1,t5_33y2d
