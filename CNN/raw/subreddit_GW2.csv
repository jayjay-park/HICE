640693,0,t1_cel8fn9,I would suggest thief. Mainly because there ARENT cool downs just initiative. This doesnt mean you should spam skills left and right but it should help with your hidden problem.The only downside is that max range is  on shortbow or pistols but its far enough for most purposes.I would suggest taking shortbow and swordpistol for pve. If youre into WvW I enjoy shortbow and daggerdagger.Edit lots of people dont like thieves because they can die easily. But IMO dying is part of learning what youre doing wrong. Dont get too frustrated and see what you can do to not die the next time. Repeat until successful.,GW2,cgd3imv,1,t5_2sisz
