106549,0,t3_1v5vj3,I know the feeling. Most of the time as some users have already pointed out its because you are hungry but your brain cant interpret it properly.When this happened to me it was because there was something stressful going on and it distorted my hunger into something terrible. But if I tried to focus on something else or just relax then everything would go back to normality again.Anyways for extreme cases I would take a sip of yoghurt or ice cream just a small portion less than a spoon and it would dispel the nausea and leave only the hunger.,emetophobia,ceqk8s5,1,t5_2vnka

Im a teenager so I cant say I have experience with the whole kids and getting sick situation.. but whenever I had anxiety in its first few times when I was  I make my mother pray with me in the kitchen that I would be fine and she would mock me and call me crazy. She always told me oh youll be fine when you grow up and drink youll v if it happens it happens it wont be that bad.. Well it hasnt gotten any better.Ive got a few questions for you though. . What can I do about my anxiety and getting on meds for it? My family doesnt like anyone taking medicine for psychological things so what can I tell them to convince them to let me see a doctor?. I want to have a family of my own one day but far away from now.. lol and Im deathly scared of morning sickness. You mention your kids in your story.

Youre likely fine and even if you had accidently swallowed some of the water you would still be likely fine!Its good that you pushed yourself  remember your anxiety is a bit higher right now because you pushed yourself beyond your comfort zone.

And thankfully Im not missing out on anything due to my phobia not yet and not really though it happened once or twice in the past because the phobia made me feel like I was actually sick.Yeah Im kinda scared of that. And I know how silly it sounds. Though when I was younger there was this period of time when I was feeling nauseous as I was trying to fall asleep and my mum took me to the doctor but she said everything seemed alright and I should just try to be on a diet for a few days.

It makes you realize how unsanitary a lot of people are  not to say that being overly so like me is necessarily a good thing either. Unfortunately its also easy to catch as your body only needs to ingest a very small amount of the norovirus particles to catch it. Im taking a trip to DC for the Sakura Matsuri cherry blossom festival and Im excited... but nervous about it at the same time since I will be around so many people at what seems to be a bad time of year for the virus.

Im happy to have my daughter and love her more than I could have ever imagined loving anything. I have a feeling I will slowly get over my fear and become desensitized to certain gross stuff.

5882211,0,t1_cxnoq8g,Yes this is the point my dad told me when I was younger about my phobia How many days are there in a year? In those  days you may NOT even get sick. But if you spend all of those days worrying over nothing you are not living a full life. Even if you do get sick you arent going to be sick all year maybe  days tops. They may be the worst  days but everything will be okay. I still get scared but I try to think of it that way. ,emetophobia,cxqovm7,1,t5_2vnka
6011464,0,t1_cy7l3st,Well as long as you didnt drink from her water bottle after she started the v you should be cool.  People arent contagious until they start shedding the virus.  Just wash your hands before you eat anything bleach out the bathroom to cut way down on potential contamination doorknobs too and in the future maybe cut down on the sharing of water bottles so you dont find yourself worrying needlessly.  I survived three rounds of SV in my apartment.  My roommates are gross people but I kept up my handwashing bleached shared surfaces and didnt share a damn thing that went in my mouth with them and Ive been cool for three bouts.Also the above poster is right.  I know it isnt reassuring in the slightest right now but you need to think about it logically as much as you possibly can which is something I have to find myself doing more than occasionally as a fellow phobe.  One day that virus will most likely get in you.  Youll be fine.  Itll suck but not nearly as bad as you think it will.  Once your body decides its gotta do the thing itll do the thing and youll seriously laugh at how gross being a human is and how much time you spent worrying about something that is so normal to most of the population and really not that big of a deal at all.  Youll feel like you achieved victory....Trust me.  And when its happening you can come here and vent and say whatever you want about it and there will be a bunch of us to talk to.For reference Im .  Hadnt Ved since I was ten years old.  Probably should have multiple times but never let myself.  Then I got FP from some Chinese food and thought I was going to die.  Then I Ved for like an hour straight and spent the rest of the day in bed feeling like I climbed Mount Everest.  Bragged about how brave I was to my roommates who were just like hey good job I guess.  After a year or two my phobia came back and I have to remind myself whenever I feel a twinge of N that if it ever comes to that Ill be fine.  And once Im better Ill go on a shopping spree to reward myself and brag all over again to people who will never understand how many calories I burn worrying about things needlessly.Youll be fine either way but good luck to you.,emetophobia,cy7ms3u,2,t5_2vnka
6077538,0,t3_3yrcqe,I still get that blah and gross feeling as well. I also get headaches sometimes even migraines. Excedrin really helps though it makes my heart race because of the caffeine.

It was advised by my doctor. Instead of feeling crappy the whole week my period got cut down to  days and I only feel shitty max one day if at all.

I did still eat at chipotle through the whole scandal I wasnt too worried. And I love chipotle. Im reaaally careful about my meat though and making sure I safely thaw beefchicken and dont keep it too long.But I agree that i wished people could understand just what we mean when we say we hate it.

EMDR did absolutely nothing for me but what really worked was a program called Cure your Emetophobia and Thrive. You can buy the book on Amazon alone or buy it and do therapy with a Thrive certified therapist. I did mine over Skype with a therapist in my country but two time zones away. Gotta love Canada he was the closest one in the country.
