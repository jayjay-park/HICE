559233,0,t3_20jft4,If you really wanted to fight you should have gone infantry. I thought that would have been common sense. Too late now though.You might not wanna intentionally fail out of data. You might not automatically get sent to radio school. You might get sent to wire school instead . Are you still in MAT platoon? If so ask whoevers in charge of MAT platoon if theres any possible way you can pick up with a radio class instead of a data class or find a guy slated for radio that wants to be data instead and see if you can do a swap with him. Volunteer to go to Mojave Viper or rake the sand in front of the duty hut or any of the other shitty working party jobs if that helps you get on their good side and make them more willing to help you out.Reason I even suggest this as a possibility is because when I was in MAT platoon there was this absolute shitbag wook who had been in MAT platoon for ages because she kept failing out of her classes and failing her PFTs. She was slated to pick up with a wire class because of how dumb and out of shape she was but apparently the SSgt in charge of MAT platoon thought she was great so he gave her all kinds of special treatment. This SSgt whose name escapes me right now pulled some strings and let her pick up with a radio class instead of a wire class. MY radio class. She ended up being my fucking Class Commander by some stroke of fucktarded bulltrash.If that kind of ridiculous bullshit is allowed to happen to benefit a complete waste of space shitbag I dont see why they wouldnt be willing to do it for a motivated hardcharging Marine who isnt a shitbag.Fuck it talk about how the Navajo code talkers are a huge source of inspiration for you even if they arent and maybe SSgts ensuing motoboner will make him cave.,USMC,cg3uax1,3,t5_2qswv

1565374,0,t3_2c6npx,Fugball. Its kind of like ultimate frisbee but you play it with a football or rugby ball and theres no limit on how many steps you can take. Instead of an endzone you have a x or so box marked out with cones. Goal is to throw the ball from outside the box to someone inside the box. Rules outsider the box are pretty simple. Play start by kicking the ball to the other team then. Run until you are tagged pass the ball to a teammate. Have to give the passer room to throw the ball and pass interference type rules apply to defending a receiver. Unless the receiver is inside the box the you can push his ass out if the box shove him to the ground etc. If a receiver drops the pass or the ball is intercepted posses changes and the other team starts from the spot of the dropped ball or interception. It can get pretty physical inside the box so keep an eye on the jackasses who might do something dumb like throw a punch or get overly butthurt. But for the most part its a tone of fun everyone will be dripping with sweat by the end. you can incorporate little punishments for the team that gets scored on such as  ammo can lifts or buddy drags to their end of the field or something of that nature. I will reiterate though that it only takes one jackass getting butthurt to ruin it for everyone. My old shop used to play every other Friday until one kid just lost his fucking mind and took a swing at someone for tagging him too hard. The guys team was winning too. Anyhow it just happened to be the day our Msgt and some officers decided to play as well. So needles to say we went back to gay shit like ultimate frisbee after that Edit shit just saw the last bit. Ill haze myself for lack of attention to detail later. Either way its an idea for a fun PT that lets guys get a little aggression out. ,USMC,cjchqww,5,t5_2qswv

Being close to the top of the dysfunctional thought processes and realworld rejects that clutter the SNCO ranks was so disillusioning and I had injuries that kept me from pursuing a move to the officer corps.

Well we had a Major who was really competitive and a CWO who was a super runner ultra marathon type.Well they are on opposite teams and sprint down the sideline while a Cpl launches the frisbee.  They both jump and collide mid air.  They come down hard and we go running to them to see if theyre injured.  They both help each other up laughing.Heres where it gets good after they help each other up their eyes lock.  After a brief moment they must of seen something in the others eyes because fist start flying.  About  of us NCOs separate them and they start talking shit to each other stuff like No wonder your wife says she likes to be hit during sex I barely felt that. etc as they are being separated.After a few lines EVERYBODY start to laugh.  They both high five and look at us and tell us No one tells the Colonel. We went back to playing.It sounds cool but it was awkward uncomfortable and totally WTF.,USMC,cmdcudv,15,t5_2qswv

If you can barely do  you should be able to do  to anticipate for the strict observers especially if you want to be an officer.Before my career I had a pullup bar at my bathroom door and made myself do a max set before and after hitting the head.

I joined with disqualifying childhood asthma that I didnt tell them about because I hadnt had an attack in  years but thats  years of certainty. I know absolutely zero about epilepsy so I wont tell you what you can and cant do. Just that you have choices and those choices have consequences. Common sense applies in this situation.If you have issues in the civilian world where your condition interferes with day to day life in any way I personally would find another avenue. Join some organizations find some adult sports leagues volunteer to help veterans. Theres no shortage of things to do stateside and youd be joining a peacetime Marine Corps. There are alternatives to challenging yourself through the Marine Corps. Ones where you can control the length of time the conditions and whether you have meds as a safety net.

This was  it was some training deployment not a combat situation or anything like that. Anyway I thought great Ill get to spend my last three months on the beach. Nope my orders were modified to HQ Co th Marines. I spent three months on barracks maintenance duty with the occasional job of observing piss tests. I should have known they werent going to send my ass down to Pendleton being so short. I did spend a month there when I returned from Oki with s advanced party. Basically taking inventory of the equipment from the battalion that took our place in Oki.

My package had been approved for EOD I was going to have a guaranteed school date and I was really excited. I loved EOD those guys saved our asses so many times and it was exactly what I wanted. I got recommendations from my Ssgts Gunny and former Gunnies My Lts My company CO My battalion SgtMaj Battalion XO and battalion commanders. I was getting ready to reenlist and joking with a friend that I had decided not to....Complete joke. I got called to the company office and two Of the Ssgts and a few others started telling me how big of a piece of shit I was and waste of space and how I didnt deserve to reenlist. That ultimately led me to get out. I ran into my BN Commander two years after I got out at the Atlanta airport and told him what had happened. He was appalled. Looking back on it Im glad I didnt do it. I had hoped things wouldve changed going EOD. All the guys that came up with me that did reenlist where the guys that always fell out of humps fell out of patrols overseas. I saw through Facebook the other day that a guy was meritorious Ssgt for some school training new marines. This guy on deployment while we were applying tourniquets to one of our brothers that later turned out to be a fallen angel Ran up on him and while he was still conscious said Theres too much blood Hes not going to make it. ,USMC,cv4ap3x,1,t5_2qswv

As flight e you will be the one working on coveralls and flight suits so hook people up when they need coveralls done and hook them up if they want some flight suits that will make you friends faster than anything else. Then once you have friends in other shops offer to go out on jobs with them you will have plenty of time to do so being flight e. This will help teach you about other shops work. As for making it official for civilian use after the Corps once you get your CDI for your shop talk to your SNCO or training manager to get you other shops training and quals assigned to you in ASM so you can get them signed off and use that to take to employers after youre out. Your training jacket which you get from ASM is what they will look at to see what you are skilled at doing. It wont be easy but it you really want to learn other jobs thats one way to.

Things arent as bad as they feel. Focus on the good things in your life and you will have to consciously choose to do so because the depression wont let that be your default state. If you dont feel like you have any good to focus on make some good.

At the very least reporting it and having the person identified could help prevent another person from being put through the same ordeal.

If you dont plan on going to college then you might as well get some of that bah money. The negative to using it is as you progress and your pay goes up your bah payments go down quickly which sucks. Luckly my first month on the job another vet told me about the vocational rehab program. My basic understanding is that if you have a disability rating  or  I believe you can use this program instead of the gi bill. The two big benefits im seeing vs the gi bill.... Your bah payments stay maxed out the entire time instead of doing down.. They can help you out with toolsclothingboots. My situation was a bit different as I was already in the union but it looked like most guys were there because they couldnt find any work at all or they wanted to retrain into a different field. So far my experience with the voc rehab program has been nothing but positive and I highly recommend it to anybody not really wanting to use their gi bill benefits. ,USMC,cx2vnxq,1,t5_2qswv

Its the same exact idiocy.Wouldnt take much to prove it.gt Thats really not even the point at all. The point is more to do with bias based on religion.

I have risen myself up out of our home but most people dont ever leave that home town and just become criminals. That is their fault and their fault alone.

6430686,0,t1_czkgjke,I wasnt a marine but I hang around these military subs because my professional background is extremely involved in active duty military foreign policy and veterans affairs. So I care about these issues. I cant comment on the transition from military to college but I did indeed graduate in political science. Many of the Marines I met at school were involved in political science as well. My advice is to keep your options open. Surprisingly before I worked for the government I worked advocacy issues for an environmental non profit. If your goal is to work for an elected official or the government try to focus on the ISSUES you care about and rather than telling yourself you need to work for the government right away try to keep your eye on organizations and non profits that also work on the issues you care about. For me I worked at this environmental non profit running social media and organizing events and had an opening as an outreach coordinator in a congressional office. My skills and responsibilities transitioned well. My job was to meet with constituents who wanted to discuss and advocate for the issues I was passionate about and to organize and design private and public events hosted by my boss and valued constituents. Working for the government and working toward legislative issues you are passionate for should go hand in hand. There are a lot of great volunteer opportunities for students both in local government near your college or fr nearby campaigns. A lot of legislative staffers get hired from volunteer positions during their campaign. Your military experience will give you a huge advantage both in maturity and dedication toward important issues congressional offices work toward.,USMC,czkgz3w,1,t5_2qswv

8672459,0,t3_4yoyod,For me ITB was much more of a kick in the balls than boot camp ever was. I kinda knew what I was in for when I began boot camp but had no idea what ITB even was let alone what Id be doing. Boot camp is more about breaking you down psychologically in order to build you back up. ITB is far more physical. The hikes will fucking suck especially with how hot its been. Dont believe that boot camp nonsense about how youre a respected Marine now that youve passed initiation. Youll be treated like shit because youre a boot and you probably wont be treated with much respect until after your first deployment. Life will suck for a while. Be smart with your money. I was so fucking stupid with my money that I ended up overdrafting my bank account almost every other week. Save that shit man. When you go out in town ignore every fucking store that says they have special deals for Marines. Its a huge scam that they play on new Marines because for most of us this is the first time weve had a reliable paycheck and we dont know any better. Wear a fucking condom. Dont be that guy walking around with your dog tags out and a marpat backpack in the mall. That guy is a dildo. Capitalize on other peoples laziness. Weekend firewatch was done by the hour when I was in ITB and people will offer serious money for you to take it. The same goes with dip cigarettes and snacks. Take some extra with you in the field and sell it to the other Marines for a nice profit. Consider switching to USAA for banking. Ditch the one they pushed onto you in boot camp.,USMC,d6pog35,13,t5_2qswv

The boat space report for fy isnt even out yet and youre making many assumptions about what is and isnt available. Reservists utilizing the PSEP program are treated as first term reenlistments per MCO .A. obligated reservistsstill on contract will only be reenlisted into their contract MOS. non obligated prior service and IRR have up to three choices on open MOS for that fiscal year. On the obligated side a reservist needs to be released by the reserves via DD signed off by their chain of command MAW MARDIV MARFORRES before a regular recruiter can start submitting a new enlistment package. enlistee proves that there are open MOS gets enlistment package approved at regional RS level of MCRCMarine Corps Recruiting Command enlistee is sent to MEPS and approved. Package gets sent up to district level of MCRC and entered into TFRS to be submitted to the office of the CG of MCRC and if approved a RELM is sent back down enlistee signs it and TA fucking DA active duty is attained.without all the bullshit thats how its supposed to go. I make it sound easy but first hand Ill say it is the most difficult task to perform. boot camp all over again would be easier. nonetheless dont spread god damn misinformation.

See MARADMIN However if you dont have this figured out by now Im not sure youll get it done by the rd. The way the Marine Corps sets up pay for new recruits doesnt allow you to send money to your old account if this has changed maybe somebody whos been through recently can comment. Plus it can take awhile to get paid for the first time and youre definitely not going to have time to pay bills. If you dont already have money set aside and have someone trusted to make the payments for you Im not sure how you could make this work. You could perhaps see about getting a loan to pay three months of rent in advance but I dont recommend it. As others have mentioned using SCRA to break your lease may be your best option.

10840216,0,t3_5uysbe,Wifeys viewpoint  We just PCSd after  years there. I am a huge fan of living on base. We have  young kids and having a safe neighborhood with tons of other kids running round is wonderful. However its a transient place due to schools so lots of movers every summer can make it tough with yearly goodbyes.tis the life. Quick access to  from base makes for quick trips to Stafford or Woodbridge.  DC is m to hr away. I dont know if most of your work will be on Quantico or Anacostia.  Im not familiar with communities near the latter. We had friends sans kids who enjoyed the downtown city life of Alexandria.  Your commute to Quantico would be against traffic at least. Take into account the traffic travel times when looking where to live.   gets bad sometimes ok lots of times unpredictably. But the HOV lane goes to the Stafford exit and is being lengthened still.As for buying vs renting it depends on the type of area you want. Homes are expensive up there but market seems pretty steady so selling after you leave may not be too bad.  My husband may be applying to HMX in a couple years. If that works out weve discussed renting in Stafford.  Schools are great for the kiddos and we like that area. We still will consider base housing but there arent as many homes for the rank hell be then. Hope this helps a bit. Good luck! Ruh! Edit Husbands opinionHe says to accept the traffic as part of your life. Dont get mad just embrace it. Sounds like you dont have kids so he suggests looking into renting in areas as Montclair off route  or north of Occoquan on route . Avoid Woodbridge Hoodbridge. Those areas are north of Quantico and youll have closer access to DC and nightlife.,USMC,ddy3azw,4,t5_2qswv

I wouldnt call them special operations considering they only have one company sized element that supports the UK special operations.
