309466,0,t3_1x0ie3,I went to his auction here in Houston a few weeks ago when they were closing a Tilt arcade. There will be people there overpaying left and right. There were maybe two or three that went for a decent price but a majority were ticket games and claw machines. You get some guys that try to show their money like they are on storage wars or something. Some guys were in their over bidding everything so it took some fun out of the experience. I Dont have my sheet in front of me but they paid like  for what Im  sure was a non licensed angry birds ride. I heard the owner say to his guy that it was almost double what he paid. But I will say the guy from Captains is a pretty funny guy and he seems to know his stuff. All in all I had fun though. Get there early see if there is anything you like and grab a items list. If youre items arent until the end then plan accordingly as I wasted my whole Saturday watching claw machines sell because I didnt realizing there was a list with the order of the machines.

1139944,0,t3_276ato,without peering into the console itself id guess that someone attempted to rewire the buttons in groups and accidentally switched the ground wire for these  buttons with the activation wire. microswitches themselves are dead simple if you have access to the console it should be a relatively quick fix. you can wire all the buttons and directions with a single daisy chained ground wire or you could ground each one individually or just do a few in your case  at once. to fix find the ground for the other buttons that work and chain it over to the ones that dont making sure that you disconnect their previous connections. wire up their individual activation wires to exactly the same part of the microswitch or leaf switch whatever the case may be that works on the other buttons. worse case scenario you have to buy new microswitches which are like  bucks each for really nice ones.  but my best guess is its a ground wire group reversed. good luck Kingofswanland. edit sorry i didnt read your comments on the top there im sorry i spoke too soon. im not sure what it is but i hope you find out. ,cade,chxurxh,3,t5_2snqq

If you were able to do what you did with it without extensive woodwork and such then it mustve been in fairly solid shape to start with and could likely have been cosmetically restored with no more effort than you put into what you did. That said  arcade operators were frequently guilty of atrocities much worse than this conversion.

Using an adapter means you wont have to rewire the entire cabinet and you can always remove the adapter and throw Megazone back in if you ever want to.

3579941,0,t1_cq0b3wv, Assuming  you are referring to the Super Deluxe version of Terminator Salvation.  As far as the gamegun are concerned there are no performance differences.  The main performance differences are those associate with a projector vs an LCD panel.

4031067,0,t1_crfml4q,No Coke Pepsi. Heres a picture showing the typical locations of the adjustment knobs. The exact location will vary a bit depending on the exact make and model of monitor you have. Newer monitors will have the picture controls on a remote board  usually located innear the control panel or behind the monitor bezel  for easier access. A few older uncommon monitors had the color controls located on the chassis itself instead of the neckboard. The controls themselves also vary from model to model and different brands used different names for the same controls. Because most monitors let you dial in your colors individually not all monitors have a contrast adjustment for instance. The good news is it all sounds a lot more complicated than it is youll probably fiddle with the red and green knobs for two or three minutes get your color bars looking decent then call it a day. Its just finding the knobs and not accidentally shocking yourself thats tricky. ,cade,crfrtmp,1,t5_2snqq

If it is get a replacement. Inspect the flyback if it looks cracked...replace it.I stopped working on  CRT monitors about  years ago when arcade LCDs started hitting the shelf. It was much easier for us to throw an LCD in a game than haul a chassis back to rebuild only to maybe have it last another six months. ,cade,crhlzro,1,t5_2snqq

5595578,0,t3_3rn00g,Ive got a Kraylix V that I bought used it was originally assembled and painted by Kraylix. its an extremely sturdy and solid feeling cabinet the panel is nice and wide so even with  players it doesnt feel cramped at all. My experience is with real arcade machines I have a number of machines including a Sega Net City Dedicated KI and UMK DDR Virtual On Donkey Kong etc. I dont have any experience with the Xtension but my basis for comparison are against actual cabinets.My Gripes with the Kraylix V are as follows these might be fixed in the V I dont know. the space for the game boards is actually quite small I ended up decasing my PC and mounting the components to a piece of MDF to fit everything in to my liking you might be able to fit a minitower in there but I didnt have anything small enough given the parts I wanted to use. I tried to leave as much space as possible to put a subwoofer in there but I dont think Ill have room for anything larger than a  if that.. there is poor access to the controls and to the PC from the front of the cab. theres a nice big door in the rear of the cab but who wants to pull the machine away from the wall everytime you need to change something. I have a coin door blank in the front which gives just enough room to reach some USB ports and the volume control that I placed behind it.. The bolt in the lower left corner of the control panel falls directly under player s left palm which is pretty uncomfortable. I ended up removing it and at some point I plan to drill some counter sunk holes so the screws are flush mount and I wont have this problem. Ideally they should have designed the cab using the actual Vewlix panel layout so you could swap in a legit panel.The positives are that the cab is every bit as solid durable and good looking as a legitimate arcade cab. Most people i have over who use it dont even realize that its not an actual arcade machine. it doesnt have any of the homemade design qualities of other homecades unless you look up close.I paid  for the cabinet with no electronics and after the monitor speakers joysticks and buttons I think I paid about  all said and done. I dont regret it but I dont think I would have paid full price you can get a Sega Lindbergh or a Namco Noir cabinet with monitor and controls for  shipping within the USA and Id rather have a well designed legitimate Candy cab than something made out of MDF or particle board. Honestly unless youre really need to play HD games PC titles Street Fighter IV MKX etc. then youre better off getting an older CRT cab like a Sega Net City or Blast City. Theyre even less expensive and having a nice big  CRT will make emulated title look much nicer.,cade,cwqomuq,2,t5_2snqq

8101502,0,t1_d4pzuqm,Unfortunately the cabinet a game comes in isnt always a reliable indicator of what the game currently is. Its possible that the game was converted at some point and just bears the markings of the original game.Major arcade machine manufacturers of the day like Stern also had a tendency to mark their boards with the company name logo or the name of the game the boards belong to. In my opinion due to the lack of really any distinguishing markings likely makes this a bootleg game of some kind in a Stern cabinet.Could you take a picture of what the monitor looks like? Its possible that you simply need to adjust one of the hold settings to get the game working again but without more information recommending a fix is going to be pretty hit or miss.,cade,d4qok2i,1,t5_2snqq

I had a cheaper one that I already chipped so I just bought the more expensive Bosch one in the hopes itll last longer.

8482162,0,t3_4vuepb,Honestly Id splash out for a new controller whether an XBox controller or something else.

9957419,0,t1_db5drro,Yeah the power switch idea for the back of the cab is a good idea.  Ill look into that for my next build.  And for the buttons the first iteration was made using spares and leftovers from an upright that I built for myself this one was for a friend as a gift so he got what I had same buttons for the rebuilt model.  If I were to make it from scratch I would probably go with all black buttons with maybe a red and a blue for button  on first and second player. buttons per side are for PSX and Dreamcast games.  Im on the fence about if its worth it to include them.  Theyre not as retro as most people want not as suited to arcade style play but on the other hand Dreamcast has MvC .  In the end I make the control panel how the customer wants and leave the decision up to them.,cade,db5h6n7,1,t5_2snqq

11786066,0,t1_dgvwxiw,best thing to do is just replace the common ground you can find it easy it runs to all of the buttons and switches on the sticks and make sure the ground from the new power supply you get is well connected I had  buttons keep going goofy on me when I first got my cabinet the ground connection was shorting once I replaced the wire everything worked properly. Cheapest and most secure way to go is go to a home improvement store and pick up a roll of Green ground wire and some new plug ends they are usually in the electrical section pull one off the cab to bring with you so you can make sure you got the right size there are a bunch of different sizes out there. you will need to grab a crimping tool or solder and heat shrink if you are so inclined then just start figuring out cable lengths its a lot easier than it sounds and once you get the hang of it the job goes quickly. ,cade,dgvzn38,1,t5_2snqq
