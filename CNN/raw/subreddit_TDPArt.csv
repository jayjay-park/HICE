596281,0,t1_cg80fmh,I think having multiple uniforms is more western? I know there are sports uniformssummer uniformswinter uniforms but those usually arent worn outside of their normal situations. I think there are ways we can make the uniforms seem more distinct than simple modifications though. For example here in Kimi ni Todoke the uniforms have jackets sweater vests and buttoned shirts... it could look like three different uniforms depending on what parts the characters choose to wear. Some schools also allow different colored jacketssweaters to be worn on top.Yes ATV.  Lets do what we can.,TDPArt,cg81ujw,1,t5_310k6
