339409,0,t1_cffnx63,I still dont consider the Bundesliga very strong. They have Bayern and thats it. Dortmund was great last year but theyre being stripped of their players. Lewa and Gtze to Bayern Reus saying that he has plans to move Gundogan on the way out Bender linked with tons of clubs Hummels always being linked to go etc. Then Leverkusen who are solid but no better than Roma or Napoli. Other than that everyone pretty much sucks. Schalke is going to get a CL spot and theyre pretty miserable.,seriea,cffy7hw,3,t5_2rzix

1309528,0,t3_291h5c,Its a shame because I think hes a very brave coach. he tries new things changes formation from one game to the next and gives young players a chance. hes also a smart coach but i think he overthought things in this tournament and bravely made stupid decisions. The game against Costa Rica is case and point How can you play  midfielders behind balo and the only one who can take on a man is Candreva? He played like he was terrified of losing and he lost he knows this. But i blame FIGC for not putting more faith in him so that he could have the confidence to make brave decisions that werent so desperate to not lose. ,seriea,cigxsh9,6,t5_2rzix
