I see this and manage to swerve  degrees and break hard. As we both came to a stop my knee was about an inch from the cars bumper.

Your need to get to work quickly does not trump other road users right to stay alive  regardless of whether they are walking riding a bicycle or in another car.  Reading your story it sounds like you responded angrily just because they were cyclists even though you would have been in a nearly identical situation had the obstruction been a tractor debris or deer. Please remember that everyone else on the road is someones family. You said boys... were the cyclists children?

1229240,0,t3_285tt1,Check out what types of bike programs your university offers. Many colleges have an oncampus bike shop with mechanics who will teach you how to do any type of maintenance you might ever need for free. Their parts are also often much cheaper than at regular bike shops. Theyll probably have professional equipment too and using the universitys tools is much cheaper than buying your own. It can also be a good way to meet other cyclists on campus if you want riding buddies.The most costeffective way to maintain your bike is to remember to maintain your bike. Use a chain measurement tool your oncampus bike shop has one if they exist and replace it when its too stretched out. This will save you hundreds of dollars compared to having to replace all of your gears if they get worn down from using stretched out chains. Keep your tires inflated to reduce the number of flats you get. Lube your chain frequently to extend its life. Basically if you visit the bike shop for  minutes every couple weeks to lube your chain pump your tires and check for any issues youll save a lot of money in the long run through preventative maintenance.Ill also do a shoutout for rechargeable lights. Theyre slightly more expensive up front but in return you save a lot of money on batteries and theyre typically brighter than their cheap AAApowered counterparts. I made a bike lights website to help people choose good lights if youre interested. ,bikecommuting,ci7wo8m,1,t5_2tbmq

When I first get on one I haul on the front brake as hard as possible the first few stops and after that they work ok.  Sometimes the front brake is really awful for the first couple of stops probably because the last  riders only used the rear brake because of the ignorant fear of front brakes that is so common.Unfortunately once the brakes are cleaned off like this they can also tend to be a bit grabby which could be tricky in slippery conditions.So yeah  the brakes are the worst point of them.

1899695,0,t3_2gdhul,I would expect to spend  at a bike shop afterwards on a full tuneup.. The bikes should have two  wheels. . The rims shouldnt rub the brakes when you spin them.. The wheels should spin rather freely. If you give them a good spin they should spin for a good long time... but that might be something that fits in with the last point.. Components shouldnt be visibly broken. Cables and cable housings can be bad theyre cheap to replace.. If the tires are good theyre good. If the tires are bad get the thickest tires that will fit the frame.. You need as many gears as you have mountains in your area. Ohio is a tough place to gauge. Northwest of the ClevelandColumbusCincinnati axis you need one to three gears. On the other side you need more gears the closer to West Virginia you are. You really dont need more than seven gears  in front and  in the back as long as the range in the back is something like  teeth. .

You should get a shirt that wicks the moisture away from your body and wear that as your bottom layer. Merino wool is great but expensive. The synthetic athletic shirts are good.Also try wearing a pair of latex or nitrile gloves under your wool gloves. These will act as a wind break and they will also trap a layer of air which actually turns out to be the best insulator of all. Also theyll keep your gloves from getting wet from sweat.

I just mentioned that your philosophy is at direct odds with that of Dr. King and that my actions are not. I did not and would not make any comparison between the plight of African Americans in the United States and the occasional abuse that bicyclists are subjected to by drivers except to say that both though obviously they are of significantly differing severities fall under the dictionary definition of oppressive injustice.gtI volunteer for bicycle advocacy groups in Colorado attend and donate my timemoney to fundraisers raise awareness and try to be polite and educational it is difficult at times. To me that goes a lot further to right any wrongs than blasting people in the face with a fog horn.There are times when being polite and educational is a great idea. I dont honk my horn at random people or even people who make honest mistakes I honk my horn at people who willfully and intentionally abuse me and put my life in danger.People tell feminists they should be polite and educational all the time too and that they should act less angry. Right now people are telling folks in Ferguson to please stop being so angry.Acting like a secondclass citizen is a great way to perpetuate being treated like one.gtI think that course of action just seems counterproductive to me and is only serving as an outlet for your anger. Its a pretty fundamental difference here.I dont understand why you believe that the fact that my actions are outlet for my anger devalues them. Its entirely appropriate for me to be angry when I am abused and when my life is put in danger. Its entirely appropriate for me to express my anger at the person who has offended against me.

2455981,0,t1_cmf8mnf,Your diet the Standard American Diet is basically the exact same diet that farmers feed to hogs and cattle to fatten them up.  Its WELL known that grains are great for fattening livestock...why the hell anyone would think thats a healthy human diet is beyond me but it most certainly isnt.  I was around  when I realized I was getting fat and over another year or two that crept up to around .  I moved and started biking to work weight dropped down to  where it stayed for over a year. Quit gaining but definitely didnt lose any weight.  Sat down and spent a couple dozen hours studying biology and nutrition and it became extremely apparent that grains and sugar are what got me fat and what was keeping me fat.  I dropped  lbs a week on a strict keto diet until I got to my current .  Ive pretty easily maintained that weight by continuing to be active and focus on keeping my carbs low but not keto low.  Some days Ill eat  grams of carbs others Ill eat  occasionally Ill do something silly like Sunday brunch waffles etc and down a few hundred these days are followed by a few days of keto low to keep weight in check.  Its absurdly trivially easy to keep weight down when I know thats its not how much I eat but rather WHAT I eat that matters.I lost a TON of weight eating  calories a day.  When I was strict keto Id make ketocasseroles that contained tons of heavy cream cheese cream cheese and bacon.  Id estimate a hearty dinner portion at around  calories a bowl.  Id have oz of coffee with oz of heavy cream  calories and snack on nuts throughout the day probably another  calories.  I lost lbs a week for a few months eating like this.  I gained all the weight initially eating  calories a day of carbladen Standard American Diet garbage probably averaging around  a day.  Its absolutely NOT how much you eat and its NOT strictly calories in vs calories out although matter cant be created out of nothing and no matter what the diet youll lose weight eating less than you burn...but counting calories sucks and adding bacon and cheese to everything is great....Snacks are nuts cheese jerky veggies.  Dont ever snack on anything with carbs.  When snacking especially on cheese rest for a minute or two between bites it takes a while to kick in.Head on over to rketo watch Fed Up Sugar The Bitter Truth read Good Calories Bad Calories and watch as the pounds melt away with basically no effort other than stopping eating the same fucking shit farmers use to fatten livestock.,bikecommuting,cmf9eog,-2,t5_2tbmq

If youre a runner this isnt the problem but if youre a swimmer it certainly could be asthma can be exacerbated outdoors due to allergens If your legs are getting sore you may be using the wrong gear. If you use a really high gear i.e. pedalling slowly it can make life much more difficult. Shift down pedal faster to avoid this. If your muscles get tired and if you havent been doing any leg exercises at all no swimmingrunningsquats  anything your legs might just really suck due to inactivity. Theyll get better really quickly if this is the case though just stick with it. Your bike might be terrible but I list this last because it should be pretty obvious and you should have already notice something wrong if this is the primary cause a terrible bike wont do you any favors no matter what but it shouldnt normally cause your body to break down after ten minutes either.

I believe its a problem when these get put on a map as has been done in your city and are considered part of the bicycling infrastructure grid. They dont have the political will to put proper infrastructure so they paint a bike on the ground and call it job done.

4863941,0,t3_3hhrrz,Last year I went from no biking at all to  milesday  daysweek bike commute with no buildup in between. It took a few months to get to the point where I could make it through the whole week without having to take rest breaks on the commute but after that point I was typically able to make it to work in just under an hour. No shower facilities at work so I usually didnt push myself too hard.My bikes are my only transportation so I absolutely do ride in the rain and I commute home in the middle of the night. If youre riding at night dont underestimate the value of a nice bright light bright enough to see with not just to be seen. My morning commute is  busy avenue  side street. Maybe  of my route involves bike lanes and yes I do ride in the road where no bike lane is available. My evening commute is the same but due to the hour theres almost no traffic at all.I was absolutely a zombie by the weekend. Whenever I had two days off in a row half of the first day was spent sleeping. That and the safety issues inherent in biking in F C Arizona summer heat is what pushed me to invest in an ebike kit which Ive been commuting on for the last few months. I fully respect that ebikes arent to many peoples taste but with the commute youre describing if its an option youre open to I cant recommend it enough based on my own experience.As for my bikes theyre both Walmart BikeShapedObjects. I started commuting last year on a Genesis Max Air er hardtail MTB which now serves as my ebike commuter. Early this year I switched to a GMC Denali road bike with Shimano Tourney components and grip shifters on the drop bars. Bizarre bike but it was a dream to commute on compared to the MTB before the ebike conversion and I still use it for errands some recreational rides and any time Im going somewhere where Id be risking the ebike getting stolen.I wasnt fit at all when I started. I was  lbs of no muscle. My first  mile ride to work I had to stop to rest several times with an average moving speed of around MPH. At my peak I was able to do  miles at MPH on the GMC and my longest ride was just shy of  miles. Im not quite as fit now largely because the heat keeps me from wanting to put much effort into the daily ebike commute but Im still in good enough shape to make the commute on my normal bike.,bikecommuting,cu7mxr4,3,t5_2tbmq

4978537,0,t3_3j2tax,Id say pepper sprays a bad idea not because its not passive but for practical reasons.I carry my Ulock in a Mixed Works Sunbird fanny pack which makes it an easy crossdraw for selfprotection. I also ride with a db air horn which is extremely painful at close range and good for signalling. Finally I carry a  folding baton in a chest holster if things get really bad.In general the pepper sprays only gonna be useful if someone gets out of their car or possibly if their window is open. The baton on the other hand can smash headlights and windshields.Im not saying any of this is something you want to go looking for a reason to do but if someones being intentionally aggressive while driving a vehicle and you have to do whatever it takes to get them to stop causing a few thousand dollars of damage to their vehicle will do that a lot faster than spraying pepper spray on their window and potentially blinding yourself as well.Ive never had to use my baton or Ulock though I use my air horn daily.Two days ago though I had to draw the baton. A guy leaned on his horn behind me for a couple of blocks I cussed him out at a stoplight and he stepped out of his vehicle and stood nose to nose with me. As he approached I drew the baton held it at my side unextended and repeatedly and calmly told him to step away from me and return to his vehicle. He did eventually.You might want to check with your local district attorneys office regarding folding baton legality before you go this route.,bikecommuting,cum2ynf,2,t5_2tbmq

Remind them how theyre taking their very lives in their hands any time they get in a car.  Crossing the street is fraught with danger and ask them how do they feel about that guy you saw jaywalking without even looking the other day or that guy you saw exceeding the speed limit on the expressway the other day.

6843230,0,t3_48z3as,My personal question is what are these pros and cons relative to? i.e. Are you comparing belt drives to a x Shimano Tourney setup or SRAM CX?I am running a x on my commuter bike with bar end shifters. I can similarly agree that it requires almost no maintenance is quiet is good with watersnowice does not require an internal hub.From a Rivendell blog from  years agogt Belt drives are fine but Im not into them and replacing the belt requires a removable seatstay. Again its good for some things theres tons of room for lots of different and good kinds of bikes but for the most part I think belt drives are an overreaction to getting a grease mark.I considered going with an IGH before building up my newest doeverything bike but ultimately I went with the traditional derailleur system.  Here is a quote I saved on my computer from a forum about IGHs that was the final kicker for me.The Final Say on Internally Geared Hubsgt A glib rundown. Please take no offense. I am being curt for the sake of clarity and conciseness.gt If youre smart you get to shift whenever you need to no problem.gt If youre stupid you get to beat the crap out of your bike and not face bad news when your LBS tells you that your derailleur andor derailleur hanger is a goner.gt  If you get a flat youre facing a considerably greater deal of trouble in an onroad fix. Be prepared to pack an extra tool or two.gt  If you need any rear wheel focused service at your LBS its going to take a bit longer. Slightly longer flat fix? Minor inconvenience grab a coffee. Your rim got tacod and now you need a new wheel? Sorry your Saturday is shot and youll be on the bus for half the week at least  they need to build a custom wheel around your expensive hub and its not happening until Thursday. A convenient changeout to a prebuilt wheel is just not going to be an option.gt  If your IGHs seals are still pristine you dont have to worry about a thing.gt  If your IGHs seals have gone crap is getting in there and theres no good way to get it out that wont ultimately compromise the IGHs performance and longevity.gt gt In my mind the last part is the kicker. IGHs are a great idea. When they were reasonably serviceable they were great in practice. With increased complexity the lets keep it tucked away safely to keep things simple has given rise to yet another instance of that most classic of problems having a really complex solution to a problem all in the name of keeping things simple. If you have any doubt of how bad it is consult the service manual for a contemporary Nexus or Alfine hub. That will make it all clear.gt gt Its too bad. I really really like the idea.,bikecommuting,d0rzht8,1,t5_2tbmq

6991271,0,t1_d18sp5e,Another friendly tip. You should always aim to be pedalling like mad  spinning at high RPM gives the fastest acceleration and takes the least strength. Try to pedal like a race car slow and strong at first then faster and faster until youre spinnig out then you can change gears. If you can pedal twice as fast youll be a lot faster than pedalling twice as hard. Its also easier on your knees and should make you go a lot faster. Even on undergeared bikes like kids mountain bikes pedalling lke a demon will get you pretty fast. Of course thats only for when you really want to go fast. Its better to take a heavier gear and pedal more slowly when youre trying to save energy or not get sweaty or just cruise and hold a speed. ,bikecommuting,d18sx50,6,t5_2tbmq

7233416,0,t1_d20d1ej,Id say ride where you feel the most confident. For a long time I stuck to the sidewalks and dealt with being in blindspots with drivers pulling inoff the road because I was not only uncomfortable with the idea of riding on the road I was downright scared. Funny enough what finally got me to do it was an argument I had with a dude in a car upset that I was on the sidewalk. Ride where you are most comfortable just be aware that if its on the sidewalk and youre legally allowed to do so be hyper vigilant. You WILL be riding where drivers are not looking so have your head on a swivel whenever you cross streets. You dont want to ride on the road if you arent able to take the lane and ride with authority. Road riding is intimidating and definitely still is for me when I hear big trucks rumbling up in the lane beside me. But I keep in mind that I am in a drivers direct line of focus where they are most likely to see me. It feels counterintuitive to say the road is the safest place to ride but it really is.

8286407,0,t3_4symaq,I cant speak to a variety of bikes but I can tell you about my commuter.  I ride a Cannondale Quick CX  after trading in the commuterized mountain bike that I used the first two years and have been loving it.  The price was reasonable I found it on sale for under CDN at my LBS and it comes with disc brakes front suspension and mountain bike gearing.  I added full fenders a rack bottle cage a frame pump and a small tool bag under the saddle and it has faithfully carried me for just over  km so far.My commute is about a km round trip.  My house is in a suburb perched on a bluff overlooking the river valley while my office is downtown right in that river valley.  What this means is that my morning commute consists of  km of chilly descent followed  km of fairly flat riding and the afternoon commute consists of  km of flats followed by  km of climb.  The route is  paved pathway and  side streets and both have occasional rough sections OK in my head I refer to the side street as Asshammer Alley because Im pretty sure it was last paved before the advent of pneumatic tires.  The suspension fork does help make the rougher patches more comfortable the disc brakes give me a lot of confidence at the end of the descents and the mountain bike drivetrain is a godsend when climbing at the end of the day.,bikecommuting,d5dcyej,3,t5_2tbmq

8520085,0,t3_4w1dp5,If youre having trouble getting up the hills then look at your gearing.The bigger the gear on the back the easier the climb try to get a  tooth or more on the back.The smaller the gear on the front the easier the climb. try to get a  tooth gear or smaller on the back. It will stick suck. No amount of gearing really makes hills completely disappear. But youll definitely get easier and easier the more you do it.And having the right gears makes a world of difference.In general you want to be cycling with a pretty high cadence  between rpm and adjust your gearing to maintain that same comfortable cadence whether youre going up or down the hill or on the flats.When youre going up a hill its permissible to let your cadence drop a little lower to say rpm. But the only way to be able to maintain a good cadence is with the right climbing gears. If you have a regular road bike youll want something like a compact crankset which is typically a  tooth and  tooth front chainrings in the front and an  or  tooth cassette in the back.If you mountain bike or commuter bike which has  chainrings in the front then you usually have enough gearing to get the job done. Put it in the smallest chainring in the front the granny gear and the largest in the back and then practice practice practice.Talk to your local bike shop about what options are available for your bike.Also a lighter bike will climb easier too. So if youre riding a heavy mountain bike or city bike then getting a light alloy frame or lighter will help too.But at the end of the day the more you do it the easier it will be.And theres certainly no shame in walking the bike up if it gets too hard. Just keep working at it. And set a goal to walk up less of it the next time!Good luck and happy commuting!,bikecommuting,d66kkua,1,t5_2tbmq

You spend a lot of money on parts that often dont last as long because they are lighterthinner fundamentally do the same thing.If youre racing then sure its worth it. For commuting it doesnt matter really. Also unless youre on a lot of hills a little extra weight on the bike wont make much difference. Again commuting you usually have stuff w you.

8874987,0,t1_d7em70c,gt Not even close to true car crashes are the leading nonnatural cause of death in the US. Traffic deaths are orders of magnitude more common than murder and rape.Fine then we only police cars and nothing else. Sounds like a great plan. Or looked at another way really? Murderers have all killed at least one person motor vehiclists have not  on a per capita basis seems reasonable that we should devote a bit more attention to murders than motor vehiclists as a class. But paying more attention obviously doesnt mean only paying attention to the murderers  we should do something about unsafe driving as well. So why not extend this to cycling  causes less harm but isnt completely safe. Even though more attention is paid to drivers riders should get some scrutiny. As should pedestrians  jaywalking puts not only the pedestrian at severe risk but drivers and standersby at some risk as well.gtThis is an idea expressed elsewhere in this thread and it makes sense. Larger vehicles cause more damage so fines should be increased.No only larger vehicles should get any tickets by your logic  biggest fish only its not like youve made allowance for cyclists getting smaller tickets you keep saying none. This would encourage people to drive smaller cars and make everyone safer right?gtThis is true but transportation funding is incredibly complicated. Gas taxes only cover a small portion of road funding and projects take many years to implement. The decrease in driving resulting from increased gas taxes happens immediately and has a much more direct effect on driving rates.Really its not as simple as any increase in cost reduces an activity? Imagine that. So by that same logic implementing safety regulations on bicycles might have a short term impact on cycling but over the long term having them may not decrease cycling  done right perhaps they increase it as cycling becomes more acceptable through appropriate regulation. What doesnt help is if cyclists have a kneejerk reaction to getting a ticket for risking running over a bunch of kids  sure puts people at odds with cyclists instead of accepting of them.Point being youre being obtuse about this. There are plenty of good reasons to be concerned over a variety of activities. We try to balance lots of safety concerns at the same time. But bicycles are not so special that they should be singled out as never receiving attention from law enforcement.,bikecommuting,d7enclj,1,t5_2tbmq

The battery looks a little big for a battery that size and I wouldnt be surprised if it was actually a SLA battery rather than lithium. With a W motor and a V AH battery you should be able to run it for a little over an hour without pedaling. If you just use pedal assist and never hit the throttle you should be able to go significantly longer between charges.The price theyre asking only really covers the electric parts. Then again its difficult even find a hub motor less powerful than W or a battery pack with less than ten amp hours by themselves anymore. My price estimate on the e part of this bike may be off by about  is all Im saying here. The problem is really the folding bike itself.The gold standard of folding bikes is the Brompton They arent cheap and any quality folding bike is going to run you at least . Consider that a decent prebuilt electric bike will cost you at least  and you get an idea of how lowball this bike actually is.I may be completely wrong.

9630265,0,t3_5cvoy3,On any bike besides a beach cruiser you should not be able to put your feet in the ground while seated. When you come to a stop you move forward off the seat so you can touch the ground. Your legs should almost be fully extended when at the bottom of the pedal.  The left shifter is for the front gears and the right is for the back. Most people only shift down in the front when going up a steep hill but it depends on your fitness level and how the bike is setup. The right one is a little easier as one click is one gear the front one can take more than one click to shift. Turning comes with practice. It is easier to make tight turns when going slowly. You should not have to stop and rotate the bike after you get a little practice. For the nervousness it helps to plan a route with low traffic streets or multi user paths instead of taking busy streets. Take the lane if it would be unsafe to let cars pass you. It also helps to practice commuting on the weekend so you know the route when you arent in a rush not to be late for work. ,bikecommuting,da04mcg,9,t5_2tbmq

11073658,0,t1_den5bs0,gt ride without a helmet and do so on trails and when not traveling with trafficHah!  That is funny because those are two time I DO wear a helmet! Of course trails for me means aggressive MTB riding and no traffic is a multiuse rail trail on my road bike trying to average  mph.  Just realized the speeding on multiuse rail trail sounds very reckless but it is done early when there are few users and I slow down when appropriate.gtAre you arguing that it is safer to not wear a helmet on a bicycle? No I am not.  I am pointing out two facts.Safety is complicated and there are more factors that go into it than people assume overall I think most topics are more complicated than people think.  The study was simply the researcher riding his bike with a sensor measuring the distance cars passed him at the only variable was a helmet vs no helmet.  You could also consider wearing a helmet gives you a sense of security that is likely way overblown and may cause you to be less attentive when wearing one.  So is wearing a helmet safer?  Maybe maybe not.  I do know wearing a helmet any time you crash your head into something is under most circumstances safer yet I do not wear a helmet all the time as I go about my life.  Which brings me to point The other consideration is risk vs reward.  My personal experience shows that I am more likely to slip and bang my head walking down the stairs twice in the last year than I am to bang my head biking to work  times in  years.  I do not have the numbers for the risk for specifically riding in traffic but then again they are likely to be drastically different depending on where you ride.  Many studies have shown the more people that are riding bikes in traffic the safer it is for bikers in traffic.  Many studies have also shown that mandatory helmet laws decrease the number of people biking.  Statistically the health benefits of biking outweigh the risk.  I have ridden in DC and if you stick to calmer routes it didnt seem that bad but then again I am from Boston,bikecommuting,den6tes,3,t5_2tbmq
