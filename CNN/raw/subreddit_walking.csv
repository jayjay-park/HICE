The shoes will probably be expensive but I see the little extra I spend on shoes now will save me thousands in medical bills later. Plus walking is more fun when you dont have to think about how uncomfortable you are.I would also recommend getting a Fitbit. There are great features to motivate you to move more. Every step counts when you are going towards  miles.,walking,df1t6bw,3,t5_2rmf3
