To people from Punjab.. both Hindi and Punjabi movies are mainstream. My point is that Bollywood is not the only mainstream movie industry. Id say it is the most popular. Proportionally speaking the links in the from page reflect the same pattern. BTW this movie is a remake of Tamil movie.. which was itself inspired from Memento. ,BollywoodRealism,cpfo04k,1,t5_2x3c7

3975318,0,t1_cr9d41u,Ive seen a good deal of Indian films but heres my best guess why.Id say  of the issues involved in the Editing are most likely related to the quick turnaround on these films.  The markets are highly localized as are the actors related to basically which language the film is in.  Id assume that the studios operate in a manner similar to the golden age of hollywood with the films being highly centralized by the studios.  They probably finance these pictures a handful at a time and switch move around inhouse Directors and Crew to keep them going all year.  Indian films rarely blow up overseas so they need to constantly be producing films to get consistent returns which Im assuming are small in the margins.  By bankrolling things like action films together they can basically keep otherwise niche positions on staff like wirestunt teams and pyrotechnic crews.The downside to this is that it means you constantly have to be churning out scripts and constantly running preproduction on possibly multiple films.  This doesnt leave a lot of time for oversight or planning so Id assume they lean on their crews to basically stage an action scene on set.  I assume they shoot as much coverage as they can and then offload to postproduction while theyre still shooting so they can get the film in the can ASAP.  This also means Editors will get more time with the footage they get first and less time with anything thats shot towards the end of production.  I know Indian films also tend to be really long  hours or more often so again I assume that the goal is to get an assembly cut probably within a week or two of production wrap and that it would probably be an hour or two longer.  Then they probably just go in and cut huge chunks to get it out the door.Im saying this because Im guessing that Indian movie companies take home most of their profit directly from the theaters so if a movie isnt totally shitty in any one area it wont affect their wordofmouth returns.  Just my guess.,BollywoodRealism,cr9f4g8,2,t5_2x3c7
