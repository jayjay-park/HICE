115875,0,t3_1veg01,You were able to create a quick fix for the junkie in New Vegas. I think they could add levels to addiction so minor addiction is easy to kick but easier to get addicted again and more likely to get to a bigger level of addiction. So like mildmoderatesevereextreme and if you hit extreme drugs wear off in not time at all and carry huge withdrawal symptoms then make detox harder. A realistic side too could be interesting like death from a detox from extreme alcohol addiction. ,Fallout4,cermj2g,2,t5_2s6ll

3459050,0,t3_2zukjs,Dual wielding could be good if done properly. I like the idea of being able to carry two pistols or a small arm and a knife.You never really had to have followers they were just there if you wanted them and to complete their quests. I have a few I liked dogmeat but for the most part I ignored them.I dont think making all NPCs nonrespawning would work because after awhile the wasteland would be completely void of enemies. However if you made it so named NPCs were like that and maybe even some areas had all enemies be non respawning that might work otherwise you run out of things to kill.I always thought we needed more joinable factions. There are a lot of faction but only a fraction of them you can join and I would like it if you could join most if not all. Make that a reality and your war system would be alot of fun.They did the gun mods thing in New Vegas and I loved it but I may have misunderstood what you meant. The only thing that could make it better in my opinion is to be able to build guns out of parts from the ground up. For instance you could have different types of parts barrels triggers stocks etc for each type weapon category and have them add different effects or stats so you would have youre own personal unique weapon. ,Fallout4,cpmk2ew,4,t5_2s6ll

He only assured the PC version would look way better but never showed it off.
