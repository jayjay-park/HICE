1500513,0,t1_cj25n2z,Having spent even less time that Mrs Ed clearing that pesky underwater temple out I still would find a reset to be rather discouraging. A bunch.,Biffa2001,cj4d34r,1,t5_2v3sq
1546455,0,t1_cja3rhy,One of the big things probably the biggest is being able to check when the server is misbehaving checking the chat logs and basically being able to maintain update and generally tweak things to run as best as possible given the current number of players memory available etc.  I know from experience that just running a minecraft server vanilla  even on a dedicated server  wont cut it if the player count goes up.  You need to be able to diagnose and fix things also on a linux level in some cases like updating openjdk versions etc and I guess people like me who do have a system engineering background arent that common within this playerbase. I might be wrong. ,Biffa2001,cja4e7j,1,t5_2v3sq
1552968,0,t1_cj9yvtx,Been thinking a bit about this  although thats kinda dangerous in itself  I didnt have problems with the Gold Farm at all and my place is the nearest of anyone on the server. Nathan when you started to modify it with pretty walls and stuff did something change? Like you upd the rates? Because you do have a kill switch. Did someone leave it on instead of turning it off? Something changed dramatically. Perhaps you know what it was?,Biffa2001,cjaxrwq,1,t5_2v3sq

1649941,0,t1_cjn4ko5,I cant help here since once I get my internet I cant guarantee Ill be on daily. If we can get Biffa on board within  hours of a report we can get a  accurate list of who was on since a theft. If this route is taken wed need the time it was reported as well as the latest time that an item was last seen. If the modified time of the player file is older they couldnt have done it. If its newer they go on the suspect list.Should we set up a thread where we report whos on at what times? Also where you were in the world when you were on. Id almost bet that whoever is seen online and DOESNT report in said thread is the thief since I really doubt they are reading the reddit with all of the posts that have been made already.,Biffa2001,cjn4zxn,1,t5_2v3sq
