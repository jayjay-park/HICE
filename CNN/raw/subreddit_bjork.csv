3726750,0,t1_cq3s78o,I also notice this all over the place. I think its just some gibberish she made up like Jonsi in Sigur Ros singing in a made up language,bjork,cqh2p4s,1,t5_2s4tf

9030907,0,t3_52urx6,I always loved this clip cool to see her early band with Leila Arab on keys who would have known twenty years later they would still be working together. I really hope she contributes to Bjorks new album i miss her presence,bjork,d7xdet4,2,t5_2s4tf

10006459,0,t3_5hof8r,Dude I love both of those songs. Dark Matter is just quietly beautiful its very short and the harmonies really soar and dip together in a dance. Hollow reminds me of something that I mightve heard in an old film like Fantasia only with Bjork singing over it. I can imagine a scene in my head to the music. That one is all about the pacing and the spaces between the notes. I can see why its not for everyone though haha,bjork,dbbvcfg,3,t5_2s4tf
