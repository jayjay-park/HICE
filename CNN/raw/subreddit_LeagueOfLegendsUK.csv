798552,0,t3_239gle,Ill start by saying its always encouraging to see people from the UK getting involved in eSports. That being said this article reads very much like it wrote itself. I didnt gain any unique insight into Mimers careerlife the article just states what I could find spending  minutes on Google. I do think the ending has some sound analysis but it is a bit all over the place in the sense youve tried to cram as many points into that paragraph as possible.And now aside from the article just my thoughts on reporting in general. If you want to be noticed in this industry you are not going to do it by being a reporter of or a conduit for already agreed upon wisdom. Talking about the tank meta and how x player is known for playing x will not get you anywhere. Now if you just enjoy doing this for its own sake by all means keep going with it. But if you are trying to establish yourself this is not the way to do it. You have to CREATE content not echo news. Try and get an interview and ask some nonorthodox questions. Pull a Richard Lewis and expose the fucked up state of eSports financing. In other words do something in a new or exciting way.Anyway Ive blabbed on enough now thats just my take and I have no experience in any of this so may want to take it with a pinch of salt.,LeagueOfLegendsUK,cgv1r1a,2,t5_2y2uo

1368823,0,t3_29r39f,. Definitely more events over here. London filled out so fast and as I live in Scotland I couldnt make it down so maybe some events further north say in the Birmingham arena and Glasgow Hydro or SECC. As everyone else has said more promoting local groups and games. Its nice to see ESports group over the world but in the UK it seems to be really slow. America have their university leagues and now have scholarships. I seriously doubt wed get anything like that in the UK unless we really fought for it. I myself am currently part of a scottish group that are growing and looking to get more events happening but it would be nice if we had a hub where we could see and add anything that is happening.. Reddittwitterfacebookclientleague forums. Snoopeh Deman Joe and Quickshot are all great UK figures for me. It was great to see the casters enjoying themselves in London. Also this is more of a general thing for everyone here but is it possible to get a tournament up that isnt based on being in a university team? I like the idea and its great for those who can attend it but I chose to work instead of going to Uni which instantly excludes me from any Uni tournament teams.,LeagueOfLegendsUK,cinvck0,2,t5_2y2uo
1368946,0,t1_cinon1h,Regarding the NUEL they really need a lot more riot interaction i feel they could really take off with a little help but the casting is really not great stuff is often poorly organised and theres a lot of stuff for a ragtag bunch of grubby students to do often in parallel with studies. maybe you could do a training workshop for the casters and camera directors maybe give NUEL some Riotbranded twitch space maybe on a riotgamesuk or riotgamescollegiate twitch channel if not on the main riotgames maybe with a single Riot caster and a handful of NUEL casters. Could even work as a neat little way of picking up any future Riot caster staff you might need in the future if you were really good at helping these guys develop. Im sure you can figure out some more ideas on your own,LeagueOfLegendsUK,cinvwif,1,t5_2y2uo
1370770,0,t3_29r39f, more tournamentsevents LCS at Wembley proved theres a market for it theres not a lot that could specifically done for UK players other than maybe we could get an exclusive skin for free eg. gentleman chogath. I mean Italy got gladiator draven for free justsaying  I get pretty much all my info from reddit which may sound like a bad thing but its not I actually love rleagueoflegends if there was more official interaction with rioters there it would be great I follow a fair few UK figures. Im a big fan of freddy and impaler from the proscene. But a  big shout out to wunderguy on youtube. That guy is genuinely really really funny and gets no where near enough love compared to other big youtube personalities like keyori and foxdrop ,LeagueOfLegendsUK,cio44m0,1,t5_2y2uo
