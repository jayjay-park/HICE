806539,0,t1_cgv3owd,He chirps nicely when he is standing on his pirch or playing with his toys but when he flies he likes to squak. Also sometimes when he stands or plays with his toys it sounds like he is talking like a human.,budgies,cgvyhho,2,t5_2tjtv

1871707,0,t1_cke0qud,if anything it helps him keep his beak trim they do constantly grow and chewing wood keeps it perfectly healthy. You could also encourage his foraging put a treat he seems to like maybe a little bit of millet? in a balled up paper and when he gets through it its like a prize! ,budgies,ckeqfmo,1,t5_2tjtv

2142755,0,t3_2jifoe,I had the same thing happen to one of mine a couple of years ago In the morning he looked like he had trouble sitting on his perch. He was swaying a little so he grabbed on to the wall of the cage in order not to fall down. I left him there because i had to go to work but i decided to take him to the vet afterwards.Unfortunately it never came to that. He was lying dead in the cage in the evening. The Vet told me that these sudden unexpected deaths can occure due to tumors or organ failure and that there is nothing he could have done to save him.,budgies,clc6xhk,3,t5_2tjtv

2344309,0,t3_2m6t70,Budgies can probably handle the cool household temperatures of winter but drafts are a problem.  Is there anywhere in your house that isnt drafty? I would at least use a blanket or thick towel to cover the cage on two sides and half of the top so the bird has a windbreak and sort of cuddle corner. I have never brought electricity into my birds cages  thats not a warning or anything I just have no experience with that type of thing.,budgies,cm1gva1,2,t5_2tjtv

4591030,0,t1_ct99jso,No I appreciate the wall of text! Im totally new at having a bird so Ill take all the info I can get. I know they do well in pairs but would you think a new bird owner could handle two at the start? I live with my boyfriend and a roommate so theres always people around but if you think they would do well together Ill take your advice. Would two birds strangers to each other be okay with a new environment and sharing a space in the same day? I had originally wanted to get two birds from the same store that looked okay being around each other but we dont get to have that luxury at the moment. To start with Ill buy the biggest cage my store has to offer Ill need it immediately so I cant wait on shipping plus dat discount and Ive read in many places to find a cage that is longer than it is tall. But Ill look into the cages you recommend with my next big paycheck one job pays weekly the other biweekly which gives me a lot more when both come in. What would you recommend for bedding? Our store uses a wood pellet but Im not sure whats best for them. Ive also heard from my coworkers that birds should have too much seed in their diet and pellets are usually more nutritionally balanced for them unfortunately our store feeds them a weird mix with little star shape pellets and a lot of seeds so the transition might be tough  for him. We also have millet in the cage constantly since we usually have a high turnover for birds but he hasnt really touched it since hes been alone anyway. Thank you so much for the pellet brand recommendation! Ill write them down and see if my store carries them. Overall thank you for the suggestions I feel a little more prepared for our new little dinosaur or two  ,budgies,ct9am11,3,t5_2tjtv

7019656,0,t1_d1c0fkg,I never ever for even a minute planned on giving her back. She is mine now. Just a little pissed that a store sold her to me as a young bird when she clearly is not one. Deceptive. It annoys me a little since the kids are still reeling from our last bird passing. It isnt like an average Joe walks into a pet store and knows how to read a leg tag.,budgies,d1c10ki,1,t5_2tjtv
7038169,0,t3_4c0vv5,Our bird is only partly tame but I wouldnt trade him for anything.  He will definitely cooperate with us when hes in the mood but there are many times when he just wants to be left alone to do his thing which is fine.  But there are times when he will sit on my shoulder and preen me and let me touch his head a little and its glorious.  But even when hes not in a cooperative mood he is endlessly entertaining.  I wish I had not waited so long to get him.  He makes my life happier.  ,budgies,d1e4sge,3,t5_2tjtv
7300556,0,t3_4fe15m,Personally I leave food in the cage all the time as I would worry about them being hungry especially if I was delayed at work for example.  Our two get plenty of exercise and Im not worried about them becoming overweight but Ive never had a problem with a budgie overeating anyway.  I also hand feed them  little bits of millet each before I go to work and some fruit or veggies in the evenings.  Theyll get a treat like a seed bellstick once or twice a month.,budgies,d280uui,1,t5_2tjtv

8836669,0,t1_d79z96o,Thats good to know thanks again!One last question for you how interested have your birds been in sitting on your shoulder arm head etc  ? I wouldnt be bothered by it I think I would like it actually but Im really curious about it is this something they do of free will of is it mostly humaninitiated so to speak?,budgies,d7a1kbr,1,t5_2tjtv

8858251,0,t1_d7c4z1b,Thanks for your input good stuff to know about. It was the colour really. I think the deal breaker for us is the extra hassle. Although we surely could pull it off with some effort at least so I like to think! we agreed that we are better off getting the birds from the same place. For our sake as well as for their sake. We want our new family members to be amp stay happy!Thanks!,budgies,d7cmxbu,1,t5_2tjtv
8902191,0,t3_526fx2,What a pretty little bird! As for the age I cant help you much but if heshe is  months old as you were told its very likely that your birdy is going through its first moult!

11080302,0,t3_5y7xj8,Just pay attention to your budgies body language and if he seems annoyed by your attention leave it for another time whether hes molting or not. My bird isnt always crabby when he molts. Depends on the day.  Sometimes a budgie wants to nap or chill or eat or is just in a bad mood and doesnt appreciate being disturbed. After a while you get to know what times they feel most playful and approachable.  Always keep taming sessions short and rewarding with lots of treats. They have short attention spans and get bored easily.  I dont know about untamed budgies talking. ,budgies,denxxlj,2,t5_2tjtv
11127203,0,t3_5sq7gv,My Nugget was the same way. I started by mixing seeds in with the pellet. By sprinkling a small layer over the pellet he would go to eat the seed and often get a mouthful of pellet. Also it may seem harsh but after a day or two my birds have all switched to pellet when no seed was available. Sometimes I have to out stubborn the little floofs.,budgies,det9c1r,1,t5_2tjtv
11246463,0,t1_det8bqb,I wish my bird would eat fruits and veggies Ive tried a variety of things like mixing small pieces in with the seeds or clipping it to the cage but he doesnt even want to go near it.

11563742,0,t3_651gjg,They are fighting and your cage is much too small for even one bird three is insane. Im sorry if this sounds harsh but they seriously need more room. When picking a cage you want it to be longer than it is tall. You can find good cage size calculators online.They need to be able to all fly in the cage which is currently impossible in yours. Basically all of the cages you can find on the petsmart store shelves? Way too small. You can find proper flight cages online. If a flight cage isnt an open you can find the requirements for your budgies and get something at least big enough so they dont try killing each other.When possible budgie proof a room and give them time to fly around daily. ,budgies,dg6r77c,11,t5_2tjtv

11696169,0,t1_dglh6x4,He seems like he tries to be very friendly to his reflection. Mirrors are not usually good for budgies as they interact with it and do not get a normal response for a real bird.
