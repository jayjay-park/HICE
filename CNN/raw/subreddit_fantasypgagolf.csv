57917,0,t1_cel0lyn,I have played on Yahoo! before but if you check out my other posts Im in a different kind of league its a really fun setup if you can get enough guys to play.  I have the basic rules in the comment section of the post on my draft.,fantasypgagolf,cel0w06,1,t5_2zp0r
263740,0,t3_1wxspv,I see other experts have Chris Kirk and Pat Perez in their lineups. What are your views on these two? Kirk scares me as he finished with three straight poor rounds at the Waste Mgmt Open. Perez is interesting finished poorly at Waste Mgmt but has played well the last few weeks on the West Coast swing.,fantasypgagolf,cf83gun,1,t5_2zp0r
