5015664,0,t1_cuqgw90,I read all about that case last week and it was never proven in court. He always maintained that it wasnt him and the prosecution certainly couldnt prove otherwise. So I for one am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. And even if he did piss on a girl so what?  Its a little gross maybe but its not thaaat bad. Not like he would need to be given consecutive life sentences or anything. Im generally willing to let things slide when it comes to personal sexual fetishes you know unless it really does cause a lot of harm to the other party and who really knows if that was the case here. I think thirteen year olds are a lot more resilient than most people give them credit for.,GuiltyPleasureMusic,cuqkt3j,1,t5_2v5fo

6442403,0,t3_43x8d9,This song has really grown on me I think its partially because I read the book and know the context but also because it is so powerful and fits the ghostly theme so well. Bonus here is a male singing it and hitting all the highnotes skip to  seconds if you dont want to hear him talking about it and is actually really impressive overall besides being a guy with intact male parts. My favorite cover that keeps some of the gloomy tone and aura of Kate Bush while not gouging your ears is here,GuiltyPleasureMusic,czlomla,1,t5_2v5fo
