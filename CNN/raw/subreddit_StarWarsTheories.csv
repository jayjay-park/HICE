8598831,0,t3_4woe6z,snoke didnt show his force powers in TFA but him teaching Kylo Ren indicates he actually is a force wielder. Also in the TFA novel Snoke states that he thinks he gotta show Kylo Ren the dark side again as a reminder after he supects him to have compassion for Rey.,StarWarsTheories,d6gg2we,1,t5_38y7j
9865702,0,t1_dasymip,Two thingsWe dont necessarily know that Ben had not turned to the dark side during the events of Bloodline. Leia had not been in contact with Luke or Ben for some time.Also Rey was not necessarily there during the Knights of Ren scene in her vision. There were other things in the vision that she wasnt present for.,StarWarsTheories,dativ3k,2,t5_38y7j
10076021,0,t1_dano8gd,To be frank I think that Balance  Number of Force Users is wrong. I think thats how people rationalized Darth Vader once we knew what was going on.But I think real balance will be when both sides of the force flourish in individuals. That the Dark Side and the Light Side quit being separate and instead we find the balance between them in all Force Users. Aka Grey Jedi I think Rey and Ben will give this to us since Rey will bring the Light and he the Dark and theyll teach each other how to toe the line correctly.,StarWarsTheories,dbkxdng,2,t5_38y7j
