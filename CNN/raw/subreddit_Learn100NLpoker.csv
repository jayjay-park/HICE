7588802,0,t1_d34t1wl,trying to put myself in a position to profit today.  Ego has nothing to do with this.  NL is fine to start on cash.  Even if I auto bust two buy in there im in much better shape then last night where I busted three NL buy ins by the th hour in yet still somehow managed to mount a comeback and book a win.  Its not a brag its a constant war with myself to be as confident as I need to be to do well nightly.  Ive had a naturally low level of confidence most of my life.  Most good poker players Ive known and even the ones in my private poker group have had to battle opposite demons where their ego and confidence is naturally too high.  So poker teaches them to eventually tone it back some.  For me poker has taught me I need to get my ego HIGHER so I can have a neutral level of confidence.Now I realize for me personally the more ego the better.  I will know when I need to tone it back but Im naturally so nonconfident increasing my ego can only help me. Middle child syndrome if thats a thing among other issues I suppose.,Learn100NLpoker,d34t5ls,1,t5_3ebae
