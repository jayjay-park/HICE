Of course the miner then must hash enough new blocks to become the longest valid chain getting the fraudulent blocks accepted by the rest of the network.The bigger question is what the miner would get out of it. Mining an empty block doesnt increase the reward but it does remove it from the original miner. It doesnt necessarily destroy the old transactions they are still valid and can be included in future blocks. It doesnt allow the miner to include fake transactions transactions are hashed by the sender which are usually verified before being moved on top of  some miners take a risk and skip this step to get a head start on the next block.Am I missing an adversarial reason for changing previous blocks?,BitcoinTechnology,d0v1in0,1,t5_3699e

Both achieve the same net effect i.e. that the node doesnt hold the keys necessary to drain the wallet but if you use multisig you can have the node generate its own addresses whereas watchonly addresses would need to be generated elsewhere.Ultimately the decision depends on how much money youll have there.  If the amount isnt particularly large and you set up a cron to drain the wallet every hour or so to some more secure address just using regular addresses is probably the simplest way.,BitcoinTechnology,dfybgug,1,t5_3699e

Savings and spending.Savings is a cold paper wallet that I never touch other than to deposit btc.Spending is Mycellium on my phone.Now the reason Im not sold on the need of multisig is because I never keep much money in my spending wallet and when I want to make a purchase Im happy with just going into the wallet scanning a qr code and in the case of my iphone using my thumbprint to confirm.To me that seems like sufficient security for something that never holds more than  or so,BitcoinTechnology,dg12wu6,1,t5_3699e
