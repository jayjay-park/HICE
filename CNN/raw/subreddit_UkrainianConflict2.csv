4127288,0,t3_37wpwc,Sept putin wants to protect russians in other countries at least he said?????via Our own neoSoviet Islamic caliphate. Putin returned to the old Soviet habits and started resettlement and displacement of refugees from the East of Ukraine. To Siberia. Can we be surprised? Especially in the context of mass graves in eastern Ukraine firing convoys of refugees and killing them ... Enemy planes shot down civilian aircraft ... All those who think that Russia deciding to open aggression will stick to conventions of war are wrong. Russia exports to Ukraine today its basic commodity  terror. Terror which is degenerate and turn into animals both parties this conflict  including those who defend themselves against aggression. Terror that will excite longstanding hatred and the sense that human life is not worth anything. Therefore this conflict is more than just a war on the borders of Ukraine. Its a clash of civilizations. Today when we look gt we see the murders carried out Christians remember that Putin is able to unleash a nightmare as analogous Islamic Caliphate. Anyway once already did it. In Chechnya. Genocide made there could easily compete with what is happening today in Iraq. The fact that Putin ist carrying out a similar carnage today in Ukraine  are the result of leak forces and calculation. It is poor consolation because the situation may change. Let us remember that we have our own neoSoviet caliphate. Just around the corner.Putin returned to the old Soviet habits and started resettlement and displacement of refugees from the East Ukraine,UkrainianConflict2,crqqhg7,1,t5_3233g
