84437,0,t1_cenv3rd,gt You could easily scrape by with less yes. However someone living on that wage is always on the brink of disaster. In a world with no social programs that person could end up homeless and starving in a matter of weeks.What why?  Ive rarely heard of people all the sudden getting sick or losing a job within a few weeks.  gt Another part of all this thats not often considered is that minimum wage jobs rarely yield the worker  hours annually. It can be  less than that and still be considered full time.Thats another reason why people get roomates to offset the cost.  And I wouldnt say minimum wage employees rarely get full time.  ,Spokane,ceo1it0,0,t5_2r9l2
115787,0,t1_cerlnld,Again what Im doing right now is assessing interest in such an activity or event. I believe the specifics of what would take place should be negotiated and decided on by the community that will ultimately be participating and not one person. Im working at getting the people who are already concerned about the issue in contact with one another and all the specifics and details can come after that.With all that out of the way if all my feelers come back and theres only like seven people who would want to do anything Ill stop working on it.That being said if there is a significant interest and this rally or protest takes shape like previous rallies in Spokane then it will probably involve meeting at City Hall around midday a short march through downtown downtown just aint that big ya know and concluding with an open forum allowing those who wish to speak on the topic a chance to do so.,Spokane,cerm614,1,t5_2r9l2

When you arrive there are a few things that will really surprise outsiders.  The first is the lack of diversity. Spokane is white. Very white.  The second thing is ethnic food here is basic.  You are going to have to search for good mexican food.  I speak Spanish and have used my Spanish in Spokane twice in a dozen years here.In the winter is it dark.  It is too bad that you will not get to see December here before moving.  Everyone expects the cold but not necessarily the dark.  For a good part of the year you will drive to work in the dark and drive home from work in the dark.  For locals this seems to be a small inconvenience for me it is soulcrushing.There are pretty places to see here and really good hunting but be prepared for some substantial differences.,Spokane,coqenpa,9,t5_2r9l2

4098213,0,t3_37k5vi,This is my knowledge of the STA. The bus costs . for one ride although one ride may include transfers but you have to ask the driver otherwise youll pay another . on the next bus. Monthly pass costs varies but through my work it was cheaper to get one with them if you rode twice a day five days a week. If you ride the bus sparingly get a smart card. Load however much you want on it deducts from it each time. Saves you from carryingfinding change. STA has partnered up with mycommute.org so if you get to work in any means besides single person driving you can log that in and win stuff. Ive won a lot of gift cards. Your work must be signed up with them though.  Park ampamp Rides are selfexplanatory but just in case  theyre areas you can park your car for free with buses picking up and dropping off there directly. Generally parking there and bus pass cheaper gt monthly parking downtown. All the bus drivers are nice and helpful! Just ask.  The bus is not some scary transit like in big cities. All Most buses will at some point stop at the STA plaza downtown. I used Google Maps to find route times. Theres an option with maps to chose car bus walk or bike.Edit One more point.

4600271,0,t1_ctabf42,When I was a kid I ran that carrousel during the summer. Letting someone get away with that ring is highly frowned upon by management. The rider is supposed to turn it in for a free ride ticket. Many people tried to escape with it during my tenure but at that time the garbage goat was a real goat and he was trained to ram ring stealers into the path of the tour train. Youd think all the rings were made of solid gold the way management spoke about them. Letting children take the plastic rings was just as bad in their eyes. The children werent the problem though asking nicely goes a long way with kids. Parents on the other hand are terrible people and would argue to their last breath that its only a few rings. A few rounds later and theres no rings to put out. I dont know why management didnt just keep a larger supply of the damn things. Oh and the worst part was getting under the carrousel to collect rings and garbage. Its dark dusty cramped and sorta scary under there. ,Spokane,ctagbrx,1,t5_2r9l2

6874993,0,t1_d0vj1qt, The creators of the show were probably lazy when it came to finding a logobrand for the team Kutchers character was supposed to have played on.

Unless of course they just used it without their permission like every high school in the US does like West Valley.   Kutchers character is someone in their mid s whose career in semipro football just ended and the show revolves around him moving back home to Colorado to take over his fathers ranch. Character seems to be of someone whose doesnt want their career to end hence a reason why hes still rocking is presumably old teams shirts and hoodies. ,Spokane,d0vldwq,1,t5_2r9l2

Homes are affordable I just bought a house for k that would have cost K back home. People are friendly Those Ive met  they talk to you look you in the eye and are sincere. Everyone speaks English you dont have to know Spanish to order at a drive through one of my personal pet peeves about SOCA. That being said there isnt much diversity here...its primarily white people. Yeah you find some CA haters but really I have found this city to be welcoming and a wonderful place to live. Id just not offer that information up to everyone you meet. Oh and if you drive a car up get your WA plates ASAP. CA drivers tend to get pulled over a bit more around these parts. There seems to be a lot of car crime here Stolen broken into..etc and I hear a lot about drugs meth but seeing that will depend on where you live. Do your homework in regard to location to make sure youre living in a safe area. I hope you love it here as much as I do! Good luck! Edit Grammar,Spokane,d5ovec5,1,t5_2r9l2

Since the stores are selling last years harvest a lot of the stock has lost most of its terpene profile and has oxidized. This results in a lack of smellflavor or bad smellflavor. To hide this synthetic terpenes are being applied to flowers to add back some smellflavor. It is very easy to purchase synthetic pinene or lemonene in bulk and apply it as a spray.

Many of the things people from around here tout as being great are pretty underwhelming. But at least its not a shithole.Spokane is an affordable place to live with a pretty poor job market. Its cheap because most people arent making much.

He does the old humblebrag and selfdepreciation about his wealthy grandparents long walks around Oxford a poor attempt to mask an elitist attitude. Oh you drove a crappy car in HS that you dad bought you? Sounds like a real hard life there. I hear an entitled kid who has no concept of how entitled he really is.  I dont think people can read his writing and find him personally relatable even myself where there are many parallels to my own life and loss.  This story should be hitting you right in the feels but all Im doing is rolling my eyes. Hes entitled to think whatever he thinks of Spokane and the people hes even entitled to write about it. The guardian article was an opinion piece. It should have been stated as such and facts should have been checked. The kicker to this whole thing is the fact that the writer clearly has a bias to Spokane.  People are calling him out on his piece.
