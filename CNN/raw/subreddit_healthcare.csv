However in this case the World Health Organization addresses the following question. Should you have to pay for the gluttons medical care because you do either through your increased insurance premiums or through your increased taxes that keep the healthcare system working when the glutton cannot pay the medical bills that result from eating the wrong things. Clearly the free market will not solve this problem because God and evolution conspired to fabricate people with the wrong hungers.

This needs to stop but how? My own personal suggestion would be cameras in the nursing homes. As we live our day to day life going in and out of retail stores you will be on camera. So why not the nursing homes. As I have worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant I know firsthand that they are completely over worked and underpaid. We also need more awareness on this issue from the state possibly putting together a team who works with elder abuse only. Financial reasons tend to be an issues as to why this is not in place yet. We do have a hotline someone may call however when the state visit is done the nursing home employees suddenly do everything by the book.     I have personally experienced elder abuse with my mother who is only  years old. Approximately five years ago she went into a home only to build her strength up and to this day she is still in a home unable to walk very far. While at the nursing home she was a one assist and had been taken to the restroom however when she was finished no one answered her call light. With that being said she proceeded to help herself back to the chair and in the process fell and broke her ankle clean in half sticking out of the skin. Surgery and five years later she cannot walk on her own at all. This could and should have been avoided.      Many healthcare professionals would argue that video surveillance is not fair. Why should they be watched while working? Well my answer to that is if you have nothing to hide why would someone worry about it? Of course being a privacy concern for your loved one you would need to make sure and have their permission first. A video camera would eliminate much of the he said she said talk. In my mothers instance she has been verbally made fun of for accidents she has while waiting so long for the aides to take her to the restroom. As you get older most understand that your bladder is not as strong as before so holding it for long periods of time is difficult. I have personally been on the phone with my mother while waiting for her call light to be answered for  minutes. Which leads us to believe that maybe the nursing home needs stricter guidelines for more nursing aides.     While this is the third nursing home I have moved my mother to the reality of the homes are that the aides are completely over worked and under paid. If the home had stricter guidelines for how many aides they needed at one time would definitely help with the over worked part. My personal experience is that most aides make anywhere from .. per hour to care for your loved one. I dont feel this is an adequate wage for all that they do. We need to bring more attention to this issue as we can see its only getting worse with the baby boomer generation hitting their sixties.     Together we can raise more awareness about this issue and possibly get some comfort in knowing that our family members are in good hands. I know I would rest easier at night if the nursing home could get more assistance financial emotional and personally. It takes a special person to care for our loved ones when we are unable to.,healthcare,ct9nw0e,1,t5_2qkih

5401858,0,t3_3ozy1o,These annual inhome health assessments serve three purposes One is actuarial another is an attempt to identify and prevent costly gaps in care while encouraging preventative measures the last only applies to the MedicareMedicaid crowd but involves the insurance company making sure that they are being reimbursed appropriately by the government due to risk score adjustments. Given the unsustainable rising cost of medical care there is a big push among insurers to pay for preventative services as well as catchingeliminating drug contraindications. Encouraging nutrition counseling smoking cessation subsidizing health plan memberships assessing fall risk etc. is no longer seen as an extra cost but rather as a way to keep costs lower long term so that they can remain competitive pricewise against the other large players in the market. These visits are essentially an attempt to get the best picture of a members health. Perhaps your cardiologist didnt get the records over to your PCP and he has no idea that the meds he just prescribed can cause arrhythmia when combined with that statin your heart doc gave you.Ideally a pharmacist would catch this but if you get one med from Walgreens and the other from an online store then theres no way for himher to know. If that arrhythmia send you to the ER then the insurance company is now on the hook for several thousands of dollars. For the elderly many insurers will pay for things that can reduce fall risk. A  shower bar that delays that broken hip for  months saves them a lot of money. The fact that their house is covered with slippery rugs is not something the PCP is going to address in the min they spends with the member. All this to say is that the insurer is likely trying to save money not by auditing your health and raising your rates but by trying to prevent the avoidable stuff as Healthcare gets more complex  and to encourage healthy prophylactic medicine in order to keep your Healthcare as simple and cheap as possible. These visits allow them into your HIPAA loop which helps them to do this. But no you should never be required to do this. ,healthcare,cw25b11,4,t5_2qkih

The exchanges are not profitable and heavily regulated by the government making it difficult to earn a profit. The government wants to show affordable rates that for most companies are not sustainable so United is electing to not offer plans in the exchanges and only sell to businesses offering employer sponsored healthcare.The ACA set up a marketplace for healthcare providers to offer plans to individuals seeking private insurance this is what is referred to as the Exchange. However the regulations and the market itself was set up very poorly and companies are having difficulties not losing a ton of money offering plans within the Exchange. The problem with United dropping out of most states is that they were the largest company in the exchanges and if they couldnt profit or make it sustainable other companies may back out as well. Less competition will cause prices to increase. As prices increase less people will sign up.

9364585,0,t1_d930b6h,gt Also Doctors negotiate their rates with the insurance companies on a  or  year basis so the rates they charge are set.Thats not the case with cash pay prices! Nor can I confirm the veracity of that claim that has not been our experience dealing with doctors.gt The only cheaper plan for our family is an HMO type plan which doesnt give us access to our regular Drs.often times when you refer to your doctors people are referring to their own and their families primary care physician. Most of the time wellness visits will not bring you to your deductible. This is why it is beneficial to switch to a high deductible plan and pay out of pocket for your annual wellness type care.This is allows you to see the doctors you want since you are a cashpaydirectpay patient you exist in a world out side of the insurance experience and are not bound by insurance networks not get burdened with a possibly much high submit value as the insurance company and your doctor battle for their own best pricing while you not meeting your deductible get to foot the entire bill anyways.You could transition to a much cheaper high deductible health plan that covers you only in the case  of catastrophic care where you would hit your deductible and save the money you would have spent using a taxfree HSA which you then can spend on your healthycare directpay visits where you wouldnt hit your deductible.gt but it will not solve the problem of escalating prices.By introducing transparent pricing to the market and allowing healthcare patients to behave like rational consumers we can have market forces drive down the cost of care to consumers. Its hard to define a fix because it can look like many different things to many different people but if you want to have a pragmatic solution for the way things are and at least appear as though they will continue to be a directpay solution may just be it.gt Doctors have no control over pricing and have been getting squeezed.Doctors are constantly going back and forth with insurance to determine pricing to be sure but they certainly have the ability to set their own prices. All of our doctors and doctors countrywide when going outside of insurance networks to directpay patients can set whatever pricing they choose.,healthcare,d9310vm,1,t5_2qkih
