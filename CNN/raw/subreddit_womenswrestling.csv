3110484,0,t1_cmwi4mh,I freaked out of excitement when i saw Melissa debut in TNA not as Raisha but as Alisha Flash. I am pretty sure Daizee Haze was on the show that day too. But gradually it just went into bigger and bigger disappointment  she was getting no ring time her ring gear her made her look bland.Also in the promos she was either very nervous or thats just her voice but she didnt come off strong. When i watched her in Shimmer  she almost never talked had same angrybitchy facial expression which worked really well. I believed her to be a badass and not giving a fuck about anybody.,womenswrestling,cokefer,1,t5_317ug
