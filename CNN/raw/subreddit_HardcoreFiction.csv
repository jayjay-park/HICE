9277726,0,t3_57h0k7,You summoned.  Random but I dont suppose if you know whether or not this is the correct format for a comic script? Not saying you did anything wrong I honestly dont know but since I do mostly screenwriting nowadays I was wondering if comics also followed the screenwriting format. I mean... looks like pretty much the same set up but different aesthetics.   Your dialogue seems very forced especially with your exposition about G.R.I.N. the conversation about G.R.I.N. with Zoe and Felix  Fade? In comics? I have to read more comics.  With Angelica taunting Claire thats a little bit of a tell issue. For one the line is kind of cringey in itself but the idea isnt bad because honestly truly thats not too far off from whats in a nerdy chicks notebook. So maybe read a line or two of cringey smut. Or guess which boys the poems are about. Or show a clip of lopsided selfinsert anime.  But yeah Angelica needs work. Shes too classic bully for me to hate her vs just find her annoying.  ZoeFelix scenes tend to be drawn out. Aaaaand Im really sorry for only doing Chapter  but my day is kinda booked. That should give you enough fundamental critique to get started revising. But yeah. You probably didnt get feedback because they arent used to scripts and people are lazy.,HardcoreFiction,d8s0oci,2,t5_2x64p
