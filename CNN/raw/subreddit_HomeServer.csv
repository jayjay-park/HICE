So you pick your registrar find an available domain buy it for X number of years the longer you buy it typically its cheaper per year. Once you buy the domain by default that registrar will host your nameservers. Nameservers are where all your DNS records live plex.domain.com vpn.domain.com etc.. From there you can make new records and point them to whatever IP you want your house a webhost etc.So if you have a server at home running the services already you wouldnt need to pay for webhosting.

4961679,0,t1_cujvqu7,I just need to clear one thing up.gt As an example  I recently read an article which indicated that I wanted a mainboard with ECC memory support and the reason for this is because it is necessary in order to use ZFS. For the sake of accuracy I must say that ECC isnt necessary in order to run ZFS. That is to say that ECC RAM is not required but not using it with ZFS is kind of dumb in my book. Ill explain why in the next paragraph.Is data integrity important to you?The reason I ask is that Im a fan of FreeNAS which as Im sure youre aware is based on FreeBSD. It does have fairly strict hardware requirements and it has certain limitations that not everyone accepts but ZFSs data integrity features are second to non. Which is why ECC is essential in my book. If data integrity is of prime concern then it just doesnt make sense to skimp on the RAM when ECC not only adds another layer of protection to your data its also proven to be more reliable than nonECC RAM.Could you elaborate on what youll be using the server for? For example will you be using it to transcode and stream media? ,HomeServer,cujyinn,1,t5_2sxqm

5404983,0,t1_cw2c5ir,Im not  certain that Ill always keep it as a FreeNAS box. Im considering migrating to a different NAS platform and utilizing it as much more than just a NAS  Media host. Ive been so set on the c all year but Ive recently seen people complaining about single threaded performance being low on certain media types. The Xeon D is the successor to the Avoton line and while it does have a larger TDP its performance per watt is staggeringly high. The ev does have a fairly high TDP w considering the application but I am currently using a w q as well as a large feature rich board designed for gaming that is likely a higher wattage draw than the MBDXSLF. If the D was readily available or I at least knew when it would be available Id almost definitely go that route considering it has a low TDP with very good performance and an absolute ton of perks on board dual g LAN | quad g LAN DDR or  etc.  For now I am making sure my backups are  up to date and I have a spare RE on standby if I do experience a true drive failure. Hopefully Ill have a long enough time to do more research and allow for the D to hit the mainstream market. Thanks for the info though it is good to know that the c can handle more than enough streams. I guess another option is to watch for a price drop on the c when the D settles into its sku range. TLDR Basically thanks and lots more of me rambling about these options. Pretty much just me putting my jumble of thoughts onto a tangible media.,HomeServer,cw2jp29,2,t5_2sxqm
5473687,0,t3_3q1ghf,Ive never had an issue using Molex to SATA. Theyre rated basically the same with V and V lines and SATA adding a .V that as far as I know doesnt get used generally. As long as youre not trying to Y off a ton of connections you can easily get away with  to  and are using high quality adapters I dont think theres a problem. You could conceivably hack off the Molex and wire in a SATA without an issue so an adapter is just a nondestructive way to manage it.For additional SATA ports you need a card. If you just need a couple more ports one of the cheaper  cards will probably do you. If you need more than that or want something more reliable youre going to want an HBA of some kind. Note that these look like a RAID controller but theyre not theyre just an expansion card. Particularly popular for home use is the M which is technically a RAID card but can be BIOS flashed to IT mode which then makes it operate as a HBA. These guys have a couple slots for breakout cables than can then spider out to all your drives. The M is popular because its older but perfectly serviceable came standard with a lot of servers and thus ends up decommed on eBay for a decent price  usually. Youll have to get the breakout cables separately but theyre  on monoprice if I recall.,HomeServer,cwbbcgz,2,t5_2sxqm

6137607,0,t1_cyn8ej3,Thanks for the reply.Ill look into the mapped RAW LUNs. I did wonder if I had Xpenology as a VM how I would point it towards my WD Reds.With Synology I predominently use the audio photo and file server apps. From time to time I also use the File Cloud apps. The music app allows me to stream my music from wherever I am in the world with an internet connection obviously from the server to the app. Movies are the same and File amp Cloud are pretty much access apps to the NAS for any files read write.For remote access its really as above. It would be nice to have access to my music and films remotely and upload my pictures. Tonido offers this and perhaps Plex does too?As I have both servers available I could look at one as just a plain old server and another as a virtualization box. The Gen  can be upgraded CPU amp Ram which Id like to do over time. This box would appear to offer me more support for virtualisation.Something Ive just looked at is perhaps installing Ubuntu server and them running VMs under that. Similar to these two websites  amp  It would appear I could run Plex amp Tonido on an Ubuntu VM. Then another Ubuntu VM could run Xpenology. Have you had any experience of using something similar?Im just trying to understand what benefit I would actually get from ESXi.

Windows Server was out of my price range especially after forking out for the gen hardware and I had a Windows  Pro licence knocking around which I was able to upgrade to Windows . I did some light googling at the time and couldnt find any downsides to using Windows  Pro in a home server role aside from the number of connected clients.

9009891,1,t3_53o5tb,Ok lets clear things up. RAID is not backup RAID has a high failure rate during rebuild with a RAID made with TB drives during rebuild youre almost sure mathematically to kill one of the two remaining disk killing the entire pool.The second best is RAID but you would need a third TB drive.If you want to protect against data corruption your best choice is ZFS which will keep your data safe but you would still need a minimum of  drives to get the best results.Hardware RAID is faster than software RAID and many RAID controllers do things in messy ways. You can hope to recover from data corruption if you use software RAID if you use hardware RAID especially cheap ones start praying.I wrote an article about data corruption a while ago it might be worth checking it out.About FreeNAS and ECC. If you run ZFS the base for FreeNAS you will need an ECC system CPUMBRAM if you dont want to kill your pool. An error in ZFS caused by memory can easily kill the whole pool with ECC you basically remove this error from the equation.If you want another egg cracked I wrote about ECC memories too.Lets sum it up  RAID  Unreliable and mathematically disastrous.  RAID  You wont kill during rebuild as in RAID but you can still improve.  RAIDZ ZFS Parity  Similar to RAID but an error wont kill you still rebuilding will.  RAIDZ ZFS Parity  Pretty safe.  ZFS without ECC  Suicide if a memory banks gets faulty or even if an error were to occur.  ZFS with ECC  The minimum.EDIT I would like to emphasize that the last part overstates risks and gains purposely. Will follow up with a post soon.,HomeServer,d7uujr3,1,t5_2sxqm

9619479,0,t3_5cmhjl,I DIY my NAS. I just have never been able to think of a single purpose I could ever need for a web UI on a NAS. Its a glorified external hard drive. I needs to be able to receive data and write data and absolutely nothing else.I have a bay Supermicro running Ubuntu Server . on a little Logitech thumb drive plugged directly into the motherboard. The storage array is a single BTRFS RAID mount with subvolumes for my various specific storage pools.BTRFS is exactly what youre looking for with flexibility. Its the primary reason I chose it. The downside is no stable parity RAID so pretty much your own option is RAID. You can add and remove drives easily. You can use mismatched sizes with the obvious caveat of having unusable space in some configurations. ZFS is not flexible in this way. Every time you add storage youre going to have to add a set of drives with their own independent RAID level. This is really the one reason why Ive never jumped on the ZFS bandwagon. Its great if you have very specific predefined needs and when you upgrade are prepared to backup upgrade then do a complete restore.For networking I just use individual NFS shares for each externally accessible storage situation. Honestly theres no reason to use SMB unless you have something that specifically requires Samba. NFS is better in pretty much every way and much less of a hassle once after you get past the initial setup learning curve. NFS is faster less resource intensive more secure if youre using v doesnt require separate SMB users and probably some others Im missing.My crunching servers are hosting as VMs on my R and each one that needs storage is attached via its own NFS share to the storage server.To upload files to the server I just use rsync. I also have NextCloud available for uploading and sharing.Sounds like the only thing you do thats not related to running a NAS is Plex. Thats easy enough to get going yourself manually on the NAS if you dont want to run it on another server like I do.,HomeServer,d9ysrgn,1,t5_2sxqm

Software ssd caching from recent tests Ive done seem to work just as well as the hardware based ramcache solutions.That said ive also never had an issue with perclsi products that were not their low tier ones. Ontop of that you pretty much have always been able to get one gen back for pretty cheap. Now one thing I do find lacking in many software raid solutions is flexibility in expansion and that might be a reason to keep with hardware raid.Personally at this point I have a mixture of both. My backup array is a Storage Spaces with an nvme cache. That is something my hp will never be able to do however it still chugs along pretty nicely and handles a pile of annoyances pretty well.Also as a side note the newer raid controllers seem capable of working has hbacache if you dont want to use them for parity. So I think LSI and co are catching on.EditAlso ive found LSI pretty flexible.

There is a SAS version that works the same way but supports larger hard drives and is usually MUCH more expensive and hard to find used.  Theres another version that has  SFF  connections with no expander so there arent any drive limitation issues.  And finally the TQ has  individual connections with no drive limitation issues.

IMYHEiKYKThe IMYHE runs three VMsVM  ADDNSDHCP serverVM ADDNSDHCP server Secondary disregard being on the same hypervisorVM PiHole and Docker with a few containersVM To be built with SQL server instance and IIS webserverThis NUC currently barely breaks  CPU on average and has GB of RAM Model only supports GB max. Went with this at the time as it was the only model that had native Windows Server  drivers.  While there is an easy tutorial to manually install drivers I wanted something I didnt have to mess with.The iKYK runsVM Plex Server connects to Synology DS NASVM Ubunutu . with Docker containers for services like Plexpy Grafana InfluxDBVM Dev VM for web apps and other projectsVM Soon to be propped up for Blue Iris to monitor some network cameras.This NUC will vary quite a bit on CPU depending on the transcodes for plex but overall barely breaks a sweat with everything I am doing. This NUC was supposed to be more Gamer friendly but when you look at the stats it has a very powerful CPU has a better passmark than my AMD  I was using for a server at the time supports GB of RAM and supports PCIe NVME SSDs which is a huge plus.  The performance is better than a full desktop I was using and uses about  less power.  Truthfully this could easily run both NUCs workload combined I believe but wanted to have separation as one is considered infrastructure and the other utilitiesservices.The biggest reason I used them is the size and power usage.  I have a wall mounted rack in my closet and the idea of a full length server even small form factor servers just took too much space. The other big benefit for me is the integrated graphics in case I need to plug in.  Previously I was using a desktop that had no integrated graphics so any issue became a big chore as I would not keep a graphics card in it since I did not have one at the time nor wanted to waste power on it.  I know there are small low power ones to add but was trying to reduce clutter in what was an already crowded small server case.  While not a scientific approach my UPS went from  minutes of battery life to  minutes of battery life after incorporating the NUCs but still feeling like I had both hardware isolation as well as great performance for my needs.As far as the Veeam question I do not have Veeam setup but was exporting my VMs to an external HD that I had plugged in via USB ..

11436351,0,t1_dfs88xc,Geez... I dont have nearly that much data. Maybe  TB right now. And especially if it is a regular sync there should only be crazy wait times when first seeding the backup and then in the super unfortunate event that all local data gets lost Im okay with waiting a few days to get all my data back safely.,HomeServer,dfsas1s,1,t5_2sxqm

Itll just waste power. The on chip GPU will let you use a graphical interface for the initial setup or you can chuck a GPU in the computer and remove it after install.Id put the money saved on GPU to an extra hard drive. Either for backup or additional storage if you dont care about backing up your media.Going Windows Pro for Plex only also seems overly expensive if you dont get the license for free.I converted an old i K with GB ram to a server that runs Open Media Vault which is a debian based NAS setup that lets you control the entire system through a web browser. It extends with Plex plugin but you can also set it up yourself via terminal. The computer just runs with a power cable and network cable. Its got more than enough power for a few concurrent streams. I think youd want a separate hard drive for your operating system regardless of the option you choose. Just in case.Edit I realize you maybe want to use the computer as a media center pc as well. If you dont plan on using it for couch gaming Id recommend you looking into Rasplex. I run it on a Raspberry Pi  and its another Linux distribution that you install on an SD card and stick in the Pis card reader. It boots directly into a Plex player and you just connect it to power it runs on cell phone chargers but get the one with more amps a network cable will make the streaming run much more smoothly than wifi and hdmi for the tv. It even supports HDMI CEC which means that I can control the Plex machine with my tvs remote control through the hdmi connection so the Pi machine can be tucked far away The Pi has plenty of power for video playback it consumes very little power and its silent. Itll let you put your Plex server in maybe an office or whereever you may have space for it.,HomeServer,dganslg,2,t5_2sxqm
