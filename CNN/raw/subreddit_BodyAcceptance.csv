32869,0,t1_cei5f4f,then why not focus on the photographers work instead of posting photos of ONE model from MULTIPLE photographers? more so I have literally hundreds of photos to choose form and i dont post ONLY good photos I post ALL photos because the point is about body acceptance not quality of the photos. Heck one of the photos they posted wasnt even by a photographer and several were from classes not professionals. and lets be honest if they wanted to post genuine criticisms they could have contacted me or the photographers directly or posted in a space that was a friendly place for positive criticisms not a sub that is specifically to say hur hur this aint art because i said so. Ive also read some awesome articlesposts about how art is in the eye of the beholder so to speak its someone expressing themselves and what could be better than a genuine outpouring of the soul? so nope i dont buy the genuinely wanted to offer constructive criticism of the art,BodyAcceptance,cei69dn,-6,t5_2s3ye
41890,0,t3_1uikw8,Listen to unahhan heshezhe makes some good points!  You can love something and want to make changes. Just because you would like to eat well and exercise and make other changes doesnt exclude loving every part of yourself now. Feeling like you cant like yourself until things are perfect or if you like yourself now you cant change is black and white thinking. Its ugly and it relies on false logic.  I think its best to emphasize healthy actions. When you do this you get to win every day. Did you eat veggies? WIN. Did you drink water? WIN. Did you fuel your body to exercise? WIN. Did you get filthy sweaty when you went to yogashoveled the snowany other activity? WIN. You make it a lot less fun when its like how many calories did I eat? Why am I not losing weight if I cut out x number of calories? And as another user pointed out most people dont maintain their weightloss. Something like  of people gain back all the weight they lost and more! in less than  years. You also mention a health condition that might make it harder to lose weight...so why fight your body?

613450,0,t3_215wbz,Hey try not to stress and worry over much as it wont really help anyway. Ive been in a similar spot former anorexia nervosa patient been in recovery for two and a half years and my absolutely biggest fear was that my boyfriend would be disgusted by my weight gain and shape change. Looking back at the journal I kept during the worst times its all I wrote about. I felt huge and gross and could imagine nothing besides him turning away from me because Id physically changed.But you know what? When I left residential treatment and moved back to school he wasnt disgusted at all. Just the opposite in facthe was thrilled that I was not a bag of bones and most importantly that I was HEALTHY.Does your partner know youre struggling? If heshe does Im sure heshe would want you to be healthy above all else no matter what weight or shape or size you are.  I know its hard to bring up and then continue to talk about but maybe discussing it might help both of you? Who knowsyou may seem off or tense to your partner but heshe may not understand why or how to approach the situation.I hope this helps even if just a little. Stay strong and feel free to PM me! Remember that YOU ARE AWESOME!!!!!,BodyAcceptance,cga01lw,4,t5_2s3ye
708782,0,t1_cgknrvd,You probably should read the entire rant as well as the original post. Its actually not that long and clearly explains why this is problematic. gtOr may be they see your figure and realise that exercise must be harder for you  because you carry more weight face more stigma have to be more careful with your joints and likely check in with the doctor more regularly. May be because it can be hard to even get exercise clothes in sizes beyond XL and find equipment that can carry your weight.This is exactly part of the problem  Its nobodys business right or obligation to act on such huge assumptions about a person. This is exactly what fat people have to struggle against on a regular basis  the fact that people assume because they are fat they have a hard time exercising they have joint issues they have health issues etc. Its no different from someone assuming that an extremely thin person is anorexic ill a heroin addict etc.The only thing you can tell from a persons body size is their body size. Period. Singling someone out for encouragement based on someones fat is no better than singling someone out for criticism based on their fat. Would you go up to a very skinny person and encourage them when you see them eating a hamburger? Its simply no ones business. Now encouraging someone because theyre out there every damned day rain or shine regardless of their fitness level of body type  great. Everyone can use that. ,BodyAcceptance,cgkubdj,10,t5_2s3ye

But the one thing that doesnt change is that I definitely feel like I am only attracted to women who are much better looking than I am.  Honestly and Ive always been bothered by this fact about myself I am pretty much only attracted to women who look like what I wish I looked like.  Basically a thinner slightly younger and less wrinkly with better skin and hair version of what I look like.    Being gay is confusing sometimes.  I can hardly ever even be sure if I really actually like someone or if I just want to be them.  Also this is my first time in this sub.  Im feeling super crappy about myself today.

2549288,0,t3_2owg9q,First up great job on caring for yourself and letting yourself accept both your own internal positive messages and your SOs external ones. Hope very much you enjoy the process of making the costume and the fair.  Secondly I have! I sew and have made a few reproduction costumes. I struggled for years to have a healthy relationship with food and with my body image I still struggle with the latter. Pattern sizing is always on the small size and Im not really sure why. I dont think it has a lot to do with vanity sizing like your SO suggested I think it has more to do with them saving on paper costs for printing and every brand just like every brand of clothes is a little different for sizes. They may also be running on old sizes data from when they began at the turn of the century when peoples bodies were smaller in general. I took a break from sewing clothes for few years and when I returned to it a few years ago I discovered that I literally could not find any patterns that ran big enough to cover my body size. I was really sad and upset. The companies didnt even admit my size existed or that I might want to make clothes for myself  didnt even want my fat money! I decided I didnt want to let the pattern companies tell me how to think about my body and its measurements I ended up finding my solace in learning how to grade patterns. I now know how to size up or down! any pattern to better fit any size or shape of body. It was very empowering to me to learn the nuanced skill I needed to do the job that pattern making companies give to computer algorithms that often do a bad job of sizing and fit!

2686699,0,t3_2qn8lz,Im sorry that youre going through this tough time. Its always brave to ask for help!I suggest finding a therapistcounselorlife coach. It can be a struggle to find the right one but they really can be invaluable towards helping you. They provide regular reminders structure and techniques for helping you work through things. If you want to seek this out dont be afraid to ask questions. Ask things like I want to work on having a better body image. Can you do that without promoting specific dietsexercise techniques? and What kinds of techniques do you use to help people through problems?If thats not an option for you try working through some selfhelp books about body image. Dr. Deahs Calmanac is a good basic one to try and you can also check Amazon.com for other highly rated selfesteem and body image books. You can also look for highly rated selfhelp books on bettering your relationship with food.Look at pictures of people who look like you doing things you think look cool inspiring or beautiful. Some studies suggest that this can help us be more accepting of ourselves by admiring others who look like us.Brainstorm some neutral or positive mantras to replace your negative selftalk. Notice what kinds of negative thoughts you tell yourself when youre feeling anxious or down. Make a list of them then think of a positive or neutral way to counter them. You can write them on a cheat sheet card to keep in your pocket even and pull it out to read to remind yourself!For example since you know that you have a problem with black and white thinking about food and your body try to brainstorm something neutral and in the middle perhaps something like I need to nourish my body and that doesnt change because of how someone else looks. I am still learning what healthful eating means to me personally but I can still feel at peace with whatever choice I make now. Even if you dont feel the selftalk is true at first reminding yourself of these things will help you embrace them over time.Good luck and dont be afraid to ask for help.

I started medications of various sorts and a litany of treatments meditation medical yoga neurofeedback PT hydrotherapy cognitive behavioral therapy talk therapy dialectical behavioral therapyetc etc for a physical illness and coexisting ptsd. I was floored at how much better my life and habits became all the way around. Committing to myself was key. Its an opportunity to become really insightful about your self and your desired quality of life. This is such a rewarding experience. There will always be sources of pain or discomfort in our lives. Some of us will have diseases or symptoms we cannot control. But making that decision to feel BETTER allows us to learn to live peacefully no matter what chaos is occurring to us or around us. In my experience optimizing how I conduct my life and take care of myself opened up the whole world. I feel I can empathize with others far better than before and I actually LIKE who I am. Working with your therapist to optimize your treatment and really deciding that now is the time for you to feel better means you are well on your way to all sorts of great discoveries and most likely a peachy existence in a realistic world. You deserve this and I think you are pretty awesome for making it happen. Hit me up anytime if you want to discuss.On a practical note be really careful about noting how the SSRIs and other medications make you feel and how you function. They help tons of people but there are other pharmacological treatments out there and SSRIs although a frontline treatment for this sort of thing dont work for everyone. They made me super apathetic personally and provided no benefit. Other nonantidepressant medications however have been amazing. So ya just dont let necessary medication adjustments get you down because there are lots of options All the best wishes Ill be thinking good thoughts for you. p.s. Mindfulness is a great place to start btw.. free of bad side effects! It does take practice but the skills AND results are cumulative.  ,BodyAcceptance,cp862bj,2,t5_2s3ye

5770413,0,t3_3taohp,I think the other commenter who speaks about religion has the right idea  your body is complex and beautiful.  There are people who would try to tell you that its purpose is to look a certain way but your bodys real purpose is for you to live in it.  Worrying obsessively over your weight takes up so much time and energy.  It makes you feel guilty whenever youre not being obsessive.  Like you pointed out it changes the goal of working out from getting stronger to getting smaller.  It changes the goal of eating from getting nutrition energy and good tastes towell nothing because youre always feeling guilty about everything you eat.  And trying to fit societys beauty norms also gets you nowhere because so very few people fit the ideal that you can work all your life for it and never achieve it.  So Id suggest you lose the scale and try to come to neutral terms with your dress size.  Constantly keeping tabs on your weight is you commodifying your body buying into the value system that society imposes on you.  Come up with your own value system.  Do you feel good?  Can you do activities you like?  Start by being grateful for the small things.,BodyAcceptance,cxcdg6n,3,t5_2s3ye
6432986,0,t3_43s70u,Hey love I am  and completely know what youre going through. I remember when I started gaining a bit of weight in highschool and hated it! I thought everyone could see it and talked about it etc. The fact is your body is changing drastically. Its trying to deal with a ton of hormones and life stresses. I promise you you still look just as beautiful as you did before and only you can see the little bit of healthy weight thats accrued. You shouldnt compare yourself to your friends because everyone is different. As long as youre eating healthy and staying active let a few pounds accumulate. IT IS NOT A BAD THING!!!! I have a feeling that the reason your friends are getting more flirting is because you are absently acting more insecure about your recent little healthy weight gain. You need to work on being positive about your body and keep trying to be as healthy as you can  Just eat well be active and try meditation and mindfullness.

7207610,1,t1_d1xfgbb,gtThey didnt fat shame. They made a joke that did not shame anyone for being fat. Youre wrong and overly sensitive in a way that immediately vindicated said joke.First of all they admitted that they were wrong.  Fat shaming is using things like HAES to say that we should ignore thinshaming. Thats just bullshit.gtAlso HAES as far as everything Ive seen people say isnt about becoming more healthy at any size. Its about convincing yourself you can be healthy at any size. Which is nonsense. If Im wrong and all those people I see posting are wrong then Im jumping on the HAES bandwagon. But I really dont think thats what its about. I think its about denial.Youre wrong.  I have no idea where youre getting your information but if youre serious about this you need a better source of info.HAES means Health At Every Size not Healthy.   The concept of HAES is that everyone can get healthier.  It never says that someone is or isnt healthy  in fact thats exactly part of its tenets You cannot determine the state of someones health by looking at them.  Is someone who is morbidly obese or severely underweight going to have more health issues than someone who is simply overweight or just below the normal weight range?  Of course!  And HAES doesnt say differently because HAES doesnt care what you weigh.HAES says that you dont need a scale to determine your health. Let a doctor decide.  HAES is against food restrictive dieting for weight loss.  Please note that HAES is not antiweight loss in general and fat people do lose weight with HAES.HAES is about learning to make peace with food instead of treating it as an enemy.   When you make food forbidden or evil food is controlling you not the other way around.HAES is about learning that exercise is good for you and encouraging it for physical and mental health instead of a weight loss goal.HAES is about liking yourself and your body. Study after study shows that people who dont like themselves andor are shamed are less likely to adapt healthier behaviours. gtIm  for body acceptance and against shaming of ANY kind. Except ignorance. Im all for ignorance shaming. Thin privilege. Of course thin people are treated differently. And fat people arent going to be treated as well. Honestly why do you think that is?Depends how you define ignorance. This leads to the Logic that any fat person who isnt trying to lose weight is ignorant therefore HAES is wrong.  It leads to the Logic that if a fat person likes themselves theyre in denial and ignorant that they have a problem.  ,BodyAcceptance,d1xg55j,0,t5_2s3ye

8042440,0,t1_d4k1hf1,Right. Its about learning to love your body no matter the size and shape. That is your size and shape are irrelevant here.  How about just loving your body without any labels?   You clearly care about yourself. Why care about what category your body fits in to?  You dont need to pick a body shape to love yourself as you are.I mentioned hot or not as an example of the ideas that this sub is most emphatically not about.

8747016,0,t3_4zvdhz,Im in a very similar position but the way I see it is the dieting culture wants you to hate your body thinner. This will keep you buying pills and diet food and ridiculous fitness equipment like those spot reducing ones and shakes all by telling you that youre not good enough until youre thin. This is always temporary so you regain the weight and lose tons of money and they get you again with something else. But when we let go of that culture and see it for the money grubber that it is and begin to actually see love and accept our bodies as they are something shifts. For me it was finding activities I like to do like dancing or challenging myself to run a K. It was also tossing out the shitty diet food that left me starving and angry and learning more about whole foods and figuring out what my body best thrives on. I have PCOS and IBS so for me I am learning that grains and refined sugar dont make me feel very good.I also see my relationship with my body like my relationship with my husband. I love that man to death but sometimes he frustrates the living shit out of me. But does this make me hate him? No. Even though I dont like what he did or said or how hes acting at the moment I still love him and want to spend the rest of my life with him. I am still learning to offer that same love grace and forgiveness towards myself because I am with me for the rest of my life.I believe body acceptance puts us in a position where we eat healthier and exercise because we want to take care of our bodies. And like me with PCOS I want to lose weight and lower my insulin to help lower my risk for Type  diabetes and heart disease which I know can also affect thin people lowering how much sugar and refined carbs I eat helps no matter what size I am but I am much more patient with myself. I remind myself I am a whole loving wonderful person at my size now and I have a great life and can already do so many of the things I can also do  pounds lighter like run and walk and swim and keep going through an hourlong intense Zumba workout. BUT I also dont beat myself up if I want ice cream or pizza or cupcakes because when I accept myself I accept that Im not going to starve myself but I will also work hard to not emotionally eat or binge and will take notice of how certain foods make me feel.Its understanding you dont NEED to be thin to love yourself or be loved by others. And that if you hate yourself at  lbs you really wont feel much better at  lbs. For me its being motivated by love and grace for myself than hate and selfloathing and not using weight loss to solve my problems but instead face them headon. novel,BodyAcceptance,d6z14y4,9,t5_2s3ye

10837299,0,t3_5ux3s5,Starters thank you for reaching out for helpguidance. The first thing to remember is everyone has a different body type and what works for this person might not work for that person. Seeing a therapist or councilor is a great idea and is recommended. I would say every woman goes through what youre going thru regardless if they admit it. I have been with my wife since we were  and she is  about the same weight then. When she looks back all she says is I was beautiful why was I so hard on myself. You mention going to the gym however you also mention you do not hardly eat I would see if you and your parents can talk to a nutritional councilor so that you can move forward and get the nutrition you need to get through your day and help at the gym. It is counter intuitive but not eating has the opposite effect on your body and can be doing you more harm and effect how you look vs eating at given intervals since your body is going to try and store the food you do eat. I am in no way an expert let alone novice in the field of nutrition however I have a  year old daughter and this is what I would tell her. You talk about how you compare yourself to them and since you weigh more and that you are taller to me being taller and weighing slightly more go hand in hand. A persons weight fluctuates throughout the day and since your body type shape and framing and others differs comparing weight or obsession on weight is like a hamster running on a wheel. Regardless of how hard they run or how long they run they are still in the same spot. Your friends are going through the same thoughts you are just with different girls comparing themselves too. The only diffence between your friends and you is they just dont have the strength to admit it to anyone. Please look in the mirror and tell yourself the things that you love or like about yourself and try to replace the negative thoughts with positive ones because accepting yourself is the key. It gets better you will be able to see that as you start to see the positives in life. I feel in love with that girl who had the same self image that you do  because I never saw what she saw I only saw how beautiful she was and how patient and thoughtful she was plus she is and was so much smarter than me. We have been married  years and together about . Your life is going to seem much better once your able get past this little hurdle.,BodyAcceptance,ddxsh3l,7,t5_2s3ye
10951988,0,t3_5wez1u,You are right skinny is a perfectly normal way to be and people who are skinny are also criticized for their bodies. Because society is dumb. Sizing in the fashion industry is something I feel kind of strongly about. But I dont think there is a clear cut way to fix it. Unfortunately sizing is always going to alienate people. Because there are many body types. Not just skinny medium and fat. There are so many different typical body types that just one size range is never really going to work for all. Different companies grade their sizes from one standard set of measurements. But whatever their standard measurements are are different than every other company. And those standard measurements are based on whatever body type each company thinks its target market has. Because thats just how it goes. I dont think that is going to change anytime soon. And we all have fit issues because of the way this works. Try not to let how clothes do or dont fit make you feel bad. Because we all struggle to find things that fit and that we think look aesthetically pleasing. ,BodyAcceptance,de9mbn3,3,t5_2s3ye

11654646,0,t3_66axal,Hi there Im sorry youre feeling so low about yourself. I have many days like that too. One thing I find that makes me feel better is to focus on learning a new skill or perfecting an old skill. It gets me out of my head and makes me feel accomplished and proud of myself. Obviously this does nothing for actual physical appearance but when your self confidence is high appearance will matter much less to you. As for your skin I started using the natural products from Lush about a year ago and my skin really cleared up. I have spent so much money on skin care before I found Lush and now I cant imagine switching to another brand. I have no real solution for your hair other than to ask if youve been to the doctor and had a blood panel drawn recently. If you are deficient in certain vitamins and minerals your body may be responding in this way. Make sure you are really nourishing your body with nutrient dense food and see if that helps.I hope some of this helps and you find some inner and outer peace with yourself.
