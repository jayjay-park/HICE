In my humble opinion if youre not laughing at least  of the time youre doing BDSM wrong. My one twue way involves a lot more laughing and cake than is generally seen. Cant do kink without smiles and cake.How to start the conversation depends on how much she knows about it already. Its either Have you heard of BDSM? What do you think about power exchange? Do you like the idea of having a submissive? or if she already knows the basics What would you say to making our relationship a bit kinkier? I think Id like to be submissive what do you say to being my Domme? Take it slowly at first. Sometimes people jump straight in with a  tpe and it overwhelms them. Try new things one at a time slowly and see what fits. Good luck! I hope shes enthusiastic about the change youll have a blast D,lesBDSM,crdvktv,9,t5_2u7ff
