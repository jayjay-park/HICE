We even will have Shitpost Sundays every Sunday where you can post whatever you want music related or not.Do try and make reasonable posts though ones where the answer will go beyond a yesno response or just a quick answer. Here is what we have to say about them in our guidelinesgt When writing a selfpost please make a thread that will generate real discussion beyond the first response of the thread. Examples of posts that do NOT meet this criteria Does anyone else... posts What is the name of that one song... posts posts that are only a yesno response and Why do people like this songbandalbum? posts.

This song is great too but Honeymoon and Ultraviolence are spectacular Flesh Without Blood  Grimes It took me half a year to get into Grimes and this is the song that did it. I have been listening to it very frequently. s Music  Kimbra I really loved Vows but this one took a while longer for me to appreciate.

11269955,0,t3_60uw4f,Ive given it a few listens at this point. I think it falls squarely in the middle of Drakes discography qualitywise. Bc he called it a playlist i think he is trying to shield himself from more serious criticism on this project compared to the hohum attitude following Views. I think this is probably around the third or fourth best project from Drake.Like pretty much every hip hop album of the last two years this suffers from being way too goddamn long. like come on  tracks really? Drake did you not learn your listen with the  min snoozefest of Views? Its obvious you dont have much interesting to say at this point so keep it concise. at least this time he peppered in a healthy dose of features which make it a lot more bearable. my favorite tracks are the ones with limited or no drake. the back half of this thing has way too many drake solo tracks that drag the playlist out and make me want to turn it off. Fake Love is legit the only song I see myself coming back to after KMT besides maybe Glow because it is uniquely terrible with an amazing outro. I really hate the whole Drake appropriation thing but it worked out really well for More Life production wise. The beats are the clear stand out of this project. Ill probably keep  tracks of this in rotation and ditch the rest. Thats a lot more than i can say about Views so I guess this is an improvement..,ListeningHeads,df9fl7m,7,t5_3iae1

11594381,0,t1_dga7ggf,To answer your questions  Afaict both Ah Um and Pithecanthropus Erectus have avantgarde leanings especially compared to the albums at the time. Like I said most people were making pretty traditional jazz by our standards so keep that in mind. Kind of Blue was considered a bit out there at the time and it sounds fairly standard now.  I originally started the site focusing on NBA articles if you couldnt tell. I still post an occasional sports article recently  on the Packers and the Serge IbakaDeMarcus Cousins trades but Ive shifted more toward music. The idea was originally to focus the concept of the tenth man or the last man from the second unit on an NBA squad. These guys who do a lot of the dirty work and are still in the top  of athletes but they dont the same shine because they arent the stars. Kind of been trying to apply that concept to music a bit but I still write about a famous albumartist occasionally. Anyway thanks for giving it a read man glad you enjoyed it! Especially glad you liked the footnotes theyre one of my favorite little tools to incorperate in writing. Maybe give that album a spin and see if you agree that its approachable haha. ,ListeningHeads,dga8cjk,2,t5_3iae1
