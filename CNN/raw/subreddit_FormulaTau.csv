5559199,0,t1_cwm6142,gtI assume Sutil is staying with Toyota? And are Toyota using the old TA car?Yes and yes.gtAnd when you say Vandoorne did acceptably well you mean that he beat both Think Again drivers in the old car...Given how anything can explode if it feels like it I tend to not place responsibility for anything much on drivers. Hence why I never bother doing anything interesting with them I guess.,FormulaTau,cwm644y,1,t5_381ux
6186715,0,t1_cysuyrg,gtNot looking so good for Forty Two so far. Youkai are predictably falling a bit short but I had hoped Forty Two might at least finish a race. Ill have to do something about this.Youkai are th in the test race championship which is better than I expected. They havent really done anything notable so far though.Forty Two definitely need more reliability they already have one of the fastest cars in both qualifying and the race so going more towards reliability shouldnt be a problem.Alternatively the reliability upgrade is a thing  it worked for FUD last season...The initial disadvantage from Forty Twos upgrade doesnt seem to be affecting them too badly unlike with Nathan and Ben.gtAlso what happened to Di Resta in qualifying for Race ?I didnt watch the qualifying I just used the accelerate time button and skipped to the race but I assume he was either held up by a Toyota or made a mistake.,FormulaTau,cysv565,1,t5_381ux
