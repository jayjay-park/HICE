8776426,0,t1_d72aubk,Sorry I have now included it in the original post. I hope people fund the procedure for me  Thank you for responding!,cryonics,d72pz0l,1,t5_2r11d
9028391,0,t1_d7x2ick,But again if you want an incentive for new customers the sane thing to do would be to lower the rates for new customers not to lower the rates for people who have been part of the organisation for  years. For all we know the prices may have changed drastically in  years when this change would become significant for todays new customers.,cryonics,d7x2jsn,5,t5_2r11d
9082956,0,t1_d82ixz7,Patients are vitrified in cryotubes not frozen in freezers and M cryoprotectant was developed over decades by cryobiologists Grey Fahy Brian Wowk and others to enable biological systems to enter the cryogenic range without ice formation and with minimal toxicity. It is simply not comparable to automotive antifreeze. No one knows the minimum quality required for future reanimation so preserving people as well as possible upon their clinical death is a rational and conservative approach. Only in the very distant future will anyone be able to say with absolute certainty that restoring a given mind is physically impossible the viability threshold will be observed to have been achieved long before reanimation became possible and long before conclusive judgments on viability could be made. Whether that threshold was passed in the s or the s or will be passed in the s the s or the s et cetera wont be known until much later. Those cryopreserved so far may not ever be reanimated but by not preserving ones brain at all one only ensures one has no chance at all. The premise of cryonics has always been that even the most minute chance is preferable to none. ,cryonics,d83mgjz,3,t5_2r11d
9472026,0,t3_5ahmr7,gt These techniques are getting worseCould you elaborate? I dont really keep up with development in cryonics but this sounds interesting.gt you wont get better with ageIt might certainly make sense to go into cryonic suspension before you would normally be clinically dead in some situations. Take the fairly wellknown case of Kim Suozzi for example  as far as Im aware she decided to stop eating at some point so she could go into cryonic suspension before her brain tumor would ruin her brain any more.I would say this is generally the case for somewhat rapid brain deterioration.In other cases when your brain is doing just fine it makes sense to try to stay alive as long as possible especially since antiaging research as happening in the mean time.gt you could run out of money by the time you need to go into cryoThats why the suggested way to finance it is with life insurance.,cryonics,d9gmrjk,6,t5_2r11d
9484125,0,t3_5alt00, taken broadlyThat number starts dropping pretty quick once you add in all the qualifiers though.What are the odds that cryonics will work for me......given the methods available when I succumb to legal death...given the legal restrictions at the timeplace of my legal death...for the length of time necessary for my preserved data to be recoverable...given that no one may care to recover my preserved dataPresuming everything important about what makes a person is based or at least reflected in the arrangement of their matter and that the basic laws of the universe are known or knowable eventually any degree of degeneration will be reversible. Any number of things could prevent an individual from staying preserved long enough for technology to catch up but catch up it will. One day repairing the damage done to a person by cardiac arrest and cryopreservation will be trivial. That day may be so far away though that you have little chance of seeing it.,cryonics,d9i4evt,2,t5_2r11d
