1407278,0,t1_cisnlwa,Feel free to scan it with every anti virus program you have before opening it. The reason I uploaded to mediafire is so that people could watch the video clip in full quality. Youtube completely butchers my quality every time I try to upload to it so Im not wasting my time with that bad site ever again. If my goal was to distribute a virus I sure as hell would not have spent hours making and rendering video to upload to the bc subreddit to do it lol.

5538208,0,t3_3qxul4,gtAre there cheaters in this game?Yes.  The automatic fire  cleartheserver kind of cheater is exceptionally rare these days.  Ive seen maybe one in the past year.  Not frequent enough to be of any concern.The more subtle kinds of augments and cheats giving already good players wallhacks or snaptohead aim assist when firing also exist and its hard to really figure out whos just legitimately good whos just having a good game and who demonstrates a trend of suspicious behavior over a longer term to satisfy your suspicions.  I tend to find these kinds of softhackers more often on Euro servers than NAbased ones.  Theyre also not super popular but theres usually one or two per night lurking around various servers.  They dont impact the game enough to warrant changing your purchasing decision but theyre out there especially now that Even Balance isnt really updating Punkbuster for BC.gtI am also a little confused why the game costs  like the same price as BF.Because its made by DICE and they dont drop their standard prices to reasonable rates.  However  times a year theres typically a sale that reflects what the price should be normally.  BCs pretty much guaranteed to be  this holiday season.  BF vanilla has been on sale for .  I think BFs base game hit .  Just have to wait for sales.gtIf I buy the game on DVD instead of SteamOrigin will the multiplayer still work?Yes multiplayer doesnt depend on the vendor you acquire the game from.  Its all administrated by EAs login servers.gtConsidering the game is quite old now how long do you think EA will keep the servers online?Another  years likely.  Past history of other BF games suggests EA sticks to around a  year lifespan and BC came out in March .  I wouldnt expect to be playing this game deep into .gtLastly am I reading correctly that it is not worth buying the expansion pack because rarely anyone plays Vietnam?Vietnam is much less popular and the games already starved for full servers so its not always possible to find a good Vietnam match.  Plus theyve found a way to mod the servers now and allow vanilla players access to Vietnam maps in the vanilla server browser so you dont have to buy it to play it.gtAnd if I understood correctly the other DLC is just cosmetic.The SPECACT kit for BC gives you camo versions of certain weapons but also opens up  new kit slots.  So you have AssaultEngiMedicRecon you can customize but then also separate slots for Assault SA Engi SA Medic SA and Recon SA so you can save two loadouts per class without which depending on your playstyle habits might be a nice convenience.,badcompany2,cwjjza9,1,t5_2rgyt
6134515,0,t3_3zezzd,Just look for the servers that do not have XP or modded in the server title. If you join one that gives you a weird amount of points just drop out of that server and find another one.,badcompany2,cymxhjv,1,t5_2rgyt
