50756,0,t3_1unvkw,I was in the same boat as you. After the first fitness test I just about puked and it took me quite a while to cool down and collect myself. It gets way better stick with the exercises and youll see positive results. My second fit test at the beginning of week  I did better in almost every test and when I was done I did not feel sick but I was just as tired ,insanity,cek7j5d,1,t5_2qyvz

484716,0,t1_cfuyyxo,Hey adding weights can be dangerous. Weights on your wrist is bad because it puts weight on places that shouldnt carry extra weight. Everything Ive heard about weights is to be careful.I agree with OP that you should check your caloric intake. I bet you need more calories and more protein to build the muscles.Look in to keeping your core tight to engage the muscles. Otherwise you are doing the exercises while forgetting the core which would explain the lack of core progress. Also doing a mile on a bike  cardio abs isnt sufficient to see results. I bike a lot and a mile isnt a lot speaking for cardio and fitness. Look up spin class routines many of which are usable for machine bikes and manual resistance bikesMy opinion is to check your diet and do insanity again as its supposed to be done. Good luck!  ,insanity,cfvd68m,1,t5_2qyvz

563468,0,t1_cg48yt2,So heres the thing about Intensity and PX  it isnt.  Its not a HIIT workout or MIT.  Just because of that dont think that you wont lose weight.  Youll seriously drop because youre getting your heart rate up.  The benefit is because youre doing resistance training youre strengthening muscle groups that will make some of those harder Insanity movements easier.  The hybrids work really well I find and there are some weaker workouts that leave room for Insanity workouts in so you keep those in so I dont lose cardio endurance which I found out this weekend that mine is really good.Heres the breakdown of PXFirstly your Tuesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday which is optional workouts are always the same except for recovery weeks.  Below is what they are and in parentheses is what I have subbed. T  Plyometrics Vertical Plyo from Aslylum but Max Interval Plyo or Plyometric Cardio Circuit would do great as well. R  Yoga X I dont sub but if this is too difficult you could do a shorter Yoga routine or an Insanity Recovery workout. F  Legs and Back Dont sub it do it  its amazing. S  Kenpo XTrainer from Asylum  you could sub in any Insanity workout but I like XTrainer because it has some of everything.  You might consider Max Interval Sports training if you have it. U  XStretch Optional I dont do it.So at this point that leaves your Monday and Wednesday workouts which are always one of the resistance workouts  Chest amp Back  Chest Shoulders amp Triceps Back amp Biceps Shoulders amp ArmsThe other workouts Cardio X and Core Synergistics are used during recovery works.  I replace Cardio X with Core Cardio and Balance since it IS a recovery week.  Core Synergistics is a great workout for a recovery week so I keep it. So I end up with a PX Focused hybrid thats been giving me great results.  Ive lost about    inches off my waist Ive lost  lbs since finishing Asylum  and Im getting super strong in my upper body.  Now equipment concerns.  Weights are expensive.  If you cant find something on Craigslist for super cheap I never thought to look and I want a matching weight set get bands theyre MUCH cheaper and can be bought at Dicks for  lbs of resistance all the way to .  The handles will cost you    and the most expensive band is They work just as well Tony will show you modifications for how to use the band.  If you use weights there are still modifications.  Basically each workout has  background people.  They are there to show you how to modify the move to your skill level and how to use the bands.  Youll also need a pull up bar. Those run about  and if you cant do pull ups you can swing the band around the bar and pull the band back to you for a similar exercise.I chickened out on PX for years and I wish I hadnt.  Its extremely well rounded and as long as you include some Insanity in it youll continue to see incredible results.  I cant vouch for BJJ  Insanity but I can vouch for PX. Either way again congratulations you deserve it.  Youre an inspiration and youve done great.  You should be so proud of yourself.,insanity,cg4blpa,3,t5_2qyvz

710411,0,t3_220orn,Ok bare with my since i am not an expert on the subject.You say outer upper arms? I would assume that the pain you describe then comes from the Triceps a muscle group that makes up a good part of the back of your arm. This muscle are kinda of isolated as are the Deltoids  muscles around the shoulder area  which is why when people start doing push ups can do very few as the muscles are sorta under developed.Do you feel a similar pain when you do triceps dips?  first time i did them in insanity i managed to do like  before collapsing  If so my guess is that your triceps are rather weak.If that is not the case i would see a doctor as there is no reason for you to be feeling such pain as i personally feel the most strain when doing push ups on my Deltoids and Wrists. ,insanity,cgl0yxr,1,t5_2qyvz

810364,0,t3_23f3f4,I did the same thing when I was incredibly out of shape started with the most intense thing I could find.What I recommend is to be cautious of your heart rate and health for the first week. Make sure you know what your max heart rate is and check your heart rate monitor frequently to see how where you are at. Feel free to take breaks and let the dvd continue no need to pause it. Insanity wants you to be at  of your max during the workout intervals. Once you know your limits start to dig deeper and go harder. You will start to see yourself become a little bit stronger and go a little bit longer with each week. Also dont expect the weight to just come flying off. A lot of people including myself did not see great weight loss for quite a while so dont be discouraged. Instead focus on your fit test results and those will without a doubt be getting better each time if you are doing the workout everyday. ,insanity,cgwe5e0,6,t5_2qyvz

Theres no way Im doubling up to get them back just going to resolve to not miss another.  Just started recovery week last night its a different kind of workout very core focused.

1405571,0,t3_2a35g2,Im gonna agree with everything uEtherBoo said but just wanted to add this. Weight loss is the result of one thing and one thing only. Burning more calories than you are consuming. That is why an exercise program should be couple with the correct diet in order to be the most effective. My suggestion is this. Download MyFitnessPal on your phone and figure out what your calorie goal should be for the day and record every single thing you put in your body. Honestly do this! If youre anything like me you probably severely underestimate how many calories you are putting in your body every day and by seeing it laid out in front of you you can make the necessary changes to fix it. My next suggestion is to start moving even if its just going for a walk at the start of your day for  minutes to an hour just get moving. As long as you are eating a caloric deficit the weight will come off. Fitness has a bit of a snowball effect. The more you do the more weight youll lose the better youll feel... Then as the weight comes off youll get fitter which will allow you to push yourself even further etc... Your number  goal here is to lose weight without getting injured so listen to your body and push yourself to your limits but not beyond them and get moving!  minutes off the couch are better than  minutes on it. Finally dont get discouraged Set small goals and work toward them. Its a lot less daunting to think I have  weeks to lose  pounds than to think I have lbs to lose in a year. Good luck with your journey and keep us updated!! You can do it!,insanity,cisgv97,2,t5_2qyvz

1588141,0,t3_2cgtg9,First off I suggest you do both months since the most significant results are seen in month two. In regards to the back pain I can understand. Ive had sine pretty bad back pain after some of the workouts. I believe this is from keeping your core tight during the workout. Your abs and lower back work together for stability. When you work your abs the muscles in your lower back will feel sore too. If its painful to workout  I would say rest up and try again the next day or go slower. If they are just sore  congratulations!  Your lower back is getting stronger! ,insanity,cjfcuct,3,t5_2qyvz

2779284,0,t1_cnjywr0,MAX is HIIT without the intervals. Its one long high intensity workout. The biggest difference to me between Max and T is the amount of plyo involved. Theres a lot of jumping and explosive movements that T doesnt have. Its even tougher than most of Insanity. In fact a lot of the moves that I thought were the hardest in Insanity power jumps diamond jumps floor switch kicks appear in Max but they are made harder by adding them to a complex movement which forces you to have a larger range of motion.. Its a killer workout. ,insanity,cnjzu6c,2,t5_2qyvz

Doing some weights will infact make Insnaity easier when you return to it.,insanity,d3p14rq,1,t5_2qyvz

9990401,0,t1_db3er3v,Im at Day  week  now. Im really enjoying it and I figure it can be done without Insanity as a prep. However I have  issues that I will have to overcome . I cant jump rope. When I was a kid that was something only girls did we would climb trees break windows or something. So I lack the coordination to do all the fancy kinds of jumping rope that he does. The workout is too fast paced to learn the basics during it so I just do the moves without the rope. I shall have to learn to jump rope on the side and add it in later.. Im getting leg cramps from all the jumping. I will have to do a little bit of warmup before I go into the workout as it is intense and you pretty much dive right in. ,insanity,db9rz5u,2,t5_2qyvz

11125969,0,t1_desxyep,I dont know whats worse the warm up or the actual workout. Both are horrendeous! My fav part is the initial stretch those  or so minutes of blissful sweating...  I skipped my plyometric cardio today im just gonna take an extra day off with Sunday cuz God knows i need it. First day i skipped... But i cant even walk properly after yesterday and my arms hurt like hell... Monday is gonna be awful...   ,insanity,det4atn,1,t5_2qyvz
