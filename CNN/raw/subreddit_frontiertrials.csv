2955999,0,t3_2u0cic,Thanks to Jax and Zephyr Lucca my summoned partner and I rushed into the portal and into a cave with the rest of the Summoners that were involved. For now the two of us needed to talk about what the heck just happened. I looked at Lucca for a moment asking him Never have I been in these parts of the land before and certainly not beasts like that. Ever found something like that on your travels before?Negative. Thats the first time Ive seen such monsters. This is uncharted territory or at least to my kingdom. Any idea on what those things are? Lucca asked me back. I shook my head unable to recall anything on such a subject. Sure Ive been a Summoner for about  months now with a welltrained team but a restriction to one summon is tough. Choosing just one is like picking a favorite for me Im not good with it. In the end Lucca was the only one eager enough to come alongside me.No amount of research I had done before would be of assistance here. In an unknown land the only things I can rely on are my allies my reflexes and my will. I had all those but I wasnt close to prepared yet. First separated then straight into a conflict topped off with the enemy numbers multiplying by six. Though Lucca was thinking the same thing on my mind at the time All in all this couldve been a lot worse. For one we couldve been murdered right out the gate or everyone got separated in some way or another. But lets not ponder over that Id say. I simply nodded my head for now.For now I could hear the others talking about those monsters. The giant red beast was something called an Edelma while the green Earth snakes were Granomuses Granomi? Oh dear. The Granomuses Granomi seemed to travel in packs and assault by swarm. The Edelma was extremely sturdy but vulnerable to some form of status condition seeing one Summoners Sefia paralyze it temporarily. But the research I had looked through in my days didnt make any connections with whats on this unusual island.Lucca was already keeping himself occupied with his conjured dragon smoothening out its green scales. He seemed emotionless like nothing was really going on during that entire fight. I looked at him for a moment and muttered out Looks like all of us are in for one hell of a quest.,frontiertrials,co4412z,3,t5_365m4

My master had thought me something of the same sort as this potion of yours but I am not skilled enough to do it. My master taught me how to see the things it affects instead.tgShe conjured a little hammerspace to her left To return your courtesy of telling me... much about your background and your summon I shall tell you of mine. I am proficient at Fire magic  it is my one true element although I can conjure a bit of Lightning and Dark magic as well. I am also a master of spacebending magic and I favor the scythe just like your summon. I trust you are already familiar with who my summon was?tgAfter seeing Kohya nod she continued She was my first summon and she has never fallen until now. Well I will accompany Jax and by extension you as well but my main priority would be finding one of the Scouts before the day contract rule expires and I lose Sefia forever.tgShe then pulled something out of the hammerspace a black overcoat with a hood matching leather vest and pants and kneehigh boots. She offered it to Kohya Here as it happens I do have clothes that are not dresses and can fit you. Sefia always thought I overprepared my wardrobe in my hammerspace little does she know.tg She handed the clothes over to the alchemist.Paging uShuffledTurtle,frontiertrials,comvjey,1,t5_365m4

Crit chance on the other hand doesnt affect damage calculation directly and has a dice roll mechanic to it already where we roll from  with  being a critical. To this its simple to just add a chance boost and change the numbers that result in a critical hit therefore not changing the calculation. Same with evasion and hit rate buffs except with flat intervals of .Alas I am but an enemy trainer.

Are you alright!?aa Ulkina worriedly landed beside Lance and checked his burns.Im alright! Im perfectly fine Lady Ulkina. The armor...sttThere you go again covering for that warmonger Hiro!!aa The fire witch interjected glaring at her summoner.Like I said Im perfectly fine!

The tinge the underlying sensation was totally new to him that he could only think that it was a concoction made by Kohya.

Was it Sir Jaxs?sttIf thats the case then lets stun lock it!!sttTaking note of its weakness Lance enveloped his blade with cackles of lighting.Ulkina!

And I admit that its because I want to increase readership of the sub but of course I have to respect the mods decision.Thats why whenever someone mentions FT there I tell them to not do it too much as Ive already talked with Twofu and I dont want to even indirectly break the rules there.

Now in front of her was a lingering fire ball which she was heading straight for.  TchcLustrea barreled through the fireball with minimal injuries. Not much could be said for her cloak which was burned and torn in several places. Her hood had been blown backwards.  I have to repair this again...c  Ill repair it for you. Dont worry about it. I need to add some things to the cloth anywaysc  Lustrea muttered under her breath with Lafiel responding in kind.  Who are you. ANSWER ME!  I am... Lustrea.c  Cautiously placing her left hand on the hilt of Gulvenir she eyed Jonathans overall stature and the burning hand he had.  The other two that were with him had not yet arrived and could be soon.  She turned to face Jonathan with a scowl on her face. Her dark blue colored hair above the grey cloaks neck revealed itself see profile for exact style. She intensely focused her tired greyishbrown eyes onto Jonathan. Noticing her hood was down she quickly put it back up.  The oddly healthy tree had shifted a little with a few creaks but neither deemed it too great of an issue.  Gulvenir glowed a slightly dark aura of killing intent. It rattled periodically in its sheathe rather loudly. Occasionally Lustrea shifted her eyes to the twisted tree that seemed to slowly grow a face.I cant make a sudden move to destroy the tree...

I get it...cThen without much delay Lochs familiars got blasted into nothing and he exclaimed Torek the man who had tested them earlier was already fighting Teimus at the summit.Wait hes fighting alone? Hes even more reckless than I thought... Well I guess that settles it.cReturning Kagura to the Gate Alek made sure everyone was inside the barriers vicinity before he began casting his spell.Everyone ready? I hope you know how to fly better than last time!cA flick of his hands formed a spell circle on the ground beneath him an incantation escaping his lips as the circle appeared on the backs of everyone present.Angels and devils let thy essence become one and fly free in the eternal sky. Levium Delta!cWith that white shining wings with a trim of black forged themselves on the backs of everyone lifting them off the ground.Ready? Next stop the summit!cMeanwhile at the summitSwords clashing crimson earthen and electric energy jolting back and forth Torek Dolk and Teimus exchanged blows with each hit that Teimus landed Torek changed units making sure the Demon Sentinel could not inflict permanent damage. Stopping their trade of assaults the human summoner and the electric terror took a breather as Torek changed his attention to the hawk familiars behind him.Haah... Looks like your main events already here. It would be a shame if I let them take over with you still full of pep.aaShrugging the humans remark off Teimus swung his blade releasing an arc of energy that cut down the approaching familiars.It wont be long. The enemies of Lady Maldarrie shall perish by my hand.ccSurprised that the demon servant had the guts to call the mistress by her name Torek prepared to strike once more before the summoners would arrive.Oh? Are you sure its a good habit to go about using the almighty name of your mistress to the enemy?aa Torek asked as he seemingly blinked from one place to another swiftly cutting at the Demon Sentinels armor as his greenarmored companion made a headfront attack. Brushing them off wincing in the slightest pain Teimus primed his sword but saved his energy for the summoners to come.You already know of her name. Youre here for that reason are you not?ccImpressive. Then again theres a lot of things we dont know about demons. Who knows what even youre capable of.aaJust as he finished that sentence the winged Summoners rose above the summits stony walls landing behind Torek and Teimus battle.Hey! Its been a while. I hope you dont mind I kept your big boss company.aaA general quick description of what the summit is likeThe summit is a crateresque flat area with the large granite shrine at the northern end they flew in from the south. The walls are thick slopes leading to the flat and the diameter of the circular area is  metres. There are boulders and pointy rocks scattered here and there. Additionally theres a rather foresty area to the right of the shrine but its elevated higher than the crater thus is a nonbeneficial place to try reach.,frontiertrials,d423zkg,1,t5_365m4

Sighing he flexed his arm glancing around him to assess the situation.That was when Aisha who had been performing as their eye in the sky spoke Ralis Solaru fell into the pond earlier and clearly he looked like he was unable to swim. The others have helped him out of it and hes conscious so he still looks fine. Also I think I saw movements in the frozen trees and rocks but I cant say for sure what they are unless I go near them... Nobodys joining me in guarding the camp...tgConsciousness does not mean that he is stable. Im checking on him. In the meantime Aisha I... Never mind keep watching out for usc Ralis kept his head angled downwards feeling as though he as weighted down by something. Eyes fixated on his hand which he was running the spell through he pondered coming to a conclusion.I still need work in mana efficiency... Or amplifying it... Being able to sustain a strong dose of regenerating magic for this many allies along with making them stronger... I need to work on it. I cant lose another one...c idly walking around deciding that Solaru was truly safe for the time being he continued to ponder about his failures.Before he knew it he had walked up to where Alvin and Jonathan were. Seeing a flash of orange and yellow he looked back up noticing the two ready to spar.... Tsk are they serious about straying from the rest of the group? Or are they simply so confident in their fighting prowess that they do not fear danger...?c Ralis thought staring at the two.... So instead of helping us to guard the camp theyre doing that? Hell are we even resting? I see only a couple of the Summoners setting up something but besides that I feel that theyre not taking this seriously enough. Weve had intruders in our camp twice now even if one of them was merely Solaru but are we willing to risk being attacked by someone like that Tyrfing again?tg Aisha commented anger creeping into her tone.Are we going to just let it happen again?tg Her Summoner stopped staying out of range of the impending spar but at the same time hopefully within their field of vision Aisha... Ugh... I understand that its hard for you up there... Ill try to convince some others to join you.cA finality No. Im going to do it myself.tgLeaning forward on her dragon she directed it to go downwards swooping ever closer to the main bunch of the group that remained in the resting site flying over their heads to which if they were to look up they would see nothing but the underbelly and the wings of the wyvern that briefly swooped above them. Along with the flight the dragon had brought about a gust though not with enough force to knock a person down.Once she had gotten their attention turning back to a slower cruise over the Summoners Aisha jumped off her dragon and landed near them waving off her dragon to land elsewhere that was clear of people. Glancing around she spoke in a firm tone I understand that you Summoners need to rest seeing as how we have been moving since the start of today and went through two battles in a row. But will we truly be able to regain our strength safely if we do not set up any form of guards for where we are now? I see that most of you have the intention to rest here so at least have a Unit to guard the place to protect you. I have been watching us from the sky all by myself and never did I once notice anyone else trying to help.tgLooking at the stilldrenched and most likely cold Solaru given the frosted area they were in Aisha casted a spell directing a warm aura to stay around Solaru for a few minutes. Good news Ralis he seems stable. But his clothes are wet and its cold here. Ive currently given him the radiator treatment. Do not worry. Keep an eye on the other Summonerstg Aisha sent the thoughts to her Summoner.Did you lot already forget what happened to our camp a mere few days ago?tg she stared at the familiar Summoners once again.Over at where Ralis was he called out to the two Summoners Hey do you need someone to keep watch for you? Standing out from the rest of the group isnt the safest thing to do considering where we are and if both of you were to be attacked out here... Well...cHe was suddenly at a loss for words. Or perhaps he was not but he found it difficult to speak any further.Amy where do you think he put that thing? Eve asked rummaging through a pile of objects.That thing...? Oh that thing. Its uh...

10435371,0,t3_5n5ie4,Catch!cJonathans eye shifted over to where a flying cloth was flying towards his face. Closer inspection showed a flash of blue indicating that there was a blade within the cloth. Moving his head to the side Jonathan watched as the clothed blade crashed into the tree then immediately disappearing and reappearing back to Solarus side.  Tch. Moving his head back in place he sent a dangerous glare back at Solaru that he most likely didnt see cause of his hood but the gist still stands before going back to watching whatever the hell was everyone doing.Its a good design to say the least...A while later Jonathan was now just watching around the clearing which now involved more Slime feeding with Seven and Lillith completely freaking out and running off while her ghost friend called out Lunaris who was blushing heavily Ciara asked So what the hell are we supposed to do? Those Sentinels still know were here even if we took down two of them...Jonathan was about to answer her question when out of nowhere the blade that he dismissed earlier immediately materialized itself back in Jonathans hand and started glowing with a pulse. What th Jonathans eyes widened as he realized what was happening. Before his Units could say or do anything his eyes lit up in flames as he immediately chucked the blade over the horizon towards the city that they left prior to the fight.What wasccAs the flames around his eyes calmed down Jonathan just answered with Nope not answering that. Im also not having that happen here where everyone else is. He pushed himself from his leaning position off the tree and said Im just gonna go fetch it.Hey wait cant you just recall your weapon back?Jonathan frowned and started heading towards the city. Yes but one Im curious what form it took this time and two Id rather not have everyone asking about what in the world just happened. Hopefully everyones too busy doing whatever the hell theyre doing. Shoving his hands in his pockets he headed off.Meanwhile the sword was flying towards the air right over the path that Lillith was taking. After flying out of sight a while later Jonathan was walking down the path following the blades trail. Oh right she went down this path earlier... Passing her and Sylph he muttered a question that only Lillith could hear.Tell me. Have you ever broken a rule before?With that whether the girl heard what he said or not he continued his way towards the city.Skills Flame Eyes used for about one secondumiririri well that was a thing.uInnocentAnguish flying blade flying over Lilliths head and Jonathan walking her direction afterwards.,frontiertrials,dcqx3gr,1,t5_365m4
