3688127,0,t3_2vcs92,Oh man the Valdemar books were my refuge when I was in like grade .  Im convinced that they are the reason I didnt grow up into a selfhating closeted homophobe  those books exposed me to gay and lesbian protagonists well before my fundie NMom ever started trying to indoctrinate me about the evils of homosexuality.  So I have a lot to thank Mercedes Lackey for. I havent actually read the collegium series though.,RBNBookClub,cqco65m,2,t5_2zx7n

8244987,0,t3_4lfpya,I benefited a lot from this book but took objection to some of the things she says. For instance that unconditional love belongs to the irrevocably past realm of childhood and has no role in healing adults. Protection from abuse by our community and society should absolutely be unconditional. And the right to be accommodated while we heal must too be unconditional.I also found it offensive when she says that abusive parenting doesnt preclude love for the child even extremely passionate love. I mean shes probably right in many cases but NPD is just a whole different beast and Ns HATE their children. So that statement anyway isnt applicable to our situations.That said it was very insightful throughout and Im glad I saw what it was about.,RBNBookClub,d586gbl,1,t5_2zx7n
