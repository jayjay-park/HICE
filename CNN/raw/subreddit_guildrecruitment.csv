We cap our roster between  and run monthly activity checks to ensure our  members are all of quality.  But I can assure you we are a guild focused on community and knowing our members.  You will not find the broken chemistry you speak of here.  We take our recruitment very seriously.  It is a community effort we are not trying to pack every player that will accept an invite in our roster.  We try to seek out players looking to be part of a community and after reading your post I think you would be a good fit for us.XHSA has been a guild for  years.  We have great experience in helping members reach their goals.  Our strengths are PvE and sPvP.  I personally as well as officers will be running low level fractals to teach people and get them over that initial hump into high level fractals.  We are also very effective at teaching dungeons runs and spvp builds and rotations.  We also have been running guild missions every week since their release without fail.  Currently every Friday at pm Central.If this interests you.  You can check out our recruitment post where you will find more info on us link to our clan page on our sponsors website and some comments from some of our members.You can also contact me in game on Mireles Lore. with any questions or to request an invite.I look forward to hearing from you.

10882984,0,t3_5vjag0,Hello DonaldsonI might have a guild that interests you.  We are XHSA a community focused guild established for nearly  years now that is very active in raiding.  Although we might be a bit larger than you are looking for with  active and high rep members we certainly fit the bill for an established end game focused community guild for players that are looking for a main guild.We have raiders that range in experience from LI to players just starting out.  We have groups running just about every day of the week some that can clear all the raids new one included in roughly  hours.  We currently have some static slots available as well.This is also a guild that never forgets that this is a video game.  People play to have fun.  While we too strive to do our very best we dont berate our members because mistakes are made or DPS on a particular encounter wasnt the very best.  We are all players trying to reach a goal that know when we can do better.  Respect for people and respect for their time is  priority here at XHSA.Granted you are okay with some of our policies.  I think you would be a good fit for our guild.

11525098,0,t3_64cjui,Hi there! I lead a guild that is dedicated to helping all players at all levels of the game from those who are brand new to the game to those who are returning from a break to those who want to do all the hardest content. We are Uniting Noobs of Tyria and wed be happy to have you! We have many players who do raids and the highest tier of fractal dungeons. We have a rotating schedule of guild events including dungeon runs fractals and HoT map meta events with HP runs but of course events and groups happen spontaneously. Currently we have SAB events scheduled and have  raid trainingpractice sessions a week. We are a friendly guild and have just one rule be friendly to other members as we have players from all over Europe and some in South Africa from all kinds of backgrounds. We emphasise this is a game and is here for fun. We do not have a representation rule. If this sounds good to you send me a message in game to Lateralis. leave a message here or send me a PM. I can answer any questions you might have or can send a guild a invite. ,guildrecruitment,dg2deb3,1,t5_2thc3
11688936,0,t1_dgkxy3h,gt bury the whole thing?Im trying to see what got you so mad? from what i can tell you was asked to play a meta build lied about your gear and then decided to argue with the raid leader in the middle of the raid. They had enough of your shit and kicked you out after you started complaining they agreed that instead of dealing with someone whos just complaining all the time to just block them so the conversation doesnt get toxic a little like this one is getting.Im not sure if your saying that im insulting you or not with your comment but the fact that its on the internet or not doesnt make a difference except that with the internet you are free to logoff whenever you like no need to get hung up on things.,guildrecruitment,dgkyj07,1,t5_2thc3

THEN COME GET INSIDE US,guildrecruitment,dgqugub,1,t5_2thc3
11741042,0,t3_67ec6i,Having been part of too many guilds to put a number to during my gt years in GW this one is by far the most engaging and where I hope to stay. Being in an environment where others are trying to get the most out of the game will encourage you to get gud and enjoy it like nothing else can. Personally I went from having some raid experience and tons of shoddy fractal group experiences to being placed in a static raid team with opportunities for challenge mote raiding and neardaily solid tnm cm groups in the  months Ive been part of XHSA keep in mind that this didnt happen by being carried through content thx grimm but by putting in effort and trying to improve. Im not the most social player and am admittedly mostly here for the content and consistency but guild missions and general banter are a blast and members are laid back and easy to get along with. Come prepared with your best memes and apply already if you think youre all that,guildrecruitment,dgqvkyn,2,t5_2thc3
