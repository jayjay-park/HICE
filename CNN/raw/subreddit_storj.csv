2112566,0,t1_cl8brur,Storj is about cooperation as opposed to competition. We dont claim to be the one perfect solution to cloud storage which is why we reach out to other projects and have plans of integration with the likes of MaidSafe and Ethereum and others.,storj,cl8coyi,2,t5_3178x

2525557,0,t1_cmo7sat,Someones gonna store information on the blockchain eventually anyways.lukejr already put his little poems up?I know it fills up the blockchain but if this is really a risk to the network shouldnt we address it and not try to hide it under the rug? Someone is gonna do it eventually anyways. Maybe some paypal bosses will start to bloat the network what are you gonna do about it?Might be me! ,storj,cmo86uu,1,t5_3178x

2774482,0,t1_cnjf3v9,The problem with another crowdsale is that it can take up to  months to prepare and this will delay the project further. What we are proposing is to raise funds to be immediately spent to accelerate development etc. This will allow for our apps to be finished sooner. I think the benefits of this happening are far greater than having to wait months to raise more funds.,storj,cnjg4u0,1,t5_3178x

6984831,0,t3_4bd1jx,Maybe not the right forum for this question? It seems grossly out of place to me. May I suggest.. Do your homework yourself? Why would you ask folks in this forum to tell you about a technology other than the one here discussed?Edit Ooopps. My bad. Looks like this forum encourages comparisons to other projects. Sorry for assuming otherwise. I see Community Rule  is more restrictive in statement than it is in practice.,storj,d182jtl,-1,t5_3178x

9115975,0,t3_554s88,So this has a couple pieces. One of which we solve and one of which we dont. The first is a data time stamping system. There are systems for this like factom or tierion. Shawn helped author the Chainpoint standard for embedding data hashes in a blockchain.The second is ensuring that data doesnt disappear over time. This is what we do. Storj is a separate network that does data storage. We help make sure that if someone wants data enough to pay for it it sticks around.So for your history app you would store the files in Storj and embed metadata in the blockchain.,storj,d87lchu,2,t5_3178x

11395872,0,t3_62mhoa,HiStorj has not yet migrated over to ETH thus currently you should still use a counterwallet address if you want to use Storj Share. Yes you can indeed use the SJCX address in poloniex to store your SJCX coins on.  There is a bit of confusion here as you are mixing Storjshare with just buying tokens. To buy tokens you do not need a counterwallet address you can just keep them on the poloniex exchange.If you want to buy SJCX you indeed first have to buy bitcoin at for example coinbase and then send it over to poloniex then on poloniex buy the SJCX coins with your deposited BTCs. ,storj,dfnpgc9,3,t5_3178x
11665161,0,t1_dgi3tus,We are working on a disclosure document that will describe all of these in very great detail. It will describe the market use of sale etc. In the meantime Ill be posting blog posts that cover some of these very soon. ,storj,dgi9es8,2,t5_3178x
11776893,0,t1_dguxs7s,It says it right here If an animate or non animate entity adds entries to a graylist identifying illegal content that means the entity has identified the content as illegal. Its a list like this segment segment ...These segments are identified as illegal by the graylist which you may or may not subscribe to. If you look on your storage you may find these segments. That means yourre hosting what the graylist considers illegal content.It might not be illegal but it might also be. The point is why do we even let the content be located to a specific node? If were not able to determine which segment is stored on which node then we dont have this problem. This problem causes us to not have plausible deniability. You get it now?,storj,dguy56a,1,t5_3178x
