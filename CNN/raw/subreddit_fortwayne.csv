Could that splitting of cost actually make it cost efficient?But then you think about displacing homeowners that cant be helped no matter how much money you throw at it.And now that I am thinking about it it would be silly to do all this for one train. I think in order to make this something that could be worth it  profitable we would need to turn Fort Wayne into a huge hub for commercial and residential transport. Just thinking out loud.
