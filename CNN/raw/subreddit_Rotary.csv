I dont know how great that works but some Rotaract clubs I know meet in the conference rooms of public libraries or at bars where you are not obligated to buy anything. Find a place that works for your members. Always ask your members and prospective members what they want and cater to them as best as you can. They will want to stay if they feel comfortable and if they feel like they have a say in how the club is run. Also do your guests eat free at least? If they are still prospective I dont think they should pay. The club should pay for them. If you have prospective members but they think the cost of the meals are too expensive you may want to redirect them to a satellite club or have your club start a satellite club!. I dont know much about them but you can find out more from your district. My understanding is that satellite clubs can function as Rotary Clubs but have lesser expenses and fewer meetings and whatnot. They do tend to be catered to the younger generation though and Im not sure how youngold your prospective members are. What kind of songs do you sing in your club? I feel like so many Rotary Clubs in the US almost always sing God Bless America or something along those lines. That can get boring VERY easily and I have always seen people complain in meetings that sing those kinds of typical songs. My Rotaract Clubs sponsoring Rotary Club has a new song every week and the song master makes up new lyrics based on something the club members all enjoy as a whole based on the speaker of the week based on an event coming up etc... and the tunes are always from common songs. It turns singing into a fun thing because everyone laughs at the way the lyrics are changed and whatnot. If people hate some part of the motions that your club does change the motions and make them fun! If that doesnt work then dont sing anymore. Not every Rotary Club sings as it just doesnt work for everyone. Again do what the club wants to do...and feel free to change things up! Make everything seem exciting and when prospective members come they will want to join something that looks like fun!,Rotary,ck1fjf4,1,t5_2sdhw
7870141,0,t1_d40i2a6,Rotary is not supposed to be political. At all. And the majority of Rotarians are not American. I had to Google what hb is as Im not American or know what it is  I simply pointed out that youre not going to get an answer on this sub. Were volunteers who try to do a little bit if good in the world  ideally or for me we stay out of politics amp religion it should be about service to others and yes for any sexual orientation amp gender identity. But this is just one persons opinion I cannot comment for the entirety of Rotary International. Neither can any Rotarian. Personally  as a Rotarian  if the media asked me this I would more likely respond if its asking about supporting LGBT amp mental health then respond on politics. So rather than just Rotary I think what youre describing are groups and organisations who dont want to be dragged into a political storm by commenting on various issues. It sucks but so is being taken out of context amp presumptions. Not receiving a response is not a sign of support for it either.If you are expecting a political statement from Rotary overall about the bill youre best to try and get one through Rotary Internationals media department there should be something on rotary.org for contact. AGAIN none of us speak for Rotary overall. ,Rotary,d40oczr,2,t5_2sdhw
