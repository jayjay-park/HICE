Its normal for a few hours to a week even after a seizure to feel weird. Headaches dizziness and aches and pains are pretty common  and it varies person to person and depending on the seizure itself. Did she get an aura before her seizure? An aura is basically a feeling you get before you have a seizure and in itself is a seizure simple partial. If she stares blankly into space and her eyes roll back into her head it means shes beginning to have one! ,seizures,desaynr,1,t5_2qrbt
11352055,0,t3_5yuur6,Im sorry to hear about your younger brother. Im no professional but Ive also been suffering from seizures since I was a child. Since your brother has a neck injury you might want to see a chiropractor to see if the injury is healing correctly? Seizures can be caused by problems in the nervous system so rather than worrying how worse your brothers seizures are going to get  you could take preventative steps to make sure he wont end up worse.  For example make sure his posture is correct and that he is lightly exercising when he can. Most importantly try not to worry in front of him. Seizures are stressful on the body and plus the added stress of family worrying about you is a lot for a young child. Stress can also trigger seizures in epilepsy and psychogenic seizure disorder Just remember more children grow out of seizures than those who dont and it may just be a case of a few lifestyle changes.,seizures,dfiqg7r,1,t5_2qrbt
