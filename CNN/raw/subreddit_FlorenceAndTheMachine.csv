11677850,0,t3_66mjs5,Lungs sound is mostly what you might consider small scale. In the early days of Flo and Isa recording they barely had any instruments at one point stealing drums from another recording studio and banging on the walls to get their sound. Thats why for a lot of the Lungs songs the main instrumental focus is tambourine piano some later transitioned to harp as the band expanded clapping and Flos own layered vocals. After they took off from Lungs Flo went for a much grander sound with Ceremonials hence the introduction of big drums and other grandiose effects. The songs reflect the same shes said in interviews that she was trying to encompass more of human feeling and experience but in the effort actually distanced herself from it and made it a bit too big and remote. She also said that with Lungs and Ceremonials she thought she was being honest through her symbolic lyrics but actually realized that she was hiding herself. How Big How Blue How Beautiful is a different sound altogether a bit more brassy than the other two albums but also more downtoearth. HB is the album where she truly revealed herself her struggles and her pain. Pay close attention to the songs with less instruments and backing vocals as these are the most raw songs and the ones hardest for her to record. I also strongly recommend watching The Odyssey which is a longform music video compiled of several songs from the album. Searching the band name and the movie title should bring up the full edition so that you dont have to hunt for all the chapters. I hope you continue to enjoy her music!
