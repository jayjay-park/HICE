1868406,0,t3_2g039m,The Battle of Texel was one of the rare times in preWW history when the French and British were allies. In this case they were fighting the Dutch under Michiel de Ruyter and Cornelis Tromp. The battle was a victory for the Dutch. The ship in the center of the painting is the Gouden Leeuw Golden Lion Admiral Tromps flagship as the painting was possibly commissioned by him.,BattlePaintings,ckec4h7,2,t5_2v8tt

4211312,0,t1_cs09yf2,ampampamp Glorious First of June sfw gtgtThe Glorious First of June also known in France as the Bataille du  prairial an  or Combat de PrairialNote A of  was the first and largest fleet action of the naval conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the First French Republic during the French Revolutionary WarsgtThe action was the culmination of a campaign that had crisscrossed the Bay of Biscay over the previous month in which both sides had captured numerous merchant ships and minor warships and had engaged in two partial but inconclusive fleet actions. The British Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe attempted to prevent the passage of a vital French grain convoy from the United States which was protected by the French Atlantic Fleet commanded by RearAdmiral VillaretJoyeuse The two forces clashed in the Atlantic Ocean some  nautical miles km west of the French island of Ushant on  June .gtDuring the battle Howe defied naval convention by ordering his fleet to turn towards the French and for each of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent. This unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains and as a result his attack was more piecemeal than he intended. Nevertheless his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered in no condition for further combat Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his ships of the line Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howes fleet securing a strategic success. However he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war. In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies.gtThe Glorious First of June demonstrated a number of the major problems inherent in the French and British navies at the start of the Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains along with illdiscipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat. Still battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a shining example of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies.gtgtImage iInteresting The Glorious First of June play | Order of battle at the Glorious First of June | Lord Howes action or the Glorious First of June | Bowyer Island Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcsyie oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecsyie.

7025384,0,t1_d1b1qom,Plate armor definitely changed the game a bit like you said anything that could bash in metal like a hammer or mace worked well against it but at the end of the day in a melee you wanted a pole axe which was the best of everything an axe to hack at vulnerable spots hammer on the opposite side to crush and topped with a vicious pike to poke through visors or gorgets if you could manage. Things like billhooks were good for cavalry though you could hook the riders leg and pull them down which was lights out normally by a dagger through the visor slit. ,BattlePaintings,d1cohqj,2,t5_2v8tt
