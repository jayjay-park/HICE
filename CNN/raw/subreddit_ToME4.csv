1141195,0,t3_276ulk,One thing I love about this game that nobody else seems to mention the ingame chat. Its such a simple yet mindblowingly great concept that makes ToME that much more enjoyable to play. The community is a lot of fun to BS with and discussion is almost always helpful and amusing. Theres only been a few times where Ive seen negative examples such as rude chatters homophobic remarks and the like but not enough to really warrant more moderation. Id like to apologize in advance for my seemingly random comments ingame but I do like to amuse myself as well as others ,ToME4,chxzu9m,4,t5_3201p
2224020,0,t3_2klp3g,Its been ridiculously buggy for me. I can barely load the game and when I did there was no exit out of Searing Halls. I really want to play it. ,ToME4,clmiylg,2,t5_3201p
2745297,0,t3_2richm,In general This is a bad week to get started streaming as there is a major event AGDQ  going on which will take viewershare. Sunday and Monday are actually great days to start if you want exposure since people are going to be looking for something new to watch.Aside from that Really depends on what kind of streaming you are doing. I know I LOVE informational streams. Entertainment is a lot more hit or miss and I personally abhor what Twitch finds fun and lean more toward the LPers who happen to also stream.But either way The streaming market is pretty oversaturated. TOME is probably a less heavily streamed game but everyone and their mother is streaming these days. So if your goal is to get popular you are probably boned. If you just want to have fun who cares how many folk are watching?,ToME4,cng4muw,4,t5_3201p
3338325,0,t3_2yb7k7,I believe I had tried it before but maybe it could be done better.What about more share your character threads I mean dedicated ones. Sure theres the class thread  where we encourage linking characters of that class but maybe we could have where you share a character that youve had which matches the parameters we set for each thread. Each parameter your character fits within scores you a point and so we could have leaderboards on the wiki for mostbest characters and possibly even custom flairs to recognize people who have participated in many of the threads.This would make it more of an active thing as well as a way to show your involvement in the community here.Alternatives could be Best death threads Builds and tips Or we just make all the weekly threads be worship DarkGod threads.,ToME4,cp8slwp,2,t5_3201p
3443848,0,t1_cpk9wbn,You need to learn Shoot in Last Hope from a weapon shop. Its only  gold but you really dont need to be using ranged weapons on a Berserker.,ToME4,cpktoix,1,t5_3201p
3530297,0,t1_cpue62n,I let my character die. Im beginning to now understand some more advanced stuff about stats and tactics. The farthest Ive made it with the way Ive been playing in a nonexploration mode game was level  just past the Last Hope graveyard.  Which I guess is really lucky for me considering. Also it was on easyI have also now just learned what inscriptions are and how useful they are. I havent played much since I made this post so I havent really been able to play around with them. But before this I didnt understand them so I just avoided them.EDIT Inscriptions are love. Inscriptions are life.,ToME4,cpuoexq,1,t5_3201p
3549685,0,t1_cpwt5tk,.team files are just renamed zips As for why the file isnt there the only thing I can think of is you installed the nomusic version and the patcher doesnt work for it.,ToME4,cpwvy39,2,t5_3201p
3622299,0,t3_31us6u,I played nightmare for the first time yesterday got to lvl and then died to the master.  I had  options to go to  the dreadfall tower master lvl elf dungeon monsters were lvl the base with portal never tried it and the spell place near the dreadfall tower.  Once I hit lvl  I noticed all the monsters I was fighting were higher level. Once I hit lvl  every monster I was facing was  levels higher than me how to survive I have no clue.  I could actually beat all monsters higher lvl than me but I couldnt beat the master and super raresunique monsters which I skipped.  In the end wasted my lives trying to take out the master.  edit I could of beaten the master but he made too many summons at the entrance and I was surrounded. Super raresunique monsters still owned me due to being  lvls higher.I was suprised I hit lvl in nightmare mode I noticed because you were facing stronger monsters you had better drops earlier which helped me face them. I was a cornac bulwark with anti magic if that makes any difference.,ToME4,cq562x4,2,t5_3201p
4451482,0,t3_3c1uau,I know I can but I find Nightmare or InsaneAdventure more fun than NormalRoguelike so I dont bother. There have been instances where I almost made it but I died to silly mistakes like dying to Stoning Poison  summons and Aether Breaching myself those were the only two deaths in my Insane Archmage run.,ToME4,csrslrj,3,t5_3201p

5077227,0,t1_cuxyr95,No its aboslutely fine and important to have different opinions on basically anything. Its kind of funny that you bring up turn based combat because I was actually thinking about exactly that a few hours ago. I was thinking would this run be any different if it was not turn based? and I came to the conclusions that no it stays exactly the same since in both cases youre gonna be moving and executing everything as fast as possible.That seems to be the great strenght of roguelike they arent actually turn based if you play them fast.I think there is no real correct answer as to whether to use time or turn but time is definitely more appealing to me which shouldnt mean that you cant do it I am just not gonna respect it as much,ToME4,cuxzxan,2,t5_3201p
5614925,0,t3_3s07xp,You should probably wait to do it until you come back from the east its a level  zone.  So basically Dreadfell gt Reknor gt Cave gt Spiders gt Underwater Cave if you have waterbreathing gt Armory gt Briagh gt Backup guardians gt Elven Ruins gt Sludgenest.  Its been a while since Ive been to the Sludgenest but If I recall correctly you want to take the stairs to the second level of the Sludgenest and fight the boss as soon as possible since the walls keep turning into higher and higher level enemies pretty much until there are no more walls.  ,ToME4,cwt33ec,3,t5_3201p
5842355,0,t1_cxkxn0j,Will do. Some searching on the forums revealed problems like this in the past mostly due to not being able to find the C libraries it wants to use. Some posts say that its an Ubuntu problem and talk about sim linking etc which is beyond my current understanding. ,ToME4,cxlgjju,1,t5_3201p
5975735,0,t3_3x9blz,Hope youve got a teleport that you can get out of there with. If not its probably time to start thinking about what your next character will be. So close to a chokepoint too....,ToME4,cy2y7ww,2,t5_3201p
6064809,0,t1_cyeketa,Yeah positioning and decision making when to begin an escape etc. seem to be my biggest downfalls right now. Almost all of my deaths occur around level  right now.,ToME4,cyel7tt,2,t5_3201p
6461786,0,t1_cznkqrc,Theres just as much content in ASCII mode as there is with tiles. After over hundred hours of gameplay I changed to ASCII I despised ASCII games and graphics before and because I knew my way around the game already I felt quite comfortable with ASCII in a familiar game. After countless hours of ASCII Tome I was actually able to enjoy other ASCII games as well.You can find the OldRPG tileset by searching for OldRPG at te.whatever or in the Steam Workshop. Its quite large compared to the regular addons so its in nine parts though. Protip if any of the tilesets or the ASCII is too large or small for you just edit the size in the options. I like to play in x ASCII so I almost always see the whole map on my screen. ,ToME4,cznoxcu,1,t5_3201p

Before you file a ticket though select a dwarf as your race and look under the Wilder group Stone Warden is a Dwarfonly class and is only available to select if you have a dwarf selected as your race.,ToME4,d0z059m,1,t5_3201p

9947325,0,t3_5heb45,Wyrmic is pretty good for that.A more mindpowerbased build can do a lot of damage with Corrosive Mist Static Field and some supplemental skills like Devouring Flame also Leaves Tide if you learn mindstars from Zigur.A more strengthbased build can focus on getting a bunch of Breath attacks and reducing their cooldowns with Wyrmic Guile from the Higher Draconic Abilities category. All the breath attacks also inflict debuffs that can help a lot as well Blind Stun Freeze Daze Disarm and ability failure chanceIts got pretty good healing with the Fungus Tree and pretty good at getting out of difficult situations with the Lightning Speed ability.,ToME4,db45u0n,1,t5_3201p

10381220,0,t3_5onz21,I chose to start with roguelike mode and havent played any other life mode since.In other roguelikes Ive usually enjoyed dying and restarting frequently for the first few playthroughs as I start getting the hang of how to survive. It kind of makes the exploration of the unknown more fun for me I think when I have no idea what Im doing and theres a constant fear of getting my character killed. ToME was not an exception to this.It can be a bit grueling but as they say in the Dwarf Fortress community Losing is fun!,ToME4,dckrxgi,7,t5_3201p
10401062,0,t1_dcmzqrz,Thanks! I just tried Sun Paladin on my own and got killed by level  since some ranged thing murdered me. I was unable to close the distance due to other mobs being around. I suppose I just need to git gud but I think I need something to ease me back into the game because right now I have no idea about even the most basic concepts of the game as I havent played in a few years.With that in mind Im currently trying my way as a Wyrmic so Ill see how that goes before I give the Sun Paladin another try. ,ToME4,dcn0zi5,1,t5_3201p

11239550,0,t3_60fgkx,You can actually talk to DarkGod. He wont always respond to chat but he does sometimes. Anyone you see with a red name in the chat has developer privileges and they tend to be pretty reasonable to talk to and give feedback to.

11569571,0,t3_653e8m,. Wait out the bone shield then burn your cooldowns.. Check his stats chances are he has high armor or physicalall resistance so counter with armor penetration or physical resistance penetration. If he only has physical resistance you could also find a weapon that does elemental damage. There are a couple artifact jewelry items that will convert all your damage to other elements.. Use antiheals if you can. Most are poisonbleed so Bone Giants are probably immune.. Check his talents and their cooldowns. If this is Celias Crypt and this guy came from one of the coffins those undead are actually Rare purple border class so they have player classes which may give more insight into how he can be countered.,ToME4,dg7f03r,3,t5_3201p
