2581031,0,t1_cmvgx87,Im wondering that too. Its not a bad show by any means. It was just incredibly overhyped. If they do continue on with a nd season they absolutely need to change the writers and add some depth into the characters. They pretty much wasted the acting skills of Kublai Khan by making him say cringey lines like I WILL BE EMPEROR OF THE WORLD. Might as well add a muahahaha at the end of that line. Everyone thinks Hundred Eyes is a cool character. I mean hes fun and all but hes basically a blind kung fu master... Thats it. He does kung fu and walks around saying mystical things. They introduced some backstory into Jia Sidao and went absolutely no where with it. They could have tried to humanize him. They could have tried to add depth and make the viewers feel some kind of empathy towards him by portraying his childhood as harsh and abusive. Nope. That flashback scene did almost nothing for the story. Hes just an evil scheming villain who hurts children and hates women. It tried to appeal to people who liked the political manipulations and drama of GOT while trying to keep the simpler viewers by having attractive basic ass one dimensional characters with incredibly bland dialogue. It also didnt help at all that a bunch of articles called it Netflixs Game of Thrones which was incredibly silly because the two shows are completely different.The only things that kept me going were the Kublai Khan character and his wife who are the only ones with actual depth. If the show continues Ill really enjoy seeing his downfall as accurately predicted by his viceregent.,MarcoPolo,cmvh7qw,18,t5_2y477

2741786,0,t1_cneo25x,If Kublai doesnt kill Yusuf hes seen as a weak man who allows traitors to survive. If he kills Marco he is seen as unjust since Yusuf has already confessed to the crimes. Yusuf really forced his hand. I think they try to show this as well when Kublai goes to play one more game but he has no moves to make since all his pieces are gone. ,MarcoPolo,cnfqa2l,10,t5_2y477

8158308,0,t1_d4whzax,Ill add to this by saying that Nayan was no doubt going back and forth throughout the Mongol Empire with an official document sanctioning his travel in addition to his large armed escort which logistically speaking in some cases can slow you down yet they were traveling through nothing but friendly territory the unified Mongol realm. The Polos had no such thing and as you suggest were bogged down in many places before reaching China. It did not take years plural to travel from China to the Mediterranean in those times although it did take seveal months the better part of a year. It was even quicker if you sailed through the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea instead of taking the arduous land route along the Silk Road.,MarcoPolo,d4xc4rl,2,t5_2y477

When Kublai asked her when is the last time she made the hard choice we as the audience know that shes been making them all along and not bothering her husband with it because that is her role as his wife. Shes also not an idiot she knows her son has been through many women and not had a child. Once is bad luck twice is unlikely three times  its the man yo. ,MarcoPolo,d55f6eb,10,t5_2y477
8229699,0,t3_4rzep9,Whats interesting to me are the completely different ways in which Kublai and Kaidu interpreted Genghiss mandate. For a supposed ruthless Khan Kublai is surprisingly tolerant of other peoples religions and cultures. He seems to be content letting those under his rule live how they wish and believe what they want provided they bend the knee obey his laws and keep those sweet sweet taxes rolling in. The problem according to Kaidu is that the assimilation of so many outside cultures into the Mongol empire threatens the traditional Mongol way of life. Kaidu wants to  keep Mongolia Mongolian. He doesnt see the point of wanton expansion if it will dilute and eventually extinguish the culture of the great Mongolian civilization Genghis worked so hard to promote. Kublai on the other hand kind of sees things the opposite way. Kublai reminds Kaidu that part of the mandate Genghis received from heaven was to spread Mongol culture and civilization to all the corners of the earth. To Kublai then theres no point in preserving the traditional Mongol way of life if theyre not going to expand the empire and bring that culture to the people they conquer.I think that Kublai is a lot less likable than Kaidu because hes the Khan. By virtue of his office he has to make all the hard choices not just for himself and his family but for the entire Mongol empire. Kaidu simply isnt faced with choices of that magnitude so there are a lot fewer opportunities for him to do something that would make him less likable. ,MarcoPolo,d569ouu,7,t5_2y477

8261205,0,t1_d5a5y21,To be honest even in thcentury Mongol society female warriors were still somewhat rare. Its perhaps comparable to other premodern nomadic peoples on the Eurasian steppe. For instance ancient Greek historians sometimes noted how the Sarmatians had female warriors within their ranks. Im not sure if ancient Han Chinese historians mention it but I wouldnt be surprised if the Mongols ancient predecessors the Xiongnu also had some female warriors and aristocratic women who engaged in melee. Although it was sometimes the subject of fictional literature throughout Chinese history there actually was a Tangdynasty Chinese princess who raised and commanded her own troops the Princess Pingyang    AD daughter of Emperor Gaozu of Tang.Sadly the th century is when some HanChinese in the Southern Song Empire and later conquered domains of the Yuan Empire of Kublai Khan began the practice of footbinding. The sporty outdoorsy plump aggressive horsebackpoloplaying women of the earlier Tang period were now giving way to much more docile and submissive feminine trends in Chinese society. That was largely to due with the conquest of parts of Northern China by foreigners even before the Mongols set foot there i.e. Tanguts Khitans and Jurchens. The Chinese saw it as a virtue for women to remain faithful to their culture and their lineages to go as far as committing suicide rather than being allowed or forced to marry a foreign conqueror and his soldiers. By the Ming Dynasty footbinding had become a solid cultural norm and it continued throughout the successive Qing Dynasty into the early th century! The process of stamping it out began with Chinese feminist movements of the late th century though inspired by Western standards of freedom and living for women.,MarcoPolo,d5a7iw4,2,t5_2y477

And heres why its rightIn episode SE he says while half delirious I watched hermomdie then she took me in her arms. It was a feeling of pure love. The then was many years later with the whore.Clearly childhood trauma had messed the young Ahmed up quite badly. Meeting a loving beautiful woman of his own people dredged suppressed memories and brought the broken child into the present.Add to that the fact that whore seemed too young to be his mother and this becomes the best reasoning.Now I have a question for you.
