Make sure you press every seam as you go and think about grading your seams cutting them down to avoid bulk in places like the shoulders underarms waist etc. I like your thinking with lacing up at the back although personally I think it could do with maybe double the amount of eyelets to avoid too many large gaps. Its probably a good idea to look up how to lace a corset as well so that you end up pulling the dress in at the waist rather than under the bum. Good attempt though  keep going!

But I have a theatre degree and used to be active in a local community theatre years ago before I shifted focus towards other things so I know a little about how hard it is for small theatres to source costumes.Another thing that might get you some business that you might not know about is called Live Action Role Play or LARP. Its sort like a mesh of role playing games mock fighting and cosplay. A lot of LARPers are DIY folks but there are many who want to play but dont have the interest or skill to learn sewing for costumemaking. Since you expressed interest in Wedding Dresses you might want to look into doing Feast Wear costuming. Sort of like formal costumes for big parties. Most LARPs are pretty fluid in the historyfantasy aspect so youd have a good flexibility of stuff available to use as source. I have a little bit of knowledge of the SCA but I know thats really heavy historical and some groups are really strict about costuming being historically accurate down to how its sewn. Theres also Dagorhir and Belegarth both are more fantasyoriented. I know some people still do WhiteWolf Vampire the Masquerade but Ive never been in that so Im not sure exactly how they do garb.

If you have a warranty center that you trust bring it there and they will check it over for free and if they dont ship it to us and Ill tell you whats going on with it.

If you dont want to spend money on new zips and who does? either visit your local second hand shop and see if they sell zips as sometimes they remove and sell the zips from clothes they cannot sell for one reason or another or the other thing you can do to save money is to unpick the zip each time you practice it and then use it again.  Obviously the zip will get a bit worn after a few times being sewn but it is all good practice.  Check out youtube vids for inserting zips.  Good luck.,sewing,cnle3mu,5,t5_2sczp

Theyre perfect for bobbins.Christmas ornament stand for the larger threads or threads that are cross wound and that do not fit on a machine or if the spool pin is missing.

I use these for patterns that way  I can flip through them easily and dont have to worry about tearing the envelopes or having the little pieces slide out and disappear. Since I have quite a few vintage patterns the paper can be fragile.Oh these pen holders can hold a lot of different things like seam rippers marking chalk and other stuff. Stick them where you can reach them. This is cool especially if youre losing your scissors or theyre always across the room. I use this and swap out my rotary cutter or scissors depending on my project.I also look for glass paperweights. I use them for holding down patterns. Usually at thrift stores theres a few.

If youre worried about messing up the fabric you could always select a similarly sized more familiar fabric to work with and get a bottle of blue dye and a paint brush. I suspect you could swing all of that at less than the cost of the overall tapestry and you could achieve the same effect. Sort of a onelooktwobudgets sort of approach.

4026168,0,t3_36mbkh,Hey there!First of all NOBODY fits the pattern straight out of the packet so you will need to make adjustments to make them fit you.  I can suggest a few things to help If you change size a lot look at patterns that are a for knit fabric which is stretchy or b has some sort of elasticated waist drawstrings etc etc.  You will want to google how to sew with knit fabric because its slightly different from sewing with a woven.  Look carefully at the bit that tells you what you need on each pattern Colette Moneta  specifies knits so this would give you that flexibility.  This skirt is an example of an elasticated waist that will accommodate size changes I know thats a skirt but I havent found other similar patterns in dresses  it gives you the right idea.   For the boobs you will want to look up full bust adjustment.  Find a tutorial for with something similar to what youre doing e.g. princess seams withwithout sleeves etc.  To find the pattern size use your high bust measurement and go by how big the actual pattern pieces are NOT the size on the back of the envelope.  Then you can adjust the bust to fit.  A muslin is a really good idea  all it is is a practice garment made out of cheaper fabric than youll use in the actual thing.  I really recommend doing it especially if you need to do a full bust adjustment.  You can use MEGA cheap fabric e.g. curtain lining fabric for wovens or nasty metre knit fabric from your local markets.  I hope that helps!,sewing,crf7o8w,11,t5_2sczp

Since the yoke is a unique shape careful sewing around the squared out areas. OR option  could be attempted   by cutting down the seam allowances to  after stitching yoke on then sew the bias tape on top dont stitch it to the facing.   Finish the edges of the facing and blind stitch it to the body to cover the seam allowances of the body.  ,sewing,cu4x5qj,2,t5_2sczp

In addition you should understitch it to help the lining turn to the inside and understitching is going to be difficult to achieve nicely on a curved French seam.  If youre really concerned about fraying I would recommend stitch and pink i.e. run a line of straight stitches down the seam allowance then use pinking shears to cut the edge.  ,sewing,cva45ia,2,t5_2sczp
5178226,0,t3_3lpuf6,My two centsYour butt looks great in these. Others are saying theyre a little too tight in the seat and maybe theyre correct if youre looking for a more traditional masculine fit which hides the rear. I debated for a while whether or not to tell another guy I dont know that his ass looks nice. My friends are used to comments like that and youre asking for fitrelated feedback. Unless these jeans are uncomfortable for you dont go letting out the seat. In the same area I think the back pockets should be a bit shorter inches shorter. You could remove them and gauge length by folding down the top and basting until you get them perfect. Thats a personal preference though. On mobile now too so this part might be bad advice when the jeans are on. The front pockets dont lay flat against the fronts in that detail pic. Thats a nitpicking detail that only someone looking for imperfections is going to notice and call out. Id have to look again to see if it smoothes out when you put them on. Overall you have good advice from others already so use it as you see fit. Understand though that youve made a pair of jeans that fit better than most rtw and are a oneofakind pair that look great. You should wear these with pride. Ive had some oz raw selveged in my stash for over a year and have been putting off making my first pair. I finally ordered rivets and buttons from Taylor Tailor so Im drafting a pattern now. Im making muslins of a couple commercial patterns and my selfdrafted one.

5202116,0,t1_cvczbnj,I guess it depends on how loose the weave is and how much it will be touching your skin vs. the slip.  I just wouldnt want to party all night in an itchy dress!  For something like this you could get away with an exposed zipper.  I would baste your seam closed first before installing it.  You may be able to get away with a small zigzag stitch to help prevent excess fraying.  Michaels doesnt have a sewing section but Joanns carries lots of patterns.

Your typical pair of yoga pants got cut out s at a go. The machines that will be sewing them are set up just to deal with those fabrics. And the people performing the step perform the same step s of times on the same sized product in a row this lets them be faster and more efficient. Lets assume that you not only have a website but patterns that are able to be graded to those measurements and the tech to do it automatically and prep the file for print. You now need to prep and cut each pattern this is going to add significant cost.You need to assemble them if there is thread or material change your going to need to adjust every step in production. Finally you need to inspect package and ship each item this is different than what most industrial setups doFor off the rack clothing most places target  for cost of good sold. This would cover materials manufacturing and some times shipping to your point of distribution and taxes associated with that delivery. For MTM thats a very different number with labor being the most expensive number.

5603135,0,t3_3ruxwb,There are a couple of problems you could run into with over dyeing. First only the natural fibre in the garment will take up the dye. This includes the thread which is typically polyester in commercially made garments. If theres any top stitching on the garment it will remain green. Second garments worn next to the skin pick up body oil that will inhibit the dye in that area of the garment. So the garment will take up less dye in those areas and the results will be patchy. tldr Over dyeing commercially made clothing thats been worn is a risky business ultimately not worth the effort.,sewing,cwrmfkg,3,t5_2sczp

I like to calculate about  per hour for nonstressful items. Something like a fittedtailored jacket I would charge more for. Some Googling shows me that on etsy car seat ponchos sell for  depending on how intricate they are. Using all those factors as a guide and without seeing the garment I would say that  is probably fair to cover your supplies and time.I hope she likes it!,sewing,cxn6q2c,6,t5_2sczp

I belong to a climbing gym the day pass costs  but the couples membership I share with my fiance is  per month. We go about  times a week so about  times per month. Spending that much on a day pass for that many visits would be difficult and would equate to us not climbing at the gym.

A few are wonderful.  I have continued because I want to learn and improve.  Most people I know who sew are pretty hard on themselves. When Ive had my work reviewed and graded point by point the impulse almost always was to help me improve not to upset me and my work was whatever my work was.Im not to going to claim that Ive loved sewing every class project but usually it was clear why skills were taught in a certain sequence  why you started out learning how to sew seams and then a skirt before doing a more complex blouse why you start with cotton wovens before moving on to corduroy and wool etc.Im not from the sewing world either.

In part with that costume Jeri Ryan is not just wearing the corset underneath for Borg sexiness  she is wearing a fullon catsuit between the corset and the lurex. Partly to smooth lumps and bumps lurex is unforgiving if you have cellulite and partly because lurex can be a bit slippery. Wash  warm or cold water  before cutting or working with it. Im not sure why but almost all lurex I have ever worked with has a weird smell to it from the factory.OK. Your lurex is clean and you are ready to cut. What now?You need to IRON this stuff on low heat using a cornstarch spray so that the edges dont curl as you cut WITH an ironing mat. Grab a powerful spray bottle from a hair supply store. Make this mix  tablespoon of pure cornstarch  cups of water. Shake that up and hang onto it near the ironing board.  Buy an ironing mat. Preferably the kind with the nearvelvet texture on one side.  Here is your ironing technique SPRAY SPRAY SPRAY the lurex with the cornstarch mix LAY LAY LAY the ironing mat over the lurex and WAIT WAIT WAIT for about  seconds  while you PRESS firm onoff motion not a sliding motion with the iron the lurex on LOW LOW heat. The metallic threads will melt if you go too high with the heat.OK brave soul. March on and get your lurex catsuit going! Seriously this should be your rSewingChallenge.,sewing,cz093x5,14,t5_2sczp

Sewbaste stable depending on whether you want stitching to be permanentdoesnt have to be. . Put twisted rectangles on. sew sideseams on rectangles for short distance just under arm. Measure distance between straps pythagorean theorem using  distance of straps as a and full length neck to cleavage as b. Calculate c.. Measure down C from center of shoulder twist.

On left side RIGHT side from inside out end sideseam just below hip.. Done with pattern makinginitial sewing. Line for added weight and hem. Can remove basting once lined because lining will hold the twist steady. May need alteration to make it fit closely enough in some places.B. Uses patterns but may look less like image. Requires modifying patterns Merge bikini top with tie and maxi skirt patterns. Sew pattern muslins. Put on. Attach bikini ties to top of skirt. cutremove. Cut all seams. Use muslin with attached bikini ties to skirt as pattern. C. Slightly harder because it may require more than  hands and may require some pattern drafting skill. Will look most like image.

My area of expertise comes from mainly things like activewear panties booty shorts etc so take what I tell you with a grain of salt. It looks as if this pattern comes from draping not flat pattern. Im not saying its impossible to come up with a pattern for this from a sloper Im just saying that more then likely it would be easier to develop a pattern from draping for this type of thing. Its got a cascading tiered skirt with perhaps a petticoat of some sort underneath. The top is a sweetheart neckline corset most likely. In bridal wear these days I hear there is lots of use of plastic bones. Alternatively you could look up a pattern with a similar skirt and just insert a sweetheart neckline corset in to one of these. Basically youre swapping out the top. However do try the muslin first especially if your fabric is expensive. ,sewing,d148g6q,7,t5_2sczp

A metre of patterned cotton was around  and I needed ... Not happening. Instead I went to the charity shop I guess like a thrift store but theyre quite small here and brought a maxi skirt tbf it might have been a tube dress a high waisted skirt and and an awesome  piece top and skirt that is  sizes too big for about .

7253172,0,t3_4ep0bb,I made a shirt for a friend a couple weeks ago. It has a lace top but I made it with cotton sleeves. After she tried it on she begged me to make lace sleeves instead. No problem! I unpicked the cotton sleeves cut lace sleeves and painstakingly attached one. My first clue should have been how difficult it was to attach but when I finished I pulled it rightsideout and discovered I had attached the sleeve hem to the shoulder. After painstakingly unpicking lace from lace I tried again. This time it went on without a problem. When I pulled the sleeve out I discovered that I had sewn wrong side to right side and the lace seam allowance was showing on the outside of the shirt.I unpicked that darn lace sleeve once again and then I decided my friend was getting a sleeveless top.

The women lived all over the country so I had to rely on the measurements they sent me. Every dress had a fitted cummerbund waist and in my navet I tailored them exactly to the provided measurements and provided for no adjustment options. On the eve of the wedding we had first and final fittings. Not one of the waistbands fit and some were off by nearly six inches. What followed was one of the most stressful sleepless nights of my life. Everything fit perfectly by wedding time but I had learned a valuable lesson if no prior fittings are possible always tailor the garment for generous lastminute adjustment options. ,sewing,d247oyv,8,t5_2sczp

For instance I got a cotton blend for a knit shirt and I dont think its strong enough. The more visual it is the better it is for me.

7824083,0,t3_4mgj3z,When I first started sewing on my SE I thought this double needle stuff will allow me to easily French seam some leather seat tops together and Ill be awesome! A lot of failed attempts later just trying to go through two rather thin layers of leather my delusions of grandeur died. I couldnt get the home machine to consistently stitch properly I easily wasted  bucks in leather just messing around. I could get things to work but what I thought was capable and what was reality capable with twin needles on a home sewing machine there was a huge gap. Im not even sure I got my two lines to look as good as yours.With my rudimentary knowledge I think the biggest issue is putting the two threads through the same tension disk I was using the largest upholstery thread that I could get through the needles so my problem was even worse since the thread was thicker. Maybe going with a thinner thread to help keep both lines in check as you sew that might help with your uneven tension issues? I wouldnt adjust the bobbin tension unless you are comfortable with that process to get it back to normal.Hopefully somebody comes in with a better success story and some good tips on how to get this to fly right. The way I fixed my issue is I bought a walking foot attachment that has a guide on the left side of the foot that I drop into the groove and it keeps the space consistent even on curves and odd angles. Works great. Good luck!,sewing,d3vhs89,1,t5_2sczp

8344684,0,t3_4tve2f,Hehe. Nice idea. But it may be a bit more complex than cutting down the middle. First thing do these Shirts come with attached collars and hems? It so carefully detach them. Take a good look at how they were attached. Youll probably wont be able to replicate it completely but youll come close. You got the right idea with not cutting down straight at the center line. But an inch is way too much. The usual measure for seam allowance is something like cm. Sweatshirt fabric usually doesnt fray much but is stretchy. So sew with an elastic stitch or a wobbly straight stitch increased stitch length very slight zigzag. For the collar and the hem cut them the same way. Dont forget the seam allowance. Reattach them. Try to make your seams line up. Its a bit hard to describe the whole thing in just words. But if youve got any questions feel free to ask.,sewing,d5kn133,3,t5_2sczp

They broke down the material rates since this was for yarn work they would write out how many yardsmeters of yarn is needed what type of yarn and the cost. Then theyd mention the time needed for them to pick up the yarn maybe add on a few dollars to your rate if it takes you say  minutes to get in and out of a fabric store. Then theyd estimate how many hours is needed to plan out the project make measurements etc. Then include how many actual hours is spent on the project. Multiply that by their hourly rate and mention that their hourly rate will be higher than minimum wage of course and include the cost of their experience and expertise of the craft in that wage. For example you wouldnt hire a doctor for  nor would you pay a tailor or a blacksmith  an hour. So some people will bill their time crochetingknitting for  or  an hour. Then add up the time spent and if you write that math out for them and they see the final number they may balk because they dont understand that this isnt something that is churned out in a factory with cheap materials cookie cutter methods and Chinese child labor. Or you can demand they do something for YOU that theyre good at. For example if they say you MUST make me one of these !

8964369,0,t3_52ys1t,You should know that even at the highest levels of professional sewing couture and bespoke tailoring the sewing machine is still used for things like major seams. Those fields have highly talented people with often decades of hand sewing experience but they havent completely dispensed with the machine because machine stitching is strong and fast.You can sew many things by hand. It will be slowgoing. Hand sewing is not really suitable for sportswear.  I would stick to clothing that does not require the stitches to show. I would also work on learning how to use a sewing machine.The backstitch is the strongest stitch and used for major seams.  Other common stitches likely to be used are the running stitch the catchstitch aka the cross stitch the pick stitch the prick stitch and the fell stitch.As an experiment I once sewed an entire simple shift dress by hand except for some stay stitching in the neckline.  I basted underlining to it used the backstitch on the major seams hand overcast the seam allowances slip stitched bias strips to finish the neckline and armscyes.  I catchstitched the hem.  It took forever and it looks good and has held up pretty well but I think that a machinestitched dress would have lasted longer. I only hand washed it.,sewing,d7pdrru,2,t5_2sczp

10613313,0,t3_5rv9kk, Tracing the pattern on the fabric with chalk is more precise than pinning the pattern to the fabric. Dont lift the shears from the table when cutting. Basting controls the fabric. Compare basted darts to ensure theyre symmetrical before sewing by machine.Its better to demonstrate say three steps and have the class do it than to do  steps.  If you do too much people will get lost.  Machine exercises done on paper without thread are helpful.  Then students can sew lines mazes and arcs using only the presser foot as a guide.,sewing,ddaokrw,5,t5_2sczp

10668701,0,t3_5seb9v,I recommend something simple such as a tank top or camisole. Simple doesnt mean plain  Here are some camisoles made with silk. With your lively print you dont lace.Make sure you use the correct size of needle and make sure its new.  A dull needle makes a nasty click click noise when it goes through the fabric.Im not sure the gelatin tip for stabilizing works with polyester.  Instead you can place the fabric between layers of tissue paper pin the pattern on top and cut out the pieces.  Theres also the nuclear option of lightly ironing freezer paper to the fabric tracing the pattern and cutting.To sew if the fabric falls into the feed dog well you may want to place a light sheet of paper underneath the layers.  It can be torn away later.  I think some people use paper tape.  It helps to hand baste pieces together.  Some people like to use a walking foot.Finally while I of course realize that cost can be a factor I would try to work with natural fibers like silk in the future.  Youre putting a lot of work and time into this and might as well end up with something of the highest quality. Synthetics are often harder to work with.,sewing,ddge94n,2,t5_2sczp

11565726,0,t3_652o0f,This skirt is actually  years in the making. I originally was trying to make a dress for a wedding in may  the top is yet to come  I decided to make these into a two piece dress because I no longer have use for such a formal dress. I probably started this in January . But I got bogged down with depression and I did not sew very much in late  and most of  still did but just simple things.This was a draping exercise I did in order to mimic a Lanvin dress I saw onlineI originally tried to do the draping of the skirt on a smaller dressform but when I scaled it up to fit me the back was draping across the butt because her butt was much flatter than mine. This led me to purchase the uniquely you dress form which only was the most boring and painful process of this whole experience. Beyond getting the shape correct before translating it into a pattern this was pretty easy. Even if you havent made your own patterns before Id say this is doable foie am intermediate sewer. Its just lots of pleats.This is a silk fabric that Im pretty sure is hammered one of my favorites. But it didnt say at the small shop I got it from Edit I know its a bit late to be showing this as I am adding this over  hours later but for anyone ever coming back here heres part of my process and my draping that I did I use a much springier fabric for the top which i kind of regret. It doesnt lay as well as the chiffon I used for the skirt. I would definitely keep that in mind when designing a draping product use scrap pieces of fabric that will be similar to your final fabric. ,sewing,dg6zaty,34,t5_2sczp

11688573,0,t1_dgku0a1,Oh my theres just so much in the world. A vintage zigzagger would fit the bill phenomenally. There are tons of them. Brands like Singer Kenmore Pfaff Necchi Elna are good and there are others. Your best bet would be to figure out what you want your machine to do and keep an eye out for one that fills those needs. A big thing for me is being able to adjust the presser foot pressure Thats pretty standard on vintage machines but only really found on higher end modern ones. A free arm is super helpful for sewing things like sleeve cuffs but not essential. Most machines you find will fit your needs. When you see one just run through a check list see if its in good shape the malepatternboldness article I linked earlier is great for this. I bring a few bobbins needles some thread and a scrap of fabric with me when I go to the thrift store. Unless its a steal price wise or its love at first sight I dont bother with machines that wont sew ok in the store. If it were me as evidenced by the fact that I currently have  sewing machines in the house Id probably just get the  anyway and figure Ill find a zigzag later. This advice may not be the best for your or my budget though. I feel like this is all more confusing than helpful. Are you just desperate to start sewing right away? Then maybe jump on this. Are you feeling patient? Then maybe wait it out. The best machine is the one you will use. ,sewing,dgkx1ln,1,t5_2sczp

While those are definitely stains that can be treated Im wary to give you any advice since I dont know anything about washing vintage fabrics. Since you really dont want to give up on the dress take it to a seamstress and ask about the tear AND the stains.,sewing,dgl84as,2,t5_2sczp

11781850,0,t3_6841zz,Natural fibers are breathable. Synthetic fibers are not and will make you look like a sweaty mess. Typical hot weather natural fibers are cotton linen and rayon technically a semisynthetic but it does breathe. There are some new athletic synthetics that arguably breathe but you are not asking about athletic wear.Loose weaves breathe better than tight weaves. Knits can be clingy and gross or wonderfully airy. Textured fabrics e.g. slub linen seersucker stand further away from the body so are better for airflow smooth drapey things e.g. satin can cling and with sweat cling awfully. Stretch fabrics can cling plus elastane is synthetic and doesnt breathe at all. Use your experience with manufactured clothes to guide you here.,sewing,dgvie8g,6,t5_2sczp
