Youre pretty much guaranteed to not win on a map that doesnt have at least one or two cities within reach of your first turn.Depends if you have plenty of ports you could be cranking out strong armies each turn from your capital. The AI is really unprepared for this Ive found because its really reluctant to sacrifice any given army to kill a strong one at least when not taking a city.

Re dark comedy Im more of a dark comedy writer than a horror writer so thats probably just an inevitable consequence of my faculties.Im trying to grapple with the dichotomy of having more detail and more choices while still keeping them to use the branding bitesized. The next two that I have written are still very much on rails so to speak in that they use the interactive element more as a technique to engender investment from the reader than as a way to alter the outcome.Honestly Im not a huge fan of playing IF games where you have to search for the emotionally satisfying outcome especially when the game starts with you waking up in the morning.

Alliances can be made and diplomacy is a large factor for safety and resources. Sometimes war can break out between between alliances with hundreds of people.The community is very nice and are not generally toxic with an exception of a few people however there are pirates who terrorize weaker alliances. However without pirates there would be literally periods where barely anything happens.This game is like  grind and it takes a few months at least to get to a level where you can actually do anything Ive been playing for a year and there are still people  times more powerful than me.,WebGames,cukszrf,1,t5_2qhoa

5993889,0,t3_3xh8qe,I dont normally give games on here more than ten minutes but I have been playing this game ALL DAY.  Id keep playing but Ive gotten to a point where I cant proceed without pumping a LOT of oil and that requires just a staggering amount of infrastructure. I had to admit to myself that I was not prepared to put that much more work in just to start producing the next product. I could easily have played another couple of hours Ive been at it on and off for at least twelve and it was running the entire time if it was easier to upgrade the oil wells without needing a fuckton more energy each time just for a incremental amount more oil coming in when I need to sustain multiple times that to start producing something with it. It was also sorta frustrating having to sit there staring at that deep water for hours on end without having the capability to reach out to it but I did it. And when I got there I was further disappointed when I realized that because I had to run pipes to transport the oil to the reservoir on the shore PLUS run cable out to the oil pumps to provide them energy I couldnt even utilize much more than half of the deep water oil fields. To do so would have required again a ridiculous amount of increasingly expensive infrastructure maybe tone that down a bit too?.I dont want anyone to take all this as gripes about the game  I played this game all goddamn day and loved it. Ive thought harder about this than I have some major retail games  despite the fact that there is zero story or characters of any kind. Youre just designing an ideal resource collection empire where you dont have to worry about money or taxes or garbage collection or area beautification or pollution taxes invasion fuck all. The graphics arent compelling but I like them. They serve their purpose beautifully and I was able to clearly distinguish everything particularly when I enabled the option to display the upgrade level of all my buildings. This is an awesome feature and is absolutely vital once your plan gets beyond a certain size and complexity. Id recommend it be enabled by default to aid players who might not normally venture into the options panel.Whoevers developing this thank you. It has a simplicity originality and playability I really like. I hope you continue to update this and add things and simplify things  I could probably rant on and I hope you eventually make some money off it. I dont play a particularly large number of webgames anymore although I used to regularly spend hours on sites such as Kongregate many years ago and so I am unaware if this is completely derivative of something that was popular during a week where I wasnt paying attention which could have been anytime after tower defense games came to dominate browser gamingNinja edit  AND the save function works.

7900796,0,t3_4nff5b,That link is pretty broken! why not just reference the real url? About balancing etcWe just released the game so it does need alot of balancing. We plan on adding more teamrelated gamemodes. and when we have more players we will group them by skill level.  However We never closed the URL while developing the game so the game actually leaked before we were ready for release! So currently we are very busy optimizing the game and making sure the servers dont die on us! When we have peace in mind about this we will shift our focus and make the game better!,WebGames,d444gnb,5,t5_2qhoa

Use freeze to walk past frontlines for every army with defenders or ranged. Isolate last province save up about k and make sure you have lots of green giants day   etc you should be popping at least  per  after day . Make sure the  alien landing points have  sniper   samurai wreck the final territory. If you dont remember where those landing points are save before attacking the last japanese province. Reload afterward and fortify. After you pop the aliens run at the islands. Hold with both the snipers and the samurai but moving the sam marker running the sams up to the alien cogs. As they reach the melee enemies cast freeze strat and move past to the ranged. Leave the samarai there and at will them to chop it up. At will the snipers. If there is a revive cast Hold the samurai again to spread them out briefly to make sure the ranged get chopped a bit if not wiped out again. Restock the beachhead and the launching province after the battle and add defense cannons. Now you can get together your giants on a launching province about . You keep suiciding the islands at the boss to keep the forces worn down they keep regenerating then attack you. Once you lose all your sams retreat your snipers after the melee finally get to them and have done some damage to the forces leaving maybe  after a fight which should all be melee and those falling weak sparks and the boss move the giants up to an island with sniper and sam support. Now burn down the boss forces again with  islands worth then attack with the giant force and use speed instead of freeze. Now you should see the boss fall.,WebGames,d8bi16z,1,t5_2qhoa

The elf gives you speed which youll need on some of the single player maps like the various demon portals the human will have versatility with passing extra movesblocksattacks to the war and the dwarf has the HP to stay alive.Youll probably end up with three of every classrace combination if you play long enough.Single player is tough in places until you drop a good mix of items but the AI is moderately exploitable i.e. if you protect a front line character with Impenetrable Nimbus makes them invulnerable for a turn as long as the attachment isnt purged or pushed off the AI will happily smack down on them for the entire turn.,WebGames,dde990p,5,t5_2qhoa
