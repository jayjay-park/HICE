1223066,0,t1_ci77kfd,Oh... I just read Grant. Makes sense now. In the future police that obtain evidence through warrantless requests to ISP would be demonstrating willful and flagrant disregard for the charter so it would swing the Grant test towards nonadmission of the evidence.,LawCanada,ci77ox5,2,t5_2s60x

2573679,0,t3_2p7ld7,I agree with the comments that it is a lot better here and worth going if such a career interests you and youre willing to work hard at school.A couple of things to keep in mind though on the negative side. Law school is a lot cheaper here than the US but it is still really expensive. I am about . years out and a lot of my year including myself are still paying back student loans. This sucks when you are getting into your late s and early s and watching your friends buy houses.  You might have difficulty getting a job in the GTA unless you have average or slightly above average grades. If you suck at interviews this could be true regardless. A lot of law jobs require you to work absurd hours. ,LawCanada,cmuinjg,3,t5_2s60x

9360913,0,t3_58qo8r,You dont NEED an undergrad degree but its very difficult to get into most schools without one. UManitoba takes a bunch of kids every year with  undergrad years. Many schools take zero. But to apply with zero undergraduate credits might be a bridge too far.Law school outside Canada will be an option but your odds of making it work are much much lower than if you go here. Pass rates for the Ontario bar exam for internationally educated law students are something like  while they are  for Canadian students. It will be harder to get work and you will not have a network of Canadian law students to make use of as your career advances. It also costs much much more. So you pay more and get lower odds of success. Although being  is not a dealbreaker it should rightly make you a little more riskaverse.Dont know anything about paralegals.Source went to law school at  and now Articling in TO with buncha kids.,LawCanada,d92kago,3,t5_2s60x

9844952,0,t3_5g7hcc,Dicksons majority got it right. Reasonable limit.Without access to WestlawQuicklaw I suggest looking on Google Scholar I just did a quick search and saw there are textsarticles about the Keegstra case like this one about the first trial search CanLII for cases citing the Keegstra decision and also the Charter s. b and lastly go to a library preferably a lawuniversity library or a court library to look for books on freedom of expression in Canada any book published about or relevant to Keegstra would likely be in the same section.Freedom of speech in the US is much broader because of the absence of an equivalent to our Charter s.  As such you may find American commentaries supportive of the Keegstra dissent for instance this paper from a University of Windsor professor comparing Canada and the US this paper by a Columbia University professor.EDIT the Windsor professors article cited above is probably what you are looking for Moon R. .

11317849,0,t3_61ix2g,The SCC basically said in Ford v Quebec that as long as  is used in the correct form by the legislature it applies. The bigger issue would be whether or not any other part of the constitution could make such a law illegal. For example you could maybe take a run at it with section though its a stretch. Section  only suspends section  and . You could also go at it with a  approach and argue that such a law isnt a proper use of the criminal law power and thus ultra vires of the federal parliament. Take a look at the discussion in R v Malmo Levine about what constitutes a proper use of the criminal law power.Politically and publicly accepted is a different matter entirely. Keep in mind that  only applies for a period of  years meaning a government is forced to face the people in an election before its renewed. The federal government has never used  and only the feds can create criminal law.,LawCanada,dfeuyep,6,t5_2s60x

11394954,0,t1_dfnkfbc,The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario hears and resolves cases brought under the OHRC the code not the commission and does award costs and damages General and Special Damages. My mistake  I meant the tribunal. There is probably a separate avenue to pursue this via a civil suit. And thanks for your thoughts on the letterwriters culpability. I think its a valid point though it would be much more difficult to pursue than those who actually made the decision to discriminate. As an aside I would love to see this practice banned or otherwise made illegal. People with different family status religions sex sexual orientation etc... shouldnt be provided any advantages or disadvantages when dealing with housing whether buying or renting. If you decide to engage in a public offering process it should be completely blind. This has real implications for people who fall into one of the protected groups. ,LawCanada,dfnlp38,3,t5_2s60x

11649120,0,t3_665c80, days and  years ago my son was born second child for my wife and I.Because I was snipped it just made sense that my son would be too.Except my wife wanted to know why other than cause you can matchI have made detailed spreadsheets about our wireless plans comparing providers or numerous other purchasing decisions but cut my sons foreskin off? Nope.  No homework.So I did some research and couldnt come to a decision for the procedure.   As my wife said my son got a stay of execution.Are.there some.medical benefits?  Cleanliness STDs Cancer.... sure. Is there risk not.doing it? Sure.  What about having to having it done when you are older?  What if your son gets something that could have been prevented ages ago.I cant remember why I decided on no.  I looked up religious grounds but my faith doesnt require it.  I looked at the medical.evidence for.it.and wasnt sold.Should the practice be outlawed?  Well the Jews will have a problem with that.Are there lasting psychological scars as a result.of the procedure?  Maybe. Probably.  I would rather there be a process where you have to have at least done some homework as a parent or require it for religious grounds.  Otherwise it crosses into thenkine of mutilation.,LawCanada,dggfx0g,3,t5_2s60x
