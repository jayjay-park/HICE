5973971,0,t1_cy207ca,Speccy revealed my CPU was running at C. Nearly boiling point. I dont understand how as I just installed a new CPU fan when I got this CPU a few weeks ago with new thermal paste but I believe it. I knew something was off with the CPU.I dont understand why my PC didnt auto shut down with temps that high like it did when I first got it and the fan wasnt working. I opened the case and pointed two high powered fans at it and now it works like a charm although stressed temp while gaming is still C?! I dont get it. Either way Ill reapply thermal paste and take a look at BIOS settings for the fan. Thanks for your help. ,Nvidiahelp,cy2pvzp,1,t5_3a65w

6909583,0,t1_d0zf8kg,I would recommend using software like MSI Afterburner to monitor temperatures. Once you have it downloaded and installed open the settings and then the Monitoring tab. Youll want to make sure GPU Temperature and CPU Temperature are both checked you can actually check each individual CPU cores temperature if you prefer.Inside this tab you can also set each monitor to display in an onscreen display look at the bottom of the box for the option and tick the box.Then start your game and monitor the readings.,Nvidiahelp,d0zis3q,1,t5_3a65w

It will also disable automatic video driver downloads from Windows Update to solve your regression issue.Also make sure your video cable is connected to the back of the video card and not in the back of the motherboard which is a common mistake causing the system to run off integrated graphics.,Nvidiahelp,d1zkcw0,1,t5_3a65w

The first solution I had was to turn off vsync for those applications and this worked but was annoying.  The second solution I had was to disable vsync globally under nvidia control panel and I set preferred refresh rate to highest available. I hope this works for you.

If for some reason you do run into an issue then it may be possible that you need to run DDU which simply removes all parts of the driver so that it can be reinstalled.
