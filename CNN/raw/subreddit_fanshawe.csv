6166735,0,t3_400zm5,I graduated the CPA in  I highly recommend Fanshaw. I got a job out of my coop and havent been unemployed since. My current place found me on LinkedIn and have been there for . years. The course is hard but far from impossible its worth it! Feel free to ask me any specific questions you have. Ill try to answer them when I get off work. ,fanshawe,cyqldyb,6,t5_2svbv
6168250,0,t3_400zm5,I graduated in . Its a VERY challenging course often considered the most challenging offered by Fanshawe but its very well regarded by many employers in Ontario. Its definitely recognized above Conestoga. There are a lot of employers in Ontario that only hire Fanshawe CPAU of WaterlooU of Windsor grads. Fanshawe does well to always adjust the course offerings in line with what area employers need. Youll have no problem whatsoever finding a job. There is a game dev course and some other postgrad options  theyre always adding more but I honestly wouldnt even consider that until I was in my final year of CPA and youve had some experience  you may find its nothing like what you expect or enjoy just because youre a gamer. Its very heavy on math and highlevel programming. I usually volunteer at open houses and I find a lot of people come in asking about game dev postgrad with some serious misconceptions about what the program actually is. Many people either change their mind and take an easier course drop out or end up employed before they graduate CPA. Its quite a journey to get to a point where you can consider applying for Game Dev. I myself found that CPA was above what I enjoyed doing and I went into web development instead. Really if I wasnt so stubborn I should have taken the web dev option instead of staying in CPA. Most of my coworkers also took CPA. The other nice thing about Fanshawes IT program is that all programs share a common first year so if you decide youd rather do web or the networking side you can easily switch to another program within IT with no time or credits lost. Definitely not something to discount more people do it than youd expect. But yeah if it comes down to Fanshawe or Conestoga CPA Id definitely choose Fanshawe.,fanshawe,cyqrlct,2,t5_2svbv
