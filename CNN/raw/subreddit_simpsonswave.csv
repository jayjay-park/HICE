11062408,0,t3_5u93z4,Youtube VHS static video. Download any of the videos. Overlay it on top of your simpsonwave clips. You could also just make a picture with gray static lines and overlay that too.Also if on premiere just mess around with settings and the RGB a bunch to get desired look. it doesnt have to be perfect by any means. Thats all I did really for this video hereFYI tho just be prepared for people to poop all over your vid like a few commenters did to mine. lol,simpsonswave,delwmen,1,t5_3e2g7
