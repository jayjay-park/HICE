1549284,0,t3_2bmedm,Just build a giant group of friends in your classes. These connections are going to last you your entire time at tech. Also avoid Shibikov. or whatever his name is supposed to be. Hes russian angry will belittle you and thinks you are supposed to know everything already. He isnt helpful and his exams will kill you. Take Dr. Boshart for any computer classes above intro. For intro he kinda makes things really hard but for data structures though he will drill into your head the things you need. Dont get discouraged if you get below a C in any of his classes. Hes hard but he will teach you. Trust me. Also if you are the guy I think you are I may have seen you play CSGO. In that case just contact me on steam for more information. ,tntech,cjah5ku,1,t5_2sfh9
