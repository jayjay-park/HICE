5905782,0,t3_3ul6eo,I just bought the A. It has audio outputs K transcoding and better encryption capabilities. From what I saw it seemed better than the . With the faster clock speed the  should be slightly faster. Heres a discussion that influenced my decision. The  might only be able to do K transcoding offline. Other than that I figure a lot of these models  A  Pro are too similar to matter much. With  HDMI ports it seems like the A could be a better media center...but you have to go to the A to get the fancy LCD screen.,qnap,cxts59u,1,t5_2trle
6039180,0,t1_cyazhwx,Thank you for the detailed response! I am disappointed to hear that I loved the flexibility that the drive extender in WHS had.. Though I had TB of storage only about GB of that was critical stuff that needed fault tolerance and I didnt have to think about how I juggled the drives. Just jammed them in and in the console selected my important data to be redundant.Based on what you told me Im debating just buying two more TB drives. My TB drives are very mismatched right now one is a WD Red the other a WD DVR drive and I can imagine weird performance coming out of that. If I did this xTB WD Red in RAID would I be able to eventually add another disk without reformatting?A bit of a nuisance that I have to format it all over again after just getting it set up!,qnap,cyb8y3s,1,t5_2trle

9443209,0,t3_5a0anl,Should be able to do it via vm station no worries. I am almost certain the vm would be able to see the USB dvd drive if you connected it to the host nas.,qnap,d9czsda,1,t5_2trle
10047364,0,t1_dbh3c5d,Thanks for the insight. I glanced at them but was hoping to have SSD drives like the other. I missed that it has M. ports internally which make it a decent option. I just wish it had a built in SFP for the price it is going to be.  I dont need the remote or hdmi posts.,qnap,dbh744l,1,t5_2trle
10212103,0,t1_dc1eb5i,From what ive read RAID only becomes superior at the  drive mark for  drives its inferior to  and .,qnap,dc1llec,1,t5_2trle
10287005,0,t3_5mwne1,Okay have managed to answer my own question.  A reboot fixed it...  Like all the best IT problems  turn it off and on again!,qnap,dca36wa,1,t5_2trle
11393593,0,t1_dfmvevf,Aaaand Im back to square one. Turned it on this morning hoping to reach the screen I got after the reset yesterday but noooope. Boot loop. Fun. Im going to try to get back to that point at the very least. That step lets me access the NAS from Qfinder and would let me try to reinstall the firmware again. Beyond that I guess Im just waiting for QNAP to email me back.,qnap,dfng4mf,1,t5_2trle
11482668,0,t3_63wmz7,Just tested on my box if you havent patched to .. and you have port  forwarded to your nas anybody can run any command they want on your NAS as root.This could include stealing all of your data or holding it all for ransom.,qnap,dfxk3vy,3,t5_2trle

11575002,0,t3_6575bh,Connecting to the router will work fine. Im not sure about connecting directly to the qnap though. Id imagine no because usually devices like routers are the ones responsible for leasing IP addresses. It doesnt hurt to try though.,qnap,dg816k2,2,t5_2trle
