8739034,0,t3_4zq4u5,I also work in the IT security industry. I think the problem is that this is a project created by one person That would be Seb. He is always on top of things and I have not heard from anyone else and he does have to make ends meet. I have no knowledge on the finances of the site or whether he gets any help but I would think it is more a project out of interest.The payment for coaches advice if you click on ask a pro does not lead to a payments page. I would imagine it eventually goes to paypal or something like that and that would be secure. We dont want the website to deal with transactions in any way as that would be very troublesome.To fix the mentioned problem he would obviously need an SSL certificate for his domain I dont think there is a way around that. Comodo SSL is what I would recommend and is priced reasonably in relative terms. We are still talking year and that is on a summer sale.So yes I agree with your concern and Seb should make a donation page.,zerotoheroes,d6y12al,1,t5_39szt

8968430,0,t1_d7pt91j,All on a phone?  Wow... thats keen.  Kudos!  And thanks for getting back on this one so quickly.gt  attack minions are practically useless they dont even trade with s! Youre just going to end up killing one health minions with them I then read your reasoning. Actually thats all true.  If it werent for the Shattered Sun Clerics in the deck the s would be problematic  imagine sending them up against Acolyte of Pain or Northshire Cleric without the SSC buff!However aside of those its mostly s Flame Imp Sorcerers Apprentice etc. and the odd other  e.g. Beckoner of Evil that I find them going up against these days.  s are also good for knocking down totems killing knife jugglers especially post nerf bumping Argent Squires and Possessed Villagers trade well with s such as Fiery Bat etc.  Just seems to suit the current meta.gt Ive found that its too hard to pull of a good warlord compared to a good gurubashi Ive with razorfenWell this was the one I was least sure about so I expect Id be easy to convince.  I have trouble getting the Gurubashi to work for me fast enough because its got such a low attack for a drop unless youre prepared to spend  of your  mana the following turn to ping it with hero power.  But maybe its just how Im playing it?  Whats your typical tactic?I agree that if I do ditch the Frostwolf in preference for the Gurubashi Id probably switch Razorfen gt Ironfur as well though. gt gt My current thinking is just to give up on the problematic drop slot altogether thus losing the Frostwolf Warlords in my case but what are your views? This would have the added benefit of making the deck slightly faster overall which would be good given the aforementioned  and drop issue above. However as Id still be short of s and s opinion me is this likely to cause me problems on turn ?gt And thats one reason why I suck at making decks from scratch. That decision requires a lot of play testing and will change the deck somewhat significantly Ive made a start on playtesting precisely this change.  Will keep you posted.  If it works out itll sidestep the Frostwolf vs. Gurubashi question too Thought one way of playtesting it is to play some friendlies with the different versions between us similar to what uDaedin and me did a little while back with warlock  If youre up for that DM me your tag timezone and server and Ill add you.,zerotoheroes,d7pvbcv,1,t5_39szt
