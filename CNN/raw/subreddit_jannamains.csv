6398959,0,t1_czgzkj3,Well he HAS more damage than you his E does tons of damage on AA. If i cant push fast enough to get lvl  faster or in equal time i simply let it go and wait for the lane to push in a safer zone without overextending to avoid being grabbed. I mean Janna isnt a great lane bully and shes quite bad in early game long trades. If i pick Janna i try to survive the laning phase to translate into a midlate game of storms and tornadoes.Edit typo and clarification.,jannamains,czgzv3v,1,t5_34mzm

8005885,0,t1_d4fouvf, sec is the standard for single target shields. Lets not forget that it also grants AD and its Jannas primary way of enabling aggression and helping her ADC win trades. Plus nerfed shield duration means that anything that makes the shield bigger windspeakers AP the upcoming censercrucible changes is less valuable since the shield is most likely to fade before it has absorbed its maximum damage even if you timed it well to block incoming damage.,jannamains,d4fxqy6,1,t5_34mzm

8573180,0,t3_4x6361, VS Nami and Sona I would pick flat armor marks flat hp yellows flat MR blues and flat AP quintessences because these are not lanes I want to be trading with too heavily with their sustain and poke and high range hard CC when it comes to Nami. VS Soraka I would feel more at ease to play aggressive and would probably go with one of my other pages which is flat ad marks flat hp yellows flat ap blues x flat AP quint x flat armor quints. I do not consider Soraka a threat and would trade with her lane without fear if I am with someone who knows how to trade. Coin over Spellthief against Sona and Nami yes unless you are confident that you are a better player and can outplay amp outtrade them. Coin over Spellthief against Soraka I wouldnt unless your plan against her is to stale and play a farm lane if your ADC outscales her that might be a good idea otherwise no. Mpen runes are terrible on Janna only use if you do not have alternative for marks. AD armor even AP or armor pen would serve you better Janna does not harass with spells. Flat HP yellows if you have armor from either marks or quints flat armor yellows otherwise.,jannamains,d6d8a6t,1,t5_34mzm
