1499056,0,t1_cj1s4sr,Thanks! It got to about  weeks growth before I got frustrated with the fluffyness and gave it a pretty severe trim. Pretrim There was good volume and coverage but not a lot of length  which I guess just takes time when you have curly hair.,BeardAdvice,cj46iv7,1,t5_30fcr

2548517,0,t3_2ou94g,Though this isnt an exact answer like you were hoping for its my opinion that it really is up to you. You have the luxury of not being that far along in the process so you should feel free to play around with the neckline to see what works for you. Worst case scenario you cut a little close and you can grow back to near normal in a few short weeks. ,BeardAdvice,cmr887s,1,t5_30fcr

4746643,0,t3_3fwxw0,Patience grasshopper.   Growing a beard is like...growing a bonsai tree. Or more like a kudzu vine that envelops and suffocates all other life. What Im saying is you should let nature take its course. If you cant because you are a flaming metrosexual or you have a need to sculpt and preen your pretty manhair then do this  get a nice pair of trimming scissors and a little stand to put them on. Trim your beard with these once a day while counting to ten. Once you have reached ten YOU PUT THOSE FUCKING SCISSORS DOWN. Youre done for the day! You are trimmed and a real gentleman about town. However if you keep going you are the worst sort of impulsive slackjawed chronic masturbator who just cant muster a modicum of selfcontrol.  Seriously just do some light trimming and dont worry about unevenness  months in it will even out give it time. ,BeardAdvice,ctsuy2l,2,t5_30fcr

9630467,0,t1_d9zzx25,I see this response constantly. Please tell me what could possibly happen if OP grows this out for two more months. The answer is nothing. His cheeks have zero growth after  days. That isnt going to change. To OP  shaves the sides for now and keep a trimmed goatee. Thats the only option unless you want to grow an unsightly neckbeard. You could still see some growth in the coming years though so dont lose hope just yet. It makes me insane at how much poor advice is actually given on here. Not everyone can grow a beard. This is the bottom line and the truth unfortunately. ,BeardAdvice,da05ilm,0,t5_30fcr

10258513,0,t3_5mv764,Until you have enough length in the front of the face parts of the beard I would suggest shaving your neck sort of like this Keeps it looking professional while its young and vulnerable and once you have a good length up top and your neck is hidden you can decide whether to go full natural or keep it sharp.,BeardAdvice,dc6uxjs,3,t5_30fcr

11044895,0,t3_5xmg7c,Welllllllll youre going to lose a bit. At least I recommend you do. Looks like your mustache has decent coverage I would highly recommend you keep the tache and the chin so youre sporting a Jack Sparrow style goatee.  As far as everything else Id take it down to a light scruff.. Dont shave it down completely just own the stubble. Also with your mustache trim it so it lines up with the top of your lip. Great shape on that thing just clean it up.,BeardAdvice,dejx45d,2,t5_30fcr
11151780,0,t3_5z6mjp,Id keep it shaved for now if I were younot hating in any way but ofc it depends on the look youre after. Keep the smile up dudee,BeardAdvice,dew1j3v,2,t5_30fcr
11346297,0,t3_61unb0,Yes let it go at least another month. The front looks very thick and as the sides get longer they will help to cover up the voids. Reconsider after the month and take it from there. ,BeardAdvice,dfi2zet,1,t5_30fcr
