7411380,0,t1_d2kel1y,The shot ideas are definitely fun bonus rules haha. Currently in my Rogue YoggSaron deck YoggSarogue every  games or so I get Yogg to go off with Brann in play. Literally in  games last night I had him go off with  spells and  spells. Still trying to figure out how he got  in that screenshot but oh well.    Then again I didnt really count how many class spells of each he played but if youre taking proper drinks for each spell I think you could easily go through a beer or two during each battlecry. I think the bonus shots will make it much more fun though.    I particularly like Take a shot if yogg survives his battlecry haha I have yet to see that happen.,YoggSaron,d2kmijr,2,t5_3ed43
