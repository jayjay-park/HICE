4556362,0,t3_3c4vhc,Some nonconference games starting to be released on ESPN and the teams websites.  Probably more hitting the popular message boards.  So far SHU has Duquesne Nov  and vs. Wichita State Dec .  My Marquette teams entire nonconference schedule is out.  Theyre making the usual Cincinnati nonconference schedule look like a gauntlet.  Apologies to the rest of the Big East for bringing down the conferences RPI.,BigEast,ct4y7ca,2,t5_2v823
