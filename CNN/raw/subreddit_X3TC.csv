1048152,0,t3_263yd1, Unmodded pretty much all you can do with MK is tell it to start trading and where and turn it on. Theres nothing to micromanage. This can be both a good and bad thing.Commodity Logistics MK  External Commodity Logistics is a script fo the Bonus Pack. Its an Automated Trader. It is much much cheaper than MK but requires some micromanagement. Dont mod until you find something lacking in the game itself and then mod to add what you find lacking. If you just start throwing mods on the game it can cause instability and ruin the balance of the game  which can make it much harder to get advice on how to fix a problem. Is whatever you want to do.Combat. Missions. The Plots. Mining is better done by AI ships. It is clumsy. It is less clumsy when you can afford to do it in a M sized ship because their shields can survive more accidents. But really it is best to start an AI miner and then leave the sector hes working in.Id say since it a Economic and Combat simulator you should try to get your hands on a combat ship and start playing with that side of it.,X3TC,chnfgyb,3,t5_2rvys
1058279,0,t1_chogytf,Are you using UTs and STs ONLY?To me in default form STs and UTs are so worthless that if Im playing vanilla I skip right over them and go to building factories so that I can use CAG to run them.You can just run the economy and make a lot of money without building stations but goddam its so much easier with Economy and Supply Trader.CAGs and their related EST are just so much better than the default MK software. They allow you to focus your efforts in ways thats just not possible with MK.In each sector where you have UTST running if you just added an Energy and Ore a Bio and a Food EST then I think your economy would run better and youd get over those stagnation points.Leave the MK traders running to clean out any weapons fabs that get filled up with end products so that those stations dont stop buying resources.

3208944,0,t3_2wvgw5,So you have been given good tips. Because XRM is a dangerous universe you definitely have to take steps to ensure your traders are more capable at protecting themselves.First I solely choose TS for speed and shield strength. Speed helps with profit anyway and shield strength gives them a chance at jumping away before being taken out. My current game is a Terranfocused one so I am using Baldrics which have a nice balance in speed and durability. Mistrals can be even better.Second you need a better trader script. Lucikes Economy and Supply Trader EST is fantastic. Alternately you should get the MK Improved script which among other improvements in trader logic it implements the Targeted Signal. This allows your traders to know when they have been targeted by an enemy and begin jump out procedures before a shot has even been fired. This extra time makes a huge difference. EST also implements that signal. SignalTargeted is one of those features that Egosoft should have provided.Then it you should definitely look into various defense strategies and scripts. You mentioned DCS which is a great system especially once you have your profitsss machine operating at full speed. CODEA is also great for managing fleets and is compatible with DCS.Lucikes Search and Rescue Service SRS is also a fantastic system. All of Lucikes scripts use pilots that have to be trained up to achieve their full potential. And they can be crosstrained. Once you train up an SRS pilot to a Lieutenant you can transfer that pilot into one of your larger CODEA ships and his skills will transfer with him plus the combat and flight bonuses that come with them. SRS is great for training up your pilot fleet so they are ready to command your CODEA fleets when you have the money and need for them. Your CAG and CLS pilots are also crosstrained with EST work so those commercial skills can be transferred. You can set up some small CLS traders in M ships and have them haul goods back and forth between a couple stations to train up their skills and when they are up to speed you can move the pilots into TSs for EST work.I also recommend this thread which describes a full empire setup. He provides a bunch of useful tips that you may find helpful.EDIT OH and just to be clear I use all these mods in XRM. They work perfectly.,X3TC,coultur,1,t5_2rvys

4505620,0,t3_3csi7s,Have you only done Humble Merchant start? Kinda sounds like it...You should see if you have unlocked Tormented Teladi yet. That gamestart requires you to earn Petty Financier trade rank in another gamestart.Tormented Teladi is only  hours universe time long. It emphasizes pretty much every part of the game except for trading. You dont have time to trade. You have to try a little combat in a totally outclassed ship. Youll be happy just to get into a better M. It will probably start you in a sector or very near a sector where constant spontaneous combat is going on. Teladi vs. Xenon. Capitals vs. Capitals. Sometimes the Teladi sector will get totally overrun with Xenon. Sometimes the Teladi will push into Xenon space.Its not  what you are looking for. But it emphasizes combat and missions and youll have to learn how to liveget around in some pretty dicey sectors.If you complete the Tormented Teladi challenge successfully complete the introductory mission in  hours or less then it gives you a decent combat ship to continue the game if you wish. But it also unlocks another gamestart called Poisoned Paranid  which starts with a not really as hard as Tormented Teladi mission that gives you the best playership in the X universe.In PP youll use what you learned in Humble Merchant and what you learned in Tormented Teladi. It gives you a direction and something to work for  but it doesnt hold your hand.And in PP the Paranid will be after you trying to kill you which throws a wrench into the Humble Merchant Universe Trader scheme  you have to regionalize and explore the Universe fast to find trading regions that are safe from the Paranid... at least until you finish the introductory mission.I would at least complete Tormented Teladi before you install Litcube.,X3TC,csyl144,5,t5_2rvys

7002728,0,t3_4awnzo,I havent made the leap to LU yet either so I cant really answer your question properly. But Ill tell you why my current favourite ships are my faves and hopefully itll give you suggestions to consider. I use the right tool for the job. Sometimes I want capacity. Sometimes I want speed or shields or whatever. I select the right ship depending on the role it will play.Ms  My personal M is a Spitfyre. I use it as a runabout shuttle or when I feel like really getting into a fight. It really punches above its weight with weaponry. Its as fast as an M and if you are patient enough Im usually not you can even take out a Q with it since you are effectively immune to the cannons of a capital ship.I also keep a bunch of BlastClaw Prototypes in my larger ships as a reserve jump fuel tank.  energy cells will see you able to make your current jump you can rendezvous a refuelling tanker at your destination and carry on your way.For my fighter wings Falcon Sentinels all the way. For OOS combat especially shields matter the most. The fighters reach their target and at that point its all about survivability. MJ shields will ensure your fighters are the last standing at the end of the Melee.Ms  My personal yacht is my Hyperion vanguard. Easily my favourite ship in the game. It has decent everything but its standout feature is the ability to dock two Ms. I have my Spitfyre and a BlastClaw. The latter is my smugglers hold as anything in there doesnt show up in sector patrol scans. It also holds some reserve jumpfuel as per all my Blastclaws.I use Springblossoms as my UT of choice. They have fairly poor cargo storage compared to most TS class ships but they make up for it in speed. My UTs zip around the galaxy buying and selling enough to more than pay for themselves. Fair warning though they are not cheap! You wont do this until you have more money than you know what to do with.Ms  I have an Agamemnon as my personal capital Ship. With a decent commander in charge it will take out any capital ship of any class. It has a very slim profile making it extremely hard to hit if the commander knows how to rollstrafe. It almost has the speed and maneuverability of an M with the firepower to go toetotoe with much bigger capital ships. Theyre great sector patrol craft OOS also but unless you want to be at war with the Paranid can be hard to acquire more than one or two.I use Panthers as light carriers as a great way to deal with a complex under attack with a rapid response of interceptors. I normally remotely direct my Rapid Response teams though.I also have a bunch of captured Qs doing sector patrols around the place. When in an OOS fight a Q fires so much energy at its victim on its first pass that all but the most heavily shielded Ms are toast before they get a shot off! A wolf pack of three Qs will take out anything.Capitals   My main carriers are Split Raptors. Jump in drop  fighters and stay out of range they dont have enough shielding to handle a capital fight. All their turrets are for keeping fighter and corvette assaults at bay.I have a Paranid Battle fleet xM xMs xMs xMM. Its fully equipped but honestly I never use it. But knowing I have this big stick in reserve if I ever need it is great!I also love Arans. I use them as Storage warehouses at my equipment dock and HQ and also as Forward Operating Bases. One of my Arans has a wing of Ms docked. If that jumps into a sector things are about to go down. You cant just jump a wing of bombers into a sector. They spread themselves out so thinly as to be useless. But if you jump them inside an Aran and launch them locally theyll lay waste to just about anything in very short order.,X3TC,d1a3r19,2,t5_2rvys

7732319,0,t1_d3l36fj,gt They will be more profitable if you give them best buysell. Much more. Ive been going through forums about this and i just dont understand if they need it or not. All the ships I pilot have best buy and sell so there is never an instance where I dont have that well unless im in spacesuit claiming a pirate ship. Do the STsUTs need best buysell because my own ships having it doesnt transfer the knowledge to their ships? gt I think level  or  allows them to cover  jump range so home sector plus  in every direction. Then level  increases to two sectors plus unlocks universe trader.This actually sounds perfect. I dread the idea of letting them too far off a leash but theres a few sectors where I routinely have several ships making very good profits but only if I move them  sector over.  Empires Edge is amazing because the sectors south and east are also full of soy farmssoyeriesenergy so if the soyeries in EE are full I send my ship to sell elsewhere. Similarly for Ore belt cloudbase southeast paranid mines powercircle herrons nebula etc.gt Universe traders only go to explored places. Further they only have a good indication of profitability in sectors you have satellites.Yeah I have  satellites but coverage is shit in Paranid sectors south of paranid prime or south and east of Seizewell. Im working on dropping more sats at all times. gt Man your micromanagement must be a drag get on the bonus pack and sector traders.I used to be Diamond starcraft  good marcomanagement its not that bad but it definitely gets annoying if Im fighting lots of pirates because my economy basically stops. But I never wanted to try STsUTs because that software is super expensive. Will do it now that I understand how it works better. Whats your stance of giving them a turret? Some people say the UTs might not run and might fight but others say they always try to jump away and its completely inconsistent.,X3TC,d3l3ysl,1,t5_2rvys

Once you start boarding just start apologizing to anything that turned red in the sector. Be ready to get the ship out quick with a jump drive. Jump it out and make sure nothing is still hostile.

8757122,0,t3_5005ny,I usually start with a Trading Station nearby that stocks the same stuff as the HQ uses. I use a CAG with their trade duty set to Buyer to buy the stuff and deliver it to the trading station and then I use CLSes to take the stuff from the Trading Station to the HQ.You can just set the CAG homebased to the HQ and buy directly for it but this can sometimes lead to overstock calamities where the CAG fills it up with one item and neglects the minimum level of the other items. Dockware Manager allows you to set maximum stock levels for the HQ. And the CAG will respect those limits. But if the HQ ever exceeds those limits the CAG will ignore the limits and start buying that item until it runs out of money or until it completely fills the HQ with that item. And the Recycle Ship feature doesnt respect the Dockware Manager limits. So if the CAG works directly at the HQ and you recycle ships you are very likely to encounter an overstock calamity. Do it is a safer idea to have another station nearby where the CAG buys the stuff in smaller numbers than the HQ stocks and then CLS ships possibly just cheap figthers take the stuff from the Trading Station to the HQ. This way you have an extra layer of protection on your buyingstocking levels at the HQ.And then you can build a complex near the HQ to make the stuff the HQ uses and you can stop buying it in at the trading station and just have CLSes that take it directly from the Complex to the HQ.If you have the cash to do it you might even want to have mutple trading stations that each buy  of the HQs resources. Just for parking convenience if you use larger ships that fighters fighters can dock in unlimited numbers at some trading stations but they usually are limited to docking  or  TSes at the same time.,X3TC,d70art6,2,t5_2rvys

Do i use couriers to supply  stations with energy from my solar plant or is there some way to have my power plant push its energy to where it needs to go? or do i have to use  TS per station i want? Mayhem has a much simpler solution in the form of the Internal Distribution Network.
