5113901,0,t3_3l0o96,Wow this was a really good read! At the beginning it just seemed like a generic horror gameesque setting but still somewhat interesting nonetheless. Then those last few notes at the end really nailed it adding meaning to the SCP rather than just plain spookiness. I love it. Ive been thinking of writing some SCPs myself even though I have no experience and this is the kind of SCP Id like to write.,Daily_SCP,cv2ezz0,2,t5_39m7o
