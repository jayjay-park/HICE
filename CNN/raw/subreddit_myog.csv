10461785,0,t1_dctwb8g,The Silpoly color is Robin Eggshell Blue. I chose to do the tarp ridgeline like that for a few reasons. The first is that Im mostly a hammock camper so I like the familiarity and extra versatility it gives me when setting up. I can slide the tarp along two prussiks on the ends and that helps keep it pitched very taughtly with little effort each time I set it up which will mostly be between trees like shown in the photo or with trekking poles. I use Dutch Bling on my other tarps and might with this one too. I think the main focus of this tarp will be for minimalist overnighters or a group shelter for a rainy trip. I figure the ridgeline will also allow me to hang things from the ridgeline if I want wet clothes but I dont have to hook a net to it because I have a D ring on both ends.
