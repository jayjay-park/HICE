3767210,0,t3_33dt1p,I think its exactly the kind of music he grown into creating. Its fresh and unique. It hits everything he wants to say from thanks on Fiddle me this to story telling on the disappear track that is hard to listen to when you zone in on the lyrics. Hes always been a story teller but he really seems to let the pen flow in this album. American You can be a mainstream big time track for him when the edit comes out. I feel like this is the one that can carry him across different genres and get into the most ears. Im not sure if thats what hes wanting to do or if he has just been at it long enough now to feel comfortable enough be himself and make music the way he wants it to be. Regardless I think its fantastic and will push him into a higher realm. I have known him personally in the past and he was always a free spirited very talented illustration and graffiti artist and just wanted to do whatever he wanted to do regardless of who or what was in the way. I say that to say this I think he wants to just create things whether its music art clothes film or whatever. On this album thats what I feel like he did. He made something different and exactly the way he wanted it.,yelawolf,cqlouna,2,t5_2t5ht
7298588,0,t3_4csyza,I saw him on the Love Story Tour and yes theres a lot of newer material played but it mixes well with the older stuff Trunk Muzik amp Radioactive to give the show a great feel. Easily the best live performance Ive ever seen.,yelawolf,d27sszn,1,t5_2t5ht
