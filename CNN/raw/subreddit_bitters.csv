My gut reaction is there is no substitute for time but even if the quality is only . there and nobody can tell then so be it cut the time! ,bitters,cr0op1j,1,t5_2uyry

Pure grain spirits tend to be pretty rough on the maceration and pull out more unwanted elements. Lesser abv tends to be more watery for our final product. We use quite a bit of dried fruits as sweetening agents. Even though the fruit is dried some juice is still pulled out. With our process we start with nominally  and end up with TTB verified abv of  depending on our recipe with no postmaceration dilution. ,bitters,csxliu9,1,t5_2uyry
