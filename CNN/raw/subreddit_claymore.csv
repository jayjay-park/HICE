1459094,0,t3_2assd8,The flashback is what hooked me on the series... but without the first chapters getting to know Clare it wouldnt have had the same impact.,claymore,ciz6858,6,t5_2sgnj

4421555,0,t1_csnmi80,ampnbspampnbspThats a great point. Trauma in the past doesnt excuse the actions of the present it just gives them context. Its surprising that the Organization has kept her alive...surely they know about Ophelias tactics. They find out about Teresas massacre just fine!  ampnbspampnbspOphelia is known to have an unhealthy obsession with Awakened Beings. To the point where she tries to force her comrades to awaken. It was the case with Hilda it was the case with Miria and it was the case with Clare. So I think Ophelias thought process is something like this all Claymores are going to exceed their limits and become Awakened Beings eventually so why does it matter if I accelerate that process? Of course thats a really shitty way of thinking but its something I can see her thinking as a way to justify her actions. I wouldnt be surprised if she toys with her victims like Riful does. Torturing them until they awaken and if they die in the process then they werent fit to be a warrior in the first place. Damn what if Riful and Ophelia met? Wouldnt that be something. ampnbspampnbspThe only noticeable difference is in the anime Miria tells Clare Helen and Deneve about Ophelia while on the mountain but in the manga she doesnt. Instead it cuts back to Miria speaking her description to herself...so Clare goes into this whole mess not knowing exactly what shes about to get herself into.ampnbspampnbspIts never mentioned but I wonder if Ophelia was the Organizations unspoken cleaner of sorts. Why would Rubel send Clare alone to hunt with Ophelia? Claymores always go in groups of  on Awakened Being hunts. At this point hes aware of Clares drastic change in attitude towards not being as much of a troublemaker. Makes you wonder...,claymore,cso1luq,3,t5_2sgnj

4969975,0,t1_cukzes1,I actually agree to everything you say. Dont get me wrong. I think there are many things which come into play in making Teresa arc so good and what I suggested in the post  moral life thing  is just one of them which I think should be mentioned along with the others.,claymore,cul03hj,2,t5_2sgnj
4990176,0,t1_cumerz5,I honestly dont remember a single instance where the armor actually protected anyone...whether its a warriors sword or an Awakened being the shoulder plates never fail to be sliced through P I think the outfits they take up after the  year timeskip kind of inadvertently lampshade that a bit because it doesnt seem to make a difference on the battlefield.,claymore,cuni2j1,2,t5_2sgnj
5247054,0,t3_3mv9tn,Definitely curious about this one how it worksetc. The first time I read through I thought it was implied that the sword was actually vibrating fast enough to pass through solid objects something which is theoretically possible at nearlight speeds. If this is true it makes her far more impressive and makes Ilena more impressive for blocking it.The other possibility is that it simply slides under the opponents blade by having her blade move liquidly around it... This logically makes more sense but makes less sense physically  her sword would have simply struck Clares from the other side after slipping around it if it were vibrating so fast. We also havent seen the swords be able to bendbreak whatsoever so its a littler unbelievable that Ophelia could do so.,claymore,cvigj3h,1,t5_2sgnj
