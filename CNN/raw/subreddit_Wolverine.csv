11584694,0,t1_dg94nwt,I asked what it is. I knew something was happening but not what. Thats why I asked I didnt know the blade poisoning was a thing. Another question what does the medicine do besides enhance strength and drive him crazy,Wolverine,dg94rja,1,t5_2qw7l
11782341,0,t1_dgve6oz,gt I think Wolverine knew he has bone claws. He had them before the Weapon X project all the way back to his originsHe didnt. He talks about how he thought his claws were implants from the Weapon X process Keep in mind that the writers themselves havent always known exactly how they wanted to depict the claws. First they were supposed to be part of Wolverines gloves. Then Claremont made them part of the Weapon X implants. The bone claws were just another step in adding to and fleshing out Logans story. It might seem obvious now or that everyone knew back then but it wasnt. The comics definitely portrayed them as a nonmutant ability. For example Wolverine could always pop his claws when hit with power dampeners and then hed talk about his claws being implants.gt  Its interesting to see how potent his healing factor has become in later issues.Wolverines healing factor eventually recovered from the adamantium removal. Then writers gave it an explicit boost The boost was explained as the natural state of his healing factor when it didnt have to cope with the poisonous adamantium. Wolverine also started to go a bit feral at the time.Later when Wolverine got his adamantium back writers just kind of kept the super high healing factor. Really it was probably just your typical power creep and writers didnt want to make him weaker again. Some comics have retroactively tried to explain it. Here some bad guys determine that Wolverines healing has increased  over the years in response to traumatic injuries a sort of what doesnt kill you makes you stronger type thing.gt Another deviation is how much agony he appears to be in when he pops his claws but in recent issues before his death he was popping his claws without a healing factor but it apparently didnt cause absolutely debilitating painYeah thats probably mostly for dramatic effect in this scene. Maybe you can explain it as Wolverine being weakened from losing his adamantium? Hes already popping his claws in and out to keep the channels open a few pages later without the same problems so it was kind of a one time thing.,Wolverine,dgvkei0,3,t5_2qw7l
