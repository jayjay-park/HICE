2166186,0,t1_clev8wt,Is that RTV around the transmission pan?!?!? It should be a gasket if it was my truck I would get a gasket recommend getting a Ford one  they are not to expensive and clean all the RTV off the pan and transmission. You can use a razer blade to scrap it off just be careful on the transmission because it is possible to cut the aluminum it hard to do but possible. And while you have the pan off its not a bad idea to change the Trans filter also very very easy to do. Just drop the pan and you will see the filter pull it off and put the new one in.  Lube up the new Oring with some fluid and make sure its in the hole good. A lose filter will cause the pump to pull air.  Dont have to meatball it in there but it will have a slight click. Clean the whole Trans with brake clean and check it in a few days see how it looks. Let me know how it goes! Good luck!! ,f150,clf6810,2,t5_2t4ts
