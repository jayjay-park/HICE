3761495,0,t1_cqkxo7f,Hello and thank you!My focus is more of a sociological one I am looking towards understanding what laws are currently in place which effect the production and designing of video games and how they either hinder or help. I have looked at and contacted receivers of tax relief under The Corporations Tax Act  through the Cultural Test which ascertains the extent to which a video game produced in the UK can be seen as adding to British culture. I have also looked at how copyright is dealt with in the UK how malicious communications via an electronic medium can be punished in the UK and I am beginning to look at how a charity achieves charitable status here and what that means for organizations which provide assistance and support for disabled gamers and other charitable efforts that utilize video games.If I am honest I chose this topic because I love video games and I am hoping to study law once I graduate. Because of my lack of legal knowledge at the moment it is seemingly quite hard to pin down exactly where the law and the creative freedom of devs coalesce. Any help would be much appreciated!,uklaw,cql1ec4,2,t5_2qonh
3954847,0,t3_35qvcw,Its not my place to say but on a moralistic note I do sympathise. The teenage years are a tumultuous time for many. Can lead to drugs and antisocial for some unfortunately for others it can gradually decline into a darker place. As long as you didnt hurt anyone yourself the only thing you can do is ensure its not a place you go back to forgive yourself and leave that part of your life behind you. When asking for legal advice dont feel the need to explain yourself we should be giving impartial objective advice not our moral opinion Although Im aware I  contradict myself In terms of your issue. Ill be honest. You may find a number of obstacles mainly due to the sensitivity of the positions you are applying to. What you dodont need to declare should be detailed on the application form. This differs from position to position. Assuming you were not registered as a sex offender your offence should be spent. Applications for most positions will not require you to declare spent convictions. Exceptions to this are usually sensitive positions hospitals may be one of them. Both an enhanced and basic disclosure will reveal police cautions. An enhanced disclosure will also reveal anything held on local police databases  not guilty verdicts arrests etc. You mention youre not entirely sure if you received a caution. My best advice at this point is to run a DBS check on yourself. You can submit a subject access request which will reveal any info held about you on the national databases equivalent to a basic and request info from your local police department equivalent to an enhanced check. If you can get a clear picture of precisely what info is brought up when a check is run on you you can work out your best plan of action. Ps.....uklegaladvice is a more suitable sub for your question ,uklaw,cr734a9,3,t5_2qonh
7885393,0,t1_d42d3nd,HelloI apoglozie for the confusion. I am not qualified in any jurisidictions and I am looking to do so. My LLB and LLM and from a Dutch University but I do not get civil effect in the Netherlands upon graduating. This is due to the fact that Im not dutch the degrees are in English and in order to get civil effect one needs to follow several dutch law courses which are of course in dutch. Therefore Im stuck with graduating but no entry into qualifying as a practicing lawyer. Going to any other jurisidiction would be a language problem and in some cases the procedures are much worse. As such I think that taking the LPC  GDL might be the quickest and actually cheapest way of achieving this.,uklaw,d42e33e,1,t5_2qonh
8389723,0,t1_d5q8zi1,Theres a good number of firms in Bath and Bristol alone so you should be fine.Afraid I dont really know any recruiters from round that way though. Temping for doc review jobs is definitely an option to get some paralegal experience that will get your foot in the door quotations because arguably its not real paralegaling but thats open to debate and you can usually list it as paralegalling on your CV without any controversy. Those roles dont usually require previous experience.,uklaw,d5q9h84,1,t5_2qonh

9317222,0,t1_d8mo6bi,gt I will be brutally honest everyone I know from uni who got into a magic circle firm was either a you knew from day one they would do i.e. always most vocal in the class and present everywhere on the law scene or b had virtually no life and got a high first.I agree with almost everything you wrote but this didnt click with my experiences. In my class the people at the best firms mostly did get high grades of course but just had a lot else to offer whether that was extra curricular or work experience. If I can nail down one unifying attribute its that the sociable and friendly people generally got good TCs. Those attributes generally translate also doing extra curriculars and of course the grades have to be there but I can think of some total arseholes who were say captain of a college sports team and got a high . but never made it into the top tier of firms. I didnt especially care about corporate law and didnt go for it while at uni but my later experience ended up being commercial and I found I enjoyed it so applied to the MC with that experience. My trainer cohort were generally quite similar  just grounded and friendly people who were happy to have a good job. I can only think of one or two who had clearly been phenomenally driven towards it from the start of uni. I agree with the rest but would add that there is potentially even more value in paralegal work at a bank or large company as this is an excellent opportunity to get to know your future clients and understand business as well as law. ,uklaw,d8x0yad,1,t5_2qonh
