But it should be noted that many of these other agencies launch satellites.  Its totally possible that were spending more money on space to spy on other people than for astronomy.The trends clearly point to a crossover at some point in the near future unless priorities change.  But this is only in a narrow view of NSA vs. NASA.  In addition to the NSA theres the CIA DIA FBI NGA.  These are all intelligence agencies.We should be careful to avoid doublecounting.  The NSA probably overlaps with the NGA a good deal as do the others.  But if youre considering intelligence generally it easily dwarfs NASA.  Of course there are other scientific ventures but military budgets will tower over those no matter how you stack it.,dataisdepressing,cghctxv,4,t5_2x1ma
