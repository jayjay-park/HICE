6748695,0,t3_4861jo,I am curious whats the protocol if we remove a mod like this?  Are the people that built using it just out of luck?  For instance weve built a very large structure on a Barge.  If the Big Raft mod is removed are we homeless?  Can we work with our Admin to reclaim materials?  Or is it just an assumed risk inherent in choosing to use any of the mods?,jkval,d0hde5w,2,t5_3c6vf
6854692,0,t3_49nru2,The buffed dinos have been in for about  nights now I think? Im continuously receiving reports that theyre just too strong so I think Im going to go back over the stats with Jack to find a better balance.As for abandoned buildings of war... I dont know what youre talking about. The map is largely empty and no wars have occurred yet. If you could point out some abandoned buildings to me Ill certainly look into it to see if they are truly abandoned.,jkval,d0tad0v,1,t5_3c6vf
