These people have been exposed to alcohol from an early age and can approach drinking responsibly.Its more common here to drink to excess and it ruins it for everyone thats able to drink responsibly. Its not just kids either adults do it too  hence the potential of minimum pricing being brought in.I used to go to pubs when I was  and for the most part drank responsibly and socially. Unfortunately its easier to have a blanket ban on drinking than it is to educate kids about it. ,britishproblems,cekgp7o,0,t5_2sumw

56089,1,t1_ceksgb2,Exactly.  Although Ive never had a ONS I lived in student halls and this sort of thing used to happen with all the gossip and awkwardness in tandem.  These people already knew each other and still did so its not like they had sex and never saw each other again.I only came really close to an ONS just the once when outrageously drunk but had a bad feeling about it and decided not to proceed... I later discovered Id dodged a . bullet as I later discovered the girl in question had a reputation if you know what I mean and was known for leading men on.  Essentially she was a bike a possible bunny boiler and I genuinely think going through with that ONS would have led to disaster  possibly STDs or a false police complaint.There are girls I know personally who I feel affectionate and attracted to but random sex with them is out of the question.  Theyre also not really in my league so a relationship in which to facilitate this is off the cards.Many would disagree and Ive never done this myself but theres something to be said for paid escorts.  At least its prearranged guaranteed  consensual and is in a much safer and more controlled environment picking up some girl in a club while drunk is a complete minefield.,britishproblems,cektdk8,2,t5_2sumw

436674,0,t3_1z2r37,Im somebody who has worked in numerous call centres bith consumer and business.Popular consumer call centres will have a permenant queue and their management will be set a certain SLA which usually comes in the format  of x of calls to be answered within y seconds.  One I worked in before had this as  of calls within  seconds. This target is usually set based on regulatory and revenuebased criteria.  The message that is played will typically always cite an unusually high volume of calls because managment will have calculated its staffing headcount based on typical call volumes based on forecasts or it may be playing that message to suggest the customer just chose the wrong time to call.  However they will want to avoid the customer hanging up as the call centres abandoned rate will often tie into overall SLA stats.For the caller it doesnt make much difference as heshe is still stuck in a queue.  On the agents side it means that its likely that they are taking call after call after call with little break in between of what is called aftercall wrapup.  Should they have excessive ACW on their stats they will get in trouble and will likely be shouted at after maybe just  seconds to go back in.This does create a situation where through no fault of their own agents get a ton of abuse from each and every caller who has had to wait  minutes and without a break between each one.It certainly can be lack of investment in call handling it may also be the business quite happy to accept a longer SLA if its not impacting on revenues or out of compliance with regulators.Compare a consumer call centre to a business one.  I work in a contact centre for big businessesbanks government agencies to call and our SLA is  of calls in  seconds.  Which we hit.  We can sometimes go  mins without a call and most call after call scenarios clear within  mins but the stakes are higher if a business pulls out of a contract through poor SLA.,britishproblems,cfq0yhn,33,t5_2sumw

We have caused massive death and destruction everywhere weve gone in our pursuit of wealth. Its disappointing if youre happy with the idea of an unelected individual holding power through his religion in my view but to each his own.The fear mongering over Scottish independence comments means the very large establishment campaign against it  e.g. you wont get the pound you wont get into Europe x business will leave the country etc. Its all designed to suggest that the Apocalypse would happen if Scottish people voted for independence. In reality of course life would go on as normal  because it always does. Im neither for or against Scottish independence but the campaign from the prounification brigade has been nothing short of entirely negative. It has not focused on the benefits of union  its just attempted to scare the Scots into thinking that leaving the UK would lead to total collapse.The same was true for AV  the establishment launched an incredibly negative campaign against the idea of AV even though in theory it actually did what many people were crying out for which was offer the opportunity for an individual to have more of a voice at election time. It wasnt in the interest of the establishment e.g. LabourConservatives to allow it to happen though so they buried it in bad PR e.g. people wont understand it the BNP will get in etc etc.Theyre even doing it with HS now  yes  theyve hired PR specialists and the new argument for HS isnt quicker journey times but...you guessed it...fear! Now its that we wont be able to compete with the Chinese etc.Again with HS I dont actually have a strong view either way except for my concerns it wont ever go passed Birmingham but I am sick to death of fear being used as an argument.The king of all of these is national security  fear promotion has led to terrorism Iraq Afghanistan and the desire for a new Trident. I think these do significantly outweigh whatever good we may discuss.Actually if youre talking about British values the use of fear by the establishment comes out somewhere near the top for me.,britishproblems,cfr1rep,0,t5_2sumw

527759,0,t1_cg07tor,sigh Here we go again... The Mining industry was outdated and was essentially being propped up by the state by the s and ironic given todays events it was nationalisation and the subsequent union activity that prevented them modernising to compete in an international market in the first place. Need I remind you that the final nail in the coalminers coffin was already being slowly slammed into the planks with the plentiful modern fuel that came with North Sea gas and oil and its exploitation under the dark days of s Labour? I also stand by the argument that Thatcher was the only leader in the past  years to make any legitimate attempt to at least provide parts of the north with any replacement manufacturing industry through the enterprise schemes set up in places like Sunderland the Nissan plant being the best example  UK car manufacturing being another industry destroyed by the realities of nationalisation and its failure to embrace technological advances.I accept that the wounds are sore  coming from the Coalville area Im well aware of the failure of subsequent governments  both Tory and Labour  to fill the void left by an industry at the heart of many communities. But lets be honest  most of these communities were never going to be sustainable once the pit work dried up anyway  without proper training theres no way miners could transfer on such a massive scale to tertiary sector jobs. Hell even most secondary sector manufacturing jobs would require training expenditure which any sane business would struggle to find economically feasible. Sorry to tell you the truth but miners should have been prepared for inevitable pit closures in the s not once they had happened and nationalisation hid that massive elephant in the room in the cupboard to spring out and crush everyone with its great mass of grey realistic flesh. As far as the shortsighted industry and union leaders were concerned the industry was as good as saved forever once that happened and Thatcher merely gave them a rude reminder that theyd done to use a colloquial expression shitall to address the issues that led to the decision to nationalise in the first place  namely the increasing inviability and the dangling of the Sword of Damocles over the hundreds of thousands who relied on it for survival.Frankly to blame Thatcher for the demise of coal mining is blind scapegoating. She was merely the leader who was left to put the hobbling old dog down before it collapsed by itself and unfairly left the rest of the taxpaying public to pick up the mess.PS if theres one Tory you want to blame for severing periphery communities across the country its Richard Beeching and his suicidal destruction of the network in the s. Many of the mining towns now have no rail link which would have been a godsend in hindsight for their adaptation to a tertiary economy. While its a Steelworks community rather than an exmining area the Ebbw Vales success since its route was reopened serves as an excellent example and my dissertation next year is going to be based on the social benefits of such a scheme in Coalville.,britishproblems,cg09gvz,3,t5_2sumw

If Buckingham palace turns out to be unpopular we can renovate it redecorate it even replace it if we wanted to. The land alone is pretty much priceless. Lets just call that one unknown. But whether it goes up or down Im sure we could adapt.I think it all comes down to the principle of the matter economics be damned. Having any sort of royalty is just wrong in my opinion. And that is reason enough to me. I dont dislike them and I dont think theyre ruining this country but their very existence represents something that is abhorrent to me.I too dont think that keeping or removing the monarchy will be a large factor in fighting inequality.

956832,0,t1_chd1bh1,Its  of one half a dozen of the other. English players are in higher demand due in part to the homegrown rule and generally expect a certain wage for their wares. Somebody somewhere will give them it. On the other hand a relatively unknown player from overseas well say France for instance  Im a Geordie after all will jump at the chance to take a wage hike and the increased publicity that comes with playing in an EPL team. As a result a lot of relatively average players end up getting imported when theres often a lot of very similar players in the UK already and by proxy national talent ends up being ignored.As a working example Newcastle United. The squad is largely imported from France on a shoestring. If we were to build a squad of English players with the same technical ability it would be insanely expensive.gtEnglish players only make up a small portion of the best.I absolutely agree. Were not going to get anywhere near the likes of Spain or Germany any time soon but with the right coaching and the right national scouting networks whose to say that we cant improve that statistic?

Though perhaps other renewables may be more or less expensive than wind something to consider.With all this consideration Id still prefer renewable as it would be less ecologically impactful about the same price and wouldnt run out. I seem to disagree with green the least of all the parties and energy I am leaning renewable rather than nuclear but majorly indifferent.

Fuck em. I fully understand their grief and anger given what was done to their son but their refusal to listen to the CPS and others ultimately brought about the removal of a vital protection against abuse of power by the State.MacPherson incidentally pointed out that the judges rulings and direction during the private prosecution were correct the CPS decisions to drop charges and not to bring charges were correct and that the outcome of the trial was the correct one given the evidence available at that time. The reason noone was going to be convicted of Stephens murder was ultimately not because of institutional racism by the police or CPS  it was because of the fucking Lawrences and their supporters more than a few of whom should have known better who thought they knew better than the CPS.

It is a very dangerous road due to the width  hardly enough for two vehicles to pass  and the fact that is it a national speed limit mph which seems to encourage some people to drive up to it.  Actually doing so would be bonkers.When I had the Encounter with the cyclists I just could not understand why they didnt even hear my car approaching diesel engine. Personally when I am on my bike and in the days when I rode my horse out in the village I always have an ear that is directed backwards and am very very alert to vehicles behind me. The trio that I met made me feel as though I am a safer rider than them despite their lycra helmets and dropped handlebars.Due to  as others state  the poor condition of the roads around here it is one stretch in this area that has a decent surface and is fairly level for cycling.  I dont go there often  and I choose my times as wisely as I can certainly avoiding Sunday mornings when it seems to pass for a velodrome I do avoid driving there and hold my breath at that particular bend  but only recently cycled there evening time as it is also a route to a scenic village Firbeck  for those who are interested and where I can arrange a lift back oI shall  weather permitting  do it again this evening but will hold my breath around the bends  but not for so long that I keel over that would just be silly o,britishproblems,cip2mk1,1,t5_2sumw

However in this case he didnt plan to kill someone but was put in a situation where he thought shooting through the door at an unknown person was the right action to take.Some people are pissed because the Judge has decided that despite him firing a gun through a bathroom door he didnt intend to kill anyone let alone Reeva.Make of that what you will its just my interpretation of the two articles above.,britishproblems,ckfvha4,2,t5_2sumw

There are two priesthoods called the Aaronic and Mechizedek priesthoods the former being the lesser preparatory priesthood before turning  although converts also take on the Aaronic priesthood also regardless of age where the young man is eligible if he is in good standing with the Church to then take on the Melchizidek priesthood which allows him to take on a wide variety of roles in the church including leading services. The term elder is then given to them and is the lowest rank in the church.   But yes the few times Ive dealt with Mormons they have been very polite and wellmannered.

2157458,0,t3_2jpd0d,Ive always been particularly partial to Quality Street although Roses have the strawberry cream and in my opinion superior caramel keg going for them so theyre probably edging it at the moment.Ive always felt that Cadbury used factoryfloor scrapings for Miniature Heroes  they just dont taste the same. Theres the arseend leftovers from Creme Egg season the usuallystale Fudge and the fact that they dont do Dream anymore  oh wait the Miniature Heroes ones tasted like a block of chocolate salt anyway  probably no bad thing.As for Celebrations oh where do I start? They have the biggest ones we dont like problem  or in my case ones that will kill me category as nobody in our house likes Marathon Snickers and Im allergic to peanuts. Mum used to like Bounty but insists that the celebrations ones are and I quote crap. The Galaxy Caramel ones used to be my heroin as a child and I still find retro wrappers in boxes of toys up the loft today  but alas again I reckon the quality has gone down over the years. And dont even get me started on them stopping Galaxy Truffles. Fuck you Mars Company. Just... fuck you. That said the quality of what else is left is still better than the pathetic offering of Miniature Heroes  though as good as the malteaser ones are the knowledge that the Galaxy Truffle was replaced by an anorexic Twix shaving is enough to make a grown man cry.So on that basis my preference is probably as follows at the moment Roses Quality Street Celebrations Miniature Heroes Yes they always were and always will be Miniature heroes.

There are many good reasons to do this The margarine is evenly distributed along a portion of the knife blade leading to easier spreading. The level top gives an immediate visual indication of how much margarine is left in the tub  if its  way down you have half a tub left. Less surface area for contamination with jam crumbs etc. Contamination is easy to remove.

They also added cleaning to the bill believe me the apartment was immaculate. When I told some smartarsedprimarksuited twat called Hugh that I would take the company to court his response was I dont care mate Im in court with these things all the time. I ended up having to take up a case with the TDS and of course won every penny back but it took weeks.The second one was Julie Twist. They tried to charge me  for half a garden pea found in the back of the freezer. I went to the office with my girlfriend and demanded that they give me the money back or I wouldnt leave. The girl told me if I didnt leave she would call the police so I said good because youre robbing me!.

There is no law against giving your own children alcohol over the page of  as long as they arent out in public. Heres a list of things which are illegal        Now arguably if you purchased alcohol specifically to give to your  year old kid you MAY be breaking a law. However if you purchase it for yourself and then just gave them a glass or can then youre likely ok.    It should also be noted that social services dont have to follow a strict law. They can just declare your parenting unfit and take your kids away.  Saying this is not illegal wont save you. All they have to do is convince a judge that you have poor judgment and they win essentially...   However realistically if you are just a decent parent that gives your kid some booze every now and then and they drink it at home youll likely never have to worry about any of this.

Perhaps all us Londoners should complain about not getting subsidies for not growing crops However the new airport is unlikely to happen  instead either Heathrow or Gatwick will expand and I would expect the airports owners to fund them not the state. Skycycle is a stupid idea that will never happen. And no idea why you picked out that particular new tower  theres loads of building work going on in London almost all of it privately funded. So the only thing on your list that London is benefiting from and is being paid for out of taxes is Crossrail. When it opens itll be the only piece of significant new transport infrastructure to be built mainly for the benefit of Londoners in nigh on  years.Universal Benefit is a good idea its just been badly implemented because its a civil service IT project.,britishproblems,comyrsb,-8,t5_2sumw

People need to accept that the Conservatives have the majority and theres nothing they can do. They made it work for the last  years when there was no money thats what gained my vote. For all labours policies were good they just dont have my trust as a party and I wouldnt ever vote for them again. In my opinion which no one seems to agree with I think the right party got in. As long as people view all the policies and vote whoever they think is the best for them I dont see the need for complaint. Im not rioting in the north east because my local MP is labour. You deal with it. Yeah the next  years where I live is probably going to be exactly the same as last time but people where I live who never change their vote are only to blame.

I know the bandwagon is a very wellmeaning one but along with this bandwagon seems to be people who can only respond to opposing arguments with insults and ridicule.Like it or not there are people in this country who need help and shelter. There are politics to consider in situations like these. Insisting otherwise is to live in denial. Likewise insisting we do not have a moral duty to help these refugees is to also live in denial.My personal concerns over migration are to do with the fact Ive worked damn hard in my life for pretty much zero financial reward to this point. As a young person in this country I feel pretty ignored. I appreciate refugees arent coming here to steal lowpay jobs from under my nose they have much greater concerns. But how much is too much? I dont know and I dont want to pretend to know. Id like to educate myself on the issues at hand before articulating passionate opinions unlike so many people I know.That and I generally take quite a leftleaning stance politically so I get quite offended at being painted with the Daily Fail or Britain Farce brush on the rare occasions I depart from my usual stance.,britishproblems,cuqu9he,2,t5_2sumw

But I believe you are pretty much only limited to TV box based things excluding on demand  watch again or live streams. The wording may of changed but that is what I saw when I became a student  several years ago.

Heres an article supporting what Im saying but Im not sure of its bias or sources. However annual UK TV advertising spend is about . billion pa see here  this source claims its even higher at .billion spread across about million UK households see here which roughly means that  is spent on TV advertising per UK household. In addition theres radio advertising which is about million per year which adds a further  quid per household.Of course were assuming that the costs of UK advertising fall on the UK consumer but thats a reasonable expectation to make as advertisers wouldnt spend the money here unless they can recoup it from the consumer too.,britishproblems,d0d9c66,2,t5_2sumw

The size of the labour pool is one of many inputs into the larger economy. Surplus labour attracts investment and businesses because entrepreneurs are able to utilise the spare capacity in the economy instead of failing to attract workers a larger worker pool also represents a larger market to sell to in particular as immigrants tend to be richer younger and more employed than their British counterparts. Immigrants also subsidise public services for Britons having a net contribution to the Treasury as opposed to the massive drain that Britishborn people represent often emigrating before they start intensively draining public health services when theyre older.But ultimately the most obvious reason is that the unemployment rate and immigration rate have very little resemblance to each other steady migration should lead to a rising unemployment rate but does not.

8808709,0,t1_d76mfjt,Using corruption to benefit rail rather than harm it. No really thats the reason.During British Rails tenure BR being a public entity had no lobby to fight for it while the country was full of businesses  airlines buses etc  who wanted to cripple it. The most infamous example was Ernest Marples the Transportation Minister in the early s who had extensive road holdings. He commissioned a report on how to return BR to profitability. This ended up with two reports a majority report calling for investment and growth and a minority report  written by some guy from ICI what was his name Beeching?  calling for  of BRs network to be closed. He then picked the author of the minority report to run BR for the next few years.While nothing as bad as Beeching ever happened again BR was constantly attacked by successive governments who starved it of investment while pouring huge sums of money into its private competitors. BR wasnt creating any new routes and continued to close them right until its demise.The Major administration basically said OK lets make this work the other way around. They let National Express Stagecoach Virgin Air et al take over the trains. All of a sudden BRs former enemies wanted oodles of government support for the railways. Lots and lots of sweet government cash.And while it wasnt perfect the positive outcome is that the network is growing now. So it kinda worked its just many people feel service quality has plummeted as a result. Id be surprised if it has to be honest BR did their best with minimal resources but dirty crowded carriages with your seat being your suitcase and no trains ever being on time were my major memories of that organization.,britishproblems,d76oqdd,28,t5_2sumw

I take the time and trouble to find out exactly the regulations governing what I do mostly Health and Safety and UKEU Design and Construction Regulations.  I do it because . expert advice can be wrong or worse misleading and . I have no excuse not to follow the law.  Doing something wrong cos that what I have been told is no excuse either professionally or under the law.  Just as bad is offering information without even having background knowledge of or even where to look for the source reference.Of course I cannot quote word for word the regulations I work to but I do know that they exist as passing knowledge of them and most importantly how to access them.........which is no more information than I was hoping from someone who says with a bit of authority its the law.  Complaining that you do not know the laws to the nth degree in my head or verbatim when you were not even asked is a bit rich.I would have thought that even if they dont help teaching  year olds having a passing knowledge of the laws governing your profession and where to access them would have been obvious but then possibly I have different professional standards.gt looking it up is easy.

It truly is convenience. A one stop shop for everything. But having fresh milk delivered at your door by an electric cart was so wonderfully British it makes me sad weve stopped. Bakeries used to be visited almost daily butchers used to have fresh cuts of meat. People were friendlier back then. Now we go into the supermarket stuff everything into the trolley and go to the self scan checkouts scan our own stuff look around at the helper when it says unexpected item in bagging area who comes over without saying a word and taps staff login and scans his card. We carry on in silence or having muttered a thank you becoming wary of how long were making the people behind us wait and wondering if theyre judging us for how long were taking. We glance at them just to check but the person is playing with their phone. Phew. Continue packing without fear of judgement. Press total. How much? I cant put anything back now and scan to cancel the item. What will everyone think?! Pay for the bags that I used bar one I remembered to bring with me. A Waitrose bag in Asda? Now I hope they dont think Im too middle class to shop here and judge me for that or make a quip about this place being too below my level. Hide the bag and just purchase another Asda one. Its only p and some goes to charity. Put all the bags in the trolley and walk off to the car. Put the stuff in the boot and return the trolley to the trolley stand. Put in the chain. Walk to the car. Remember I forgot to collect the pound. Go back to get my pound. Find Asian man pushing the trolleys back to the store grin on his face and hand reaching into his pocket to safeguard the pound coin I forgot in there. Head back to car. Sit in car. Turn car on.

10574252,0,t1_dd6n7mx,In terms of how often it happens if there is an issue with the atm it can happen multiple times at the same atm and its up to the atm issuer not the bank to fix that issue. The bank will let the atm issuer know. The legal timescales of when you get your money back are dictated by your card issuer aka visa or Mastercard. A bank can have up to  days to contact the atm issuer and ensure its not a fraudulent claim on the atm however in terms of the speed you get your money back I think it can vary per bank. Santander gives customers the money back in  working hours and retrospectively debits if the claim is false. If you want your money back sooner youll probably need to phone RBS and create a fuss and ask to speak to a manager. Theyre quite capable of giving you the money back sooner but will be reluctant to as its not their bank process. ,britishproblems,dd6nghi,3,t5_2sumw
