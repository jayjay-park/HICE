2432757,0,t1_cmcc356,Okay so if the season ends up similar to last year. lets say .  What then?  Because like I said if painter has a good year then hes obviously got to be kept.  But if our season is a failure not making the ncaa tourney in my opinion is a failed season then painter is gone.  Im not going to continue to support a coach whos only had  successful recruiting class.  class that has actually done more than . win percentage. ,Boilermakers,cmce8mz,1,t5_2r6zs
