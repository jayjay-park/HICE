Apparently Klopp and the team figured that Dante is the weak point under pressure and created a formation that would force Bayern to play the ball to Dante more often than usual and then start swarming on him to force a bad pass or him loosing the ball. I hope this and leading  without Lewa was perceived to be a middle finger for the Bayern executives especially Sammer.

2444717,0,t1_cmdtxcz,gt The most successful MLS clubs do that. When they started the Fire were very much a team of the people  they were close to the community involved and all of that. A common complaint right now about the team is that theyve lost some of that personal touch under the current ownership.Something like that can not happen in lets call it nonfranchise football. There are systemic reasons for that. Thats the whole point.,borussiadortmund,cmdvdsm,2,t5_2svdo
2449098,0,t1_cmeeldl,I didnt mean to suggest relocation was a trivial decision in the MLS nor one individual fan groups would necessarily like. Just that it is a viable option even in the face of fan opposition because of the lack of direct accountability to membersfans.Ok fair enough I missed  didnt know about the Rochester Rhinos you mentioned. My point about the relegation system in this context makes less sense now I would agree with your earlier points that history and a clubs specific fan culture grows over time and just because the MLS is a younger league or is differently organised doesnt necessarily make supporters attachments less real or less meaningful. I could however see that depending on the perceived likelihood of a team being uprootedsubject to a topdown rebranding that fan culture would have a harder time growing simply because it was more obvious that fans in a system like that are less necessary. Similar to how teams like Leverkusen Hoffenheim or Fortuna Kln have always had troubles growing their fan bases because most supporters never really felt they were in any way a meaningful cornerstone of the clubs they supported.In combination with that the lack of organic promotion is like a hard cap on what can be achieved via sportive means which again doesnt make it more attractive to support a sports team. Whereas even if highly idealised and romanticised far beyond its defacto impact in modern Bundesliga football someone with a club membership here can at least feel like a tiny cog making his tiny contribution towards a glorious future. And as soon as something formed with a tiny part of your own contribution is at stake this fosters identification with something  not to suggest this is the only way to achieve identification with or attachment to a team but certainly a more powerful one.,borussiadortmund,cmeeuqv,2,t5_2svdo

The translation of the German newspapers this morning is correct but does not take into account the informal and light tone of the interview in which I have never criticized the club and its partners. I simply told about the cultural differences that have provided in my first few months in Germany for some trouble. I would also like to apologize to me IMAGE it was just a joke about another newspaper a Bavarian.

Second half we had the chances but didnt use them. Also why do we get a guy whose only strength is play in the box when he cant score the easiest goals?On a side note I really hated the ref. A really big chance was denied also it was clearly not offenside and besides that the booking he gave us but didnt gave Hoppenheim mainly Schwegler but also Polanski for example seemed really ridiculous.,borussiadortmund,cqw2uxo,6,t5_2svdo

4147912,0,t3_386xnh,Just want to add my thoughts concerning our striker problem.As we saw this season our system requires a striker who holds the balls and waits for the midfielders to come to join the attack movement.The best example of this is the old Chelsea particulary how Drogba was playing. They played similar like Dortmund but less counter attacking. So as this is said we can somehow analyse that Immobile was actually quiet a Fauxpas to sign. I dont want to say he is bad actually he is really strong but in a system where you need a scorer and not a false nine or trequartista.Lewandowski played this in a excellent way he learned to play the system right. In Munich by the way he is playing just a scorer such a waste of talent in my opinion.So Ciro needs a supportive striker to be a threat. And here comes my big issue I had this season Ciro missed the preparation time and training in the beginning of the season so he couldnt learn the tactic and players like auba and reus werent able to adapt and learn his approach to the system.We didnt fit in.Ramos on the other side can play the false nine supportive role as we have seen in Berlin last year. I think we hold ramos but sell Immobile to someone like Benteke Dzeko.In the end we will be surprised who shows up as our .The rumours are quiet limited when it comes to strikers. It is also dependent on tuchels system. I read in the Zeit in Germany that he is a big fan of Pep from Munich but tuchels roots are attacking football with and forward pushing defence. So it will almost be as Klopp but with a slightly less counter attacking. With a lot of pressure but not that vulnerable to counters.Time will tell lads!,borussiadortmund,crt2sk7,2,t5_2svdo

4796546,0,t3_3gkzc7,Full interview in Spanish here Idk my Spanish is a bit rusty maybe someone wants to take a stab at translating this? edit Oh ffsgt Q. How many hours per week did you take German classes?gt A. During training I always had a bilingual translator. Its truly an impossible language.I guess he didnt even take German classes then?gt Q. Was your season only bad because of the language or were there other things?gt A. There were a variety of things. If a team starts poorly you get a mental block and its harder to come back from that. We lost a lot of games because we conceded within the first  seconds and that is a sign that the team is no proper team ?. It was a difficult year for those who were already there but for the new ones like me the problems got even worse. And of course I had originally joined Dortmund because I found their playing style fun.gt Q. What was the biggest problem for you in Germany?gt A. Neither me nor my family got any help at all. We had to suffer through a lot.Gold.More back stabbinggt Q. The Bundesliga is like you expected?gt A. No. I thought it would be more demanding.gt Q. What is Klopp like?gt A. He works a lot with motivation and he gets the most out of his players. We didnt train much on a tactical level. He is a good coach you dont get to the CL final by accident. The season was very difficult we had lots of problems and the team didnt work well.gt Q. Why did you could you not integrate?gt A. You have to share responsibilities. I didnt know any German and I was expecting more help from my team mates. But well you cant pretend to be able to change the culture of an entire country. You find yourself in a bad place if you cant get used to a certain life style.gt Q. For example?gt A. Well here in Spain dinner is at pm and over there it is at pm.

We arent. Economically this may be true as we performa much better than or spending normally should have allow us but that is only because the clubs economic crisis is a quite recent part of our history that we are still learning the lesson from. Traditionally Dortmund are one of the biggest clubs in Europe. I could have taken your claim of RIGHT NOW I think we have some issues seriously had we been th or th in the Bundesliga but we are nd. And our Europa League performance is completely in line with the normal performance of any other top team in the Europa League competitons.

6972864,0,t1_d16h6f1,True but if we were playing Hoffenheim or something we would probably rest some of RAM for at least parts of the league game especially if something went wrong in the first leg and we knew we had to be very strong in the return. Always heightened risks of injury etc in a derby and the fatigue will be immense the way we go at each other. We can only hope we can break down LFC early enough in the first leg so we can take off Reus Schmelzer etc and keep them fit for the derby. We could rotate Shinji and Gonzo Neven and Papa Sahin and Gundo Ginter and Piszczek etc but we dont have a whole lot of depth elsewhere. Kagawa and Reus HAVE TO play in the derby for their derby day attitude alone so I wouldnt even be against resting them in the first leg against LFC. ,borussiadortmund,d16pmdk,2,t5_2svdo
6974423,0,t3_4b7y0t,Kagawa is near invisible. Now is that because hes having a bad game or because he just doesnt get the support by our DMs?    Now with Augsburgs  in the back playing deep down the pitch there SHOULD be a big gap somewhere in their midfield since their forward three are aggressively counterpressing our buildup play. We just cant utilize it yet.    But its nothing Tuchel cant fix tactically in the halftime now. I want to see Castro either for Kagawa or as DM as hes made those crucial passes in the recent games instead of Gndogan.,borussiadortmund,d16vznl,4,t5_2svdo

6975810,0,t1_d1715l0,Yeah I get that but if your possession play consists of  touches in  minutes of which  are between your defenders and yourself you need to adapt. If your usual playmakers for these keypasses are taken out of the game and you have opportunities to play keypasses yourself and Weigl had plenty of these it might be time to take a risk yourself and attempt to play these kinda passes. All I saw from Weigl was one long ball towards the left wing that was it.    I agree with you though. Weigl has a very welldefined role in the squad and the way he fills it is very impressively. But look at his age of course theres room for improvement.,borussiadortmund,d171npt,3,t5_2svdo

7046265,0,t3_4c3x6k,The BVB at this time was a sensation. For years no club could rival FC Bayern and Klopp won the titles out of nothing. It was a sign Klopps kids played the most amazing soccer and started to rise to Europes top. Everyone at that time wanted to join our team even Ibrahimovic stated so in a interview even though it was  kidding. Lewa said literally why would I leave to Bayern BVB is the better club Goetze said he wanted to stay here till the end of his career and he was even building a house. And he even prolonged his contract for years to come. Everything looked so amazing and innocent at that time. My guess is that our number of supporters more than tripled. It was only a question of time till we would the champions league. The future surely looked bright. Then out of nowhere we all got the message at night that Goetze is going to leave for Bayern a few days before the CL final. And suddenly everything started to crumble. This was a brutal blow to our innocence and it was delivered by our golden poster boy whom we all loved so much. It was special you could tell because all my friends called me the next day and everyone was shocked. Even on TV the soccer prominence was trying to find words. Hell even Schalke who hate us united with us. Everyone started to hate FC Bayern for what they did to this amazing and beloved team. And the BVB supporters started to channel their feelings into the hate of Goetze who crushed our hopes our innocence and our spirit. And it was made possible by an exit close which entered his contract  months before. And suddenly it all felt like betrayal. Like they prolonged the contract on purpose just to make sure the exit clause would enable Bayern to buy him and earn him big money. We lost the CL final very closely Goetze was even injured in this game and if the referee would have ball Bayern would have earned a red and a yellowred in this game which surely would have made us win the game. Bayern took back the lead BVB was beaten by money and something innocent and great was crushed. This was a time when we thought money is not everything spirit and good ideas are just as good when Goetze reminded us that money is everything. This is of course a metaphor for our normal lives as well where money is ruling our world. I dont hate Goetze any more I am  sure that he was ill advised by his staff. But at this time I started to truly hate Bayern and this will probably never stop. In the very end Bayern did a huge mistake with buying Goetze. This cost them so much sympathy and potential supporters in Germany. Time for Goetze to come back home admit his mistakes and make Bayern pay for their arrogance! ,borussiadortmund,d1f1vwq,9,t5_2svdo
7048816,0,t3_4c5gwd,I am far more concerned with his answer regarding his own situation. Id like to stay in Dortmund a bit longer... But I know this will be my last big contract and it will have to be long term. That response sets off a ton of alarm bells in my head. Hummels is an honest guy he says it like it is  so that response indicates that he wants another challenge in his career and this transfer window might be his only shot at it. If you watch the interview he even got a bit nervous and seemed a little hesitant and uneasy when the discussion gravitated towards his own contract. I think its clear that he wont spend the rest of his career here. I wont begrudge Mats anything wherever he goes but it would be crushing to lose El Capitano this summer. And I think its looking more and more likely.I think our best hope for keeping him may be a short contract extension similar to what weve done with Gundogan last year. I do think he may want another shot at the Bundesliga title and CL with us. As for Gotze I dont think Mats is working the Dortmund PR machine here. I think hes just giving professional answers.,borussiadortmund,d1fcaiq,19,t5_2svdo

7186474,0,t3_4dvbzg,tldr at the bottomFirst off Im in Germany right now which is pretty rad since its my first time out of the United States and everywhere Ive been to in Germany is wonderful. It is for an student exchange trip between my school in New Jersey and my host familys gymnasium in Oelde NordrheinWestfalen nicht weit von Dortmund!.After we arrived by plane in Mnchen we toured the city with just the rest of my classmates. The tour guide was a total Bayern fanatic and was telling all of us to support Bayern that night against Liabon or Benfica. Munich was great pretty tasty and many other positive adjectives if we forget about their soccer team. The next day we bussed to Austria and toured around Salzburg which I found even prettier that Munich. The day after that we went to Wendelstein Germany which is a massive snow capped mountain that required a mountain train to get on top and a cable car to get down. Wendelstein is undoubtably the most beautiful place I have ever visited. Any picture you find of it online can barely compare what you can see with your eyes  in person. After Wendelstein we bussed for  hours to Oelde to meet our host families. My host family is wonderful with very kind parents a sweet younger sister and my main exchange partner a  year old boy like me. We go to his classes at his gymnasium and I try my best to understand fully what the teacher and classmates are saying. Im at the level of my education into German where I can pick out a few words of what he is saying and decipher what the sentence means but not the more important words that are related to his subject like a specific chemical in his chemistry class. Now for the juicy part. Hes a Schalke fan which is slightly awkward being that Im a Dortmund fan obviously and the derby is this weekend so we will watch the game either in his living room or with his other friends. The whole situation is pretty damn coincidental and somewhat laughable considering that the game could have been any other matchday of the year but it just happens to be the weekend Im staying with my German partner. Thank god that the exchange partner is quickly becoming a good friend of mine and is mostly ok with me being a Dortmund fan as well as the parents not being too passionate about the sport or else I would have run the risk of being thrown out of the house. But yeah I just find it all interesting about being lucky enough for being in Germany for the derby while being in a house filled with Schalke fans. Sorry for the long comment.tldr Im in Germany for a school trip. My host family a bunch of Schalke fans. Im watching the derby with them. Should be interesting. To all Germans your country is awesome.And if anyone could give me suggestions for any good places to eat in Berlin that would be superb. ,borussiadortmund,d1v1gk5,11,t5_2svdo

The sooner Mats leaves and we supporters can settle down in unity again the happier I will be with it all.

7870380,0,t3_4n18wf,I think this is a fair question tbh and even though weve had a few Pulisic stories posted in the past they didnt really address this.Out of our new signings I doubt that Merino Rode or Bartra will compete for the same position as Pulisic. Demble and Mor on the other hand are both attacking players who seem versatile enough to compete with Pulisic for appearances though both are joining us from less competitive leagues. Its always hard to predict how well players as young as these three do in short to midterm but especially towards the beginning of the season I expect Pulisic will have an advantage over the new arrivalsReus is injured we dont have a final confirmation yet about Micky  there will be space on our wings. Pulisic already has half a year under Tuchel so unless our coach for some reason doesnt want to use him I expect him to get more or less the same minutes as at the end of the  season at least for the first  or so league games. After that itll mostly depend on how well our other options on the wings perform out of our newcomers especially Dembel.As others have pointed out its a bit early to tell though  well know more when we see the first lineups for our test games.,borussiadortmund,d40pbox,3,t5_2svdo

8182372,0,t3_4rdz3p,This is one of those debates that cant be had without defining the scope of the argument. Define top team.If there are  clubs in its purest sense only  is at the top at any given moment in time and that is the club that wins the Champions League. Been some time since weve done that.But given that a game or two can be affected by circumstance we rarely go with that. No we take domestic performance into account disregard financial balance sometimes take into account history disregard quality of support consider prestige value onpaper squad strength. And we narrow it down into a few tiers. Sometimes it means the consistently top tier sometimes it means the traditionally top tier sometimes it means the recently top tier. Then how do we split the tiers? Top ? Top ? Top ? Top ? Top ?By most generally accepted standards Borussia Dortmund is not a top team. Of course neither is PSG Arsenal Man City Liverpool. Currently I would say the two Madrids Barcelona Juve and Bayern are the top teams. Manchester United follows them on sheer prestige despite their recent performance thanks to SAFs era. Chelsea BVB PSG City are a rank below top tier but we are up here on account of recent successes whether bought or earned. Arsenal loiters around on consistency while Liverpool Milan are hanging on the threshold of big clubs on account of name value from long past successes. Below those you get the Bayer Spurs Roma types that are consistently pretty good but never top. Liverpool actually belongs here now but hey.,borussiadortmund,d50chi5,7,t5_2svdo

All of them earn a ton of money right now and they wont come to us if they have to take huge cuts in that regard I believe. High wages for certain players could potentially have a snowball effect and lead to other players demanding higher wages or a bad signing would cost us even more that way. While this is not a super realistic scenario for us its not like this is a farfetched and completely unrealistic concern in general. Lots of clubs have had this problem before among them the BVB.

And given that his salaries are insanely high hell already have costed Manure around  million euros by Christmas and at least  million by next summer. Small sums for Manu a team thats basically thrown  million euros down the drain the last  years on player transfers alone the last summer spending  mill alone on Pogba  what a fucking investment that was and come not only unscathed but even richer out of it. But  mill euros a season is  mill euros too much if all he does is rot on the bench.At Christmas hell probably be throwing a fit at Manures management demanding that he gets to transfer to whatever midtable club in the PL that has the money to waste on him. Maybe get Raiola to throw a chair or two for him too. Thats how he left Shaktar for us. Thats how he left us for Manure.,borussiadortmund,d9cnki9,1,t5_2svdo

9707350,0,t1_da9gvj4,Id like to add my opinion to the mix here because I am in some way one of the complainers. While I fully appreciate the level of tactical flexibility and brilliance that TT brings to the club I am saddened to see that identifying with the club and the region plays a even smaller role every year. The selling of Kevin and Kuba or the way he treats Kagawa are examples where TT was involved in if not leading the decision against loyalty and for a more cold business standard approach.The second complaining point so to say is that the more clinical and rational approach might work better in  of the games but last season showed that we lacked the punch and the will in the most important and most clutch games towards the end of the season. I have the feeling we will not see a second Malaga under Tuchel because I cant see him pushing a team to give  and keep faith till the last second. That being said no one is perfect and to expect a manager to be both a tactical mastermind and an emotional leader is a bit much. Even Guardiola could not fill these shoes. So after all I am happy to have TT right now. ,borussiadortmund,da9n0nb,7,t5_2svdo

10109392,0,t1_dbp91bq,All that is true for Hummels as well though and he never worked as a DM. Theres much more too it than just being an more forward CB a DM needs to control the game from the back his passes need to be perfect he has to be the anchor of the team espescially if you are the attacking team as we are  cases. Playing a CB as DM only works in certain cases. Just look at the derbi madrileno in the CL . Over both legs Ancelotti played Ramos as DM and he delivered literally the best performance Ive ever seen from a Defensive midfielder because all he had to do was breaking down Atleticos constant counter attacks he was more of a free roaming third CB than a DM. The game after the CL Carlo tried that again but since Madrid was the dominant team by a mile Ramos was dogshit because his role in that game was drastically different he had to do what Kroos normally does directing the midfield. And its the same for us Weigl plays very similar to how Kroos plays for Madrid and he excells in that role he is bossing the midfield when we are the dominating team but he tends to be bad when we are not because he does not have that defensive ability. It needs a very special kind of player to combine both like Xabi or Busquets do. Martinez as well before Pep decided to turn one of the best DMs in the world into a mediocre CB.,borussiadortmund,dbp9j4r,4,t5_2svdo

10826327,0,t3_5ut64k,Now this was against Golfsburg who were on the day very very tame. Except Arnold who is a cunt by default they rarely ever fought for a result here and made it stupid easy. Bruma was even nice enough to gift us that first goal after which we are rarely overturned. So these things do mitigate the stock we can put in this result.  That said there were a massive amount of positives to take from the game.   Holy fuck Castro played like a midfielder. Unlike many games where our midfielder was entirely focused on attack Castro dipped back to offer support and put in a defense shift. Owing in part to VWs lenient pressing he chose his passes and chose them well rather than constantly dribbling into defenders as weve grown accustomed to seeing from our midfield.   Wingers put in a solid solid shift in defense. In recent games we have had very little defending from our wide forwards which in turn put tremendous strain on our wingbacks. Today Reus won  tackles Schurrle won . Wolfsburgs wings looked utterly unthreatening between our wings and sidebacks.   The veterans showed up. With MOTM Piszczek stepping up Reus and Castro putting in a shift we took the load and pressure off Weigl Ginter and Dembele who all had very effective games. Kagawa was influential off the bench as well. Very comfortable game to ease in young fringe player like Merino.   Tuchel did well. Although we started off a bit imbalanced with Schurrle sitting too deep and both Castro and Dembele advancing we adjusted during the game. He actually tried something new with the subs. Taking the game to the ground against a VW that gave us space was the right game plan and we actually saw some good football for the first time in months.   We kept a clean sheet. Even taking into account the fact that VW are a shit club our defenders did well. Helped by the midfield and wings we allowed only  shots of which only  were on target. The absolute boss was veteran Lukasz who won nearly everything he took on but Ginter also had a very reliable performance and Bartra had a solid shift bar a few times he tried to murder Burki for reasons unknown.   We kept focus. Customary lapse once or twice but for the most part we were focused. We controlled the game well not rushing into attack when it wasnt the best option. We dictated the tempo of the game and caught a breath when we wanted to.  It was just VW but for the first time in weeks we outright deserved to win and I will take that. ,borussiadortmund,ddwnqrd,24,t5_2svdo

11326407,0,t1_dffqykt,Inside Half is that a Japanese football term? They also call wingbacks Side Half and central midfielders center half sometimes though Volante is more popular for the latter. Come to think of it I dont think Ive seen the term Inside Half used much in western football spheres. Inside half is a sort of hybrid midfielder part centermid part winger part . Its pretty much how Klopp used Gotze when he played with Kagawa at  and how Tuchel used Kagawa in last seasons hinrunde with him sitting further forward than Gundogan connecting Gundogan to Reus but not sitting central in a  position. In the back end of the season Mkhitaryan played that role starting nominally as a reverse right winger but playing the right half space as opposed to the touchline.

Im hesitant to being downright optimistic because monaco did manage to win against Man City  I just looked up the post match thread and found This comment after sifting through literally dozens of lol leicester is now the only english team in the CL comments.... and it basically says that Monaco performed really well and that Citys defense was lacking at times.Now its good to hear that City made some errors too which contributed to them being scored on but its not like we defend perfectly any given day of the week. Especially with  at the back we used to get scored on more often and Id rather not see  at the back without Bartra like in the first game against Monaco. And just receiving one goal could be a game ender.And when it comes to the terrorst attack Id like to say that it effects should waning on our players. Or that at least theyd be performing better than last week. But I dont know if its that easy... Shit like that sticks to you makes you think and think tires you out.
