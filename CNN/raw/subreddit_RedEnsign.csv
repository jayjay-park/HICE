11085271,0,t3_5ya7r5,Reading through the year plan  is pretty interesting.  For examplegtTo address racial inequities we need better racebased disaggregated data  data that can be broken down so that we further understand whether specific segments of the population are experiencing adverse impacts of systemic racism. We also need a standard framework and guidelines to ensure data is collected consistently. Reliable usable and comparable disaggregated racebased data across governmentfunded programs will help us monitor the impact of its policies and programs on different segments of the population. It will help us identify institutional outcomes patterns and potential biases.In the s in Toronto the police were keeping racial statistics.  Then those statistics showed that blacks in certain areas were committing a hugely disproportionate amount of crime If memory serves  of assaults and robbery    murderattempted murder etc.  Whatever you believe about the cause of such things the numbers didnt look very nice.  Such things discovered the statistics were deemed racist and the police were banned from collecting that data.  Now and then within the last year Ive heard talking heads considering bringing back racial statistics since without them its tough to analyse racial biases.One wonders how long it will take for the same farcical cycle to occur at the federal level.The report sets out a term which Id heard but never used in this fashiongtRacializationRefers to the the process by which societies construct races as real different and unequal in ways that matter to economic political and social life Commission on Systemic Racism in the Ontario Criminal Justice System . Racial categories are not based on science or biology but on differences that society has chosen to emphasize with significant consequences for peoples lives. People can be racialized not only based on skin colour but also other perceived characteristics such as their culture language customs ancestry country or place of origin or religion as is the case with Islamophobia and antisemitism.I thought that liberals had abandoned the race is just a social construct theory due to its anecdotal and scientific silliness but apparently not.  I guess we should expect politicians to be a little behind the bleeding edge.gtThe Ministry of Education is leading an Indigenous Education Strategy to improve Indigenous students educational attainment from K and support their transition to postsecondary education training or the workplace. The Ministry is also working with Indigenous partners to revise the Ontario curriculum to include mandatory learning on treaties the history of residential schools and the legacy of colonialism.amp gtWorking with the Ministry of Education and school boards we will strengthen and promote educational resources for K students which aim to mitigate and prevent Islamophobic behaviour.ampgtThe Ministry of Education directed provincially funded school boards to work closely with Indigenous partners to review team names logos and mascots to raise awareness about the negative impact of stereotypes on individuals schools and communities.While I think an understanding of the residential school system is probably a good topic for kids to learn about in the history of Canada Though I remember it being a topic in my elementary and high school classes so its already there in Ontario this is an example of why I think liberalism always wins.  Your typical keep the government outta this n that conservative wants few or sporadic controls on this type of thing The information which forms the basis of childrens developing worldview whereas liberalism deliberately implants itself at as early an age as possible.  Again one wonders... this time about whether the lessons on colonialism will mention African nations which flourished under colonial rule and subsequently imploded with democracy and decolonisation.Also theres a guy with Downs Syndrome in the background images near the bottom of the report p.  Its not significant or anything but I just though it was odd for an explicitly antiracism report.,RedEnsign,deoi7rz,2,t5_3cfff
