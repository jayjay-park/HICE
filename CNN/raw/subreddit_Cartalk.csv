121307,0,t3_1vhar0,P  A Camshaft Position  Timing OverAdvanced or System Performance Bank gtWhat does that mean? A code P refers to the VVT variable valve timing or VCT variable camshaft timing components and the cars PCM powertrain control module also called an ECM. That consists of a few different components but the P DTC specifically refers to the camshaft cam timing. In this case if the cam timing is above a set limit overadvanced the engine light will be illluminated and the code will be set. The A camshaft is either the intake left or front camshaft. gtPotential Symptoms Most likely a P DTC will result in one of the following hard starting poor idle andor stalling. There are potentially other symptoms as well. Of course when trouble codes are set the MIL malfunction indicator lamp a.k.a. the check engine light illuminates. gtCauses A P DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following Incorrect camshaft timing Wiring problems harnesswiring in intake timing control valve control solenoid system Continuous oil flow to VCT piston chamber Failed timing valve control solenoid stuck open gtPossible Solutions This DTC code is a result of a mechanical fault of the VCT unit or related components so there is no need for electrical diagnosis. Refer to vehicle specific repair manual to perform component tests for the VCT unit. Notes Dealer techs have advanced tools and the ability to follow detailed troubleshooting steps including the ability to test components using a scan tool.TLDR You need to take it somewhere and have it diagonosed.

231339,0,t3_1wrg4r,Spun bearing is very bad. The single heaviest and most important part inside the engine block is the crankshaft this shaft is what the pistons are connected to through their connecting rods as they go up and down they push the throws on the crankshaft which powers the car. The crankshaft rides on a series of oillubricated bearings as well the connecting rods are supported by oillubricated bearings series . One of these has according to your mechanic spun inside its fitting and has now done severe and irreversible damage to the crank and if its a connecting rod bearing damage to the connecting rod as well. These parts exist in the very heart of the engine which must be removed and almost completely disassembled to reach. It is likely cheaper to replace the engine. I cant say if its worth to repair or not Im sure what a  Camry is worth but you may well be better off looking for a new car. I doubt repairing the engine is worth it a replacement engine will probably cost less.,Cartalk,cf4q5sv,5,t5_2s47e

When doing this you want to have the key to the ON position in the ignition switch. I just used speaker wire to connect both ends and remove connection once the engine starts. If your car turns on using this speaker wire battery to solenoid tab on starter hotwire then you know your issue is your your ignition switch or associated wiring.This video will probably help you see what I mean I think my explanation may be confusing Edit this is a better starter testing video that makes it really simple our Subaru starter is pretty much the exact same set up ,Cartalk,cfczyi4,3,t5_2s47e

364801,0,t3_1y959o,I realize you said that your foot is off the gas when this happens but is there a possibility that this happens when you are trying to maintain speed on a flat surface or a hill? By this I mean say your at  and you want to keep it there so you give it just enough gas to do so. Does that sound like a possibility? Going off of the information which you gave me its really hard to diagnose. Is it an intermittently stocking caliper? But putting it in neutral wouldnt make the shaking stop. The reason I asked about the maintaining speed thing is that these crvs tend to have issues with the torque converter. They tend to act up between mph and cause a front end shaking that can be pretty intense at times. When was the last transmission service? How many miles are in it now?

Ill go to town tomorrow and pick up a stethoscope and see if I can pinpoint it I tried a video but its so fucking loud under the car now it ended up being a mess of static. Being under the car while it was running with this noise hurt my ears and this same car has a  watt RMS SQ built system in it so Im no stranger to loud noises. If I track it to the trans Ill drop the pan.On the offhand that this is what happened and besides a good line flush with a new radiator whats a good ballpark on a reputable shop rebuilding a R? I can pull it myself but Ive opened an auto before and I may be confident in doing a manual but Ill leave the autos to the pros. I have a shop in mind they put it in my ass when the trans in my  deVille went out  but they do good work. All I can figure is metal is expanding enough to rub against other metal or something rotating is getting pissed off. What about a power steering pump going bad like worn shaft bearings? The steering DOES feel sluggish but its been a while since Ive driven it and the fluid in the reservoir mounted to the pump looks dark.

749795,0,t3_22qdua,Im kinda confused about what happened here.You took your car to Phillips  and they did an oil change but put the wrong size filter on it.You dropped it off where and for what? Did you take it back to them or another shop?After you picked it up your oil pressure gauge was low? Someone more familiar with Dodge and their motors could probably answer this better but Fords oil sensors from at least  to  were just a sensor to say if it had more than X oil pressure not a specific amount. If it dropped below itd go down completely if not itd float around wherever it wanted.  When you say it sounded dry what do you mean? If you were to run out of oil youd get little to no warning especially if it was dry and youd experience catastrophic failure pretty quickly that would be very noticeable.Are you sure this noise is coming from the lifters?Im confused what youre asking here is what possible? That they put on a filter that is too small? Id say so but a lot of this sounds strange to me. Also this is a very good reason why it is a good idea to avoid EZ Lube etc. shops and do the oil change yourself that way you know what is going on your vehicle and dont have to second guess a minimum wage employees work.,Cartalk,cgpib25,1,t5_2s47e

790016,0,t3_23721i,I recently did the same repair on an older Camry. I bought a pair of Monroe Econostruts for about  each. Its a really straightforward and easy swap. Heres what I ran into Youll need a breaker bar if you dont have air tools. I bought this one for  and it worked great. Youll need the appropriate sized socketmine were mm to remove the strut from the steering knuckle as well as a wrench of the same size to hold the bolt in place. Depending on what brand of socket and breaker bar you get you may need to get a  to  adapter. Figure  at most for this. You will need a floor jack and at least one jack stand. Once one corner is lifted and on the jack stand you can use the floor jack to support the steering knuckle while you lower it out of the car Youll obviously need some sockets and misc wrenches to remove and secure the  bolts that mount the strut to the body. I dont remember what size they were. Probably mm.Some gotchas that I encountered When removing the mm lower strut mounting bolts make sure youre trying to loosen the nut and not the bolt. The nut pops right off but the bolt will leave you crying. Also the bolts will only slide out if the strutsteering knuckle isnt weighing down on them or isnt under compression. The second bolt on the first side I attempted got stuck as soon as it cleared one side of the mounting bracket because I hadnt loosened the top mount nuts yet. I would do that first. Support the steering knuckle with the floor jack before you loosen the top mount nuts or it will drop and hit the floor and possibly swing out and hit you. On the drivers side the mm nuts are behind the brake caliper which you will need to remove entirely to get access to. Be sure to have something tallish to support the caliper on such that you dont kink the brake linesame deal as when you are swapping out pads. The bolts on mine were a bit seized so Id suggest giving it one try and then hitting it with PB BlasterWDyour penetrating fluid of choice and then walking away for  minutes before trying again. Aside from all that you may find yourself repeatedly raising and lowering the strut assembly in order release tension from various components while removing and installing the struts. Removing the sway bar end link requires a bit of such fiddling in order to pop out the end that mounts to the strut.I used this video as a reference which shows just how easy this is to do at home. Its for a Camry but the Corolla is exactly the same. I hope this helps.Edit I found a video thats for the Corolla here Its the previous gen Corolla but should still be the same. He goes the extra mile of disassembling the strut to replace the shock absorber but its not necessary with the Monroe quickstruts.All in all its a great DIY job and youll acquire some neat tools that youll use again and again in the process. I used the same breaker baralbeit with much more muscle to break loose the harmonic balancer pulley bolt on the same Camry flex.Edit  I looked at your pic again and it looks like theres rust on the shock absorber shaft. If dirt and debris have gotten on to it it may have also gotten inside the shock which canwill cause wear on the seals. This results in a leaky strut which will eventually fail entirely. If your car has excessive bounce or the top strut mount is clanking around then I would just go ahead and replace the whole assembly like you were planning.,Cartalk,cgu2ugq,7,t5_2s47e

1117321,0,t1_chv6gd7,There may be a problem beyond your brake pads.A wear indicator is a piece of steel set back from the surface of the pad that contacts the rotor to stop your car. When the pad is worn down about  that piece of steel will become flush with the brake pads friction surface so when the caliper squeezes the brake pads into the rotor to stop the car so too will the wear indicator rub on the rotor making a high pitched noise.It sounds like your pads are dragging in other words they are not getting pulled back when you release the brake. Brake drag hurts your gas mileage and makes your pads wear out faster.

1214775,0,t3_280gmi,First off  oil leaking from the bottom can be a very bad sign. Thats not to say that it IS but it can be. It might be something as simple as the distributor o ring leaking but could also be as big of a job as the rear main seal leaking which would require the removal of the transmission Not an easy job for a rookie.Secondly  replace that ball joint. NOW. The last thing you want to have happen is this   when youre driving on the freeway.Third  Tires? Yeah those will need to get replaced. They almost always do.Fourth  Brake lines are pretty easy as well especially if theyre the fronts. Also see if you can get the rotors turned instead of having them replaced it might be worth it.Hondas will run forever if you keep them maintained.

However the only reason it knows a bulb is out is because the total resistance of the circuit has changed or the amperage flow has changed however you prefer to think of it.  Because of how the flasher determines a bulb is out it can be fooled into thinking a bulb is out when its not. The flasher can be fooled if an improperly sized bulb is put in.

1656693,0,t1_cjmmzdk,well at least you now know the alternator probably wont fail in the cars life time.  When you replaced the battery was it with a battery of equal or greater rating? if the battery was too small maybe its confusing the cars electrical  systems. A way to test if a battery is completely inadequate is to turn on all the electronics if the headlights dim when everything else is turned on then it may have too low amp outputthis  isnt a good way to test this i only know it from installing powerful car stereos which draw a lot from the battery. the battery should have a rating on it but beware some of the amp ratings on the battery have little to do with its power output.im now out of my experience so this is speculation. based on the battery problems and the brake warning light i speculate  If it has electric brakes maybe the brakes have some electrical component which is faulty and sucking energy.  ABS system maybe since its also a combination of brakes and electronics. could the kicking you described be caused by the brakes rapidly coming on and off? ABS can get over sensitive as it ages. maybe the cars computer is just going crazy that can cause all kinds of weird problems.  ,Cartalk,cjnzmla,1,t5_2s47e

If the tires are generally in the same condition less than a  or s difference in tread depth and assuming that the  not being replaced arent in need of replacement. Then I personally think they should go to the primary drive axle. This does NOT apply to running  winter tires which is borderline illegal and a poo storm of liability.  winter tires should go to the rear ALWAYS. My arguement for the primary drive axle arguement is that those  tires generally suffer most of the abuse thus wear faster. If you follow the  best to the rear rule then any tire rotation on a front wheel drive car is essentially a scam. On a FWD car the fronts do most of the work and wear way faster than the rears. ,Cartalk,cjv6kso,1,t5_2s47e

1731602,0,t3_2e9png,I turned the heat on to defrost a bit FC  humidity foggy windshield and the car was audibly revving every  seconds or so for about one second at a time.Those are pretty much the exact symptoms of a failed radiator fan for a PT Cruiser.  Its a very common problem for those cars.If the radiator fan doesnt turn on at low speeds and the AC compressor engages the car will overheat the idle will stumble it will surge and drop down feeling like the car is going to stall and the ECU will shut off the compressor to keep it from overheating more.  Its possible the AC was working fine for the long car trip because the airflow from highway speeds was cooling things enough to keep it operational. Id suggest turning your car on letting it get to operating temperature and turning the AC on while it idles.  Pop the hood and listen and look to see if the fan is engaging.  If the fan doesnt turn on and your car starts to buck thats probably your culprit.,Cartalk,cjxflli,5,t5_2s47e

This creates more metal flying around exacerbating the problem causing trouble in other gears. At times you arent able to get the shifter all the way into the gear position because metal is getting lodged between the collar and the gear not allowing the selector fork to move all the way forward but still forward enough to engage the gear this lack of movement is translated to the shifter. Unfortunately this means its time for a rebuild.

From my limited experience with car electronics  it sounds like you have a loose connection or a connectivity problem given its intermittent. Im guessing that you have a relay that controls the blower. Maybe check that first. Also check any fuses to make sure theyre nice and snug. One more question. Is your climate settings digitally controlled where you set the temp and the car does the rest? I ask because I had a car with a terrible alternator problem.  One time the voltage regulator went out I got overvoltage as a result.

Its a  Honda Civic. Roughly k miles on it. The only info I have on the gas currently is that it apparently does not smell like gas. So maybe water contaminated? It was just regular unleaded fuel I filled up with.As far as the repairs  They first dropped the gas tankpan and drained the fuel filled with good fuel and tried to start it. Didnt work. They replaced the spark plugs as they said they were dirtydamaged. Didnt work. After further diagnosis they said there was engine damage and that they replaced the engine block and head gasket. and Im sure other things as well but thats what was told to be over the phoneEverything besides the gas draining they are billing under the warranty. I was going to make another post once I had a complete list of repairsand I still may depending on how this all turns out but at this point Im feeling like the dealership being sketchy is just as likely as Chevron.My insurance has already agreed to issued a check and I was planning on picking up the car and pay the balancedeductible of .

3020249,0,t3_2uqdd2,The only way changing the fluid can damage a transmission is if the detergents in the new fluid clean gunk out of the transmission that clogs the filter.  Thats why at that mileage its generally recommended that you change the filter too. Honda doesnt recommend changing the filter on this car for whatever reason and its apparently really difficult to get to anyway.Another reason people think its a bad idea to change the fluid is because they wait for the car to start shifting poorly to change the ATF.  The transmission dies shortly thereafter so they blame the new fluid instead of the fact they drove the car with used up ATF far longer than they should have.  The last reason I can think of is as the clutches wear in an automatic transmission the friction material gets suspended in the fluid.  If the clutches are worn out this friction material in the fluid can actually keep them from slipping for a while. This is why you hear people claim that they changed the fluid and the transmission immediately started slipping.  Honda recommends doing  drain and refills with driving between each.  Thats their version of a flush.  I found this video documenting the process one thing not mentioned in the video is that the bolt is a magnet and you should wipe if off before reinstalling.  ,Cartalk,cob1obo,2,t5_2s47e

3027096,0,t3_2utvkt,The crunching sound was the reverse gear engaging and the parking prawl being ground down. It did damage your transmission undoubtably. The nature of these things is that theres a finite life in them. And although preventative maintance can slow down the rate at which you wear out the machine its very difficult to restore it. And since youre asking this question on the internet and reading this opinion its unlikely that you can fix a transmission yourself. Camrys can take a ton of abuse. Take the time to be nice to it and itll get you to k miles without any major issues. If you want to feel better about get the transmission fluid changed. The worst thing about a crunching sound is that it suggests two metal parts ground against each other and released metal shavings into your transmission. There are filters to deal with it but a number of the particles are suspended in the fluid and wearing against your transmissions components. In the future be nicer to your transmission. I dont even shift directly from reverse to drive in my Toyota. I put it in neutral before changing the direction. Ive never blown a transmission and frankly I dont anticipate it to happen.

3319746,0,t3_2y5qxj,Need to get the battery tested. It probably needs to be replaced. Lead acid batteries dont do well with sitting long periods without charging. If you dont drive much just start the car once a week and take it for a short drive to prevent the battery from going bad.The battery needs to be able to discharge a certain amount of amps to turn the engine fast enough to start or even engage the starter. The battery could have enough amps to power the lights radio or make the starter click but not have enough to turn the starter. If the battery turns out to be good it could be the starter solenoid. Or a bad spot on the starter. Best bet then would be a new starter. I had this problem with my Subaru and a light tap on the starter would help it to work temporarily.

This will piss him off but will guarantee the engine doesnt get hurt during loading. If he can start it then your grandparents have been turning it on every once in awhile and you probably dont have anything to worry about regarding damage.Once the cars in your hands I would put new tires on it get an oil change and if the battery was in fact dead I would also drain the gas tank and refill with fresh gas because you dont know how long that gas has been sitting in there. If it does start Id probably just pour a bottle of octane boost in there out of an overabundance of caution and call it good.Inspect all the rubber hoses and the serpentine belt. If there are holes or cracks replace. Reinspect the hoses after you turn the car on and it warms up  sometimes hoses get pinhole leaks in them that you will never find unless the coolant is under pressure and spitting out of them.Beyond that youre probably pretty good especially if it was stored under a roof.

Also forcing the fan to run all the time is actually detrimental to airflow while the car is moving. I would suggest undoing that if its something youve done. When you sit still the car will obviously heat up more because no air is moving through the radiatorwhich is why majority of cooling fans only come on at a standstill  to move air when nothing else will when you accelerate  air moves through and the cooling takes place like its supposed to.From your description it doesnt sound like overheating honestly.

4227893,0,t1_cs19dpg,You cant do that. The one way valves on the ports will hold pressure but not the vacuum you just created with the pump. What you need to do is rent an AC manifold kit along with that pump. Autozone can generally get them but they usually need to order them so make sure you talk to someone who knows what theyre doing and give it a day or so. Youll want to look up the procedure yourself but basically you hook up the manifold to both ports high and low pressure hook up the pump to the third hose open both valves theres one for high and one for low pressure turn the pump on until you achieve a deep enough vacuum dont know what the value is then close the valves you HAVE to do this before turning off the pump. disconnect the pump from the hose then hook up that hose to a refrigerant can and open i think the low pressure valve not sure here and basically fill it up that way.

Take extra time to make sure the gasket surfaces on the pan and the transmission housing where it mates up are perfectly clean and free of rust and pitting.. Check for stuff in the bottom of the pan. You will probably find a flat disc magnet in there that attracts ferrous material and it will be covered in metal shavings. When you clean the pan remove the magnet if possible and remove as much of the metal shavings as possible. You want to have a clean magnet so that it can continue to collect nasties in the future.. You need a third party dipstick. Dorman makes a popular one Be aware its highly negatively reviewed by idiots who think its a replacement for their transmission fill cap. To properly read the transmission level youll need to find a chart usually in the service manual youll need to do some Googling for your transmission relating fluid temperature to a height on the dipstick.

7518918,0,t3_4ibybp,The radiator is only like  of the total coolant. The rest sits in the engine and heater etc.  To fill the system up you will need to run the water pump and also have the heater thermostat open.  I guess this varies between cars but on one car I had you had to warm the engine up fully and put the heater on high to get the water to flow through the heater.  It also had a bleed point for the heater so you could open this up run the engine until coolant started coming out of it then close it off.BTW this is one important reason to use coolant mixture instead of just water even if you dont live in a cold area. Plain water will corrode the metal inside your engine whereas coolant inhibits this.Someone suggested  coolant mix but in my experience  is more common  read your engine manual and the bottle of coolant you buy,Cartalk,d2wv409,3,t5_2s47e

7559159,0,t3_4iuf96,Id venture to guess thats the fuel return line.  The way most fuel injection systems work is with a feed line running fuel up to the engine and then a return line that goes all the way from the engine bay back to the fuel tank.  The reason for this is to regulate fuel pressure.  The fuel pressure regulator is after all the injectors so that anything before it is held at a certain pressure and it bleeds off any excess fuel to get it down to the right pressure.  On more complicate setups they can control the flow of the fuel pump depending on the load of the engine or the accelerator.  I think your audi is doing this and when you accelerate hard its pushing more fuel through the pump and thus dumping more out of that line.I could be totally wrong as I do see another line going up to the front from there and I havent worked on a B A .t specifically.If you plug it and it is the return line then extra pressure will build up in the fuel system causing your inejctors to spray more fuel in than the computer is thinking it is which makes you run rich which could foul up the oxygen sensors and break other things.  Probably not good on the fuel pump either.,Cartalk,d31fui5,2,t5_2s47e

7734841,0,t3_4l8ppd,Not focusing on safety especially as a newbie can kill you.  Even experienced DIY people all too often get lazy and fall victim to this.  Remember youre thowing a lot of weight in the air then crawling under it. It WILL kill you if you get pinned underneath probably slowly and painfully so dont fuck around with this. Use jackstands.  They are  for a pair.   No excuses.  NEVER get under a car or have an arm or a leg underneath any part of a car that is supported only by a jack.  If youre under a car have  jackstands in position...because why not?   Chock the wheels too wheel chocks are also super cheap.  And since you probably have a wheel off...lay the wheel down underneath the edge of the car too so the car would land on the wheel in case of some multistage catastrophic failure with your other safety precautions. Oh  and if you plan to have the car on jackstands on an asphalt driveway on a hot day  the stands can sink into the asphalt and become unbalanced ask me how I know!.  I cut a few ft squares of halfinch plywood to put the stands on and that distributes the weight on the asphalt so the corners dont dig into the tar. And safety goggles.  Because rust dust from your chassis falling into your eye suuuuucks. Lastly dont mess with removing compressed suspension springs.   Just pay someone to mess with those.  Honestly this is what spooks me the most  just my own personal preference.  The force those springs can exert is tough to understand.  If they break loose from those janky compressor clamps which you probably rented from Autozone youre in trouble.   Those springs will plow right through an arm or leg enroute to embedding itself in a concrete wall  feet away.  They will take your face clean off if youre standing over them.

If the bearing pulls in half and takes the hub with the removed portion use the black anchor piece behind the bearing. Might also help to soak it with a bunch of WD overnight.

However there is no user input required or even possible to activate the system as is typical in  wheel drive systems. At the end of the day its kind of in between but more akin to  wheel since it isnt always actively powering all the wheels. And Honda calls it Real Time WD so... Yeah.Now as of I want to say  they switched from the hydraulically controlled dual pump system to an electronically controlled power transfer system.

9349565,0,t3_58jbsn,I JUST replaced the suspension in a  Corolla this morning with QuickStrut assemblies.  Not kidding  finished around am.  Base Corolla did not come with front sway bar. I worked at the local Toyota dealer back  years or so when these would still be brought in and indeed factory never installed them.  This car is so hilariously simple to work on and its all fresh in my head.   Front struts are easy.  For the rears you will need to be able to cut some  steel to do this without opening the brake system.  Cut off wheel on a dremmel will work.  Hacksaw wont not enough room.FrontsRaise hood. Raise and support front wheels so they hang freely.  Remove front wheels.  Remove x large throughbolts holding the strut to the knuckle.  Tap the knuckle down while pushing the strut inwards towards the engine.  This will break the knuckle free from the strut.  Next best with  people but one can do it hold the strut up while removing the  mm bolts from under the hood. The strut is now free from the car.  Be careful not to tear the rubber boot on the axle and be extra careful not to pull the top of the knuckle away from the car.  This can dislodge the axle joints and cost you an axle.   Push the knuckle down not away.  Remove the strut.  Reverse to reassemble.REARMore tricky than the front.  Access the upper bolts by removing the rear seat.  Pull UP at the front of the seat where your knees would be if you were sitting on it.  Its retained by  plastic clips along the front lip of the seat cushion.  About lbs upwards force will pop it free.  Lift the whole seat up forward and out.   Next youll remove the small? sections of seatbacks that butt up to the folddown seatbacks.  Looking down near the steel floor now exposed by the missing seat bottom in the corners youll find the cushions are held down but a single bolt each side with a large washer holding down a black plastic piece.  Remove that bolt and give the narrow seatback portion a tap upwards. The cushion piece should pop up and off the clip that holds it.  Removing that cushion piece exposes the  bolts that hold the top of the rear struts to the strut towers.Raise and support the car so the rear wheels hang freely.  Remove the wheels.  Remove the sway bar link mm.  You may need to use thin vicegrips to hold the back of the stud from spinning I did.     Remove the clip holding the flexline to the rear struts.  Using your dremmel or cutoff wheel you need to cut the bracket that was holding the flex line.  Original design is that the line goes through a hole requiring you to remove the flex line from the hard line.  We dont want to disturb the brakes so cut about mm out of the front of the bracket turning it from a circle into a horseshoe shape.  You can then wiggle the flex line down and gently pull the hardline clear out of the nowhorseshoeshaped bracket.  Remove the  large throughbolts holding the strut to the knuckle.  Then hold the strut up and remove the  upper bolts from the strut.  Remove the strut assembly.  You may need to cut the new strut assembles brake line bracket into a Ushape to reinstall.  Some struts come with this modification already done.Take your time and tackle the fronts first.  If they go easy for you consider doing the rears.  I had a tough time getting the aftermarket bolts to line up in the rear strut towers.  Compare the old parts to the new very carefully before installing them.  I had to use a dremmel to open up a rear strut tower hole about mm so I could get the bolts lined up.Good luck!,Cartalk,d914ime,1,t5_2s47e

9411934,0,t3_59jedd,Freon isnt full.Automotive AC refrigerant probably Ra in your case has to be charged to a certain pressure range and that pressure range is semidependant on ambient temperature.  Too much or too little refrigerant and it wont work right.First check your static pressure.  Check highside and lowside both.  They should read the same when the system is off.  Its not uncommon to see pressures in the psi range but obviously this is not a hardrule number.Second assuming good pressure when off when the engine is running the center of the compressor clutch should be still.  The center is what is tied to the compressor crank shaft.  When the system is switched on this center should start spinning until the system shuts it off temporarily so that it intermittently cycles over a long period.  If it doesnt turn on at all then it could be that the system does not detect refrigerant pressure or it could be that the pressure is too low or it could be an electrical or clutch fault.  If it turns on and cycles fairly quickly like more than a few times a minute then its probably low on charge or is erroneously detecting that its low on charge.Now the vehicle electrical system is very heavily involved in what happens.  Low current at idle from a poorly operating alternator might not deliver enough power to keep the clutch engaged at idle.  That often results in a slipping clutch which usually makes a hell of a racket and smells funny.Also at idle the physical RPM of the pump is low and if its too low then the system might attempt to build pressure fail to build enough pressure cycle off then repeat.  At speed the RPM of the pump might be high enough to put enough pressure into the system to keep engaged.Alternately theres a cooling fan that is supposed to both cool the main radiator and to cool the condenser up at the radiator.  If that fan isnt spinning or if there are other problems then the system might not engage the AC or it might not cool the nowcompressed refrigerant enough to make it expandevaporate and droptemp inside of the air handler under the dash.,Cartalk,d9911cn,5,t5_2s47e

10997422,0,t3_5x05v2,Disc brake pads have audible wear indicators which is a metalonmetal sound. It is a highpitched scraping sound that youll hear at low and high speeds. I didnt hear this in the video.If you hear a periodic scarping or thumping sound that suggests a warped rotor. The faster your road speed the shorter the period i.e. youll hear it more often. You would be able to feel this in the steering wheel and then hear it as you lightly apply the brakes. If you ride the brakes as you drive that can warp the rotor since youre overheating the brakes by riding them. You can also warp the rotor is youve recently driven down a long grade and kept you foot on the brake the whole way down.,Cartalk,deeivk2,1,t5_2s47e

I usually try and operate the headlights on the vehicle with the dead battery and make sure they get reasonably bright. Many times you have to wiggle the connection to make it have good connection. You did good by leaving it hooked up because this will allow the charging system to put some charge in the dead battery. I have had batterys that are so dead or damaged they will not jump.

Drive it a little and then get it inspected and change the oil. Expect it to need work. The front brakes are probably junk. The rears are drum and may be ok.

If all  of the other wheels are properly mounted and just this one randomly fell off...thats suspicious as hell. Do you have any enemies?   And is your car parked somewhere easily accessible? e.g. on a street or a driveway.   Cant rule out the possibility that someone loosened the lugs on one of your wheels with malicious intent.Had there been any noise coming from the wheel that fell off in the weeks prior?  Especially while turning the car? Im fishing for maybe a bearing went bad and helped force the wheel off...but that wouldve been making a very obvious noise for awhile now  Its very very uncommon for this sort of thing to just happen on its own.   Theres a chance you just got supremely unlucky...but damn I wouldnt be satisfied with that explanation if it were me. EDIT  and since the shop was checking tires for leakspunctures theres definitely a chance they took the wheel off to check the tire.
