2541480,0,t3_2olnys,You make your way through the bustling city of Bresk heading towards the Chapel of the Aquiline Cross in the castle.  The entrance to the Chapel is marked by banners of white and red marked with a cross surrounded by a halo of feathers.  Upon entering you are greeted by a priest in simple robes.  Good morning.  I am Endur Priest of the Aquiline Cross.  Do you need any assistance or did you come by for some healing?He glances towards your back and does a double take looking over your shoulder.  Excuse me but that fine blade you carry with you  do you mind letting me take a look?  The engravings on the hilt have piqued my interest  they seem familiar to me.He turns over Sunder in his hands marveling over the craftsmanship.  I dont know where you found this blade but see these symbols here on the hilt?  Do you recognize what these are?  Surely you must know the fables.  These four markings symbolize the four mighty beasts from long ago that helped shape our world.  He points to the four symbols in succession. The Tidereaver Kraken the Flamebringer Dragon the Stormseeker Eagle and the Worldshaper Worm.  We have plenty of myths surrounding these creatures  would you like to hear one that is near and dear to my heart?This myth is a morality tale about the dangers of both pride and power. The Flamebringer Dragon had never after many years of chase been able to catch the Stormseeker Eagle so it preyed instead on the Eagles pride bragging that the Eagle was too weak and cowardly to ever chase the Dragon. Th angered eagle pursued the Dragon and did not realize until too late that it had been tricked into fling down a tunnel into the depths of the world where the Eagle did not have enough room to  maneuver. The Dragon bit the Eagles throat and began to drink its blood for its power when the Worldshaper Worm came upon the scene. Th Worm was blind but the Dragon knew that it could feel the beating hearts of both the Dragon and the Eagle. To avoid its treachery being discovered the Dragon tore out the Eagles stillbeating heart and hide it in a place from where it would never be tempted to retrieve it. The myth of the Aquiline Heart explains how dragons became the strongest creatures in the world and teaches that those with too much power risk being turned upon bythose around them.Many believe including myself that this Aquiline Heart is very real and some of our Order spend their lives seeking it out.  They say it has tremendous powers of healing which is one of the major tenets of our Order so you can see why we seek it out.  So it is interesting that these symbols.... oops!  As he prods the Eagle symbol the runes glow and a small panel opens in the hilt revealing  small slots. Well this is extraordinary says Endur It looks as if the gems that go in these sockets are missing.  I wonder...  Endur hands you Sunder and quickly shuffles away disappearing down a spiral staircase.  Several minutes later a huffing and puffing Endur arrives at the top of the staircase with something wrapped in fine silk clutched in his right hand.  I thought I recognized the shape of those sockets somewhere.  Let me see if...  He unwraps the silk and inside is a beautiful green emerald.  He places it in the bottom socket sliding it in easily and Sunder briefly glows with a green light.  I cant believe this.  We found this emerald hidden away in our temple for years ago but weve never been able to figure out its purpose.  It seems to be crafted specifically for this blade.  Unfortunately this is the only gem like this we have in our possession.  This is obviously not circumstance  it is obvious that this gem now belongs to you.  May the Aquiline Heart lead your way. Ahhh amazing!While Im there I will also broach the idea of opening an orphanage on my lands and see if a member of the order would handle the administration of it and the education of the younglings.Our lands  are they fertile? Self sustaining? Im thinking my lands would take in as many refugees as possible and the orphanage will cater to orphans of the current war. Not exclusively of course.  It will also offer martial training to any who ask orphan and new serf alike. The goal of that is to recruit new people to fight ragesia now and more awesome adventuring paladins or at least adventuring do gooders in the future. Eldur is certainly receptive to opening up an orphanage and would find an administrator for you. The regions to the south of Bresk are more fertile and would be better suited to getting your place self sustaining.,WuTangInitiative,cmqb3ut,3,t5_31l2q
