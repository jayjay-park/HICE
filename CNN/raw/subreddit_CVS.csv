WiFi wouldnt work for this because you would have to connect to WiFi at each store. Bluetooth is Bluetooth all it has to do is sense your phone as another user said. CVS just wants you to open the app at their store so you see your coupons and buy more things. This is how they remind you. ,CVS,d5fpnqc,1,t5_2sgxc

Your job is proofreading. Edit I also try to put the right man in the right bottle for the right customer to not kill the people that I speak with everyday. You may have liability but we both share the guilt in the event something terrible like this happens.,CVS,ddnzouw,1,t5_2sgxc
