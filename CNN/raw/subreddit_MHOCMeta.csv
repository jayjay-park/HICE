I also believe that the MHOC community can hopefully read the whole comment thread. Finally why does this matter? All of this evidence is dependent on other factors and we cannot make a definite conclusion from it. ,MHOCMeta,cxlrl2r,3,t5_3a4fc

9886812,0,t1_daw9lat,Your comment just highlights the entire issue with your speakership you dont give a shit about how things look and rely on the ridiculous notion that bias can be turned on and off. You continue to talk about how the current system is unfair and fail to notice the fundimental flaw with your system the speakership will have to make judgement on political arguments which may work if the speakership appeared to be unbias yet you continue to shit post on discord.,MHOCMeta,daw9waf,2,t5_3a4fc

10168873,0,t1_dbwoycv,Well Im sorry if I overreacted Im just sick of the fact that I was basically forced out of the thing I enjoyed most and was the best person for all because some people didnt like me. Any legitimate reason flew out of the window when they suddenly forgot that the VONC was about more than me when I resigned.All I honestly want to do now is play the game because contrary to everyones belief I didnt sit there for months secretly meddling and involving myself I made a few jokes and gave my opinions in a chat that was private. I just want to have fun now after literally sitting through so much shit as speaker.Once again Im sorry and Im just going to link to this every time someone tries to snark at me. Looking at the candidates its not looking good so weve just got to look forward now so if youve been linked this its because youre needlessly starting shit.Thanks.,MHOCMeta,dbwp4j7,4,t5_3a4fc

10419028,0,t1_dcp1uzi,gt Yes Tyler has had the finger of blame pointed at him and that is far from fairIts not fair at all. They are attacking somebody who just wants to play a game. gt but both sides of this debacle have said and done things that are far from complimentaryI suppose youre criticising TheQuipton for daring to call liars out and to tell them where to shove it?gtBut the longer we bring up the same issues time after time pushing the same arguments well only seep further and further into a mire which we ultimately wont be able to escape from.You want to stop bringing up issues which need solving because itll make things worse? You want me to stop bringing up the fact TheQuipton is being lied about? No I wont. I will continue to raise a fuss about things like that until theyre sorted once and for all. Otherwise we wont be able to move on.,MHOCMeta,dcp2cwa,3,t5_3a4fc
