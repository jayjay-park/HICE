I really really really like Dixon over Star Power this horse is doing so well for him. ,showjumping,cnxyonw,1,t5_2xi58
3722790,0,t1_cqfoxzo,That was my favorite too!  My paint gelding loved to take off long for the first fence then chip the next three.  Took years to convince him to take off when I asked and not just when he felt like it ,showjumping,cqgmhg5,2,t5_2xi58
5822364,0,t1_cxitv77,Thats awesome! I am in the area too  I will be down near Red Deer with Wachter Horses. And yep well probably be against each other  hoping to find some easy practice jumper classes at a few local facilities like Amberlea though they usually top out their shows at under a meter itll help my gelding shape up before tackling the bigger heights later in the year. Planning on hitting Whitemud or the Northlands expo?,showjumping,cxiu53t,2,t5_2xi58
