6544539,0,t3_458bl2,gt What happened to the coeds camp? Their site DID get attacked by a bear? They are truly inexplicable. They believed they were being stalked by a stranger in the woods and said they were going to the police. But they didnt. And despite being in jail nobody knew where they were for like  weeks?The coeds were being stalked by Ned. He stole one pair of panties and used it to frame them for cutting the wire. The other stuff they complained about in the note other than your one meeting with them was Ned. He  had stuff from their camp in his hideout after the site is cleared.As for being in jail for several weeks unnoticed they were in a small jail in a small town in the mid s. There wouldnt have been internet or other centralized records. They seem to have decided to serve their time rather than phone home for bail. Given their attitudes they might have even thought it was an adventure.I do find it weird they decided not to carry out their packs sleeping bags and some of their clothes. Im not surprised they left behind the heavy case of beer and the magazines.My speculative answer is that Ned was getting up to some scary Blair Witch nonsense with them. The girls finally were frightened enough to slink off one day with nothing but the clothes they were wearing and their purses I didnt see them in camp. They left the note as a bit of bravado.Because they were possibly still drunk andor just stupid they stole a tractor and went riding on it on the way to the sheriff. Maybe they had a car and it ran out of gas before they grabbed the tractor or maybe they just managed to travel a while before getting pulled over. In any case they were then arrested.Something else to keep in mind is that there are no guarantees Delilah you when she found out about they were found. She had no problem with lying in her report and then lying to you about her report and then telling you after it was already an issue that shed lied. She may have only told you about the girls after she was sure you were committed to protecting her along with yourself from the Evil Conspiracy.,Firewatch,czw9bca,2,t5_32ha5

They didnt come up with anything  or at least the game didnt show that well enough  they just reacted to what was going on fairly reasonably too. Honestly they should have lost the weird research base and basically most of the files and should have kept the clues as lowkey as possible and near the end the player should have really figured out how crazy their theories were getting and it should be clear to the player that they werent going to get the big Xfiles payoff a fair bit before it happened. The ending should then have been more this huge crash as they realise how wrong they were and then their pasts and feelings of what to do next with their lives should have all come out as they can finally let off steam.

I searched around for a minute or so trying to find a way to avoid it but could t of course so I had to continue. Totally spooky body decayed and music pounding.

This leads to her stating that while digging through documents she came across a memo stating that there is a fence around Wapiti Meadow and to report damage to the fence to the University.

I saw mentions of that sound in threads but never heard it myself. Will try to hike around more gtHenrys desk has a lot of notes collected at the end of the game. One of them says in plain text that he is suspicious about Delilah lying to himHmm didnt read all of them. Thank you for pointing out I have more things to check while replaying.gtNed still has no real reason for letting him find his secret bunker and all the evidence pointing to himself alone. It only incriminates him more even if he claims Brian died in an accident.No real reason except maybe sympathy towards Henry and guilt for all the trouble he caused. Probably he hoped that Henry wouldnt blame him for Brians death. However this argument is based on maybe and probably and its still impossible to tell for sure what Neds thinking was.On an unrelated note it really surprised me when in the end Henry suggested to attribute Brians death as a murder. All my choices were to dissent the idea of Ned murdering Brian. I could imagine Delilah offering that option and Henry agreeing with that but this came contrariwise and was really confusing. ,Firewatch,d02a0ka,3,t5_32ha5

Or they were already home and were just then finding out because their lines were cut and waiting to be repaired for awhile.

I watched a video yesterday about how Delilah and Ned were actually secretly working together how Delilah was lying and whatnot but I just dont see it. If that wouldve been true it wouldve been in the game or at least more strongly hinted at. A lot of the theories sound like the conspiracy stuff that Delilah and Henry were making up ... some of them make sense but in the end theyre probably nothing. Firewatch is a relatively simple game with a simple story although it obviously could have been better f.e. fleshing the characters Ned and Brian out more.

7570695,0,t1_czu8v0k,Aha thank you!  I am on a Mac and couldnt figure this out.  Theres a button there that opens a window to where the files are on the hard drive too which is really nice.,Firewatch,d32r1ui,1,t5_32ha5
7590837,0,t3_453kjx,Somehow I couldnt get it out of my head that it was just because the graphics werent good enough to have real people closeup. When the teens were silhouettes I got suspicious. When the shadowy figure was watching you I was hopeful. But as the game progressed it was clear that it just didnt look good enough to support people.    I saw Delilahs departure coming from miles away and unfortunately I dont think it was purely for story reasons ,Firewatch,d351h5k,1,t5_32ha5

8018645,0,t1_d4hboh0,yeah maybe some kind of prequel that ends with him looking at henry like when you first see him day ,Firewatch,d4hdchz,2,t5_32ha5
8165381,0,t3_4r0r0o,LOL so mad because you couldnt predict the ending halfway through the game. Fuck off. ,Firewatch,d4y7zqq,1,t5_32ha5
8859389,0,t3_514fo5,Yeah that definitely wouldve been entertaining. But like others have said it wouldve distracted from the main point of the game the biggest reason I criticize the Wapiti Station size of conspiracy...distracting and misleading from point of game.I do wish that Delilah wouldnt have gone offline there were times it wouldve been nice to have been able to contact her for help instead of her gone because she was sulking.,Firewatch,d7crumr,1,t5_32ha5

10449230,0,t1_dcsi19y,I enjoyed it very much. There is a lot of interesting information about how the game was made and the various iterations the story went through before the final version. I recommend using a guide theres a good one on GameFAQs since it is possible to miss some of the commentary nodes and due to the auto save there is no way to go back without starting over from the beginning. ,Firewatch,dcsijqy,1,t5_32ha5
10539999,0,t3_5qxa2h,First playthrough I interacted with Delilah as I would have myself.Second playthrough I completely ignored her only interacting when required. Totally different experience.,Firewatch,dd2tqqm,4,t5_32ha5
10600650,0,t1_dd8rj0l,yeah for me the differences are bigger than the similarities but that is because of my experience playing Firewatch. Others may be like you and see the similarities bigger than the differences.,Firewatch,dd9djnl,1,t5_32ha5
