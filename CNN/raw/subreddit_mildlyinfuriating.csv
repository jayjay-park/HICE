I explained that social networking and forming relationships with the people you work with is an important part of any workplace experience. And that someone who is antisocial and never develops strong working relationships with their coworkers supervisors and customers will not advance as quickly as someone who does.He thought about it for a while said I guess youre right and dropped it.

Also you say not all smokers are litterers in direct response to the posts title. So not all kinda means most. As a smoker then what would you say is an honest percentage of all smokers not just your friends who smoke who do regularly toss their butts on the ground.

Hits include everything from talking via IM liking statuses looking at photos even just viewing their wall. Then you only see stuff from people who are ranked highly on our list. Then obviously it snowballs and even if you dont really talk to some of the people you see on your news feed just clicking their pics to view fully will increase their interaction ranking with you.Go search for a facebook friend you think you havent seen anything from in a long time and start viewing their profile clicking pics a lot and I guarantee youll begin to see all their stuff popping up on your news feed much more once you bump them on the ranking algorithm.,mildlyinfuriating,ckf2dve,3,t5_2ubgg

That is to say if you played it from the cloud but never actually downloaded it it will show up but will not let you delete it.To fix this go into your music settings and enable Show All Music. Then go back to your actual music section and the offending songs should have the download from cloud symbol by them. Click that symbol to actually download them then after it is downloaded you can swipe to delete it.  Afterwards go back to your settings and disable Show All Music.

Dont point to his response and say told you so. If you think that there is no way to explain reason then like I said dont bother.

In fact it is inherent in developmental psychology and any psychology really to examine the differences between people that fall into different groups. I have worked enough with developmental psychology to know when someone is stating something that has no basis in logic. I simply pointed that out.I disagree though. There are components to development which are universal certainly. Id think that the development of prejudice is part of that.

Maybe Im just missing something you are saying so please explain if that is the case.

3090854,0,t1_coic8t3,I will answer a few of these. Does the Flu shot work?  it follows the same principal as all other vaccines introduce weak or fragment parts of the in this case influenza virus and let the bodies natural response do its thing. The body creates antibodies to fight the foreign bodies. Since the vaccine contains a weak or dead virus it poses little threat to a health body but helps to warm up the bodies immune response. You have to get a new flu vaccine every year because it mutates so quickly. Sometimes its not as effective this year for example because they have to decide a head of time what strains might be the worst and use those to create the vaccine. Why was ethyl mercury removed?  IIRC it is safe it was removed sole because people saw the chemical name and went omg mercury is bad! It was basically a PR move. Fresh vs preserves  preservative free is generally available I believe but its more expensive because it doesnt keep. Other microbes in the niche?  we arent vaccinated against good microbes we are vaccinated against the harmful diseases. Antibiotics on the other hand are generally broad spectrum and can harm good microbes  but if you are seriously ill its better that then to be more I sick or sick for longer just because ehrmagrd antibiotics.  ,mildlyinfuriating,coid647,2,t5_2ubgg

Now typically they are suppose to notify you if they require access to the home in order to fix the issue. With the cable company I worked for a tech would leave a door tag the customer would then call in and have an appointment scheduled for the leakage team to come out and resolve the issue  typically all within a couple days if not next day.Sometimes a door tag wouldnt be seen or would be taken off and thrown away without much thought not a big deal because the account would be notated with information about the ingressleakage and an appointment would be scheduled.

5247916,0,t1_cvijupy,gtall these black shootings get swept under the rugWell except that thats an unprovable conspiracy theory because by definition if you know about it it hasnt been successfully swept under the rug.  Meanwhile  of news reports and facebook posts and internet outrage over cops abusing their power has been white cops against black kids and every time it hits the news people can immediately find a local news story about a black cop murdering an unarmed white kid that didnt just fail to get the same attention but was and continues to be actively ignored to the point that the only mainstream attention such crimes get is in the context of white cops shooting black kids.gthow many whites are thereAnd how many of those white and black people never interact with the police?You ever notice how when theyre testing drugs effectiveness against diseases they dont try the drug on people who dont have the disease?  Funny how the first response is always to ignore that little bit of the scientific method when going for the look at the population thing.  Probably because when you compare the number of criminals based on race whites get shot . times more often than blacks.Which if you wanna go with the all cops and the justice system are racist thing doesnt explain why cops would nonlethally arrest black criminals more often than white ones...,mildlyinfuriating,cvik9ny,1,t5_2ubgg

This is a road where cars fly by at   and  miles per hour!!! I understand that there is a cycling lane but what about when there is an accident?! Sometimes these multiton vehicles get in wrecks or simply run off the road out of control!!! Its like these fucking cyclists dont value their limbs...or their lives.

5284442,0,t1_cvn07iz,Its only after you ask What percentage of the population actually uses a bike as a regular mode of transit? that you speculate that the statistic in the US is around . I answered the original question with UK statistics as I am British and the picture posted is from the UK. I dont think your claims about the US are close to being true. There are many cities with substantial bicycle use and it seems evident more students ride than rich guys I would contest how viable it is unless you are suggesting its not viable because of the physical condition a lot of Americans are currently in. The majority of car journeys are under  miles and so I would argue that most journeys made by car can be made by bicycle. Cycle paths are infrastructure to enhance the experiences of both cyclists and motorists theyre not a necessity. So you have to go a safer speed for a small amount of time I dont see the big issue? When a lot of cars pass cyclists its with excessive speed and inadequate distance. I got passed by a car today as I was gradually slowing down and about to put my arm out to signal right. If Id not quickly glanced over my shoulder the motorist would have side swiped my elbow. Motorists dont appreciate what damage a gtlb vehicle going at mph can do.,mildlyinfuriating,cvn5dcv,1,t5_2ubgg

5722009,0,t1_cx6czd3,I actually didnt think Okay was fair to be interpreted as a sentence in the first place but I didnt pull you up on it because I thought that was being overly pedantic.Okay can just about get away with being interpreted as a colloquial sentence because saying Okay implies a verb as in That is okay but grammatically it isnt a valid sentence.I wasnt sure if my primary school teachers who said a sentence required a clause were being overzealous like with i before e except after c but yeah Ill happily admit that that I was wrong to accept what you said without looking it up first but thats neither here nor there. That was an aside to appease you its a complete red herring and a detraction from the actual discussion weve been having for the last  posts. I have absolutely no investment in the argument Okay is a sentence in fact Im glad its not it makes my actual point a lot easier.My point is that emojis arent words according to the OEDs own rules and every other dictionary. And unless you disagree with The OED definition of sentence. The OED definition of word. The OED definition of writing.Then youre definitely wrong. And Id like to remind you that in your effort to string together an argument here you suggested maths symbols are words which I think is just a intellectually dishonest grasp at a straw to try and hold onto a bad point youre too heavily invested in.Cheers bye.,mildlyinfuriating,cx6dec0,0,t5_2ubgg

5723584,0,t1_cx6jlhj,gtIm too tiredI cant be bothered to read this but Ill downvote it is not an argument its completely facile.  comments in a row Ive tried to get any points out of you now and youve only been able to defer you havent been able to give anything.You havent got a single interpretation that manages to prove its a word from the dictionary definitions all you have is a blog post.As for my knowledge of language I speak conversational Japanese and French and do business in Japan semi regularly I know Lithuanian grammar but my vocabulary is weak I studied  years of Latin and Ancient Greek and although I took Physics over English for higher education I still got  marks above an A in English Language. I cant claim to have a degree or anything but to say Im clueless when were literally arguing just dictionary definitions is pretty facile.Also I would never claim programming languages or knowing maths are anything relevant to linguistics or language at all but since a minute ago you were claiming mathematical symbols were words and programming languages and maths were languages if youre going to call me unqualified to speak on this Im at least demonstrably qualified in physics maths and code so if youre considering them languages as you did before I by your definition know  extra languages. I also call bullshit on that and I believe Im allowed to if were judging each other on credentials.Again a second ago you called out a logical fallacy now youre just arguing ad hominems because you have no more points to make. Also what exactly are your credentials? You read a blog? Again argument from authority is a logical fallacy this information is not too obfuscated for either of us to understand.Your interpretation is wrong. I interpreted everything using their own definitions.If you can unravel the logic ofgtWordgtA single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing used with others to form a sentence.|gtSentencegtA set of words that is complete in itself typically containing a subject and predicate conveying a statement question exclamation or command and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses.|gtClausegtA clause is a group of words that contains a verb.An emoji cannot form a group of words or be a verb so it cannot becoming a set of words that has a clause i.e. a sentence therefore it cant be described as a word.And again Ill point out that that was the last thread of your argument remaining as every optional part of the definition it also failed to qualify for e.g. its not a part of speech its not part of writing according to the OED definition though I dont mind dropping that point and we already established they dont fulfil any of the typical criteria even though Im well aware they arent obligatory.The point is you havent made a single point that indicates theyre words other than that blog post said so. The blog post that contradicts their actual dictionary. You couldnt provide a good reason why code and mathematical symbols arent considered words but an emoji is.You forced me to use the OED definitions as the crux of your argument. Using other dictionary definitions I could completely destroy its ability to be considered a word but I used that since your whole argument is OED is the authority.You refuse to acknowledge that emoji dont belong to a languages unlike every other word that isnt a proper noun that exists that they cant be used in speech that they cant be conjugated or declined that they dont have case tense form or gender that they are completely open to interpretation that they cant make compound words that they cant express complex or abtract meanings that they cant be reliably parsed or that they cant be reliably written without being an artist a feature of pictures not words.Those are all arguments for why it isnt a word and you wont let me use them because your whole argument is but.. but the OED blog!. Meanwhile I just used the god damn OED to extensively show you have no leg to stand on and youre still trying to argue? There is no interpretation in there that agrees with you. You havent been able to demonstrate one at all and you havent been able to disprove most of my points the nearest you can get is to say that one point is impossible to make because its circular and another is pedantic. The rest of your arguments rely on but those things arent NECESSARY to be a word but every one of them has stacked up none of the optional things that make a word count for emoji. Youve made zero counter arguments and now you physically cant show that an emoji can make a sentence because it cant be a verb and it cant form a clause. You have no leg left to stand on.Your argument OED say so so its true which is a terrible argument from authority again a logical fallacy which is fun because you told me I was arguing fallacies and yet havent managed to point out a single one where Ive pointed out  of yours without even trying is demonstrably false because the OED definition of the word word requires that it can be combined to form a sentence which requires that it can form a clause. Which it cant.QED your hypothesis is disproven. Ive supplied all the evidence and it isnt open to interpretation theres no rebuttal.Feel free to stop replying now so I can get on with my life instead of arguing with someone who cant make any arguments but still wants to participate.,mildlyinfuriating,cx6kff3,0,t5_2ubgg

5753382,0,t1_cxa8dlm,A good chunk of Europe had the same overpopulation problems but they were worse in Britain largely because of the Empires constantly expanding trade network allowed the isles to become less than selfsufficient and rely on imports. Those imports also drew mass migration as Britain grew to administrate and rule the largest empire on the planet. More migrants arrived as seamen who worked for British companies as far away as India Africa and later parts of East Asia. Yet more came as scholars officials cheap labor businessmen or even just travelers who heard of opportunities they could exploit in Britain. While France Spain and other countries with similarly sized superpowers at the time Britain grew biggest later Britain didnt have lots of room to house those who arrived. The UK in total is about th the size of France for example and loses over half its remaining area to steep hills and mountains Wales and Scotland in particular that make urban development very difficult.Then there are cultural reasons. The middleeast and Saharan Africa are very very hot. Most of populated Asia was very very moist. Those conditions give rise to different problems.The middleeast adapted by avoiding meats that spoil quickly and a need to dispose of the dead quickly. Europe didnt have that so much since a carcass could be left in dry storage for days or even weeks before putrefaction started to get noticeable.Similarly in Asia foodstuffs were protected from the humidity using rice leaves or other materials that remove moisture and carcasses were kept dry and wrapped if not cremated very shortly after death. Again unlike Europe where lower humidity meant a secure roof was considered enough to keep damp out.I could say more about cultural aspects but most of them come back to either overpopulation or climatic conditions.,mildlyinfuriating,cxa9fyi,5,t5_2ubgg

As far as the experiment goes it looks more interesting if you put food colouring in the water the bubbles are more pronounced. Dry ice is relatively inexpensive also and can be bought safely with just a regular cooler however probably dont let the kids hold it because it can burn your skin quite quickly.

Where I live in the tricities TNVA area the Google Maps route will beat the Waze route any time there is a difference in routes.  Waze routes me over streets with mph speed limits and tons of signals and turns when a route taking the mph freeway is only .mph longer in distance.  Ive used both apps frequently and its not just perception.The Maps ETA is usually accurate within  minutes for me.  The Waze ETA is frequently way off sometimes by well over  minutes.  It seems like this is due to unrealistic expectations of how much time Ill spend on a road with a ton of red lights how long Ill have to wait for a gap in traffic to cross  lanes of traffic or how fast I am lawfully able to travel on a given road.Both apps will occasionally tell me to do UTurns when virtually every municipality in TN has made them illegal in city limits.,mildlyinfuriating,czogh3k,4,t5_2ubgg

6808083,0,t1_d0nz69q,OK so your standpoint is more reasonable than you were making it seem earlier.I had not stated my opinion on pirated vs emulated vs used vs new old stock.  The devs have already made their money on the new old stock amazon is selling.  Personally Im perfectly fine with emulating a game even when still being produced.  Youre paying for it with typically a substandard experience.  Good emulators usually come out long after a system is run out of support.If youre worried about sway or impact you have as a purchaser as an individual you do not matter.  If you want impact video reviews written reviews or forums can have a larger impact.  Involving other people along with you is how you get your point across.,mildlyinfuriating,d0nzqoh,1,t5_2ubgg

It was a while ago.It was common to inform customers prior to close that we would be closing shortly.Not once can I recall someone complaining almost always they were incredibly polite about having stayed a little longer then expected. The more polite  they were towards me the more inclined I was to let them roam around a few more minutes past close.It was even common to inform customers that entered closer to closing time that we would be closing soon. Chances are they would even apologise.The idea of staying open for a customer to me is foreign. Its simple business maths if someone is looking at spending a few thousand you give them a bit extra. If someone is looking to buy a spoon you gracefully inform them we arent staying to long for a few dollars.Though Australians Ive found are closer to Canadians then Americans.,mildlyinfuriating,d0okh9s,9,t5_2ubgg

In his case when not well controlled it showed up as an insistence on a set routine every morning before leaving the house.

Also it was comorbid with an eating disorder hed only eat certain foods while strenuously avoiding others.  Another friend of mine had a child with OCD with a handwashing compulsion.

In general if you create a thing youre the copyright holder there are exceptions but they probably dont apply to this case.You can find sample DMCA letters on the internet which makes it pretty easy. Heres oneThis should be sent to gags copyright agent whose email address is copyrightGAG.com. You can usually find the copyright agent for this kind of site by looking at their terms of service.IANAL but if a website doesnt have a copyright agent I believe that means they do not qualify for the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA which means you have to move up the ladder and send it to their hosting provider or ISP.,mildlyinfuriating,d3lucec,6,t5_2ubgg

8079856,0,t1_d4o8r1b,You know I had an executive tell me the same thing about Lacoste and Armani. Then I let him try on my Hong Kong tailor jacket. And after he had his first suit made by my guy he donated his Armanis. And yes I know Armani isnt a particularly expensive line of suits. And yes I know you can get them tailored too. You have no idea how many times Ive been through this conversation.And then I showed him the videos of Lacoste and Izod polos being made side by side on the same factory floor with a bucket of monogrammed logos on one side and the stitch printer for the Izod logo on the other. So please spare me your pretension. Even though I have a plebes salary I earn it in one of the most expensive zip codes in the continental united states. ,mildlyinfuriating,d4o91vw,-1,t5_2ubgg

8091381,0,t1_d4ofpsc,Haha. gtIts true that I am no expert in clothing fabricationSo why are you trying to argue with someone whos kind enough to share some newtoyou information with you? gtlike mostBuckle up buttercup. Were not talking about items for the average person are we? Which is why I wouldnt expect you to understand without me explaining it to you but I would hope that even average intelligence is enough to undertstand without arguing against something you clearly dont have a stake in or any experience of.gtdoubt that it would provide any perceptible increase in comfortability or durabilityWell youre free to exhibit your lack of understanding as loudly as you want  but thats all it is. You probably couldnt  name even half a dozen features that youre missing because you probably never learned that they exist.I doubt youve ever experienced a piece of clothing even anywhere near the same league as the comfort and durability of an  lambskin fleecy lined leather jacket with switchable collars removable faux double fronts so it looks like another jacketvest underneath when the front is open a Bluetooth microphone in the top button and a little speaker in the collar see I bet you didnt even know that was a thing lol!. Tailored to fit every curve of your body perfectly. And to top it off its waterproof  so its pretty much the perfect jacket for outdoor sports like yachting or golf or horse riding. Oh and its tough enough to withstand coming off a your horse or bike with barely a scratch and still look like a million bucks because thats what good leather is about. It also comes with a lifetime guarantee  on every single stitch. Button come off? Have it repaired for free at any of their stores around the world while enjoying a free drink and a customised presentation of the latest clothes based on your customer profile or perhaps a complimentary pursesized bottle of cologne made from the most outrageously awesome and expensive perfumes you probably have never heard of.Its OK I dont expect you to know everything but to claim that something doesnt exist just because you didnt previously know about it is pretty shortsighted.gt I guess you would be able to tell anyone who cares that your clothes are made of virgin leather stitched together by a bunch of overpaid Italians.Well no actually. Although I am often complimented on how well I dress or on particular items of clothing of course I only ever give a humble thank you. Youd have to know me fairly well or be pretty pushy for me to talk about it. Or be familiar with the very subtle hallmarks of the particular brands that I prefer to wear.I would never dream of rubbing my good fortune into the face of anyone less fortunate  just as I would never criticise someone like you who could only afford clothes made by underage children in slavelike conditions in the third world. And Im really happy to be able to pass on my clothing in perfect condition even though I put it through treatment that destroys cheaper clothing many times over. A good pair of shoes will last a lifetime. A shitty pair will literally last a month. You might pay x the price but they will last x or x times longer  and be more comfortable every day than the cheap ones could ever be.I guess youre proud of a bargain at the expense of someones wellbeing while Im not ashamed to be able to buy clothes made in the first world that dont leave me with a guilty conscience. Sound fair?The problem with people like you is that you have to tear down what you dont understand. So instead of accepting that some people operate on a different level to you you have to try to bring them down to your level by saying I dont understand therefore it makes no sense.And you want to know what virgin leather is and why its so important and expensive? Not because you can tell anyone but because it comes from cows who are kept in paddocks without barbed wire so that they dont cut themselves. Why is this important? Because if youre relying on the leather to both look good AND be strong in a crash you dont want any preexisting weak points made of scar tissue instead of skin  thats where it will tear open. And if you care about the animals welfare too then its a double bonus!Head over to rcars and have the same argument about Ford vs Mercedes see how far you get. The only difference is that guys obsess over cars so you wouldnt even dream of trying to say the same thing.Hope thats been informative even if I didnt try to make the lesson anything other than painfully embarrassing for you. ,mildlyinfuriating,d4pjmj4,1,t5_2ubgg

8457920,0,t1_d5yr8xo,If the only reason someone starts shopping at a new store is for the return policy it means they only care about the return policy. Which means they wont stick around much longer once the policy ends. And if the store wanted new customers I feel like there are more cost effective ways to do that than effectively paying people. The guy listed the name of the store and they do not have this policy anymore. So either he misunderstood the policy or they stopped the policy. If the latter is true then it wasnt a good business policy since they stopped it. The former is probably not likely since he worked there and had repeat interaction with the outcome of that policy. Just because a business makes a policy that seams counter intuitive doesnt mean its a good policy. In the end what we have here is a bad policy in both theory and practice. ,mildlyinfuriating,d5yrwdf,4,t5_2ubgg

8541182,1,t1_d6968e0,Seriously do I need to spell this out for you? Okay here goes. Back in those days the internet was not what it is today there were very few users in comparison to today. People were skeptical of the internet people didnt know much about it and people didnt know exactly what to expect from it. Few media sites actually even existed in comparison to today because people actually bought paper papers back then and it was a significant source of income. Nowadays in comparison very few people actually buy physical newspapers or by their news from any sort of physical source. Their physical news delivery system is hanging on for dear life by barely a thread and is no longer a suitable source of income for them. They were all forced to have an online presence and subsequently challenged with a way to actually continue making money. Just because something was a certain way at a certain time doesnt mean that it can still be that certain way in todays reality and you dont have all the facts.

8853051,0,t1_d7bzad6,I feel you its mildly infuriating. I  order to do good in this world you have to accept the fucked up parts. Im only just starting to get over being furious about this stuff a decade later. If you are smart an actual human being and you seem like both you can get what you want of life your only real enemy is yourself. I know its  am and its miserable to go through this shit but heres my advice pick girl or guy in that class and try to fuck them. It will make the class a lot more fun and honestly thats what everyone else is trying to do anyway. If you are who I think you are you will get an a or a b no matter what. In college sex is the primary currency making the class harder and giving your rich classmates less time to fuck makes you playing this straight a double whammy. I know in any version of a good world you wouldnt be taking this class but a good world would be boring. This prof isnt so evil he or she takes money and title. Going to the dean or calling her out on bull shit threatens this in their book itd the nuclear option.  They arent going nuclear on you so is it really the smart or righteous play?Like I suggest early running into evil isnt always bad you can learn from it in ways you never can from tv or media. You will repeat this seanario infinite times over your life. Sometimes youll have to take a stand and it will be worth it. If you can identify the times you shouldnt the more important question is what to do with that extra energy. Again I suggest fuck trying to be a ta and all this bull shit and picking the craziest looking person in class and taking your frustrations out on them ,mildlyinfuriating,d7c0eza,4,t5_2ubgg

8923725,0,t1_d7kg7px,Not sure thats the reason since our eggs not from the UK nearby though keep relatively well for quite some time unrefrigerated and unwashed. I was under the impression washed eggs didnt last as long but I may be mistaken.Out of curiosity where I live the eggs are kept in unrefrigerated sections of the grocery store. I personally put them in the fridge when I buy them but many dont. They last quite a while the downside is that sometimes theres a bit of chicken poop on them so if youre planning to boil them you really have to wash them before hand. Are all your eggs prewashed and refrigerated? I wanted to ask how long they last but I actually cant compare since Ive always eaten the ones I buy here in a couple weeks.,mildlyinfuriating,d7ki1ct,11,t5_2ubgg
8925156,0,t1_d7ko38a,Yeah for those of us lucky enough to be able to afford more expensive eggs from chickens that lead a better life. There are plenty of people who perhaps out of circumstance would have to pick the cheapest eggs. Like you said the regulation of labeling is a whole other issue. In the us there has been high risk of avian influenza which makes the whole raising of birds free range out doors a lot riskier. So is chicken running around a barn with an attached outdoor caged area considered free range? I guess its better than battery cages but not exactly what consumers imagine free range to be. ,mildlyinfuriating,d7ko8i5,5,t5_2ubgg

For example you might update the app that has the new feature but may not see it for a few days until some engineer flips the switch. And when they do they may not even turn it on for everyone. They might just test it on  of users for a while. So it doesnt really make sense to include it in these patch notes that go out to everybody.The main way these big apps try to tell you about new features is within the app itself with tooltips and stuff.,mildlyinfuriating,d7xylyi,3,t5_2ubgg

It wreaks havoc on the environment and can even throw an economy off balance.  However do consider that much paper comes from legitimate sources  and that paper plants often plant more trees than they cut down  and also that trees are not the lungs of the earth.  Most of the earths oxygen comes from singlecelled organisms on the oceans surface.  The rest comes from not only trees but also grasses shrubs and other plant life.  Heres a suggested google search you can use to find other sourcesIm not trying to call you out.  Its just that well stress kills.  Dont be stressed about paper.  Its not worth the cortisol.

If traffic is doing a lot of speed upslow down flow due to rush hour the car will break hard and accelerate hard to get back up to speed. I turn the cruse off cause I can see further ahead and tend to drift longer break lighter and slowly accelerate when traffic picks up again.  A human can see farther ahead and adjust their accelerationdeceleration speed better compared to an auto car who is only aware of its near by surroundings. ,mildlyinfuriating,ddm8esi,1,t5_2ubgg

In order to have the names match up they would have had to put someone else in either the best spot in the photo or give them first billing.

If you arent willing to cater to your significant others needs at least to begin with then you obviously dont care about them enoughrespect them as a human being. Everyone is vulnerable sometimes and if my partner didnt understand that and sent me emotionless messages back when Ive clearly got angst then I would question if they were right for me. If anything it feeds back into needy behaviour.If you cater to them while also expressing in a kind way what youve said above so that youve given them an opportunity to see the neediness behind their actions and after some time they still havent improved then yes fair enough you shouldnt have to keep looking after their childish behaviour. But if you think there is no moral imperative to improve your partners insecurities and vulnerabilities then youve got twisted morals and are being very selfish.Fuck me peoples egotistical logic baffles me sometimes.,mildlyinfuriating,der88cw,4,t5_2ubgg

11254605,0,t1_df7odgs,I get that mindset but I get paid the same at my corporate job even when Im having a bad day. I dont like penalizing people who often need every penny they can get because our system is fucked. Leaving a shitty tip or no tip can just put them in a worse mood and pretty much wreck the whole day. Id say if the serviceattitudewhatever is bad enough youd be better served by speaking to a manager than by leaving a crap tip and possibly exacerbating the problem for their future customers Edit not a server never have been but I believe a lot of places require servers to split the tip with other staff busboys etc? It can be based on sales not actual tips and leaving no tip can actually cost the server money.

I do understand where youre coming from but youre vastly understating the importance of operating costs and how even a tiny increase there can wipe out double digit percentages off if your net income.Again I can guarantee you Pringles didnt increase the price by almost  because there was  of inflation. I work with these numbers every single day it simply isnt a huge factor compared to the expected growth in profits from shareholders. If you dont believe me and actually think  inflation would force a company to raise the price by  just look at years like  where inflation was over  did prices rise by ? No not even remotely close.In fact for the past  years the vast majority of our growth has gone to the top  people earning over k in  dollars. Technology and efficiency increases dramatically every year but almost all those gains go to capital holders as opposed to worker compensation or decreased prices. SourceThere is a reason Costco can keep the price of their hot dogs the same for  years and still make a large profit off them and thats because never in history has it been so cheap to produce a hot dog. Never in history has it been so cheap to produce a gallon of milk. Factory farms have increased yields hundreds of times over. And companies like Costco use some of that growth to keep prices low. Most companies instead choose to pocket it as profit and raise prices. The bottom  of the population people making ltk are literally making the exact same amount of money they were  years ago. Think about that  years before the first personal computer. Think of how much technology and efficiency has increased since then? But if were making hundreds of times more product with the same amount of inputs why are prices going up and wages completely flat but people making over kyr saw a  increase in their income during that time period.,mildlyinfuriating,dfvzad0,1,t5_2ubgg

11604377,0,t1_dgaqgoi,Huge rant block coming up  for an XRay to tell the fucking Dentist what we both already knew. And the worst part is he then just told me theres nothing he can do because he isnt an oral surgeon and the abscesses have to reduce in size first.Fucker prescibed me AmoxClav and Hydrocodone since the pain was so bad. Paid another  out of pocket for pills.After the AmoxClav ran out the right side abscess hadnt gone away so I tried going to my GP since I wouldnt have to pay out of pocket for a nonspecialist but they apparently couldnt do anything because my Dentist had prescribed it so I call him up and he tells me he wont refill them unless I come in and he does more xrays which would cost me another  out of pocket. I dont have another  to throw at him so I couldnt pay him if I wanted to which I very much didnt. Between the first xray and the meds I had  left from my paycheck. Two weeks of my fucking work went towards a  minute oral xray. By the time I got paid next the left side abscess had grown back and the pain had returned. I was now out of pain meds which would cost me more than I had to my name. I was forced to miss work because I couldnt do anything between the pain so my next paycheck was barely over  meaning I didnt have enough to do a god damned thing about the pain or the infection slowly eating away at my jaw.No other dentist would see me because in my state going to a different doctor for a prescription is Doctor shopping and theyre super fucking strict about that here so no one would risk it. The Dentist who originally saw me refused treatment without me paying upfront. I had zero fucking choice. I paid the man with a credit card and the next day my bank account was over  in the red from the pills and xrays alone on top of the overdraft fee of . I worked through being high as a god damned kite for the next  weeks having to ask friends for rides and eating a pack of ramen a day for food because thats all I had.After working nearly full time while being a full time college student when I got my paycheck I now had a whopping...Our medical system sees people as dollar signs rather than actual fucking human beings. These people know well pay these exorbitant amounts because we have to or we fucking die.Healthcare in America isnt about the patient its about how much fucking money they can make and its corruption the whole way down. Random doctors will stop in random peoples rooms ask them a couple questions and bill them a few grand because they fucking can.Every part of our Healthcare system is just fucked and it all needs to be thrown out and redone from scratch without the current people on top controlling it. Med school in the US is ridiculously expensive forcing med student into hundred of thousands of dollars in debt. The administrators take HUGE cuts for themselves leaving scraps for everyone else. Doctors get greedy when they realize they can bill  for a god damned tongue suppressor so they find every excuse to do little things they can bill for. Insurance companies wont pay for necessary surgeries because why would they want to cover you still? Youre clearly too risky!Universal Healthcare might not solve this but it will damn sure help. Making sure every single American has access to the essential human right to fucking live. We wouldnt have children dying of completely preventable diseases because they were denied access to healthcare because they cant pay the fucking trolls toll to cross the bridge. My parents would not have had to declare bankruptcy twice because I had the audacity to be born with severe chronic asthma. I wouldnt be paying  god damned dollars a month for fucking inhalers that maybe cost them  to make. People who take money from insurance companies to yell how UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE WILL TURN YOUR KIDS INTO ltHOMOSEXUALS|COMMUNISTS|DAMNED DIRTY LIBERALSgt dont just have a special circle of hell they have a god damn special hell. These people would rather pad their own pockets and let children and families die than be even a half way decent human being and try and catch up with the rest of the world.And theres going to be someone who commentsthinks hurrdurr its clearly the ltRepublicans|Democrats|Lizard Peoplesgt fault! and let me say you are all wrong.Obama did nothing to get us towards Universal Healthcare. The ACA was essentially a farce creating more problems than it ever fixed. The AHCA was fucking disgusting and thank fuck it shot down but we now have three fucking presidents that would rather worry about the best ways to spy on their own citizens three Congresses and Houses that would rather line their pockets with corporate bribery than do their fucking jobs and enact the policy the people who fucking voted them in want them to enact. ,mildlyinfuriating,dgbd6am,30,t5_2ubgg

11735207,0,t1_dgq6o72,Yes I know that its not right to pretend it never happened. It did. People were treated horribly before much worse than how things are on either side. That still doesnt excuse the complete hypocrisy. Everyone wants equality but they expect it by giving them preferential treatment because somewhere way up in their family tree someone in their family was wronged. Read not the person who wants the perks.Yes the past presented horrible terrible things for many people for unfair reasons. But you know what needs to happen? People need to learn from it and actually fix the problem. Like... actual fix. Treat everyone equally regardless of any biological or cultural factors unrelated to the jobactivitywhatever. Which is completely different from lets just give preferential treatment to everyone who isnt the traditional oppressor group since... thats not actually fixing the issue its just... I want to say flipping the roles but that doesnt feel right because the historically oppressed groups were treated much worse but you get the point. People want equality while at the same time demanding that they be treated better because of a social label they carry.I dont deny that there are still social issues that need to be fixed. But I will argue that the solution to the issues isnt fixing anything. Its just encouraging people to expect more because of a social label they wear rather than considering that yes maybe Mr. White Male actually is more qualified than me for that thing he has. Maybe he did work hard through life and maybe he did actually earn it not just get handed it because of the body he was born into.,mildlyinfuriating,dgq7rkz,4,t5_2ubgg
