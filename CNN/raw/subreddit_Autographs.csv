Its just a fun movie to watch. Some scenes kind of drag on a bit but to me I think that was one of the little gems in the movie that storytelling can be dangerous hilarious creepy or just sad.,Autographs,ckrwkgc,1,t5_2qjxo

9259202,0,t3_577sc0,Im friends with one of Mariuccis sisters so I got invited to one of their practices a long time ago when they were practicing at the Hudson center in Green Bay. I believe it was a Sunday or Monday night game so Madden and Summerall were literally just chilling on their bus outside the practice area.One of those things I want to hang onto for a long time to see if the value goes up. Honestly I have no idea what I could fetch for it atm,Autographs,d8po5qs,1,t5_2qjxo
