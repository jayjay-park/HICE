5486058,0,t1_cwcteob,Youre right it may be a deterrent for employers in the finance industry. Im also a CSBBA DD UW ampamp WLU but I apply through coop jobs through Laurier mostly dev or tech consulting jobs. Of the  interviews Ive had with employers only one has ever asked me about some of the worse marks I have and I gave him an honest explanation some employers dont get that DD isnt a joke. It helps a lot if you have side projects or other work you can show itll prove both your passion for development and also your proven skill incase they doubted it because of your marks.At this point if you have grades you dont like the only thing to do is improve future marks and build some cool projects on the side. If youre smart people will recognize the utility of the dual skill set your degree provides. Ps I just recently had an interview with Deloitte not an accounting job but still and they didnt ask about my marks. Work hard and be smart. ,wlu,cwcw802,2,t5_2s5tw

6560125,0,t3_45h1kp,Disclaimer I was at Laurier for English but basically everyone I knew there was in BBA.Business is probably one of the best and most prized programs at Laurier if not the best right now. Coop is really good and my friends who were in BBA managed to get lots of great experienceoffers after graduation. I was actually just talking to a friend in Queens commerce who is struggling with getting a job and she mentioned that in a recent interview the interviewer said that her lack of relevant work experience was hurting her applications. Not to shit on Queens commerce but just saying that coop stuff goes a long way.Laurier as a school may not have an absolute toptier reputation in Canada compared to other schools but Business specific its very competitive.,wlu,czxvdly,3,t5_2s5tw

They usually divide the LOCUS students into a bunch of different smaller groups similar to the size of most floors in residence.,wlu,d24uzoh,1,t5_2s5tw
7430576,0,t3_4h1u0f,Economics is harder than BBA if youre not comfortable with calculus and sometimes probability. BBAs get the favour of the university the university separates BBAs and nonBBAs whenever its feasible for them to do so.,wlu,d2mt59y,8,t5_2s5tw

8241225,0,t1_d57m1fc,Clearly you dont understand unions or why we have them.  We have unions so we dont get exploited by management. Management would prefer to pay as little as possible for services and unions would prefer to be paid adequately and fairly for services.   Unions would prefer to work reasonable hours management would prefer people to be on call  hours a day and before unions to work for  hours a day for  days a week in some jobs.   How this benefits you as a student?  Having a union makes sure that for some reason you cant get hired as whatever you were planning on doing and instead have to hire on as janitorial staff or learn a trade that you will not be exploited.  What does it do for you explicitly it ensures your future and your childrens future by ensuring there are good jobs and unions to preserve good jobs.  If youd rather not have good jobs that is fine but think of it like this each time you do something like the university is trying to do you not only remove good jobs but you remove jobs entirely because the other way to do it will be more exploitative which means people will be working cheaper and longer.  By removing jobs you increase the unemployed and thus increase the amount of tax you will have to pay.  Union jobs create good quality middle class jobs that pay a good amount of tax have good benefits and thus are a lower burden on society as a whole.  You should really think about the secondary and tertiary effects when you support union busting... Because those effects will screw you and that is what union busting does screw everyone in the local community and nationwide.  The better option is more unions and more economic stability for everyone which btw is how your grandparents or parents likely were able to do things if they were in Canada and the lack of unions is probably going to be why your generation gets really screwed because you cannot collectively represent yourselves. You can already see that in the wages in the Waterloo region with a very few really making big money and the majority of young people being severely exploited. ,wlu,d57pj6d,3,t5_2s5tw
8309732,0,t1_d5g85n7,Yes but that is exactly my point if you dont know how to finish a question but you understand part of it you should just get a zero like someone who doesnt even know how to start? It is unfair. The essay example is a stretch because most people are able to make up some fluff even if it doesnt make sense. Same thing applies here though would you give somebody who started the essay the same mark as someone who wrote nothing? I doubt it. With math however youre working with a completely different language that not everybody understands. How could you even possibly begin to make up the solution if you dont understand the basics? We all can read english not all of us can read math. ,wlu,d5g9ubs,0,t5_2s5tw

It really helps living on a floor with a bunch of people in your program when it comes to course work and studying.
