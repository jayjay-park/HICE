304703,0,t3_1vtzql,Im not sure if you have seen anything like htis in your area.. but since you are in Bellingham look into our Vancouver program   I would also recommend emailing rescues and filling in applications. A responsible rescue will match you with the right dog for you.You could do something like Petfinder but the posts arent always accurate and its best if you can find a rescue that will work with you and a build a relationship and become committed to finding the right animal for your circumstances.You can also look into assistance dogs that have failed the course normally for minimal reasons often for being too friendly! haha  and see what they do with dogs that fail their program. They will be trained in compassion already... ,rescuedogs,cfcclo4,1,t5_2ryfq

5326045,0,t1_cvs0067,So the rescue league I went to has so many puppies obviously. I asked her about a few and she was telling me about the ones who are less likely to get adopted she also added that she is not forcing me in any way to make the decision to which one I should adopt. Of course to me it sounded that way but I know she is just trying to get them a good home. They are a rescue league and I believe they foster them themselves shes the owner and they dont euthanize if they arent adopted which is nice but I dont want them living like that for the rest of their lives,rescuedogs,cvsgpqu,1,t5_2ryfq

7779402,0,t3_4lvdlv,She would definitely benefit having a crate of her own. That needs to be her safe place. Nothing bad ever happens associated with the crate. The way you describe her wanting to get back to the shelter you need to get her to trust her crate that way. Over time with trust and consistency she will come to trust the rest of your home and your routine. Our recent rescue was on he way to feral when he was taken in. The first two days with us he sat in the same place in our dining room looking miserable watching everything happen around him. I coiled up a comforter around him to give him a nest and put water and food close by. He ate on the second day. We had to make him go outside to the bathroom on a leash but as soon as we came back in he would go straight to his blanket nest. It took several months to get him to come out of his shell. Weve had him for a year and a half now and hes a little skittish in scary situations like lightning and fireworks but is otherwise a perfect dog and very trusting of us. ,rescuedogs,d3qgcd4,1,t5_2ryfq
8431841,0,t3_4v3zok,That coloring looks closer to Merle thanks Dalmatian to me. I love we wiry coats. Besides terriers some pointers have wired hair German Wirehaired pointer being the chief breed. Our wire haired pound dog is also getting skin sploches although her fur dies not reflect that yet Overall I do not have much more help I am just here as one owner of a wire haired bearded dog to another I saw whatever is Pongo he is cute as hell!!,rescuedogs,d5virfc,2,t5_2ryfq

9432909,0,t1_d9bmzyp,Thank you for your thoughtful response.  To answer your questionsgtdo you want to be able to come home and do nothing some days?Honestly yes.  Of course.  And I think Ill still be able to have those days once in a while.  I mean I know Ill have to take him out and maybe walk him a bit at the bare minimum but generally speaking yeah.  Id want a couple days a month to be lazy. gtGo somewhere unplanned for a week that wont take dogs?This will absolutely happen.  Probably not for a week but at least for a weekend.  But other things I do like camping or visiting my family they would accept a trained pet.  The only problem is I literally have to fly everywhere I go due to the distance between myself and familybest friends.gtAre you willing to take care of an unexpected vet bill that could range from  easily?  Do you have the resources for that? I can easily take on  debt if they offer those resources to have payment plans.  I dont currently have  just to grab although I could dip into retirement savings and such if I absolutely had to.  So while  wont be a big deal something like  would.Id be willing to pay  for a pet I really loved.  But maybe not for a pet that I only tolerate which is why I dont have cats.gtWhat if they chew up one of your favorite possessions? Dont care.  I dont have many favorite possessions outside of fairly large musical instruments and those he would never have access to.  Or he would just chew the stand of.  No big deal. gtOr defecate in your house because they are having a hard time potty training or transitioning to their new home? No prob.  Im an extremely patient person.  I have no problem with training and repetition.  If he shits in the house for a while no big deal. Ill clean it up.  I am a very clean person though.  So it might be a bit frustrating at first but I can maybe replace my nice rugs with cheap ones for the first few months.  It would be worth it to me. gtAre you going to buy only the cheapest food available or are you going to research and make sure they receive top notch nutrition because they deserve a healthy and happy long life?Definitely good stuff.  Id feed him similarly to how I feed myself and I take careful thought into what I put in my body.  I also like to spoil so hell get good stuff.  I dont want to ever give him people food if I can help it.  I dont want him to know what its like because I dont want it to beg or long for something he cant readily have.  Is that a good idea?gtWhat if the dog has social and habit issues such as barking or is afraid of certain men or idle cars are you willing to put the time and effort necessary to solve their issues some that take months or years?Absolutely.  As I said Im very patient.  I really enjoyed helping train my parents dog and in fact I trained it things that they ended up not enforcing so she lost her no bark at the ball skills.  Oh well their loss!!gtHow would you deal with these few possibilities? Would you have friends or the resources to get a dog sitter?I dont have a ton of friends and resources where I live.  I probably wont get a dog until I move to a more dogfriendly city with a lot more friends in about  months from now. gtYou may want to start with something less time consuming to see if you are up for the commitment of a dog.What do you suggest?  I used to have a fish tank and fish and I kind of took care of them but they did nothing for me so I didnt feel as obligated to do much back besides feed them.I think fostering is a great suggestion.  Kind of get a feel for it.  But what are your thoughts on adopting vs. designer?  Youre a dog person I presume.  Do you sort of internally scoff at people who have designer dogs?  Also any tips on avoiding puppy mills?,rescuedogs,d9bopwt,1,t5_2ryfq
9480587,0,t3_585r2a,Ive always changed me dogs names. My last one was named Buttons and I abhor cutsie names. My recent one was named Mit which I hated too. Each person sounds different saying a name and dogs dont really know its a name so much as the word a person uses to call them. Its not like a kid which could induce trauma since we sew our identities into our names,rescuedogs,d9hoqed,1,t5_2ryfq
