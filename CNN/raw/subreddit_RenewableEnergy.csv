837483,0,t3_23ppvm,At least in the US another issue is the regulatory process to build additional plants.  Public opinion about the risks of nuclear are one thing but a huge issue is getting financing for a project that takes  years to get approval and build due to very complex and constantly changing regulations if it gets approvedbuilt at all. Were taking millions and millions of dollars with very high risk of no returns. Note that the regulations may be completely necessary I would much rather a highly regulated nuclear facility than a proliferation of sites with less stringent requirements but it does contribute to a slow or nonexistent growth rate of new sites in the US.

Plugging the charger in takes like  seconds. Not saying it couldnt happen but it seems pretty unlikely.I can understand if youre still skeptical. Im not really explaining it that well. J.B.

Evacuated tubes are slightly less efficient at high temperatures and are more expensive. You probably wont need much surface area to heat your pool either. And in Florida the only time you will have better results with photovoltaic is when its cloudy and raining. So unless its an indoor pool you wont be using it at those times.So maybe you want to go for a combo of Solarthermal Sunlight to heat and Photovoltaic sunlight to electricity.If you do go for a combo and are thinking of a powerwall its important to look at how you use electricity. Like if you are at work all day then most of the electricity produced will be fed into the grid without a powerwall. If youre home during peak sunshine then you can set it up so that youll use more of the energy you produce. So if you work from home then you either want a smaller powerwall or none at all. If youre at work all day then it makes sense to have one scaled to your needs. The more you know about your electricity usage the more you can optimize it.,RenewableEnergy,dckwv0c,2,t5_2ryj2
