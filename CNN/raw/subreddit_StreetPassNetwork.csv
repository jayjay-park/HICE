3777623,0,t3_2zvopl,Mostly when Im driving to and from work I occasionally get a streetpass and I find that to be rather amusing. I mean the streetpass range is fairly small so I imagine Id have to be right next to their vehicle to get tagged.,StreetPassNetwork,cqmvknm,1,t5_2t8ml
4052674,0,t1_cri75ig,This is a pretty great example of a terrible response when rude people dont read the full comment and assume someone hasnt already tried Google before asking for help. U.S. maps suggest the missing state is Delaware but if you hadnt jumped for the reply button to be an arrogant jerk about it you might have seen that Ive already streetpassed people from Delaware and Maryland and the map didnt fill it in. Thanks for the nonanswer though. Totally contributed in a helpful constructive way.,StreetPassNetwork,cri8iiv,2,t5_2t8ml
4573186,0,t1_ct705yv,that is why Ill be setting the weekly meet ups one on the weekend amp one on a weekday I understand everyone has a different schedule so I was thinking having one on Sundays and one on Mondays but Im still testing to see ifhow many show on which days cause if its only my sm.group of  that cant do weekends it wont be worth the Monday meetup I figured  meetups a week would encourage people to try and make them without feeling pressured to hurry or anything. D thank you for pointing it out and taking the time to comment,StreetPassNetwork,ct725kl,1,t5_2t8ml
7508644,0,t3_4i7bom,Hello! I am late in creating a checklist for Streetpass but here it is. I made it because I was curious in my progression with the outfits available in the Mii Plaza. I hope you all enjoy it and leave feedback if you check it out. Thanks and have an awesome day.,StreetPassNetwork,d2vp0yg,1,t5_2t8ml
