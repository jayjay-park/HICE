I mean I dont think you can find a single person who wouldnt want a school setting like it has.The female characters are interesting and relateable as well.I mean Mari is a good role model that Im sure most girls would would love to be like. Shes serious dauntless and bitchy while at the same time has real human female quirks sewing her reaction to snakes etc.Hana is honestly the best yanderetsundere Ive ever seen while remaining realistic. Her entire motivation to mess with Kiyoshi is actually reasonable.Meikos nicely represents a character that can be sexualized without being a slut in turn. P.S. They need to fix her meek attitude Im getting tired of it.Chiyo represents the innocent but realistic female well.

Mari was the one who noted Kiyoshi died so Im hoping she performs CPR on Kiyoshi with mouthtomouth resuscitation. The rest of the school watches them and because they broke the rules they end up losing the Kibasen and the USC disbands. Mari realizes that she actually likes Kiyoshi as well so after they settle everything being the school outcasts now the Waifu Wars arc will start. Chiyo will slowly understand what her feelings for Kiyoshi are after she shuns him and he tells her everything. Kate will probably a thorn in the side but the focus of the story will be Kiyoshis main relationships with the other relationships being explored. ,Kangoku_Gakuen,d1b9tdv,2,t5_35q1p

10915614,0,t1_de5gsxs,Im all about this. Your observations are very astute!Hana has a very outwardly alpha personality and of course that sense of dignity and Kiyoshi throws it all into disarray. The initial incident with her being exposed to him coupled with his peeing on her is very humiliating and debasing but its important to also consider that he isnt intentionally treating her in such a manner. Still it initiates not so much as a struggle for dominance between them but more of a break down of her dominant nature which is giving way to Kiyoshis presence in her life. While she is vying for is a position of equality next to him wanting to make him experience the things she has made him go through she is becoming more aware of her attraction towards Kiyoshis underlying strength. It makes me think of when he made a major show of dominance by grabbing her hair and escalating their kissing and it was so physically overwhelming for her to give up power that she passed out! When it comes to the Hana X Kiyoshi situation I think its easy to overlook all the significance in their water play relative to bdsm dynamics too. I think its pretty obvious that the author knows a thing or two about bdsm  and to say its just some taboo piss play is as overly dismissive as saying the other things between them are strictly sexual high jinks. When she finally pees on him I dont think it was intentional so much as it was her suffering another loss of control in a moment when she sort of preternaturally knows what he wants her to do without having to be told to do so. His own humiliation is oddly enough as unintentional as hers was. If all she wanted to do was debase him then she could have easily beaten him to a pulp and just peed on him then at some point in the past. Everything that is going on between them has progressed from an accident to acts of increasing intimacy. Water sports arent arent strictly about humiliation though it may be easy to assume so.  They also touch on a willingness to accept a person after their perceived defilement. Whats more compelling a person who loves a visage of perfection or somebody who loves a person in spite of their flaws and is able to share in their experiences? And if you want to also look at it in a more animalistic way theyve essentially marked each other as territory. They have ownership over one another and share a unified presence in their own odd sort of way. If the pee wasnt evidence enough of this being the case the way they quickly find that wearing each others underwear feels natural and comfortable to them should be enough to make it clear. All that in mind its highly possible the author is toying with many of us readers with the intent of having us die in fits of indignation after making us witness Kiyo shipping with anyone that isnt Hana edits for my poor grammar and proofing skills lol,Kangoku_Gakuen,de5v9t9,10,t5_35q1p
