3139223,0,t3_2vzxff,Seems to work for everyone except of me. At first thank you for the hard work. Now my problem is that the bot is doing absolutely nothing. Im not using any screen color modifications and have the volume buttons on top. Im using Iphone  and Im pretty maxed out th maybe barracks too high !?. As Iphone  im still on Ios and Autotouch for Ios  is it working with this version of autotouch ? And i have one barrack under construction maybe that is an issue ?

3343625,0,t3_2yfp7l,At this time I do not intend to make the bot open source for a few different reasons. The main one being that I really have put a lot of work into making sure this bot stays free and available to anyone who wants it. In the future if I decide that I have gone all the distance I can with the bot I may consider opening it up and stepping away from it altogether. For the time being I have lots of exciting things planned for the bot ,CoCBot,cp9ec8y,3,t5_35mvq

5993106,0,t1_cy47coo,Thanks for sharing this.  My suspision of loot being dry is confirmed after watching an hour or so.  I have been watching the bot make a net total of k gold in over an hour and two attacks.  It has restarted at least  times searching due to an inability to find bases.  All the looted gold were just recovering the nexting prices.  I love the bot but loot just is not there at the moment.
