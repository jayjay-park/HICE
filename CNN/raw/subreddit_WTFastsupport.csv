4219984,0,t3_32bwwl,Could you please right click on the System Tray Icon for WTFast and select exit.  The WTFast System Tray Icon should disappear.  Next hit Windows Key  R  and type in the followingCProgram Files xWTFastwtfast.exe logverbose if you installed WTFast in a different directory you will need to type in that instead.   Hit enter and that will launch WTFast in logging mode. Try and use WTFast the same way you normally would and when it crashes make sure that it is completely closed on your system. This will then generate two files on your desktop one about ping and the other is called wtfastdubuglog.If you could send us those files that would help us diagnose the issue. ,WTFastsupport,cs19dqf,1,t5_375l8

4615043,0,t3_3e5o35,Riot has a gateway server before its game server that blocks all pings to the game server this is to prevent a DDoS against LoL.  Anything past this gateway WTFast cant ping so we ping up to it for both your regular connection and wtfast and compare the two as the last part of the route we cannot ping is the same for both its a functional comparisonyou can see if WTFast offers improvement or not.  LoLs ingame ping meter uses TCP which is accurate and shows the whole route in this instance.  The ms you missing on the WTFast side is everything after the gateway.Also we dont have an LA did you mean CA?,WTFastsupport,ctcb0jx,1,t5_375l8
4806684,0,t1_ctyefg4,I make sure I click League of Legends from the drop down bit where you select the game I tried using De as it generally seems to be better ping than De and I managed to get into a custom game just me no bots ping stayed around  but did shoot up to  for a couple of seconds at one point I will try it in a PvP game and post results from that too thanks,WTFastsupport,cu0f7gk,1,t5_375l8
