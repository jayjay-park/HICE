7415513,0,t3_4gv8oa,W is always better. You can do Q first for more damage in your full combo but I wouldnt say there is any situation where I would actually do that.,LeBlancMains,d2l3ge2,2,t5_35bez
7428375,0,t1_d2m4wb9,I love just chaining whoever dives on my carry since it allows the carry to one reposition and deal tons of damage but also allows you to stay behind the fight and blow up the last of the enemy team when their tanks are dead. Plus sometimes tanks are too preoccupied with diving your adc that you can kill theirs faster than they can kill yours so thats where flanking is really nice. ,LeBlancMains,d2mk4ih,1,t5_35bez

7818762,0,t3_4me3lb,The burn really doesnt synergize with her at all. So no. When behind early void staff is the most cost efficient damage item you can get.,LeBlancMains,d3uw6qm,1,t5_35bez
8435168,0,t1_d5vpscl,The key is applying proper pressure and being unpredictable. She lacks any real trade on you unless she lands a stun that means you should be contesting every cs. Always try to stay in W range unless she is respecting it. A simple W is hard to react to and a quick QW is also hard to react to unless you are being very obvious about it which is why it is important to try to always stay in W range and to be constantly moving. If you are staying behind range minions and then walk up to W ofcourse she is gonna have the stun ready. If she is good at reacting W to gap close and QE her. Watch out for stun andor wall back to your landing pad. Obviously go ham if she ever spells on creeps. Even if you dont kill her I think pre its pretty easy to get a cs lead over her and she has very little pressure. You can drop a W or QW at level  to see how her reactions are.Post  you have a massive advantage with QR poke. All she really wants to do is clear the wave with R  stun combo.Punish that. She doesnt do a lot of damage to towers and even then you have all the lane pressure post so you should clear the wave quickly and then roam.,LeBlancMains,d5vxoig,2,t5_35bez

9611205,0,t3_5cmdu2,If recommend more tankiness right now Im building morello into swifties into rylais into abysmal and zhonyas order depends on whos fed on the enemy team into death cap or void staff depending on how squishy the enemy team iswho I have to kill fast. Since lb is more like a sustain Mage now I think tankiness is much more important than before so Id recommend more tankiness so you have time for your damage to go off late game. ,LeBlancMains,d9xs00w,1,t5_35bez
9614080,0,t1_d9y4hyw,Im not saying Bjerg doesnt play champions for fun obviously he does just like anyone else. Im just saying that as a pro hes probably more focused on how strong a champion is than how fun they are to play. He literally said in the video that I go on Reddit and all the LeBlanc mains are like yeah LeBlanc sucks now dude she doesnt even do any damage... she is not even viable anymore. Except that isnt why most of us are complaining like you said the most common thing youve seen people complain about is that shes not an assassin anymore. I really think that if Riot shifted LeBlanc more towards her assassin roots again many of us would be happy. ,LeBlancMains,d9y4sqr,6,t5_35bez
9632834,0,t1_d9y3riu,I personally like the changes. Makes early game so much easier. ,LeBlancMains,da0g0w8,1,t5_35bez
9647611,0,t1_da29dpt,Yeah I really wish Riot actually listened to the LB mains and made her more of an assassin since you know thats her fucking class. I wouldnt care if she was weaker as a result I mean before the rework she was a pure assassin at a  winrate and we still played her just please make her an actual assassin again since that play style is so much more fun. In fact this is probably whats going to happen... . Riot made LB more of a conventional mage type to the point where shes more of a mage than an assassin or at best . . LB mains dont complain vocally enough since there arent a lot of ussome are happy since at least LB is strong now too strong. . LB gets nerfed so that shes just as strong as she was before the rework but now she isnt an assassin anymore and Riot gets exactly what they wanted all along a way to kill LB the assassin without causing a large backlash. Riot wanted to kill her as an assassin so I just said agree because they accomplished exactly what they wanted in the rework make her more similar to conventional mages to appease all the whiny adcs who complain that they got oneshotted by a fed LB after wanderering into the enemys jungle alone with no vision or summs. ,LeBlancMains,da29nsg,5,t5_35bez
9714288,0,t3_5e8dbq,Nerfs to her early game are definitely needed not too upset about this at all. Taking base damage out of her E and putting it into her Q is also not surprising I dont think Riot intended to have people maxing E first or second like they do. I just hope they buff her late game thats all I really want at this point.,LeBlancMains,daahvqn,4,t5_35bez

9814227,0,t1_dami6dv,First of all just because you like the changes DOES NOT mean that the people that dont werent good so they picked a champion that they didnt have to put thought into.  You are gold.  You are in the upper echelon of what people consider not good.Secondly why dont you quit babyraging against people that dont agree with your opinion which you are perfectly entitled to just like we are perfectly entitled to oursThirdly I have yet to see a post in this subreddit gushing about new LB. Sure there are posts that say they like the rework but those posts also see problems with the kit.,LeBlancMains,damta70,2,t5_35bez

9882805,0,t1_davqynv,Q on a new LeBlanc is used more as a finishing tool than a starting tool like it used to be. Maxing it first is not that bad but you sacrifice your huuuge wave clear potential with it because your W has such a big cooldown also enemy can punish you more easily when you used your W and it isnt first maxed. New LeBlanc is played around the passive proc mostly and Q is usually used to actually pop it not start it. The best thing you can do on lane is to try to W enemy casters and enemy come back and use Q on casters. You instaclear them and enemy is poked.,LeBlancMains,davr4bb,2,t5_35bez

10552666,0,t1_dd3ycn7,I totally agree which is why Im surprised reworked Leblanc feels more viable to me late game. It could be that she is less effective but Ive just gotten better at late game decision making but at the same time her winrate in high elo seems to indicate she is more effective overall.,LeBlancMains,dd49htn,1,t5_35bez
