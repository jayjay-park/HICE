38591,0,t3_1ujwvu,That all looks pretty good to me.What Id probably do is change up the commander Eng. to have ET AB EPtW RSP. ET you wont get much use out of but its handy once in a while especially while RSP is up and TT isnt needed.DEM isnt terribly impressive especially sans Dulmur and EPtW will be a larger damage boost thats effectively alwayson. With RSP available you can play more aggressively get among enemies up close with impunity. And thats a pretty good damage boost too.Im sure DEM and ES are better pvp abilities so youd probably want a separate boff but it looks like youre used to that.,stobuilds,ceitoz1,2,t5_2uv5z
147908,0,t1_cev9j6l,One thing that I can say about the cluster torp is that each mine hits each target in range so if you have a ball o baddies in a gravwell and you lob the cluster torp in itll do MASSIVE damage to them all. Sure it wont show in the DPS because of the spike but at the same time when those hit they hit hard.

505257,0,t1_cfxfegm,Well EC can be used to buy boosts for a lot of other currencies like fleet credits reputation marks etc.  At least to me if you havent ground any of that stuff yet its a better use of your EC.  If youre low on Dilithium Ore you can also buy Contraband off the Exchange and turn it in for ore.  If youre a KDF you can get all up into Marauding and get even more contraband.Unfortunately in order to buy a ship from the Reddit starbase youll need to be a member of a Reddit fleet.  This isnt true of most of the other gear you can buy fleet gear by being invited to fleet maps by a member of that fleet.  Unless you have a personal attachment to the fleet youre in it would be wise to join one of ours and reap the rewards.  You will have to wait a very very long time for your fleet resources to get where we are now.Easiest way I found to figure out DOFF stacking amounts was to buy the white DOFFs off the Exchange and test.  Theyre not bound so they can be resold or used in projects.  Very cheap too.K FC and  Omarks is just scratching the surface trust me   On just my one build Ive probably spent  mil FC and thousands and thousands of Omarks.,stobuilds,cfxp8im,1,t5_2uv5z

Theres little reason to run DC over DHC.Core gear The Borg shield is very meh especially on Escorts.  Id swap with Elite Fleet Resilient MACO if youre not going to add a Leech or Solanae which brings me to my next point Solanae  part is meh but you could do worse.  my main runs it but more for the Shield and Engine gimmicks That said Im not a fan of the core.  If you can afford a Fleet core Id probably go that way.Consoles Engineering  Neuts is overkill.  The rd one isnt adding much to your overall res comparatively speaking and youll get more from a different console entirely.  In fact on an Armitage especially with Plasma Id advise moving  or  of your Universals to Engineering and putting Embassy Emitter Arrays with Pla and Th in your science slots. Science See above.  Personally Id say the Dyson console isnt worth it for this build either but thats your call.  Its not a terrible choice. Tactical Fine here.  Get fleet when you can. General Id put a Leech in Eng or Sci if you can afford it.  Id swap any but the Borg console for it.Boffs Youve got a bit of an unorthodox setup here.  First thing why EPtA?  You have exactly  power reliant on that and fighters dont take that long to launch.  Id advise swapping to EPtS for more survivability. Science powers are OK. Tactical Standard boilerplate PVE meta favors AoE powers.  Singletarget is fine but just keep that inmind.  I personally think youre toofocused on your torp but again not terrible.  Personally Id see to having APB slotted higher than CRFCSV too but its not a huge deal.Consider a Drake build.  Slot  Purple or  Blue Damage Control Engineers so you can cycle your EPtX abilities almost constantly.  This along with the Warp Core Engineer will allow you to keep your power levels high across the board.,stobuilds,cgahvnx,3,t5_2uv5z

1135922,0,t1_chxe71b,Ohh nice thought. I think romplas GW is definently the way to go here and suprise suprise you have a more tactically oriented build than mine. I do like this setup as well although Im not sure about a few things on this setupAs to engineering abilities I think his ship is already maneuverable enough to get where it needs to go inherently  I think AD may be misplaced and instead I would suggest some emergency power abilities.Also console wise I understand the leach which is probably worth the slot but is the Isocharge really going to be that good?Why a plasmaintegrated core? I would have assumed one that boosted aux capacity would do more good and a hypercharged with its boost to engine power cant hurt as well. I think the deflectorengine are interesting choices but I think the romulan engines going to be overkill for what OP wants to do damage wise  not that more damage every hurt anyone its really back to personal preference again  I think the deflectorengine could be used to squeeze more effectiveness into the gravity well and I think there are probably better standalone deflector for tanking than elite fleet fermions  especially if the intent isnt to draw aggro which your build will be doing quite well so far.,stobuilds,chxegjn,3,t5_2uv5z

Would double TT and the conns allow for  uptime on Tac team?I believe the minimum cooldown on TT is s regardless of however means we use to get it down to that point. If those Conn DOffs can bring a single copy down to an acceptable amount of time you could always go  FAWAPB  FAWAPBAPO  TTWhich would increase your DPS.

1889451,0,t3_2g958i,Oh. This thing melts faces.  Dont ever think otherwise.Let me break down the standard build I use. As well search up stobuilds for recluse and youll find an older post or two including some great details.First off. Romulan Science Plasma Consoles  All Plasma Beams  Cutting Beam for your weapons.  Tac Consoles. That will set you for your damage.Next up is the Mesh Weavers  YES. Very much yes. These are fantastic. They provide a fantastic boost for you. And they can take a pounding.For consoles. You want the two Tac damage boosters the romulan science consoles. Then the Romulan Rep Plasmotic Leech Omega. And the last is a floater. I would say the Grid isnt bad if you have the web console. This is also fantastic for the Crystal Entity.. but thats about it. Use it during its aoe attack when it charges and it wont damage anyone.Other than that. I go for Tac commander with FAW  APB Grav well  hazard emitters two shield heals Tatc team  on my other TAC and for engy slot Power to weapons and Struct Heal.This is all written in haste. But this is a pure Damage Recluse but it DOES do damage and its pretty hard to kill.,stobuilds,ckgvcun,1,t5_2uv5z
1915311,0,t1_ckjxsmr, AB drains the aux of course but during the times when its not drained the leech provides a good amount of power and I supplement with Aux BatteriesRMC as needed. The main problem with rebalancing the power levels to account for leech is that leech itself is unreliable in how much youll actually get. This is one of those tweakfine tuning things Ive been wanting to do though. Nukara set is just for the damage bonus. I tried running piece Undine first so that I could get the AoE ability from that but it turned out to be pitiful and kind of a waste of time. If I were to switch with Rom engines Id probably go with KHG shields for the placate proc rather than fleet shields.    All that being said the Nukara piece is probably the biggest damage boost Ill be able to squeeze out of the enginesshields as Im not a tactical captain and dont have APA to boost alongside APO and APB. And yes the Tu version is something that Im looking forward to  should mean a good boost to all the abilities of this ship.,stobuilds,ckjzdgm,1,t5_2uv5z
1922027,0,t3_2gnbiv,Couple of things Id recommend a fleet resilient shield for the lower bleed through  Res B is best for PvE generally.Im not sure the DBBs in the aft slots are the way to go seeing as the ones in the front limit the angle at which you could successfully broadside so thats just wasted DPS right there. The torp is likely losing you damage too because of its ineffectiveness against shields.Console wise  Sabotage Probe Launcher Energy Signature Dampener Mk XII amp Spatial Charge Launcher are not items you see commonly listed on STObuilds I cant really comment on their effectiveness but the ZeroPoint Energy Conduit Plasmonic Leech w a flowcap or  Nukara Particle Converter or Bioneural Infusion Circuits would be strong alternativesYou havent listed your doffs but assuming this is a AB build you need x purple technicians and a second copy of AB to make it effective apologies if this is not the intended build but its difficult to judge without seeing your doffs Otherwise your boff powers look fine though I would swap RSP for EPT as RSP is more than enough usually ,stobuilds,ckksgxw,1,t5_2uv5z

As Cryptic never provides anything useful on this front and testing is done by a small group of individuals that usually only post their findings and often without context we get into situations like above where something is tested and it becomes the standing meme often well past the time its still valid best example I can think of is early AB and cruisers sucknever use more than  beams.

2737363,0,t3_2renku,To know why crafted weapons are often preferred you need to know about mods.Theres  main mods and several crafted ones.  Dmg CritD CritH and Acc are the  normal ones crafting can bring in Over Pen Snare Thrust and some PVPonly ones.The general ranking of the base  for most PVE builds are CritD Acc CritH Dmg.  I may have CritH and Acc backwards.  The idea being that youll be maximizing CritH on your consoles and then maximize CritD on weapons.  Acc is easy to fill up now and while it does spill over into CritD and CritH the flat CritD bonus is preferred.  Dmg scales very very poorly and is easily the worst mod of all.  The bonus damage it gives is only something like a dozen per volley or something.Pen works as an instant Disruptor proc for a given shot and usually evens out to about the same bonus as CritD.  The other  crafted mods are generally considered lessuseful but can be fun to have anyway.So advanced fleet weapons are only available in the following flavors Dmgx Acc Dmgx Accx Dmgx CrtD Dmgx CrtHNotice all the Dmg mods?  Thats not great.  Honestly they work fine if you have more FC than dilECcrafting mats and just want something reasonable for endgame right away.However in most cases youll be better served by crafting and upgrading.. Get beam crafting up to where you can start hitting VR purple mk II beams.  This isnt hard I think by rank  you should be pretty consistent without using Catalysts.. Craft a Mk II beam.  This costs something like  white components.  If its a good combination of mods CritDx CritDx Pen or some other combo you like save it.  Otherwise Exchange or vendor it.  Repeat until you get a worthy weapon.. Craft or buy Superior or Superior Experimental Beam Upgrades.  Apply this to your weapon.. Apply the upgrade.  You should end up with  upgrade chance with an Experimental.. Keep hitting upgrade dont apply more kits until you get a Quality Upgrade to UR.  The Quality upgrade brings another one of the standard mods.  If you run out of upgrades Mk VIVIII or so IIRC with no upgrade Exchange or vendor.  . If you hit a UR upgrade let the upgrade kit finish out you might luck out and score an Epic.  If its a mod youre satisfied with CritD preferred then apply more kits.  Just use regular Superior at this point. If you have leftover TP the upgrade will just roll over and let you move on.  Youll know when it runs out as itll allow you to add another upgrade kit.  Quality upgrades are chancebased every time you upgrade an items mark.  This is why lowmark crafting is lucrative.  One kit on a lowmark weapon will give you a bunch of chances to upgrade while a high mark one will require several kits before itll upgrade at all.So by crafting you can end up with CritDx or CritDx Pen or any other combination you want or possibly an Epic adds AcDm.  It will cost more Dil and EC especially due to failed ones but generally those are easier to come by than Fleet Credit and youll get a more optimal set of mods.,stobuilds,cnf85q8,6,t5_2uv5z

This DoT is special because whenever it procs the damage is a sum of all the Fleet Science consoles you have equipped and the DoT is boosted by Tactical consoles that improve Beam Cannon or Plasma damage. It can add up to a decent chunk of damage.The Plasmonic Leech functions as a vampire. It makes your energy weapons drain power from enemy ships and add it to your power levels.

Not just the one youre shooting but every torpedo tube on your ship.This lets you use rapidly firing torpedoes to quickly reload a torpedo with a lengthy cooldown like the Breen cluster launcher. By default its got a s cooldown but you can reduce it to s by using PWOs with other torpedo launchers.If youre using a torpedo that is already quickly reloading there isnt too much point in stacking more launchers. Remember torpedoes have a global  second cooldown. It doesnt matter how many launchers or how many PWOs you have you cant get past that  second global cooldown.Something like the Romulan HyperPlasma launcher with  PWOs is going to be firing at the global cooldown almost every shot so while you could stick more torpedo launchers on this ship it wouldnt do much for you.,stobuilds,cp3d7pf,2,t5_2uv5z

4418730,0,t3_3bmdof,Pushing k out of my Morrigu with lousy flying  the Pilot Warbirds should be capable of more than that thanks to the extra forward slot.editForgot the second part. Id say the consoles are debatable probably depends on what alternatives you have and your build. The Microprojectile Launcher boosts projectiles and is a nicely damaging ability on its own. The Subspace Sinkhole is great crowd control for pug builds. The piece console set reduces the cooldown on pilot abilities making them a bit more viable they have pretty long cooldowns without.If anything DHCs should benefit from lock trajectory since it lets you run at full throttle without taking your cannons off target if you utilize it correctly. For slow enemies fly perpendicular to them ideally their rear arc if you have Intel flanking and hit it. For faster enemies it can compliment strafing runs along with your pilot maneuvers to stay close but doesnt feel nearly as needed there since you can usually dogfight well with fast enemies.,stobuilds,csnq4q6,2,t5_2uv5z

5050655,0,t3_3jm3qg,Pets are odd. Raising a pets rarity doesnt affect its hull hp or shields only its abilities  and usually its only a small increase like an ability rank up or in the odd case gaining a extra weapon.Generally speaking if the ship you are using can slot frigates you should use them. Frigates tend to have lots of HP and shield to play with along with high damage abilities  the combination of the two means theyll both tend to live longer and do more damage than the average fighter.Whatever pet you want to use I suggest taking a look at the tooltips for the rare advanced and very rare versions before you spend anything on getting them.The exceptions to this would be the elite widows and scorpions which you can get via the reputation for nukararomulan  both are fairly solid fighters which have some exceptional abilities though not without their drawbacks. Widows for example have fire at will which makes them extremely good at shooting down high yield torpedoes for instance. The drawback of this is theyll often aggro lots of enemies and they have very little HP so youll be constantly redeploying them. Scorpions have a high yield plasma torpedo which makes them exceptional against unshielded targets such as structures in borg stfs. Unfortunately the torpedoes they fire have the drawback of being able to be shot down and again have very little HP so when using scorpions against say voth or vaaduar they will not be effective.Other pets Ive used includeelite yellowstone runabouts which are exceptional for slowing and holding enemies along with having a moderate amount of HPshield but have a very slow launch speed and tend to be fairly slow to catch up to the carrier in combat. If you use a ship like I do galx that has trouble turning quickly these can make an otherwise annoyingly fast enemy get stopped in its tracks and often will survive damage that would outright kill fighters.elite delta flyers which arent very good at doing damage but try to drain shields. Their main use is against the crystallyne entity since the ability they use takes off stacks of the healing the entity gets from small shards. They like the runabouts have a moderate amount of hull HP and shields and also share the long cooldown time between each wing being launched. I would avoid getting these.Elite type  shuttles. Boy was this a mistake to buy  they ARE a noticable upgrade from the normal shuttles but not in a way that matters. The rare versions of shuttles have only a phaser. Elites have polarize hull and micro photon torpedoes. Thats it. They do not use polarize hull in any intelligent way and there is a long cooldown between uses so although they will randomly survive lots of damage most especially from repulsortractor beams since polarize hull completely negates them theyll often simply die in droves. The tooltip lies for them too since their HP is less than some other fighters.Shield repair units... Die. Often. They have an even longer launch time than runabouts dont have a worthwhile amount of HP and do nothing but repair your shields. Expect these to get uselessly destroyed the moment you take any kind of fire. Dont buy these please.Ive tried the rare peregrine fighters before I found them mildly useful but was warned not to buy the higher quality versions because they did not intelligently use the cannon ability. Given theyre not very strong HPShield wise and the scorpions seem to be better at the job theyre trying to do I didnt bother buying better ones.EDIT I forgot about elite swarmers. Swarmers will tend to die a lot because their AI wants to have them close in and mob the target at practically the range they could lick the target so this means when the target dies so do all of them. Swarmers use variations on beam overload and are pretty good at unloading shots immediately on launch so if youre in a nasty place where your pets are constantly going to die anyway like if youre fighting against voth you might consider trying these. Otherwise Id skip them  scorpions will do more damage IF their torpedoes can land and swarmers have very little HP. Its hard to rank these guys up for instance simply because of how suicidal they are.I made a post a while ago about pet HPlaunch times for fighters. I cant be sure its still accurate but it might be useful for you,stobuilds,cuusn4s,1,t5_2uv5z

I think swapping that for a tactical seat is more than worth it. And if you are in love with the visuals this mirror ship lets you keep them.        IMO no cruiser with  tactical seats is really worth using. Its just not as effective at killing stuff even with Aux  Bat. Id say  tac seats is the minimum for an ENGcruiser like this. That can be in any configuration but  seats.,stobuilds,cvdqarr,1,t5_2uv5z

5273844,0,t3_3n8fuq,Lots of reasons why this might be the case Your TS might be firing while you have most of your buffs upyour targets are debuffed while your TS isnt. Your TS might be hitting more targets while your TS isnt e.g. you fire TS into a gravity well of Borg Spheres while your TS is just hitting gate. Your TS might be hitting more unshielded targets than your TS.If youre running SCM best Combat Log Reader software out there in my opinion you should be able to isolate TS and TS and investigate how many attackshits theyre getting off what theyre hitting what their average damage is etc. These will all offer clues. You can also filter and graph your TS vs TS damage as a function of time both in discrete bar form and continuous line form to see if timing of buffsdebuffs is at issue.Im  sure the problem is timing its just a matter of figuring out what the timing issue is and correcting it.,stobuilds,cvlskr6,6,t5_2uv5z
5279841,0,t3_3nbadm,gt  Torpedo Astrometic Synergy Regenerative Torpedo Synergy and Torpedo PreFire Sequence all seem like theyre just about musthave traits for a dedicated torpedo boat. However that doesnt leave a lot of room for all the other highlydesired traits. So what do you keep and what do you drop?Torpedo PreFire Sequence PassiveThe only must have for me. Id trade out Aux Offensive if better.Regenerative Torpedo Synergy PassiveUnless Im flying my FBP build Im not using shield heals that often and Im using hull heals more often that shield heals. This would seem to benefit those trying to shield tank. My guess is that  shield heals  really are needed to optimize this trait. Too bad hull heals are not included in the trait.Torpedo Astrometic Synergy PassiveI only have one torpedo specialty attack two if I use my Recon so this is interesting but its usefulness seems very limited. This benefits those who run tactical not science powers. This will work wonderfully on tactical ships.gt  The Classic SciTorp setup is a PEP a Gravimetric Torpedo and a Neutronic one. However the terran ordinance piece is also looking like a musthave set for torpedo boats so that means making room for another torpedobeam array.I run only torpedoes so decent dps and shield bypassing damage is a must for me. The Terran Photon Torpedo TPT has a chance to apply radiation damage so depending on that chance gt Im very inclined not to use the torpedo. Id rather go for a automatic or a strong chance to apply the radiation application. If the radiation damage is similar to that of  the Enhanced Bio Molecular then it will likely sit next to the Enhanced BioE. I will have to see what the general projectile damage set bonus is and that could make the choice hard. The click enhancement Secondary Torpedo Launchers could be very interesting. Speculation Given the three piece history a short on window  secs perhaps maybe  at the most and with a  to  minute cool down it might not be worth it to me.  The power will have to be fantastic for me to consider putting a beam array on my build.My setups generally include the PEPan all use torpedo and the Gravimetric torpedo but the Neutronic is situational as is the Gravimetric sometimes. The Harghpeng adds good single target killing power and an AOE blast. gt a The terran torpedo being a photon makes me wonder if it might be better to shift to mainly using Photon torpedoes now that there are three very nice photon rep torpedoes Gravimetric Enhanced BioMolecular and the new Terran one. Especially since the gravimetrics set bonus is all about maximizing the effectiveness of photon torpedoes.For this torpedo boat captain as of this moment the Enhanced BioMolecular torpedo is the weak link with its low radiation shield bypassing damage. As said before if the TPT has equivalent radiation And I suspect it is similar to the Enhanced BioMolecular but with stacking  then I wont be using either until my Science powers can quickly drop NPCs shields. If that happens then Ill break the hull crackers Enhanced Bio E and Neutronic out.  With a torpedo like the PEP I do not think so. If folks want to run three fore torpedoes then the TPT would make for an interesting third torpedo. I guess that it is more a hull cracking torpedo but I actually hope it is more shield bypassing similar to the Gravimetric. And the way Cryptic has been trying to build the value of HYs I suspect we will get a HY volley special effect like Neutronic but a fast moving BY like the EBM would be fun. But this is all speculation. We will see soon enough. ,stobuilds,cvmk6zx,1,t5_2uv5z

Targeting an ally with APD and APDP might seem appealing but thatll only help one of your teammates and only if that teammate is already generating the most threat though I suppose you can buff APD to provide  ThreatScale with three AdakUkans. Still think Id recommend running x APB literal or virtual though.Youll want to run either Gravity Well especially if your teammates are running DBBs andor torpedoes or Tykens Rift in the Science seat. If you go Grav Well youd want to supplement with Destabilizing Resonance Beam since its a channel youd need to keep enemies in its narrow arc to function most effectively.If going full on support Id recommend Improved Tachyon Beam powered by Radiant Nanite Cloud if possible for the powerful AOE heals the shieldstripping will be minimal and a tangential benefit if at all.Could run Structural Integrity Collapse in one or two of the Engineering seats for your torpedoflinging friends. Id also recommend considering Command secondary spec if you can live without Pilots speed and turn bonuses might be tough to give up for a carrier though.A full suite of Disruptor Pen weapons for maximum DR debuff.

With  R and one VR you should get max uptime for EPtX powers. Combined with Reciprocity the cooldown on the bionueral is pretty much going to waste. The ZPEC gives both power to all subsystems and crit severity so much better than the bioneural. Another reason to get rid of the bioneural is the Conductive RCS console. You can get UR crafted ones with a decent mod for very cheap on the exchange and they add both flight turn rate shield HP AND even more tank and turn rate whenever you get healed. This triggers on EPtS as well again another reason to go for a proper drake build with the DCEs.The Dyson and Rom Rep trait are both superior for this build to what you are currently running. with both FAW and Emergency Weapon cycle you are putting out an absolutely insane amount of hits. This translates to a very reliable CritH rate. If you parse youll notice your reported Crit rate and your in game displayed crit rate should be very close to each other.The Borg KCB and Assimilated console gives you a chance at a HUGE weapon drain resistance. Theres a lot of math behind it but it basically means more shots get fired at higher energy levels meaning more damage.

6564251,0,t3_45e87u,While according to your parse your beam has the highest DPS Ill assume that youll want to prioritize your kinetic and exotic damage based on your thread title.   Some suggestions going from top to bottom more or less  Try the Solanae deflector.  Its free and gives the biggest boost to PartGs.  But bringing that in would mean youll have to replace your shield with AMACO too keep the pc torp bonus.  The Neutronic is one of the better utility torps out there so Id try to get that up fore.  PEPT is also a great utility torp and is cheap on the exchange.  As many stated here Id drop the EPS console you wont need it for an exotictorp build.  Id move one of the universals youve got in your sci slots there.  For your sci slots Id use research consoles instead of the embassy ones since you arent using PEPT and you are wasting the plasma bonus.  Dropping your EPS console will let you add one more PrtG console here.  Id drop TS.  Instead Id probably go TT KLW for that BOff then FAW OSS TS for the nd BOff.  Youll get more DPS out of TS than OSS.  This is assuming you are getting good proc rates for Reciprocity.  If you are not getting reliable procs from Reciprocity to keep everything on global cooldown I suspect you dont draw enough threat to do so then look into the next point.  If you get enough threat then skip the next point.  Id drop KLW.  Instead Id use TT TS for that BOff then TT OSS and TS for the nd Tac BOff.  Doubling up will let you drop Reciprocity.  It may seem counterintuitive at first but as you move up in DPS and find yourself running with higher DPS people or if you find yourself with a true AggroTankAggronaut youll find Reciprocity to be quite unreliable.  Going to your traits Id drop Beam Barrage for SelfModulating Fire shield pen and Point Blank Shot for Projectile Training.  Id also drop Techie since if you fly it right you wont need all that extra healing having Radiant Field should be more than enough if you fly her correctly and drop in Conservation of Energy for some extra Exotic damage.  For the passive rep Id drop Radiant Detonation Matrix doesnt seem to be worth it based on your parse and put in Omega Kinetic Shearing a must have on any torp build.  Id also replace Particle Generator Amplifier for Torpedo Astrometric Synergy for more Sci CD reduction.  With AHOD and Astrometric Synergy youll get a  CD reduction for sci skills whenever you queue up a TS.  Going to your starship traits Id drop EWC.  On a torp heavy setup you wont get much DPS from this.  You may also want to drop Reciprocity based on what I said above.  To replace those Id look to getting Weapons System Synergy if you are a lifetime subscriber Improved Command Frequencies by maxing out the Command Tree or the new Sci Oddys trait Checkmate.  If you do get Checkmate youll really want to use a PEP torp instead of the TDD.Now moving on youll have to remember that flying a scitorp setup is very different to flying a beam boat or a standard kinetic ship.  This is more about timing than keeping skill uptime.  But some flight pointers  DRB is best use in tandem with GW on the Spheres especially.  If you time it all right DRB and your Secondary Deflector can get you over k DPS combined.  TS is best used on clustered targets.  So Id use a TS on a GWd sphere group and TS on stuff like the nanite generatorstransformer.  Fly aggressively.  Be on the leading edge of the pack.  You get left behind or fly in the middle of the pack those beam boats wont leave anything behind for you to kill.Its a bit difficult to describe how flying a sci ship would be like in words.  But maybe my own flight video can help you get some ideas on what to change in your flying style.  Now YMMV but based on what you currently have I think k is well within your reach and I think youll likely do more.I hope this helps. ,stobuilds,czyaqzr,1,t5_2uv5z

6838825,0,t3_49ey1a,The question of the CC twopiece depends on context because of the bonuses to photon torpedoes and radiation damage.That said on a pretty straightforward energydamage build the CC twopiece is definitely inferior. The sum of the consoles category bonus and the category set bonus does add up to a greater buff to disruptor or phaser damage than the category bonus from a Locator alone but only slightly so. The tradeoff comes in losing the bonus to critical chance from the Locator and if youre not making good use of the radiation and photon damage bonuses from the CC console then youre trading away that hit chance for ... next to nothing really.Id probably pass on the Assimilated Module plus KCB as well in favor of crafted turrets in the aft weapon slots and an EPS console ideally the crafted Conductive RCS EPS in the Engineering slot.,stobuilds,d0rhfty,1,t5_2uv5z

You miss out on a ship trait and on the specialist seating available on t. Since it has a t fleet version if you arent interested in the ship trait you can still get the rest plus the extra stats and console from being a t fleet ship.I am probably not the best person to judge an individual ships tu version and say conclusively if it is worth spending the token on.That being said the HEC is one of my favorite federation ships and if you dont want to get t for whatever reason and you like flying the HEC then making what you like to fly just that much better is not a bad way to go even if it isnt optimal.,stobuilds,d2pmyns,1,t5_2uv5z

7666336,0,t3_4kablb,Okay so mathematically speaking as far as I know the best ratio is where your final crit chance and crit severity multiply to the biggest number possible. Lets take an exampleYou have  points to allocate between chance and severity. So lets see our options  x    x    x    x    x  So the logic is to take the final crit chance and severity and multiply them to make the biggest number possible. Simple in theory you just take the crit chance and crit severity listed in your stats menu and multiply them together then choose the console the makes the biggest number. So if you find adding a Vulnerability Locator to an empty tac slot boosts your final value more than a Vulnerability Exploiter then you choose the Locator. Simple right?However this is where things get tricky as the number shown in your stats is not the final number. See there are hidden bonuses not reflected in the number so you have to add those manually. Things get even more complicated when you consider weapon mods. If all of your weapons grant the same bonuses to chance and severity then its simple you just add those numbers to the final value and everything is fine. But thats rarely the case. So what I like to do is add the values together and divide by the number of weapons An exampleYou have three weapons. One has CrtHx one has CrtH CrtDx and the third is crap and has Accx CrtH. CrtH adds  crit chance and CrtD adds a whopping  crit damage. So we have  crit chance and  crit damage. Divided amongst three weapons thats . crit chance and . crit damage.Does that make sense?,stobuilds,d3dma20,2,t5_2uv5z

So this may be the fastest and easiest fix ever.    In fact Im almost positive because I was running the Quantum stuff on one of my escorts at one point and I think I was misunderstanding how the set bonus the quantum entanglement works.  It says something to the effect that Firing energy weapons for  seconds triggers a quantum entanglement and I thought that meant you had to fire at the same target for  seconds before it took effect.  But then I did more reading and it looks like it lasts  seconds once activated.  Its just worded weird.

First learned it here definitely concentrate on one weapon type dont have phasers disruptors and etc. etc. Look for the Tactical consoles that boost that kind of weapon too. I for example run with x Disruptor Beam Arrays I havent gotten far enough in Reputation unlocks to use that fancy stuff. I like their proc to reduce DR. Also I lean on Broadsiding its a cruisers strength in general. So lots of Beam Arrays. You could go Torpedo Boat if you like but I have learned to love the beams. If you can get anything with SgtW bonuses I think thats the one there are several that can boost the weapon energy level also.For my Captain I focused on anything that would boost energy to weapons then other areas too. More weapon power  more damage. To an extent and not for torpedoesI also got the Science Skills that reduce the ranged damage penalty. Dont discount Accuracy either. Boost that whenever you can. I think of it this way a miss is  DR and if my other shots only get a few s extra damage Id rather hit than get the small damage increase.

Overall in my honest opinion they have some decent pulling weight even if engineering oriented.,stobuilds,dd6qk76,2,t5_2uv5z
10680489,0,t1_ddhejwn,I think to AoE effect here is underrated. Comparing it with the RIF as a single heal makes it look underwhelming at best but factor it by  and suddenly the Hull HP regeneration looks a lot more desirable. Add the Shield regeneration portion and then it probably is on par or even surpasses the RIF in total healed amounts. So lets maybe call it the AoE RIF instead. Of course the usefulness of an AoE heal is situational at best and probably less desirable for the average tank build. It seems that Cryptic is trying to give the Lukari an overarching Healer theme which would explain the way the console works.,stobuilds,ddhm0wn,1,t5_2uv5z
10797307,0,t1_ddtjf59,The only one thats infrequently used is the Dampening Wave Emitter arguably because theres less invasive ways to get shield capacity and the current meta frowns on disables and enemy weapon power reductions.If you didnt have the RIF then you might try the piece but Id be inclined to remain at  and just add the Lukari console.The piece bonus isnt overly amazing. Theres not much that can survive  seconds of Fleet Weapon Acceleration but will die in  the increased radius of Dampening Wave means more interference with meta players and while having the AES kick in at  is nice especially on the common A Good Day to Die setup Im reluctant to state that its nice enough to justify carrying a console youll barely use.Your mileage may vary maybe you dont overly care about the impact to other players or maybe youre running a tank that doesnt use FBP I dont know why mind you.

10939939,0,t1_de86tkc,Well both ships are fleet level. But why particularly the Galas? I think the Recon MultiMission Explorers Surhuelh  for Romulans have the best BO layouts. They have two Lt.Cmdr slots one of them Universal one of them Tactical. This tends to be a good combo. Admittedly if you want to use temporal powers the Lt.Cmdr Universal is basically the slot you have to use for that and losing his universal flexibility. But at least you donT need to spend a Lt.Cmdr Bo ability on Engineering like for the Laeoso. Thats rarely really worth it. ,stobuilds,de8dm42,3,t5_2uv5z

11268344,0,t1_df8ut3a,The problem I often see is that people have the impression that BO does more damage than it actually does  and from a certain point of view I can understand how counterintuitive it must seem that an overcharged shot isnt as good as spread fire one comes across the same issue with torpboat builds c.f. HY vs TS.Its a definite QoL boost to have BOSST continue to noticeably benefit the player after the first shot.,stobuilds,df990gg,1,t5_2uv5z

11322722,0,t1_dff7zyf,Honestly that would be really hard to do at the present moment but lets brainstorm it out and maybe somethingll make itself obvious. If Reciprocity was changed to a per minute cyclinglets say  per minutethen how would that get applied to something with an odd value like  seconds or  seconds? Is procs per minute  Cooldown removing the remainder going to adequately capture that? In the case of AW I could see the value for that since AW has a  second cooldown but Im struggling to find a path forward that doesnt involve a ton of work. ,stobuilds,dffethn,1,t5_2uv5z
11341490,0,t1_dfhen6v,I guess overall it comes off as very resource intensive to me with  starship traits and even with the changes to invincible states and GDF I feel like not many will have  starship slots spare just to manage what a few extra points in a skill can do. Seems to me a trait like Supermacy has way more impact than any skill allocation so spend the skill points and save the trait slot. But I digress. I look for the budget options I can get setup on alts quicker. I enjoy the varied game experience. ,stobuilds,dfhjdup,1,t5_2uv5z
11352473,0,t1_dfifeol,Thanks so much for your analysis of this. I will definitely look into making the changes you suggest!There is one other question I have which I forgot to includeSince I have Temporal Operative as one of my Specializations Im wondering how I would be able to proc Temporal CrossWiring. Is it as simple as activating a buff such as KemociteLaced Weaponry?,stobuilds,dfis5kt,1,t5_2uv5z
11518914,0,t1_dg00487,With  omnis you can use FAWBO. With turrets you cant use CSVCRF as it cannot go in an ensign slot. This makes the omnis better for a shuttle.,stobuilds,dg1o5cw,2,t5_2uv5z

11740240,0,t1_dgqnhqd,Ive missed something here. Ive always avoided Shield Mastery and related nodes. Is this something thats coming in more for PVP has something changed or has it always being useful? From my point of view negating a critical hit once every  seconds never seemed useful but I notice this is on Atems as well so between the two of you it must be good.,stobuilds,dgqsb4t,2,t5_2uv5z
