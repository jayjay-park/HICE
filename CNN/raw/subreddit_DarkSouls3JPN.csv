Similar feeling I had to when I first played bloodborne after clocking in several hundred hours on ds that is to say that the style and pace completely threw me off and made things feel fresh again. Im feeling like Im just about to find my rhythm with ds but then again it seems like there are plenty of rhythms to get in the groove with due to the various styles of weapons and their different battle arts. I think From have nailed it again and Im really enjoying it even after dying far too many times.

But basically it seems that weaponsarmor and items like consumables that either give you a buff or debuff others do not give you anything from the crow.

Go back to the first swamp bonfire and instead of heading left head right. To the left of the two giant crabs youll find two enemies with black armor. Past them via a ladder youll find the first bonfire in the swamp. Go through the swamp and extinguish  fires and continue onward down this path.

7049903,0,t1_d1fgdh9,I hate it for pvp too. PvP was never balanced around SL some builds require more or less investment depending on whatever level you pick. No matter where you set the meta you are picking winners or loosers. There is no sweet spot where all builds are equally viable so SL meta just drives a homogeneous build scene.Most people in high SM PvP are not max level they are resting around  and due to hard and soft caps you can easily beat a max level player.Havel monsters in DS are a misnomer. Even at max level with TDR and RSR these guys never got below  load and by burning two ring slots their spells where shit even if they had the stats to support them they didnt have the equipment or rings.SL matchmaking wasnt needed. And Im glad there was no real meta.,DarkSouls3JPN,d1fgqfc,-2,t5_3cn85

7078160,0,t3_4civeg,Not really. From the Deacon bonfire you can body pull the UGS one then ranged pull the one near the bench. The one on the bench doesnt respond to surrounding events unless youre standing much too close so if you can pull him without destroying the bench you can safely clear the immidiate area of clerics prior to fighting him if you wish. Kill the two knights bonfire then rinse and repeat.I think it took me upwards of a hour to farm the whole set as the body armor and leg seem to have really low drop rate. Ive heard that their UGS can be dropped as well but of all the UGS cathedral knights Ive killed Ive never seen it.A word of warning though alot of the enemybased armors in the game fit the player differently than how they fit NPCs so your character wearing that set probably wont be quite how you imagined it to be.,DarkSouls3JPN,d1ioa9d,2,t5_3cn85

7098921,0,t3_4cs4ax,If anyone is coming in here for hints I did this write up a few days back.  I started with phase  first because I imagine its the hardest for most people.I did the write up based on my experience  no shield melee only.Honestly there is nothing special about him except his high damage and somewhat oddly timed attacks.If you get hit by an attack do not spam roll.  His attacks are timed so that if you spam roll after a hit you will get hit again. My biggest gain in progress against him was changing my usually strategy of hugging until a combo is finished to staying just out of his normal weapon range.  King PhaseHis pokedashes or inairtoground attacks are easy to dodge.  If he goes in the air roll directly under him he will go over and you will be able to get one or two hits off.  If he charges his spear for a lancelike attack roll to the SIDE and again an easy hit or two.If his spear starts glowing brightly hes about to use his miracle giant lightning bolt.  As soon as he raises his spear straight up start rolling towards him.  Ive never been hit by it.If you see him clench his fist or he two hands his spear for a ground smash roll AWAY.  Remember both of these abilities have a secondary explosion so be careful.His sunlight spear from hand is pretty much the same as any other sunlight spear.  Dodge when he throws.Thats it.  Until youre comfortable with his regular swings and attacks you will have a rough time.  He has a few patterns and some are hard to discern from others.  Like I said he has an oddly timed delay on his attacks so dont get greedy unless youre  sure hes done his combo.  Usually its rollslight wait rollslight waitrollDragon PhaseAt ALL TIMES lock on to the King unless youre moving in to do damage.  Again his timing sort of psychs you out until you get used to it.  The best way to be ready is to lock on to the king not dragon switch only to the dragon when you roll in for an attack.  At certain times youll be able to hit the dragon from in front while locked onto the king and stand WITHIN striking distance of the dragons head but IN FRONT.  If you have a quick weapon it will let you poke and make it easy to dodge the fire his neck during fire is a great spot to be  for huge damage burst.  Dragon  If he moves his head far to side left his left hes getting ready to blow fire  Run straight towards the dragons torso then turn towards the neck.  Get right in there and blow him up then sprint away because hes probably following up with a kingmelee.  Dragon If you see him shift both his feet backwards hes getting ready to either lunge you or fly over you.  Theres a difference youll learn between the two based on how the king reacts but I recommend rolling BACKWARDS away from the dragon every time for now once you learn the difference roll into him or to the side whatever you prefer when hes attacking.  If he flys over you youre in a good spot now to turn and get a hit or two in.  Remember to lock back onto the king after.  Dragon If it flys straight up while looking down shouldnt do this if youre positioned properly just run the fuck away because hes about to breathe fire straight down.  Dragon  If he flys circles be locked onto the king and roll sunlight spear like all other spear spells.  Roll when he THROWS again he can be deceiving dont jump the gun.  He will then follow up with a down smash on you.  Run towards the dragon whos still in the air and roll when he starts dashing down on you.King When hes on his dragon he does a couple smash attacks and a SWIPE I find the swipe usually happens after I run in for a couple behindthehead hits after a smash or the fire ability so if you do that get ready to run and roll away.

7208361,0,t3_4e6tl9,gt I dont personally like statrerolling. Building new characters in game is usually my favorite part of Souls because it takes me on strange routes and boss orders that I otherwise wouldnt have ever tried.Thats a fair opinion but the thing that turns me off about not respeccing coughbloodborne is that it hurts NG cycles.While you certainly dont have to play them the games are built with an expectation of the player going into NG cycles for greater challenge new items etc and the inability to respec can not only cripple your character if you didnt know precisely what you were doing before hand or at the very least leave things stale once youve decided the particular build youre using isnt quite that much fun anymore. respecs per cycle might be a bit on the heavy side but I think its a really good way to address the problem in DS. It allows you to make adjustments to your character to adapt to playing at a higher level and adapt to the increased challenges. It also jumpstarts things like sorceries by allowing you to playthrough as melee and then reallocate your points later effectively skipping the long early period in which magic is quite frankly terrible. Finally its great for players that like to figure things out like mechanics breakpoints etc which leads to an overall increasing knowledge level for the community as a whole.Obviously some players might not agree theyll think like purists in that if you want to do a magic build you need to level up that way and play the whole way through but thats the beauty of a thoroughly optional system. You can continually reroll characters if you want to but I dont have to.,DarkSouls3JPN,d1xj87u,6,t5_3cn85

7404233,0,t1_d2jrz6p,Yeah Ive already read all his posts I dont agree with everything and have some theories of my own but he certainly was very thorough and I appreciated the effort he put into that compendium. The Dark Lord ending was nullified a bit BY Dark Souls  and thats the problem the whole cycles thing is what took away from that ending which is exactly why I was criticizing it as a theme above. I cant put the blame on  in this regard because it was  which weakened the theme at least when looking at each game as a standalone.  managed to take the cyclical nature of it all somewhere interesting but I still think the theme got a bit repetitive after a while although I understand thats kind of the point from a metanarrativereflexive perspective. Aldias ending just seemed like an attempt to bring back the feeling the Dark Lord ending initially gave me but without a real explanation. Thats the problem with s overall lore it tries to play the vague and ambiguous card like the other games but without Miyazakis masterful attention to detail and level of interconnectivity it just fell flat and felt like it was just being vague for the sake of it as opposed to vague with depth and meaning. Thats just how I see it. Id rather Aldia is just not brought up again the Primordial Serpents Velka Gwyneverethe Queen of Lothric....they are characters I would FAR rather see than Aldia again he just did very little for the series in my eyes. I did like Vendrick though even though the DLC making us directly talk to him was while extremely cool in its own way indicative of just how unfocused Dark Souls s story was compared to . Gwyn never needed to give us monologues for us to fully comprehend what he was all about. Its stuff like that which makes s lore and overarching storytelling methods a tier below the other games for me. I guess I just really like the Miyazaki touch I think that makes a big difference.
