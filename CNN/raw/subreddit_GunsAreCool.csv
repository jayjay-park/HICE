922610,0,t1_ch91l35,Im sorry to insert my opinion here as I am among the opposition to your cause here but I feel as though I should based on technical reasons and my knowledge on the subject as an enthusiast and former dealer Merchant of Death as I am called by some I am in no way anti smart gun per say for various reasons but the people who are making the threats and protesting are lunatics. We are our own worst enemies because of these types. Even the larger part of the community in which I am affiliated shake our heads at these fools. That all said I believe that smart guns should be sold. They need to have real world testing in order to improve the systems. Not to mention that if someone wants a smart gun they should be able to own one because yes it is their right to do so. Now these smart guns are actually nothing new. They have been around since the s beginning with a very interesting custom modification to police revolvers then in use that used magnets instead of electrics. Its quite interesting. I cant remember who does it off hand but it works and is still available to my knowledge. Colt throughout the s was working on a system for law enforcement officers but it never came to fruition but I have seen it on the old History Channel shows of the time. Sadly the ip will be a flop and not just because of political reasons and lunatics. It proves a concept and thats all it can do as of now. Even if it works and can proves that it will continue to work for generations the public will never buy into them though I would solely as a novelty. The reasons I feel it wont work states as follows. Its chambered in an anemic cartridge and rightfully so as electronics are too fragile to live through the harsh environment that is the innards of a firearm. Even items like flashlights break over time because of the punishing recoil. Further adding a more complex system to an already complicated mechanical device brings up issues of reliability. It brings a hefty price tag around  Ive been told. Having one in my now imaginary store would be dumb but I would gladly order one on request if paid up front. Business is still business your typical Person who walks in will just see a questionable  . pistol sitting beside the staples of . pistols currently available for generally  less. Guess which will sell. Thats the real world thinking. Now I have questions of my own for the ip. The information available is very vague especially if safety is the primary concern. I do not see any sort of manual safety or even trigger safety why not? Is it drop safe? Sure maybe it works as advertised but it may not prevent accidents or purposeful will. Some guns can be fired if dropped or slammed hard enough at the muzzle or back of the slide. That also raises the question of Can the system withstand a drop or a plunge in water and still function? Thanks for listening to my rambling. Once again I do feel as if Im being rude and intruding amongst your ranks here but Im trying my best to be respectable and if Im out of line I will delete the comment. ,GunsAreCool,ch95mxy,4,t5_2uvah

1003144,0,t1_chiaj6d,gt They would have then had to move their kids into the school district if they werent found locally. Interesting fact a good number of the people directly involved in Sandy Hook had moved there within the previous two years. Then key members of the school administration would have had to make sure that all of the volunteered kids were put in the same class. Then on the day of the incident they have a safety drill and have all of the classrooms except for the planted one leave the building while the planted class leaves via a back entrance well before any media shows up. First on the scene is the police any officer who was there that day would have to be in on the thing plus all of the management levels of local law enforcement. I suppose at the very least the fire chief would probably have to be in on it even if you assume the police just kept the paramedics out through blockades and intimidation. Then you would need key people in the FBI to seal the records on the whole situation and key people in city council to tear down the building. As for the kids I think that the kids are all young enough that the memory of that day will fade by adolescence with kids that young you can just give them a made up explanation and they will believe it  Thats a whole lot of assumption.

Terrorism is a tactic employed with the goal of enacting social or political change by inflicting fear upon a population in the hopes of terrorizing them into changing their behaviour in some way. What this lunatic did wasnt done with the intent of amending societys behaviour.

2390984,0,t1_cm780ib,I think the central question here is what qualifies me to carry around other people in this case the state in which I am licensed. The people around whom I am carrying should decide for themselves whether or not an individual can carry a gun in public this is justified by the belief that public places are owned by the public and the rules of entering and behaving in the public space are dictated by the public. The rules that the public makes are made indirectly by publicly elected representatives. This just happens to be the system of decision making where I live I am not saying it is the best possible system. The minimum requirements that the legislature of the state I live has created in order to CCW around the people of this state is to pass the no felony and no violent misdemeanor convictions check and to sit in a chair for  hours. I want the minimum requirements to be higher comparable to the character test and firearms training and proficiency demonstration standards of getting POST certified. However no such evaluation is in place. The people of my state have indirectly said all I need to do is have a lack of disqualifiers to carry a gun around them. I have met that standard and I dont think it is immoral or hypocritical to CCW having met the standards society asked even though I simultaneously think the standards should be higher.I think this is like calling a truck driver a hypocrite if he thinks the CDL test should be harder while he continues to drive rather than opt out as a philosophical protest. ,GunsAreCool,cm78e8z,-1,t5_2uvah

6349240,0,t1_czb9vw9,If it was as simple as that nothing at all. But thats not the crux of the problem. The problem is that a select few gun shops have been consistently linked to feeding black market gun sales and illegal trade. The gun manufacturers continue to supply them with more product knowing that there is a very good chance that the store will filter the guns to illegal channels. There is a good argument that the stores arent willfully feeding the trade. They may be selling to legit purchasers who have received a background check etc who then distribute them. Or maybe the stores are doing something shady and the gun manufacturers are turning a blind eye and potentially colluding. I think there is at least a good reason to have debate here.

Theres two parallel stories  the rise and fall of a very influential inventor and the story of a young girl born into poverty but finds a way out thanks to a creation of said inventor.Towards the end of the book the inventor has a discussion with another character about the concept of a maker  think D printer but more like a molecular breakdownandreassembly chamber among other things related to Eastern vs. Western philosophies freedom and regulation and that sort of thing.If you like really good scifi I highly recommend both Snowcrash set in a time just beyond our own somewhat cyberpunk in nature and The Diamond Age which would be a little further down the line less cyberpunk more hightech.

Mass shootings typically have much less range so a pistol or a bladed weapon may be more useful than a rifle. We also use a lot more air strikes drone strikes artillery etc than guns on the ground but that doesnt mean guns are useless. Different fields of combat require different tools. ,GunsAreCool,dak0b7f,-1,t5_2uvah
9840011,0,t1_daq4zes,There is a reason that a  needs to be more lethal and all the special forces and units know it. Thats why they often dont use . The tavor bull pups are more about portability than lethality.   blks are okay but I dont see the point unless you are running and SBR or suppressed. There may be better rounds depending on what you need. I agree that a humane kill should always be the shot you take but that doesnt always happen and follow up shots may be needed. I was more hedging this argument against a person that was against semi autos. A  or any small caliber faster bullet in brush can be get off target or tumble.So a person can buy a  round AR mag for  or a  rounder for the same price. Why would they buy a  round mag? What if they also do shooting matches? The only drawbacks of a  round mag are possible prone position issues and anti gun people fear. Gun makers dont advertise outside of gun circles. Gun makers dont advertise shooting up innocent people. Cigarettes makers advertised to non smokers kids and made cigarettes seem like a part of the day. Do you honestly believe that the ads made this kid want to shoot up a school? We have already established that he didnt buy the guns do you even know for sure that he read gun magazines? Even if he did why should the makers be liable for his actions which are clearly wrong to every sane person. This kid was hurting and needed help. His mom should have properly stored the guns and ammo and removed them from the home after the first indication that anything was wrong with him. Thats where the fault lies. These peoples lawyers are praying on their tragedy for money and publicity. Not all guns were made to kill people. There are very small . caliber gallery guns that were made for bars are fairs that wouldnt pierce a thin jacket. There are match and target guns that are used in the Olympics. There are handmade long range rounds that are made for ballistics and not penetration or cavitations.  I have never opened a magazine that wasnt a gunoutdoor magazine that had advertising for guns. IMO it sounds a lot like people blaming Marilyn Manson and video games after Columbine. ,GunsAreCool,daq6dbt,1,t5_2uvah

You are proglobalism because things are cheaper? You understand how purchasing power works? I guess not. Globalism also has nothing to do with more advanced goods. All the advanced goods could be made in one developed country faster more efficiently and with less CO emissions. Would it be cheaper probably not but at least prices would be related to your currency and not the currency of a nation that is openly manipulating it to gain a competitive readvantage thats China in case you need help with that too. The euroh is no joke. Its already in effect. You think migrants can get a job at euro an our without speaking german or having a degree? You think the employers want that? The only way to employ them is to massively lower wages. Thats how the real world works. It follows economic principle of offer and demand and when the offer explodes while the economy is in the shitter you get lower salaries across the board and mass unemployment. Wanna know how many of the million migrants got a job in germany before this euroh thing? . Yep. Heres the source you wont have to googleIll do one like youMy experience has taught me people who scream globalism is fine havent recognized the complete collapse of the middle class due to a massive relocation of factories first and now services too to third world countries.
