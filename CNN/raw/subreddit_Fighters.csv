That kid will never get better until he realizes what helps me get better. If you get pissed you cant focus. All you can think about is how youre pissed and now losing more.

1478408,0,t3_2b41c8,There is the Fight Lab that introduces the very basic aspects. Then you can check out the tutorial and character specific Morning Bread and Butter Series by Level Up Your Game.In terms of learning a character... Honestly you probably wont have to learn nor implement a majority of whats featured in a movelist. Lots of players have broken down to whats really useful pokes homing moves launchers etc with the occasional move you never ever see. If you see a player who uses someone like Mishimas Lars or whatever you will see moves being reused since they are reliable and such.For your other character find one you fits best for you and research! Find match videos with the characters. Read up on places like Tekken Zaibatsu.EDIT Someone on rTekken is also new and someone explained some of the basics. ,Fighters,cj1leuf,3,t5_2s5rz
1488788,0,t1_cj2ub55,It makes sense to an extent. I mean the entire EC video was basically a build up to tldr Having to learn is hard. Why do we have to practice to be competent? Fighters arent like a lot of other kinds of games where you can ease people into things by giving them certain abilities at certain times and such a setup would possibly be detrimental in that it wouldnt properly help people in any way than  minutes in training could. Pretty much the only game that does tutorials right that I can think of is Skullgirls. Everything else is either off the beaten path and far too segmented to ever have real world application or its so vague and useless that you end up with SF challenges. Ive said it before and Ill say it again.

6518621,0,t1_cztgsgo,Acrylic is a bit less durable so youd need a bit thicker plates  mm at least Id wager  to be sure they wont snap under unforeseen pressure. Its still a good material for cases just that hitbox cases tend to be rather big and if you put it in a bag and accidentally bump a solid surface with it if the surfaces arent thick enough they might start cracking. Obviously thats a matter of figuring out better ways to carry them around but I personally would rather pick a stronger material. Wood can also add a vintage feel to it and is much easier to process initially I wanted to include a side compartment in the case to hide the cable inside but when I turned to polycarbonate it turned out to not be as easy of a task as it first sounded. If possible Id guess itd be a good idea to get some samples of each material knock them around a bunch see if you like the touch and weight of them and decide then.I believe either Arduino and Pi would work just a matter of getting access to GPIOs. You might want to look at the UnoJoy project the guy provides a full firmware of sorts that imitates a PSPC controller. I think its possible to refactor it to work with a Pi although I havent worked with lowlevel Pi programming so idk. I initially thought of doing that I have a spare one lying around but I couldnt figure out how to turn it into a USB device without writing actual bare metal ARM code for it so I gave up.In case you decide upon an Arduino I suggest buying a Leonardo or if tight on budget an Uno. Leonardo offers you  digital GPIO pins by default and a dedicated USB support meaning itll be easier to turn it into a controller and plug a ton of buttons into it. Uno on the other hand can also work but youd have to look up turning analog pins into digital pins since there are only  digitals and flashing firmware is a bit more complicated since the USB controller on the board is a separate chip and has to be reflashed every time you want to use it with a different type of devices PCs or consoles. You can look up a thread on Arduino StackExchange I made where I asked a few rudimentary questions about using an Arduino as a controller.Just in case this doesnt ring any bells dont give up on the idea. Flashing UnoJoy is fairly easy and if you follow the instructions on the Internet it should work out of the box. Theres a lot of blog posts and guides on how to build sticks some on how to use UnoJoy so you should be fine with it.,Fighters,cztkr9y,1,t5_2s5rz

11220967,0,t3_6055df,It heavily depends the game but theres specifically something that is hard to get to people that arent really in the FGC. And its also why tiers doesnt matter  of the time. Fighting games is a lot about anticipation reads and mindgames. Things that you cant learn in a single game. Things like the combos or the character knowledge is the what. It doesnt give you the how the when and especially the why. Since mindgames are that important you dont have just to perfectly know how works your character. You need to have something more. An affinity a feeling. It perfectly works on games like Guilty Gear Tekken or Virtua Fighter since the main engine doesnt really change from games to games. It doesnt on games that totally change their engines like Street Fighter.gt Why do even pros get so affiliated with a specific character that they are slaves to whatever tier the character happens to be in the meta?Fighting games arent MOBAs. You cant win with the same playstyle and the same gameplan over and over again. Because fighting games forces the players to adapt. Yes very bad balances exists but even on impossible matchups theres ways to get in and take the matches. Games that doesnt allow both players to think less about the characters and the meta and more about their opponent have by definition bad balance or bad game design.gt It seems like except for a guy like Infiltration counterpicking is almost seen as a dirty tactic.Its not really dirty but it doesnt sound right. Fighting games have a lot of parallels with combat sports like Boxing Judo Muai Thai... When youre struggling against an opponent youre still you. You dont stop playing after the th round to switch to a teammate. You change your tactics but youre still with your strengths and your weeknesses. Just like taking a character in a fighting game.gt why arent team limit tournaments more popular?Every characters in any fighting games are supposed to be balanced and all equal. Imposing team limit its forcing the players to play a specific team without going with what the players like. And you cant force that type of community rules for everybody that plays the game around the world.Honestly just the fact that people asks the question kinda worries me. Fighting games like a lot of other competitive genres are not all about meta. Following blindlessly the tiers will not make you win more. And fighting games are not all about winning arent they?,Fighters,df3vs5m,28,t5_2s5rz
