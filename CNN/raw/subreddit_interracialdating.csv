209661,0,t3_1wgrz1,Story as old as time but really I think you have to find a way to not live with your cousin anymore. Anyway you can get a place away from family? Campus housing or something? If you can my best advice is basically just to lie to your family until youre no longer dependent on them for financial support. The lying and sneaking around might be too much strain for your relationship but then you know it might notve been worth it in any case. If this guy is the real deal lying to your dad for a couple years isnt a big deal. FWIW Im from a culture that strongly discourages dating until youre basically spouse shopping especially interracial so maybe Im a little overenthusiastic about the lie to family option...I see it all the time though and if the relationship lasts?The timeline will be like this. They hate him call him names etc. You guys get married they might offer begrudging support and begin to warm up or might continue to be dicks and just skip the wedding.Grandkids? Gamechanger. They always come around when theres grandbabies involved.,interracialdating,cf2bolc,3,t5_2x0dk

6401459,0,t3_438d8o,I am missing something... this is the problem that youre obsessed with Native American women? Theyre beautiful wonderful women. I always feel some kinda bad way when people say Well if you like this race too much some abstract meaningless phrase you objectified them and youre evil. Why cant it be that youre attracted to who youre attracted to. The Black woman who only dates white guys... is she objectifying all White men? What if she had a really bad experience and was raped by a Black guy? So dating white guys is safe? Or the Hispanic guy who now only dates Middle Eastern? Maybe his ex girlfriend or even a teacher or some adult was Middle Eastern and that always meant something special to him. If I were you id worry less about being politically correct thats kinda what interracial dating is about. Going for who youre attracted to regardless of the whys and what everyone thinks about it. Get off of reddit and go find you a sexy Native American woman brother. Other races just might not be your cup of tea and you know what? That my friend is perfectly fine. You have to change your frame. You might think All I want is Native American women so theyre objects of ideal to me when maybe a more positive way to look at it might be Native American women are so beautiful to. They always have been. I honor them by placing them above all others and I honor myself by being true to my desires. And its fine. Its fine. ,interracialdating,czha4rb,2,t5_2x0dk

7350038,0,t1_d2dfbkp,I havent told her that it ended she went away on a trip the day after I told my GF.  Further update needed actually my GF said she need a few days to really think over everything.  The breakup was I guess a sudden and rash decision in her opinion.We had it out though so she knows that there is certainly the possibility.  I yelled we cried she told me if that is the relationship I want then I need to pursue it and ignore her feelings.  Which is all great and wonderful but just because I can ignore my mothers feelings doesnt mean I can get my GF to ignore those same thoughts and feel comfortable.,interracialdating,d2dndmn,1,t5_2x0dk

8801348,0,t3_50izzz,Thank you for your words and sharing your experience.I have been working on my grandpa for years but its only been recently that he is open to actually understanding and talking about the implications of racism in our society. Im studying higher education and have been sending him my final papers about barriers specific identities face when accessing education specifically. My fianc said he can take care of himself which is what he usually says but I still worry about what my grandparents will say when they finally meet. I try to be as transparent as possible about what my family says because some left field shit comes out of their mouth from time to time.,interracialdating,d75swam,1,t5_2x0dk

10972966,0,t3_5w6cyk,It sounds like a precarious situation unfortunately. I think when it comes down to it you need to be  sure that your husband has got your back. Years ago my SO used to worry that my family wouldnt like her before shed spent much time with them. I just kept reassuring her that shes my priority. Yes I love my family but not so much that I would tacitly support them when they are wrong. We went through something similar around the time of the election. She was genuinely fearful for what the future would bring but I just kept reassuring her whenever we talked about it. We live in a rather liberal city so I think that eased her worries somewhat but in both situations the key was communication. She let me know her worries and concerns and I let her know that I was there for her .Have you discussed your anxiety with your husband yet? If so how did the conversation go?,interracialdating,debsenu,3,t5_2x0dk
11066476,0,t1_demd3lf,I mean there is a chance that she might choose family over a relationship if she needs toncross that path. Im sure that i will have to do that in my future unless i get someone my family likes which is likely not happening. But i would choose a relationship over family.,interracialdating,demdhut,1,t5_2x0dk
11485780,0,t3_6012ae,Im Brazilian American I know a Latinas like Asian because the cultures are similar and latinos are the first mix. In Brazil there more Asian guys and Latinas couples. Most Latinas wanted to be ask out. There is hope for you. Good Luck,interracialdating,dfxwtq9,1,t5_2x0dk
11516434,0,t1_dg0y45s,Dude you Asian men need to stop placing white women on a pedestal. You know most white women dont like Asian men. Thats not an insult to Asian men. Instead of chasing them and seeking validation just stay with Asian women who like you.you dont have to prove anything. ,interracialdating,dg1e0xs,3,t5_2x0dk
11524073,0,t1_dg1zkk5,We live in a pretty accepting State so there hasnt been too much harassment other than dirty looks find a real man type of comments and stupid kids making racist remarks. It breaks my heart that he has to put up with stuff like that to be with me. I have offered to learn Cantonese to better communicate with his family. He says it would better for both he and I to learn Mandarin instead since they also speak that and it is a more marketable language to be fluent in. I figure he knows more than me on this point so I havent pushed the issue. I have met his folks but only recently. Before that our relationship was somewhat in the closet. Im not the biggest fan of secret romance but I made an exception for him. His older sister was nicer to me than expected but his Mother clearly was only being fake nice type polite. She actually slipped up and told him that she disapproves of me because I am white. She very much dislike me but she is trying so Im happy she is making an effort at least. I imagine it is hard for Moms of any culture to let go of their only son. ,interracialdating,dg297o1,5,t5_2x0dk
