BUT I am not talking about that part of their service.CrashPlan also offers a backup program completely free of charge and lets you be in charge of where the program sends its backups to.One of the options is you can send the backups to another hard disk connected to your PC.  The CrashPlan program then takes care of all the file versions when you run the backup.  It is also smart enough to wait until the backup disk is connected and ready to use.  So you can take it out and CrashPlan will just wait until its reconnected before it performs its backup.I recommend just downloading and trying the program out since its completely free.Otherwise what you are looking to do is somewhat complicated and I dont think there is one simple answer.  Especially if you want to do things like incremental backups to save space and also keep file versions.

Ive already had this happen. I did not lose  drives but the OS would refuse to mount my array for whatever reason. Luckily I had a backup so I recreated the array and restored all my data. RAID is about uptime and about increasing performance. You should have a backup before you think about adding a RAID.If you can tolerate downtime to your data while you are restoring from backup and your performance is already good enough then you should probably not be adding a RAID.

2014841,0,t3_2hb6ek,At the simplest and incremental backup system will take up the space of the base file plus the size of each of the incremental changes along with a small overhead for indexingtracking the changes. Typically the incremental backup software will store previous incremental changes with compression to further reduce space but increase restoration time. With files that change infrequently or only have minor changes incremental backups will be a very wise use of space. I would definitely advise against it for files that change extensively and often however because the amount of space you require will skyrocket. Additionally incremental backups will not be very efficient storagewise if you are using them regularly against compressed media files that change. For example you may be better off with full backups if you are altering and reencoding mps as most of the file content will change and the added incremental backup overhead will not be worth the benefits.,DataHoarder,ckvzgzw,2,t5_2x7he

All of the mainstream OSs are going to provide integrity if you sort the above fundamentals out and it would appear from my quick look at OpenMediaVault that it falls into the category of mainstream.From what little I know of your project it appears that you should pick a hardware platform that supportsuses ECC and then simply ensure that you are using raid  or mirroring for your critical data.  The actual OS wont matter too much.  Taking backups to an external drive that you keep in the shed or at work etc. is always recommended as well  although if you are like me youll find that those quarterly backups stretch out to onceayearifyourelucky affairs....and then if you dont like the performance of your NAS look into RAID controller addon cards SSDs etc.   But youll find that the performance for serving music and movie files will be perfectly fine with the base system.HTH.,DataHoarder,crsw9l5,2,t5_2x7he

4363488,0,t3_3azoq5,The hard part isnt just storage but making sure you rip accurately. Red Book Audio may have the fidelity of digital audio but it provides all the data correction attributes of an analog medium that is practically fewer than none. To combat this problem a few solutions attempt to provide a straightforward means of extracting from a disc exactly the audio that was pressed onto it. Notably there is Exact Audio Copy on Windows X Lossless Decoder on OS X and morituri on Linux. You have  CDs to rip you do not want to get even a small fraction of the way through and discover youve been doing it poorly!As far as the automation goes I think your best bet is probably whip up a small shell script to drive morituri. Thanks to its command line interface you should be able to get away with a small loop that rips the CD ejects the disc then waits for the user to swap in a new disc    ! binbash    OFFSETrip offset find    echo Your drive offset is OFFSET.    while true        rip cd rip offset OFFSET        eject        echo Insert the next disc and then press Enter.        readThats just hypothetical. Im not sure about the output of rip offset find if it doesnt output just the integer offset then youll need to parse it from the output. And there might be some other flags to the rip command so you can specify the CD drive to use enabling you to run multiple instances of the script to use multiple drives and rip multiple CDs at once.Your CD drive will also have a surprisingly large impact on the rip speed. Old Plextor drives are about the best thing going and the newer LG drives are some of the worst. I bought a used Plextor PXUF which worked great but really if youve got the time try a few different drives and see what works for you. When youre ripping that many discs even the difference of a minute or two in ripping speed can add up to a whole lot of time.,DataHoarder,cshhzs5,15,t5_2x7he

5255459,0,t1_cvjac08,Ah yes you are correct that  paring a file doesnt duplicate the file it does create a par archive that is equal to  of the source file in size but thats the problem. You are doubling the amount of data saved to DVD. It would be quicker and less CPU resources to just write the files to a DVD twice then PAR them all.Let me rephrase the question how does somebody backup data across multiple DVDs and have some kind of parity that allows loosing one disk and still recover  of the files while only increasing the amount saved to disk as little as possible. The answer is some kind of RAID scheme and like I mentioned above you cant achieve that with paring single files.Now you mention collecting the files and creating a single archive then paring the archive but that has the same issue as above you need to double the amount of data saved to DVD so that you can loose one whole DVD. This is why I mentioned first splitting the archive say we have a GB archive of files we want saved to DVDs. With your method we save the source GB file to DVD then PAR it and save the PARs to DVD and we have used up a total of GB to backup GB worth of files.What I was trying to do with splitting the file is say we split the file to GB chunks and then add all  chunks to a single parchive and set it to  recovery. We then save each chunk to their own DVD and PAR to its own as well so we use a total of  DVDs but only write GB of data to backup GB worth of files and we can loose any single DVD and able to recover  of the files. Now that of course wastes more DVDs but the idea is you have many gigs of files so you would be using many DVDs to begin with.That is basically the same idea with the ZFS scheme OP was talking about but ZFS handles the parity and integrity for you.,DataHoarder,cvjgyni,2,t5_2x7he

6037523,0,t1_cyb0gt6,I reread the full ToS a second time this morning and Im completely confident that using acdcli to backup ZFS data to Amazon Cloud Drive is  within their terms.gt After your free trial Unlimited Everything is .year. Cancel your trial anytime.Im not using the trial.  Amazon gave away a free year not a trial account as a promotion.  According to the small print on the offer if Id already had a paid sub they would have added an extra free year on the end if it was already unlimited or prorated refund for the rest of the year if not unlimited and turn it into a year unlimited.  This offer falls under all the grants of their full paid tier not a trial.gt using the features and functionality we make availableThey make a RESTbased API available.  acdcli is using that.  There are numerous third party applications that Amazon features on their site.  They make it clear that other thirdparty apps can make use of the service but if they break they get to keep both pieces.  Using acdcli is completely in line with their terms.  Its not supported or recommended but thats reasonable.gt  to operate your own file storage application or serviceUsing a client app to backup data to their service isnt operating a file storage application or service.  That term means you cant use ACD as a backend to make your own service that you then resell to others.  Using a client that accesses their public API is fine.  Thats why theres an API.Theres nothing hacked together about the upload process at least as far as Amazon is concerned.  It accesses their storage using a publicly available and documented API that they provide for exactly this purpose.  Whether or not they turn unlimited into unlimited based on the amount of data used is a matter yet to be determined.  Honestly Id be surprised if Amazon played that kind of game though.I get that a lot of people have tons of FUD about cloud storage in general but accessing ACD this way is fully in line with their stated ToS.  I consider it as reliable a backup as anything else that I cant personally watch with my own two eyes IE better than nothing especially at the price.  I wouldnt store the only copy of important data there of course.  The datas on my main ZFS pool on a second ZFS pool in a second server thats onsite possibly moving to a parents or friends house in a backup hostage exchange program in the future....  Now with an extra completely offsite and redundantly mirrored copy Im in waaaaaaay better shape than without it.  year is pretty good insurance in my book.Disclaimer IANAL but I read software licenses and site ToS daily for a living.

I myself use this feature a lot for sharing with people in countries where Upthere has not launched yet. Offline Mode. WE do not have an offline mode per say but our caching layer already works great so that the most viewed items are available in the offline mode. Same applies for e.g. pictures take by the Camera app when offline. The perceived slowness can be due to Upthere checking for duplicate data so that you do not upload the same document twice. We are working on various optimizations but the actual upload speeds as reported by our clients are really good.For the overall concept of the app you can already benefit from accessing your data anywhere from any device without limits on your local storage.

If the drives are slow that could be a problem. I assume all the drives are healthy?

To be honest the fact that you even posted this question should have given you the answer you seek. If your willing to sacrifice quality to save a few bucks then buy a Norco. If you want a quality chassis buy a data enter pull Supermicro. Ive completely switched over to Supermicro chassis some new and some used data center pulls. I will never buy another Norco chassis. As others have pointed out servers are loud for a reason. With that being said you can quiet a Supermicro right down by simply running the PWM fans off your motherboard fan controller. I hooked all the fans to my motherboard and am very happy. The only other thing I will do is replace the hot swap power supplies at some point with their SQ models and sell my screamers. But keep in mind you can buy a Supermicro  data center pull for about the same as a new Norco. Supermicro U chassis cost  new for a reason. While this is just my opinion those who own Norcos will tell you they are fine and great.. The rest of us who tell you how poor the quality is have moved on to Supermicros and will never go back. ,DataHoarder,czc7w4u,1,t5_2x7he

I also have some with  hours bought in the same time frame on them and still running strong. And to be honest some large sellers offer these as refurbs for around  with a one year warranty. All drives will fail and I actually trust my old REs more than I would trust the crapshoot of drives manufactured today. Even with a brand new drive if it fails and is replaced under warranty there is a very good chance you will receive a refurb drive back from the manufacturer meaning your back in the same boat of you paid new price but now have a used drive. ,DataHoarder,czeywr7,1,t5_2x7he

6538546,0,t1_czur6iv,editThis is way more longwinded than I thought itd be.  Youve been warned.Im a reasonably big Seagate spindle customer have been for close to a decade in my current role.  I had hundreds of the  and TB variants of their .K NLSAS drive.  We did see a spike in failures on the TB spindles no question.  We had maybe  failure a week average over the first year year and a half significantly more than even the same manufacturemodel TB spindles.We also had the  and  TB variants of the same spec Hitachi drive .K NLSAS.  In the TB model of those we had reasonable failure rate approx our median failure rate per drive model regardless of manufacturer for the first year year and a half.  After that the T and to a lesser extent T spindles started failing pretty reliably maybe  per week period.  We had a larger install base of the hitachi at the time to be clear.Alright so theres that we hate TB spindles regardless of manufacturer and worry a bit more about seagate as a spindle provider.Around Years after the TB spindles generally started coming into our datacenter Seagate came to us to sell us this We like things like that a lot we tell the fine sales people but theyre really expensive and were beholden to budgets so we need to test it well before buying  find out what it does well what makes it cry etc.  But first that machine in the picture holds at least  spindles who makes the drive?So the sales guy launches into a clearly wellworn monologue.  Hes heard this from every customer for the last  years.  They know its a huge problem.  They said it slipped by QA because they were supposed to have been getting the same exact parts all along from their vendors.  Turns out after the floods a single one of their part manufacturers changed the fab or the machining or something on a random part yknow a drive arm or the motor assembly I forget the part they said.  They admitted it slipped by what should have been the common manufacturing sampling they do but it didnt.  That was the TB line possibly the  s werent available to a lot of vendors i deal with they just skipped the generation and released s when they came out.A short time after they started hearing customer complaints they acquired a weird company Xyratex.  Xyratex has been an array manufacturer for years they OEM to other vendors like DDN.  Amazingly fast arrays for the time GBs big B per controller pair.  The other side of the Xyratex house was spindle design abuse testing.  Most of the spindle manufacturers used their services.  They took a bunch of the drives they wanted abused and put them in this large racksized rig that sat on a pretty nice shake plate.  A scaled up version of that  drive thing in the article Id imagine.  This is why Seagate bought them the array business was an afterthought of the acquisition.All that is to say this is what i hate about the Backblaze study  people misinterpret it constantly.  Yknow forget about the lack of riggor in the actual statistics usecases etc.  Its the reader.  At this point even Backblaze has said the poor numbers they saw have not persisted in newer model drives.  I bet you Backblaze still buys in bulk from Seagate.  I bet you theyre getting a fantastic price too because of poor consumer sentiment.  In the enterprise space theyre a completely valid vendor to accept on a bid.  I wouldnt flinch if we decided our nextgen NAS platform was going to be one packed with  seagate TB spindles none of that SMR crap though.  The same with Hitachi.  I adore hitachi drives to this day.  But we did have a fairly significant failure rate compared to our median.  Their  and TB were just fine we bought a ton of them.  Ive got the data lying around somewhere Im sure maybe I should do a blog and their prices would tank for us too... All manufacturers have a bad model or two.  Its been happening since spindles were a thing.  Hitachi started their spindle business from the ashes of IBM after a run of  very specific  and GB drives.  Really IBM had their massive factory in Rochester MN split in half when they sold.  Hitachi lived in one and IBM the other.If your data is important know what warranty youre buying and use it when appropriate.

6689942,0,t3_477335, ZFS on FreeBSD is way more mature than on Linux. I highly recommend going with FreeNAS especially for a corporate implementation. I have not seen any Linux distros come close to FreeNAS quality just yet. FreeNAS really isnt hard. Do NOT use Z. Performance will be shit and the parity gains will not be worth it. Last I checked PERCs dont have a good record for proper JBODHBA functionality that ZFS needs. I would recommend replacing it with a SAS or higher HBA. This would cost . I would recommend one of two paths You have one big pool. You use x disk Zs. The way this works is you have  vdevs each vdev is a  disk Z and they are combined into one zpool. This would give you the most IOPS still give you plenty of parity and lots of space. If you need me to explain this more I can. You have two pools. One pool is x vdevs of disk Zs similar to the first option except half of the disks are in this pool. The second pool is one big set of mirror vdevs. So it would be x disk mirror vdevs in one pool. This would mean you would get about TB of usable space in the mirrored pool but you would also get massive read IOPS. This way you can get the best of both worlds and have the two different pools serving different areas of the business. The specs otherwise that you have seem fine. GB of RAM will get you very far.

6695368,0,t1_d0btgv6,Ive shelled a few in my day as well I manage a college help desk so Im around stuff like this regularly and never seen it either but the one thing I noticed is that if Im going to shell a drive I always do it right at the start not once its  full of data.  I tried multiple USB ports which included my HP  Pros integrated USB . ports as well as each of my two USB . PCIE cards as well as eSATA.  I also tried the SATA to USB . dock I went and got from work on all three of my different USB controllers and each of them showed up same as in the Mediasonic enclosure.  Right now I have all three drives hooked back up on my desk bare with their adapter boards attached connected to my computerI realized my drive pool did have a little over TB free combined so I wasnt as full as I thought.  So I told Stablebit remove one of the shelled drives and its evacuating it into the rest of the pool right now.  Once empty Its been going for  hours and is only  complete Ill throw it in the mediasonic box and initialize it then add it back into the pool and remove the nd shelled drive and so on.  That is assuming I dont come up with another solution via this thread before that process is finished.  Yeah its strange I didnt find a lot in searching but I cant figure what else it would be. In fact one thing I didnt mention in the OP was the TB Seagate Expansion Desk crapped out on me last year and I replaced the internal disk with a Hitachi DeskStar TB and kept using the enclosureand that disk is behaving the same way as the other two so it seems like once its initialized through the enclosure its married to that enclosures board.  ,DataHoarder,d0buxq2,1,t5_2x7he

I suspect even worse once it reaches steady state. And thats just writing to it as a raw block device with a high queue depth.Im not  sure on the spesifics when it comes to zil behaviour. Though id imagine it being sync writes and thus the latency of the drive affecting things and the throughput being even worse. When using these as slog devices.

7099073,0,t3_4cr8sy,Hm Im swimming in ram because I recently bought  IBM blades and they were loaded with low profile GB ECC DDR sticks but they are fully buffered as far as I know.GB of ECC DDR Fully buffered. Plus some IBM HS blades with Es and E cpus There are even  GB sticks but again fully buffered.Sadly it seems the Lenovo TS DOES NOT support Fully Buffered in the slightest. Otherwise Id sell you two of them for cheap.The only other ram I have laying around are standard GB sticks of desktop ram nonECC unbuffered.But I would say that ram SHOULD work with your TS the only requirements of the TS is ECC UDIMMs or unbuffered DIMMs.See below for extra info.. ECC Unbuffered works.   Buffered memory definitely does NOT work.   Bios will not post with Buffered memory.. NonECC NonBuffered memory Does Work.. Module voltage should be . volts.    Modules rated at . volts are not stable.. Use modules with CAS Latency CL of  for pc ddrMHz modules.   if you use modules with higher performance such as modules with CL of  the Bios will adjust the clock speed to the default parameter for that CL in this case MHz.  The Bios has no ability to adjust the RAM clock frequency or CL.So hopefully I gave you some insight of how you get LOTS of ram for cheap. Sorry I couldnt sell you what I have for cheap. And hopefully I answered your question that yes those sticks SHOULD work. But obviously I cant be  sure because thats how ram can be sometimes Good luck!,DataHoarder,d1l1ugb,4,t5_2x7he

Please notice that one of the differences between proprietary software and free software is that with the former you cant check source code even if you want to while with the latter you can. Since one single person cannot check source code for all software he needs to use it is obvious that security stands in the hands of the community of free software developers. I also dont need to remind you that you need to be a developer to understand source code properly and that not everybody is a developer. For example I am not.

7445948,0,t3_4h03au,Since you have the hardware just go with hardware RAID.  Id say a single RAID  TB usable or maybe a RAID  TB usable.  I guess you could a RAID  TB usable if you wanted more redundancy or just still go with a RAID  TB usable.  If you were originally planning on  drives in RAID  TB usable and were okay loosing that much available space Id recommend the RAID .  IMO there isnt anything major that makes ZFS better than hardware RAID with a good control such as that i  Ive got one sitting on my desk since I replaced it with a CVi in my hypervisor box for an SSD RAID  setup.  I also use an Adaptec  RAID controller in my main box currently.  It supports RAID levels and JBOD so I have  TB drives in JBOD for a ZFS pool and  RAID  sets both with SSDs  for OS drives other for VM storage.  I really like the webUI on the Adaptec cards and wish AvagoLSI would build one.  Just make sure you set up your patrolsconsistency checks on the LSI card and youll be just fine.  EDIT Immediately just realized your concern is that you only have  lanes on that card for  drives.  Grab a SAS Expander...less than  for a HP SAS Expander or Intel or Chenbro.

So I was pretty much stuck with dropbox for daily use and convenience spideroak for cold backups and MEGA for useless stuff ebooks sharing zipped family pictures....But I was looking for something that could allow me to sync files like dropbox to allow me to upload cold backups like spideroak versioning support if possible like dropbox and spideroak and some technical flexibility Im a sysadmin so I dont mind to get in to it.I tried amazon cloud drive unlimited storage google cloud backblaze B still in beta seafile and some other services. Also I took some experiences from other users and comments in here and I ended setting up a seafile server on a personal subdomain behind nginx. Its so much responsive faster and tecnical advanced than owncloud also I have running their linux client on the background ala dropbox. It can export your files via protected webdav if you find it necessary.The android client is superb fast and simple.You can create encrypted libraries which in your local machine are main synced folders along with unencrypted ones.In the server you see the files as blocks like spideroak even the unencrypted ones because of their deduplication.The backend storage is an S service so unlimited.You can share files via direct link they support expiration dates.Another big win for me was that you can sync and disconnect folders and later on reattach to them from the webui you can upload large files like gtGbAnd having already the S I can use it for some more stuff when needed using the amazon s api.Sincerely after tried seafile I recommended to some of my friends to uninstall owncloud and Im happy with this setup in the end the securityencryption can be handled with whatever you like encfs for example or automatic sync of pgp encrypted backups either directly to the S or through seafile.,DataHoarder,d34k2y6,2,t5_2x7he

I could also very easily just use the larger array for something like movies which would have a lot less smaller files than the TV Shows and make its block size larger to decrease the RAM needed to sync. You really do have a ton of options.,DataHoarder,d34pihr,1,t5_2x7he

7804028,0,t3_4lz0cj,If your Windows setup works why go to all the trouble to move to FreeNAS andor ZFS?And as uflamingme points out expansion of a ZFS pool has some major limitations. You cannot add or remove disks from a vdev. You cannot remove vdevs from a pool. You can add vdevs to a pool and those vdevs can be of mixed type but mixing types is against best practices.For your migration if you dont have some place to store all the data temporarily youll be stuck w buying at least one extra drive. Youd make a pool of mirrored vdevs which youd expand  disks at a time. But when that is all done youll be wasting half your total space and will only guarantee protection from a single disk failure with luck protecting you from failure of up to half the total disks. But itll have amazing io performance such that you wouldnt need an SSD torrent landing pool. Which you probably dont need anyway. In conclusion if what you have works... Id stick w it.

Even more extra fun because they are external drives if you take them out of the dinky USB enclosure they come in you void the warranty.The enclosure on these guys has no cooling of any kind BTW.

Im asking if the variation is considered typicalexpected for NAS drives or whether it suggests early evidence of a defective drive. What Im lacking is sample size as context to know which this is hence the question. If I get a dozen people telling me they routinely get up to  variations in drives that have lasted for years then I can be confident that its not an issue. However if people tell me they never see tests vary by more than . for identical drives then I know theres a good chance Ive got a dud on my hands.Not only would I consider this question interesting Id consider it fundamental to the very nature of this subreddit.

In our testing this was writing more than  new data to the drives before we hit the slowdown.  It took about  hours for the drive to do its thing and rewrite all the tracks new and adjacent.  Your plan is perfect nonraid individual disks with a backup to the external.  REDs read rate even at RPM are probably faster than your upstream internet for seeding so they wont be your bottleneck.  When you do your separate NASRAID server youre good to move the REDs into it and seed direct from the NAS.  Those TB drives caused me a lot of pain... Mine were the Seagate Constellation TB ES.

10192492,0,t3_5lu4hg,gt Redundancy system and drive failures are easily recoverableFreeNAS redundancy will depend on what you want to use. For example RAIDZ will use  drives for parity so up to  drives can die before you lose all your data. UnRAID only supports up to  drives last I checked but unlike FreeNAS the data isnt striped Spread across all the drives so you wont lose ALL your data.gt Decent access speed to the data on lan or can you ever plug in direct to these?Because of how unRAID doesnt stripe your data your readwrite speeds are only going to be limited to the speed of  drive. You can add an SSD cache to get better write speeds but thats it. FreeNAS stripes your data and will generally readwrite a lot faster. You can add an SSD cache to that too.gt Remote accessgtgt StreamingPlex in a VPS or docker container and a VPN for external lan access? Since it sounds like you have a bunch of drives already Id download the trial for unRAID and stick that onto your old computer It boots off USB and see if you like it. freeNAS isnt as flexible with a bunch of different drives and I thought unRAID was pretty user friendly when I trialed it.Honestly I think PCIpassthrough VM Gaming is a bit of a hassle.

10284049,0,t1_dc8owun,Let me state off the bat before I get into why I disagree with you that I agree with  your statement gt Companies have created an atmosphere where in order for users to fully maintain ownership encryption must be used.Im not saying that you should NOT store tb Im NOT saying that you should not use encryption. I am saying that google ALREADY encrypts your data and does not delete accounts for LINUX ISOs so maybe stick to encrypting your JUST your dick pics and leave the rest for google to deduplicate so they can continue to offer a reasonable service to reasonable people.What I think would be a prudent approach would be to encrypt data they cant deduplicate anyway this being data only YOU have a copy of and would quite likly be your more private data like dick pics sex tapes embarrassing love songs you wrote as a angsty teenager explicit crayon drawings of barney the purple dinosaur in various states of undress or drug use My most perfered solution would be if rclone crypt encfs or a similar tool suported convergent encryption where you could retain your private key to decrypt the index of your files and their indiviudal encryption keys but would alolow for storage providers to still deduplicate your ENCRYPTED data.Back to me being snarkyFirstly yeah I was being an bit of a dick and a kinda snarky lol I own that. I thank you for remaining levelheaded. I wanted to be empathetic so youd know I could identify with you but also some what rude to gauge what type of response I would get to determine if further discussion would be fruitful.You responded to my arguments rather than my rudeness which demonstrates you are a person that can think rationally and you value discussion of information as apposed only representing how you FEEL about a subject. This was important for me to establish early on so as to not waste time arguing with someone who cant rationalizethink throughcomprehend viewpoints outside their current view.Why I responded in the way is did was largely due to the tone of your message. I get it I called people asshats I set the tone for the discussion I started it lol I got it! I didnt think anyone could posibly be so bold as to think they had a leg to stand on in arguing that storing tb of data in an economically unsustainable fashion had any chance of a future. Alass I will try to pursuade you...gt Its our space we can upload whatever we like. Companies shouldnt sell unlimited if thats not what they mean.

Then demonstrate how you can retrieve your data off BitCasa StreamNation Hive MegaUpload RapidShare? Please PROVE me wrong! Dont just say I am wrong.gtwe can upload whatever we likeNot really as demonstrated by Microsoft World Governments Edward Snowden Julian AssangegtCompanies shouldnt sell unlimited if thats not what they mean. Its false advertising.I already adressed this gtcustomers are gaming the systemGoogle is making a good faith offer of unlimited storage arguinging and being pedantic to justify abuse of that offer is foolish. You know people get mad that wireless carriers sold unlimited data that wasnt unlimted but it was unlimited UNTILL people started gaming the system and using their phones as their home internet connection then the companies had to renege their offer and add acceptable use policies... People gamed the sytem and ruined it for everyone totally not entitlement tho right?Wireless cariers havent retracted their offer of unlimited calling but I bet if you and enough people took the attitude of entitlement you demostrate here and applied it to your cell service by decideding to constanly have a call live an conected   CAUSE HEY ITS UNLIMITED!!! they would cancel your account or kill the offer entirely.They are offering UNLIMITED storage and by not retracting that offer so far they have demonstreated their good will to continue offering said service. Its simply that ASSHATS gaming the system are going to make it unsustainable and fuck it up for EVERYONE.I dont see how a reasonable human being could rationalize an alternate belief...If I had a tire shop and I offered unlimited tires and changes for life for  per year including replacement for blow outs provided you come to my shop. I think Id be a pretty nice guy depending on how expensive your tires are. Now if a buch of hoodlums came in bought new tires went out to my lot to burn donuts wreck the tires and have me replace them repeatedly I THINK my more reasonable less ENTITLED customers would be reletivly justified in calling those hoodlems ASSHATS for ruining what was a really good offer. DropsMic GivesFingerYou are not being resonable or justified you are simpy being pedantic to justify misuse and abuse of a system that will ultimatly ruin that system for everyone who now enjoys it.gt The EULA or ToS has nothing to do with this situationFACT This is wrong! You probably did not read the EULA or ToS same as anyone else but that wont stop them form choosing at anytime that you are in violation of that agreement and disabling or deleting your account...gt If EULA violations had occurred the company would have terminated those users in violationFACT This is wrong companies dont always enforce their their EULA and ToS but some time they decide to do so selectivly at a later date and when they do you can end up  FUCKED as a result!FACT I Have tons of content in stored violation of the ToS of one of my storage provides an have had it there for YEARS. BUUUUUUUT they could at anytime delete my account and Id be up shit creek with absofuckinglutly no recourse at my disposal. What I am trying to get at here is you demonstrated an attitude of whateva I do what I want or Its my right! but facts and history would argue quite the oppositeNow you or anyone else can talk till they are blue in the face about how they have the RIGHT to or SHOULD be able to do x but the only thing that ACTUALLY MATTERS is what you CAN do! History has demonstrated this for countless millennia....  Martin Luther King Jr Had the rights to Free Speech and Peaceful Protest same as anyone else but that did not stop him from being arrested. On JULY   the The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America stated We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  . Despite the founders viewing theses rights as unalienable law were still passed allowing the imprisionment and execusion of people depriving them of their unalienable rights   .These right are aleged unalienable yet the united States refused to aknowlege that africans were men and they enslaved them . Interracial coupling . Gay mariage  So dont talk to me about what you SHOULD be able to do or what companies SHOULD do or whats right. We dont live in a world were the right thing is the thing that happens. People die everyday from lack of food and water while other people are able to have excesses of wealth. This world does not will not and wont ever care what you or I think. What happens happens because people who have power make it happen. Your pedantic rosy eyed idealism has no sway in coporate decision making however the actions of thoes abusing a good faith offer of unlimited storage may very well have a long term impact on the of the contiuation or cancelation of that offer.So unless you can FORCE Google or Amazon to make good on their offer of unlimited storage even if you have made it cost ineffective to them you can SAY Its our space we can upload whatever we like. Companies shouldnt sell unlimited if thats not what they mean. Its false advertising. however that statement is about as meaningful as the kid who gets hit in the face by a bully his own hand then telling the bully he the bully cant do that because its wrong...  The bully if fact can he will and their is not a damn thing we can do about it. So instead of insisting that a company we are not majority share holders in do something on our totally NOT entitled say so a more prudent approach might be to use the service offered in a way that will make sure to encourage them to continue offering it rather than make it highly costly for them and then acting like a pedantic bratty child stating how its OUR SPACE AND OUR RIGHT!,DataHoarder,dc9r4wq,1,t5_2x7he

10379001,0,t1_dckgeog,I use Storage Spaces  ReFS at work on several large systems. Honestly ReFS  integrity streams  Storage Spaces at large scale is pretty alphabetaquality stuff right now imo. It does provide integrity verification but Ive personally encountered quite a few different serious showstopping bugs in the course of normal stuff like volume expansion scrubs recent memory leaks in refs driver code prior to certain patches being installed etc. Some of those Ive encountered in  even so this isnt even old issues. Updates have mostly resolved the worst issues but even encountering them once before updates are issued is pretty frightening. Old problems with Storage Spaces included pools literally crashing when utilization neared  without the ability to mount again...etc. Oh yeah and it can also spaz out and literally wreck your pool if you have multiple HBAs of identical models in some cases in which you will have uniqueID conflicts and it will add disks but then basically break your pool. Oh the problems I have had... and this isnt on just one system or anything. Oh yes and Ive also had random file corruption that did not stem from ram the ecc ram was fine or disks no errors reported on disk but huge swaths of data that were corrupt and not repairable in a mirrored storage pool immediately after doing disk expansion.All that said it can work and work well...my confidence level in it is just...low. I breathe very gently around it now Storage Spaces  NTFS is also more mature imo. A lot of the weirdness stems from ReFSIntegrity Streams.Imo DrivePool is a very safe solution given how it operates. It doesnt support VSS or scaling across many disks in IO performance so its not all that practical in business use cases of course which is where Storage Spaces fills a niche in MSland but for home use or cases where high throughput isnt needed and nonvss filebased backup can be used I think its great.For bitrotchecksumming with recoveryetc I think ZFS is the way to go at home or where it can be supported in business. Its a very stable and mature solution across the board. Plus the raidz parity implementation for ZFS actually works. With Storage Spaces untiered parity writes are like trying to fill a swimming pool through a straw that clogs up randomly every few seconds.,DataHoarder,dckiv74,2,t5_2x7he

You can pass through your disks  to your VM if you want the best performance. Or you could just use VHDX files on the drives and expose that that to the VM. Very little overhead either way.One tip If you are going ESXi Dont passthrough individual disks. ESXi messes with the disks in a way that most smart  drive tools wont work properly with it. The consensus over at rhomelab is that passing through an entire SASSATA HBARAID card is the best option.Personally I run a hybrid hyperv setup gt Physical install runs the file server and hyperv VMs for all the logic.

Others wouldnt dream of it.If the data is WORM writeonce readmany RAID tend to be a good choice as you wont suffer from the write penalty as you arent writing much but you get the most amount of storage while still retaining the ability to have  disks fail.If the data does a lot of writing such as for hosting VM disks theres no other choice than RAID IMO. Youll lose  of space on the redundancy but it gives the most performance and the ability to lose up to half the entire array before failure.,DataHoarder,dfq5rg7,2,t5_2x7he

11645254,0,t1_dgfyzzs,Well it is certainly a good idea to plan ahead but ZFS is not necessarily fixed in storage. See ZFS manages data in pools meaning you could combine  TB drives into roughly a TB storage pool. If you want redundancy through RAID you first create a vdev from the  hard drives and then add it to the pool leaving you with a little less than TB for a RAID in your pool.Expanding the pool can be done by adding another vdev to it. However if one on your vdevs fails completely say more than  drives fail in a RAID the pool is also lost. Another method would be to one by one exchange each drive with a bigger one and resilver ZFSterm for rebuilding the array between each step. After all drives are switched your pool grows in size.For your backup it doesnt matter if you run ZFS or not. The file system runs much lower in the hierarchy so any other device in the network doesnt know you are running ZFS  even programs which run on the ZFS device dont notice the difference. But running both storage systems on ZFS gives you some nice features like sending a complete snapshot of your current filesystem over the network to your other device.Edit Typo,DataHoarder,dgg04oq,1,t5_2x7he
