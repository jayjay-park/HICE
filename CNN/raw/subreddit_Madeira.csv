3566192,0,t3_3168d7, its June its going to be mildly hot already get a Mojito from Maktub Pub in Pal do Mar in the southwest coast of the island. Bring shorts as you might be tempted to join the locals and dive from the tiny pier there  only do it if others are doing it if people are looking scared there might be jellyfish in the water. dont buy bottled Poncha from the supermarket its overpriced crap. Get it fresh from the barspubs theres quite a few of them in the center of Cmara de Lobos Id recommend the Number  bar theres a couple Number  establishments throughout the island at least  in Funchal theyre usually a safe bet and in the Zona Velha in Funchal. As for the best Poncha it would either be in Serra dgua small place inbetween So Vicente and Ribeira Brava or in Poiso way above Funchal near the mountains. be careful which trail you take when walking in the mountains it seems like every year theres   or  tourists falling to a horrible death slipping from an unprotected cliff. Research properly first before adventuring yourself either online or asking locals with some knowledge like guides. Sometimes even marked tourist paths recommended to tourists can be dangerous. Of course some of the most unbelievably beautiful views will be in these but seriously dont die. I cant stress this one enough THE SUN IS DANGEROUS UV rays are very high and can give you a sunburn even if its cloudy or if it doesnt seem that hot. Every year I see literally dozens of Scandinavianlightskinned tourists horribly sunburnt. Always apply suncream if youre going to the beach or taking a walk in the mountains and be extra extra careful in between noonPM. Im a local used to the conditions and refrain going to the beach before PM! theres sunlight until way past PM. Typically tourism in Madeira has been geared towards an elder rich audience  peace calm tranquility viewwatching flowerwatching etc. In recent years however weve started to explore activities that are more radical or geared towards younger people cannyoing paragliding scubadiving surfing trout fishing for something milder be aware these things exist and Madeira is an absolutely fantastic place for all of it! Consider taking a boat trip to Porto Santo its relatively unexpensive  per person and youd get to visit a completely different place its a tiny island that you can see all in  day so I really wouldnt stay there for more than  day unless you plan to take advantage of the beach to the maximum as their beach is better than the ones in Madeira theyve actually got sand. But watch out that the weather there in June could often be cloudy and windy.,Madeira,cpyrtdo,4,t5_2uixz
