144097,0,t1_ceumn8m,Yeah I think it could be Home hardware stores frequently stock marble because its a soft rock easy to quarry and cheap to buy. This is why I asked for whats commonly called a scratch test .Because of what the rock is those little flakes will keep happening. As you found out marble or other calcareous rocks are quite weak When you pour water on them and theyre hot the water will make the outer shell of the rocks cool very fast. When the outside cools its going to shrink and fall off in little pieces so that little bit of mess is going to keep happening. The only way to actually vaporize any stuff in the rock get it into the steam your using marble is to pour acid on it. Unless your going to do that those rocks should be fine if you dont mind the flakes.This is probably more than you wanted to know. lol. Ill finish up by saying you could use those but one day they will eventually crack from the heating and cooling. If your after another one pick a very hard one Cant scratch  and make sure its not smooth.Not smooth is important because if it is the most common way to make a rock smooth is for it to be in a river for thousands of years. This fills the inside of the stone with water.When you heat these river stones they will explode with more than enough force to fill the inside of your oven with pockmarks.   These are what not to get. Good luck ,geology,ceuudpm,3,t5_2qshr

This is a case in geology in which the original depositional layering is tilted and the tilting is not a result of postdepositional deformation. Crossbeds or sets are the groups of inclined layers and the inclined layers are known as cross strata.gtCross bedding forms during deposition on the inclined surfaces of bedforms such as ripples and dunes and indicates that the depositional environment contained a flowing medium typically water or wind. Examples of these bedforms are ripples dunes antidunes sand waves hummocks bars and delta slopes.  Crossbedding is widespread in many environments. Environments in which water movement is fast enough and deep enough to develop largescale bed forms fall into three natural groupings rivers tidedominated coastal and marine settings. gtgtImage iInteresting Sedimentary structures | Hummocky crossstratification | Moenave Formation | Hermit Formation Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgfziu oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgfziu.

If the optical properties changed that is if the bifringence or optic sign... etc than that would mean you would be looking at a different mineral. The properties of a properly made thin section means also that the sample has been ground down to a thickness of  microns. A very thin section from your original sample. Anyways the colors transmitted through the sample change as the thickness changes. Because of this particular thickness thin section must be it would seem to me that any evidence of the technologies used to ?quarry? the talclignite would probably be removed from the original sample due to this required loss of informationHowever.. searching for other structural clues in the thin section such as shocked qtz or shocked talc could be indicative of heavy blows used to mine the minerals. This is certainly something that could be found by fluoroscopy I have a friend doing some research with this equipment. Structural geologic evidence could be gleaned from this. On average fractures sets will form in pairs at  degrees and in three dimensions at this same  degrees from each other from the direction of compression. Grinding may produce heat that could metamorphose some minerals through diagenesis. This process could be looked into for more through answers.Your best evidence of human activity due to sawing gouging and grinding would probably found on the exteriors of exposed and quarried rocks. You may want to ask rArcheology or other sub for more information about this more recent human activity.

2013104,0,t3_2ht6pu,This is just a geode although a pretty nice one. They tend to form in small open spaces that geologists call vugs when the open space gets coated by a shell of silica gel. Depending on how much silica there is you get a nice growth of quartz crystals around the inside of the vug. Sometimes the vug gets completely filled in which is kind of disappointing when you try and crack the geode open. The acid test was probably reacting to some of the limestone mixed in with the outer shell of the geode.,geology,ckvrxuo,1,t5_2qshr

2744708,0,t1_cng139p,Whilst the term Runaway Greenhouse Effect strictly means a terminal event for the planet involved it is also used to describe other positive feedback into the rate of climate change.Methane clathrates held in the ocean and Arctic tundra could hold anywhere between  Gigatonnes of Carbon  which equates to around  of all known coal gas and oil reserves. The main issue with these hydrates is that they dont need to be burned to produce CO as methane itself is a greenhouse gas that has approximately  times more effect on warming when in the atmosphere.Methane from tundra and shallow continental seas is already leaking at higher rates than ever before and the concern is that as those areas warm more then more methane gets released leading to more warming etc. This positive feedback loop is called a runaway greenhouse effect by many and is believed by some to be linked to other extinctions such as the PermianTriassics Great Dying.The good news is that methane has a relatively short half life of only  years so if the rate of release is slow enough then the positive feedback loop will be slow enough to avoid a runaway effect.,geology,cng2833,2,t5_2qshr

This forms a graben the dropped down section with horsts either side. This is also what happens during the formation of oceans and rift valleys  if you want to do a bit more research have a look at horst and graben formation and ocean spreading.The second thing Im slightly less sure about but there seem to be two intersecting faults in an x shape. Diagram  When this occurs the acute angle  diagram  is the strongest force compression and the biggest angle is the direction of the weakest force  diagram . The direction of the weakest force is the direction of extension purple arrows.The intersecting faults conjugate faults correlate with the mini graben formation at the top of the rock.

Rather than a consequence of a temporal decoupling of evolutionary innovations between fungi and plants Paleozoic coal abundance was likely the result of a unique combination of everwet tropical conditions and extensive depositional systems during the assembly of Pangea.

8433515,0,t1_d5vpc2s,No worriesFlash floods normally occur when the ground is dry and unable to absorb the water this means that flash floods may also occur when the ground is saturated and more debris will probably be transported if thats the case. The key factor is the ability to absorb the water. It is called a flash flood because it evolves rapidly. Large amounts of precipitation fall in a short time span normally less than  hours. As the ground is unable to absorb the water it will start to flow and debris will be transported with the water. Edit The creek is dry because it is dry at that location. The precipitation may have occurred high up in the mountains or whatever several hours before. Flash floods are fast! And dangerous. I apologise if Ive repeated myself or made things unclear.

10450144,0,t1_dcsgids,I know the image doesnt help with ID as an opal but I am certain it is.  There are no sources of  quartz or chalcedony like this in the opal mine.  I found it in a load of clay  hours after it had been brought up from under the overburden.  It has the telltale surface cracking of an opal beginning to dry out and while not showing in this pic it does also have light contraluz fire in one corner unmistakeably  contraluz not rainbows from internal fracture like quartz can have.  I could test hardness just as another ID factor later today fracture is pointless here though The museum or university is a great idea though I will have to work that angle!  Thanks for the suggestion.  Im dying to know more specific details.,geology,dcsmdc7,3,t5_2qshr

10505130,0,t3_5qcp02,Cleavage is easiest to understand in minerals. The simplest way to think about it is the plane along which a mineral breaks or forms due to its chemical structure the way the atoms are bonded together specifically where the weak bonds are.If you take a sample of pyroxene and find a cleavage plane rotate it deg. Youll find another cleavage plane. Repeat the process and youll see another. Cleavage is a specific characteristic to each mineral although some minerals do not have cleavage. These cleavageless minerals will fracture read break irregularly.This image is a simple way to view it. clickHeres a decent video clickI didnt fully understand what cleavage was until I finished my undergrad chemistry classes and mineralogy. ,geology,dcyv9dy,1,t5_2qshr

11293102,0,t1_dfbxwb7,gtIm not sure if theres any mountains being actively fracked or not According to the top comment here there are mountains being fracked. It was new to me too I was sure if they could be. gtbut I think youre being downvoted because of your gross over simplification of what mountains are made of. That and saying it isnt with such certainty. Also I think this person is thinking of mountains such as Mt Saint Helens or Mt Batchelor not things like  mountain ranges like coastal mountains or gorge mountains. ,geology,dfc2285,2,t5_2qshr

Had to go to a surgeon to get it pulled.  Took him a couple of minutes with a scalpel and some forceps and that was that.

11748719,0,t3_66rl91,Sounds like Earth ScienceGeology would be perfect for you so long as youre going to be OK with working outdoors on fieldcourses. A major aspect of geology courses is a  week independent field project where you will be usually mapping the geology of a chosen area. Not on your own though youd have a mapping partner and probably go together as a small group I recently graduated from a UK University and now work in admissions so I have a pretty good overview of the courses offered at UK institutions  im happy to give you any adviceanswer any questions! If it helps I can give you an idea of what kind of things to look for in a course as I know its pretty overwhelming choosing a uni Something you might wanna look into are geochemistry course at Manchester maybe environmental science as well as geology coursesRemember you can always specialise in something like ecology climate change sustainability etc at MSc level after you finish your undergrad and geology would be a good first degree to any of thosePS  not having geography wont be a problem at all. A lot of people do because physical geography is often what leads people into geology but A Level covers topics at such a broad level that it really wont matter!,geology,dgrqw00,1,t5_2qshr
