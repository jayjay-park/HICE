1880069,0,t1_ckfqceb,I used a nifty little program called DEM which can turn raw height data into a raster image.Its really easy to use  a dialog will open up once you launch the program where you determine the file type you want to convert and point the program to the specific files. Itll then create the raster for you.You can then mess around with changing projections cropping to a smaller area changing the resolution of the image changing the colour scale etc. Its clunky in places but it does the trick.To finish I imported the image into GIMP to pretty it up a bit and add locations and text.I can PM you the stepbystep process if you like.,HistoryWales,ckfqp7x,2,t5_33hgc
