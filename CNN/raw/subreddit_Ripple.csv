10003,0,t1_cefk21b,Ive had serious problems with Bitstamp. It took  weeks for them to deposit from Ripple and to reply to my support tickets.Then same backwards  weeks no response slow withdrawal. It was a terrible experience.,Ripple,cefko90,0,t5_2r9sg
301494,0,t1_cfbyfiv,Solution for what? MtGox withdrawal problems?Truth is they would suck hard as gateway too and even give Ripple bad rep with their incompetence once they fail to handle transactions properly.Just look at Bitstamp  even though they are early adopters of Ripple they still seem to have smaller issues constantly where the Bitcoin bridge is down the hot wallet is depleted or depositswithdrawals are not working for some time.,Ripple,cfc0kuo,2,t5_2r9sg
415421,0,t1_cfmjs14,IMHO bitcoin is going to evolve into the same dual software model. Theres the full client with ever growing storage requirements and lite clients electrum multibit etc. Fewer and fewer people are running the full client. Clearly one day the full client will be hosted by a selected few and they will carefully select who their clients connect to.Ripple is starting from the opposite direction. Eventually both will meet somewhere in the middle where theres a backbone network of high quality servers surrounded surrounded by a cloud of lite clients.For example thats how Internet operates nowadays. Very few computers are allowed to access the ARPA net directly. Most of us rely series of routers to the ARPA backbone,Ripple,cfntofc,1,t5_2r9sg
907534,0,t1_ch7f4m6,Im initially going to fund it with  xrp. My goal is to have sponsors as well ie.  but if that doesnt work out Ill just throw in more xrp down the road.Forgive my ignorance but is this something I could figure out how to do fairly easily with instruction? I wanted to treat it a bit as a learning experience. Let me know if you think its out of reach for a beginner with minimal coding knowledge though.,Ripple,ch7fxr0,2,t5_2r9sg
1068723,0,t3_26ccz3,I guess this explains why Kraken has not become a Ripple gateway... and everytime I deposit or withdraw XRP I had problems.At least take XRP off your exchange if you arent going to fix things.edit sorry If I seemed like a dick but seriously I get so annoyed dealing with XRPs on Kraken lol,Ripple,chpro6q,5,t5_2r9sg

3431098,0,t1_cpjcq7s,gt The equivalent of this for Ripple would be that all the honest nodes use the same UNL.Not  same but fairly well interconnected yes. The required amount of interconnectivity is what was discussed in the thread you linked.Bitcoin miners burn electricity to prove they are worthy to take part in consensus  if they do however most of the time they are accepted even if they do things some most? people dont like e.g. miners that mine empty blocks dont get forked away.It is not  clear what Ripple validators should do to prove their worthiness  burn money? Operate honestly for x time units? Maybe we need a gradual trust model instead of the current binary one so you can enumerate all validators out there and actually listen to their chatter  then come up with your own private weight function on which ones to trust how much...?Imho there are more urgent problems to be fixed first though before Consensus can really be evolved to a widely spread trust graph... we are still kinda in the Satoshi is the first and only miner phase.,Ripple,cpjddc0,1,t5_2r9sg

6182796,0,t3_4090pi,Yes that message might be connected to the fact that Ripple no longer supports the RippleTrade client... yes seriously. It doesnt really matter what the error says anymore since Ripple Labs will basically shut down RippleTrade in March you can bet features will just get worse. They are putting all their efforts into building out the protocol interledger XRP adoption and of course whatever viable services banks request. You should consider trading on exchange markets such as Poloniex,Ripple,cysf4ap,1,t5_2r9sg

11435397,0,t3_638ttf,It costs a lot of money to transfer any currency around the world.This is what XRP and other CCs is here to destroy you exchange a sum of money to XRP give the address to the recipient and in turn exchanges XRP to his respective local currency.This is how XRP will be used or what its intended for. The team behind XRP wants to exchange the SWIFT banking protocol with Ripple protocol making the flow of money around the world completely free and apparently Japan just joined the wagon which is a HUGE deal for a VERY big part of the worlds industry Think automotive and technologySo Ripple serves as a Currency at the same time it serves as a Open Payment Network.,Ripple,dfs6vuk,3,t5_2r9sg

11541439,0,t3_64q4cr,I agree the price is way less than it should be given the real world applications of ripple and where its going. It is genuinely going to explode. Looking at the way the CEO is talking too they are aiming to be bigger than bitcoin...XRP has faster transaction speeds and beats the pants out of bitcoin in that sense. XRP is faster and cheaper than bitcoin.Ripple is also incredibly well managed with a lot of expertise and experience behind it. To get such high level connections and integrations with the biggest banks in the world speaks for itself.As for the issue of theyre being excess supply of XRP I feel thats talk by people who dont know understand what ripple is all about. To answer your question The reason the price is so low is because a lot of people are clueless on what Ripple actually does and where its going. ,Ripple,dg482gz,13,t5_2r9sg
