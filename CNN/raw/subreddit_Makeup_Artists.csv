Is it going to be primarily outside or inside or a combination of both? Do you generally wear a good amount of makeup on any given day? How do you want to feel on your big day? What colors are you using for your wedding? These are just a few questions. Then take pictures in it the pictures are what you are going to take away from this day other than your new spouse and how it looks in pictures is going to far outweigh how it looks up close or in a magnified mirror. Also depending on the MUA and their understanding of skin types and products that work well with each is how well the final outcome will look. Foundation and colors fit everybody differently you just have to find what works for you. I agree with the above rec of finding a freelance artist. We tend to have a bit more freedom when it comes to our kit build and products we recommend. ,Makeup_Artists,deq3aqh,1,t5_2z98n
