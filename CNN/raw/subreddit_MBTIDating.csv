10862130,0,t1_ddxxb1y,Hi! Nice to meet you! You seem really cool. Im Joel. To be totally honest Im seeing someone Im pretty into right now but like I said you seem really cool so I wanted to respond. Where in Michigan are you? My family is from Detroit and I was born in Rochester Hills and lived out there in that area for the first few years of my life. Im curious what do you do for work? Im kind of hoping to figure out some sort of selfemployed work down the road. I also love dancing and do it a lot in my bedroom by myself. Its so much fun. ,MBTIDating,de0coky,1,t5_37dc5
