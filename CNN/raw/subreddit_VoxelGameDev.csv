105351,0,t1_ceqe1uk,Glad I was able to help. Another thing Ive made a habit of avoid dividing!If it is a simple divide x   just multiply it instead x  . If you are dividing by power of  you can do one even better by bitshiftingA common size for chunks is x so it is possible you will need to divide a voxel coordinate by the chunks width or depth on occasion. So rather than doing x  chunkWidth you can do x gtgt . In the same vein you could multiply by shifting the other way x  chunkWidth  x ltlt .This microoptimizations wont make or break your performance attempts but the key thing is that keeping a performance focused mindset is important when dealing with thousands if not millions of iterations.The only reason I did this microoptimizations from the get go is because they are dead simple and its not an algorithm optimization that may be prone to bugs it is simply replacing one operator with another.Id love to have a chat with you as Im in the process of making my own voxel game. Ive actually begun the AI and that is one area Im particularly weak on. Shoot me a PM if you are interested in talking. It is assumed chunkWidth   since you are using xx make sure you shift by  instead of .,VoxelGameDev,ceqfbuq,1,t5_2ton9
202131,0,t1_cf1gd51,Yea this is probably the best solution.  I dont do any post processing currently but it seems like it should work.  For me I would have to detect some significant delta in the depth buffer It might not be a full hole it could be displaying some bright geometry that should be occluded.  ,VoxelGameDev,cf1gs0m,1,t5_2ton9

949570,0,t1_chbwyg4,That would make computations go a lot quicker! The game industry is trying as much as possible to move things server side to reduce technical issues cheating client requirements piracy etc. But a distributed system wouldnt be too hard to implement and its easy for a server to verify results from clients.,VoxelGameDev,chc82iq,1,t5_2ton9
986303,0,t1_chgc75h,That is exactly what I was doing before just without any merging.  The problem was that rebuilding a mesh caused massive lag spikes even when the mesh building was in a separate thread.  This was normally not a problem but when moving around entire slices of chunks are loaded at once which dragged down performance.  Other than spikes performance was actually fairly good about  FPS with nothing but terrain and once all chunks had loaded.  Drawing anything else like entities HUDs etc brought it down significantly however.  Do you think using merging and distributing chunk loads across multiple ticks would help?,VoxelGameDev,chgefc6,2,t5_2ton9
1275810,0,t3_28nvqs,Simply store all object positions as doubles. Now doubles wont really work for graphics so when you go to draw it you simply treat the player as the origin and use floats so you have almost no rounding error on the GPU.        float newX  chunk.X  player.XWhere chunk.X is an integer or double and player.X is a double.,VoxelGameDev,cid59oc,2,t5_2ton9
1385325,0,t1_chfu1qh,Good summary. Another type of encoding that I think should be promoted more is hash based SVO encoding. Although daunting at first its surprisingly easy to implement and offers many advantages over traditional pointers especially in construction neighbour access not requiring storing pointers and jumping to specific nodes without traversal which is sometimes useful when considering spatialtemporal coherence.template lttypename VoxelTypegtstdvectorltstdunorderedmapltVecInt VoxelTypegtgt hashSVOhashSVO.resize  make a depth  SVOif hashSVOVecInt  if specific voxel at depth  exists       hashSVOVecInt    Voxel...  add new voxel to its neighbor  in xaxisYou can also plug in your cachefriendly orderings to a custom HashFuncstdvectorltstdunorderedmaplt VecInt VoxelType MortonHash MortonEqualitygtgt zOrderSVO...but itd be better for a more optimized hashmap than unorderedmap like google sparsehash. I found much faster results using uncompressed memory like stdbitset for first few levels of Brick VoxelType then storing Bricks in hash CPU or pointer GPU structure to other bricks like GigaVoxels.,VoxelGameDev,cipxlki,2,t5_2ton9

1986716,0,t1_ckscv3q,actually its not a voxel engine because a voxel means D pixels which are usually textureless and the smallest element which is not the case.

2137374,0,t1_clb4fsd,Lately Ive been doing a lot with Game Jolt since it has an integrated game jam system that allows you to automatically submit games by using the appropriate hashtags and allows a lot of options for developers. You can have your game play in a browser or by download and can even upload multiple builds for different platforms. It also allows for screenshots a nice banner for your games page gameplay videos etc.Itch.io is similar but I dont use it as much personally because it feels messier than Game Jolt has less options and doesnt seem to have as many players. That being said its still a good site and is pretty popular. Like Game Jolt it also has an integrated game jam system. It also allows for donations  purchases of games.If you ever do anything in Flash HTML or Unity or whatever else is compatible sites like Kongregate or Newgrounds are also options. I personally prefer Newgrounds since their community is fantastic at providing feedback and your game is guaranteed to get at least k plays. Kongregate is pretty terrible for smaller developers honestly. The way the site is set up it can be extremely difficult to get any exposure without already being known.Arguably the most important part about putting yourself out there is the feedback. Seeing your creations through others eyes with give you a more true impression of the quality of your work. From my experience the best feedback both in quality and volume comes from Ludum Dare and Newgrounds though there are plenty of other sites subreddits facebook groups etc. that can do a great job as well.Also keep in mind that the more you put yourself out there the more exposure you get and the more exposure you get the more feedback you get. The more feedback you get the better your games become!EDIT As far as social media goes you pretty much have to be on Twitter since thats the primary social network for game developers. Twitter also helps because many game jams will have official hashtags that are used so by participating in said game jams you will get additional exposure by using the appropriate tags in any twitter posts relating to your game.,VoxelGameDev,clbi9rp,1,t5_2ton9

3091690,0,t1_coi0l4s,I remember Wollay posted a lot on TIG Source but thats about it. If you find this voxel forum please let me know.Also big LOL at the last blog link because that is actually mine! I do ray marching on the CPU this way though it only works locally within the chunk the rays come out of. Its the reason why Im trying to move it to the GPU because I would like to pass voxel data effortlessly to the shader and would like it to run on low spec computers. It already feels a bit slow and chuggy on my Pentium G when chunks are being rebuilt.gt Though he calculates it over more cubes than just the neighbor cubes.gt I have thought of this actually but that would be probably like  cubes to get soft shadows like the once you see underneath the trees. That sounds very expensive to do as you go building the meshes. I already do pseudo AO with adjacent cubes and that was arduous enough to code to handle the different combinations of adjacent cubes. Cant seem to grasp my mind on how to do that AO with farther distancesradii other than the typical project rays out of a hemisphere approach.I also attempted light propagation the way it was done for Seed of Andromeda But I think you have to start propagating outside the current chunk right? Only apply the lighting after the surrounding chunks are already loaded.,VoxelGameDev,coigajj,1,t5_2ton9

8738046,0,t1_d6xe7tu,Blocky games all get compared to Minecraft because people know Minecraft.  Open world sandbox games get compared to GTA because people know GTA.  Anything you make is going to be compared to the closest other thing people are familiar with and theyll usually judge it according to the other things metric.Basically any time someone gets a new game for a particular or mechanic that they like theyll ask themselves If Im playing X because it reminds of Y why am I not just playing Y?  If the answer to that is no compelling reason Y was better theyll go play that instead and have a low opinion of X.If the answer is Y has no more replay value theyll play X but form their opinion of it based on Y.  If its Y cant do this thing coopcraftingopenworldetc. theyll play it and judge it on the new feature as long as the good parts from Y arent too lacking.The easiest one is Id kill for Y but playing its not an option not on this platformcommunity leftcant afford.  With these as long as you do a great job on the thing they wanted out of Y players will forgive all but the most glaring flaws and have a high opinion of it.For instance if I ever found a D builtyourownmech game like Chrome Hounds or Armored Core for the PC I would absolutely buy it on the spot.  Or a Crimson Skieslike flying game but openworld.  Massive brownie points just for existing.  On the other hand if its a blockworld sandbox reminiscent of Minecraft my criteria would be it needs a metric shitton of content interesting environments and either larger draw distance or better physics to compare favorably.  If it included vehicles Id be comparing it against StarMade which itself is also in strong need of more interesting environments and shittons of content.  I wouldnt judge a game against Minecraft for being blocky but I would if its a plotless sandbox with a buildanywhere mechanic.  By that metric I generally consider Ark to be more like Minecraft rather than Fallout  because while all of them have resource gathering and building and even though Ark includes guns and looks pretty it is also multiplayercentric and has no storyline characters or lore which are Fallout s defining characteristics.  Incidentally Ark compares dismally against Minecraft in terms of Minecraft gameplay and the reason Im playing X instead of Y is because I have a friend whos into Ark who drafted me into service.  The target for a new game that wants to be a better Ark would be a less punishing level progression tech tiers dont change the style of gameplay significantly but each new tier makes your efforts in the previous tier feel utterly pointless and less hideously buggy like  deathbyserver.,VoxelGameDev,d6xwlee,5,t5_2ton9
