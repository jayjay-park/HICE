For those that feel like they belong and have a voice in AA and find that it works for them thats great keep going and working the program and stay sober.  I posted this for the people who feel worthless and are suicidal.  There are other ways and I guess we all belong to some sort of cult since we are tribal mammals.

Most cities have  day detox programs and I would recommend they follow up with a  day inpatient program itself followed by intensive outpatient therapy. The programs include AA meetings but they also offer other structural support services.Others recommend living for  months in a sober house. AA is great for people who have gotten sober and have been thru an outpatient program. But to send somebody who is a drunk or addict and not sober to AA is foolish at best.

1965623,0,t3_2h6ydj,One of the difficult realities of sobering up is having to feel all the emotions and physical trials life puts us through.  The last time you got clean you may not have been in as bad as a place as you were this time.  For me the first sixth months were pretty rough as far as how I felt physically and emotionally.  I heard someone say in a meeting The good news is you never have to get sober again. This didnt solve anything for me but it did let me know that I was putting the worst part behind me.  Isolating when feeling bad is extremely common especially for us in recovery.  It is also really dangerous.  Joining a home group helped me connect with people because I was expected to show up early and help out. That helped me overcome the social awkwardness I usually feel around people I dont yet know.  You are feeling things I too have felt.  It gets better just not always as fast as we would like. It would be a good idea to talk to a sponsor about whats going onas well as your psychiatrist.

Now obviously every meeting is different so Im sure you can find meetings and people who will tell you that any other method is doomed to failure.

2913383,0,t3_2tgw0g,Hugs.The line that got me was the bit about staying in pain and sober.  That sucks.I have  years and I would absolutely love to relax with a bowl.The reason I dont is because my experience has shown me that I am an alcoholic and an addict. Im not going to grow out of it being drugged fir surgeries and dental stuff has proven that to me.  Its just the way my body was made.  I cant process drugs and alcohol normally. So when I ingest them it is rolling the dice.  Whether fast or slow bad things happen.So thats why I dont smoke that nice legal bowl.So then I have to figure out what to do about the pain and uncomfortableness I feel.   Otherwise I would kill myself.For me that has been an absolute commitment to enjoying deeply enjoying myself and life. First I had to clean out the crap ideas and guilt I had about myself and life.  Therapy and steps can help with that.The hard yet awesome part is trying things and learning to really pay attention how they made me feel.  Things that are supposed to be good and enjoyable may or may not work for me. I had to learn to look for the tes and places where joy bubbled up in me and do more of that.It takes courage because you may not end up being the person you think you are.  In the end it wont matter because you will be so freaking satisfied and happy.  For example  you may be a tough guy that ses like he would enjoy cage fighting but when you try it you are just meh inside.  And then you are introduced to knitting and it makes your heart soar.  Do the knitting.The circumstances of my life have been far from easy. But I deeply enjoy my life and really feel comfortable in my skin.  It is possible.Joseph Campbell wrote about the heroes journey.  This is one of them.The other thing I have learned is that when I get stuck or cant figure something out I ask for help until I get it.

3207404,0,t3_2wqp97,The simple answer is that AA is a LOT more than just something you do to keep from drinking. Right now you are dealing with your problems in an unhealthy way AA will help you deal with them in a healthy way. Currently you likely hide your feelings isolate and hide the real you from others AA will encourage you to build connections and be real with other people. You will learn that people will not hate you when they see who you really are.  So even if you do keep going to meetings for the rest of your life you will be doing so because you love being that real authentic free person you became by doing the steps and because you learned the great joy of helping others who are struggling which is the th step and a huge factor in why people keep going.Also a simple illustration  If someone told you to remove all the air from a glass you would have a difficult time sucking it all out and leaving a vacuum something always is going to want to fill that space.  Instead of trying to suck it out pour water into the glass. It will be full and the air wont be able to get back in.  Alcohol is the air and AA is the water. You can try to just quit drinking but even if you stay dry you will inevitably fill it with something else and probably not something healthy. Give AA a try for a while. If you think its not for you then quit. And if later you decide that it was better in AA than out then go back.Good luck!,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,coug2t2,2,t5_2rdsb

So are you going to cover it up or are you going to say well shit I did this because Im an addict? It will be hard. Probably the hardest thing youve ever done and I do recognize how difficult engineering is. Now consequences suck and youre going to have to deal with how people react when you let them know what you did. Remember they are your family. They love you and they support you even if they have no clue what youre going through. My guess is theyve got a pretty good idea of whats going on but they are likely aware that confronting an active Addict with that information will push them away. It did with my family. Be hopeful be faithful. Find meetings with supportive folks and commit to this.  GOOD LUCK! ,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,cpppk6z,1,t5_2rdsb
3535194,0,t3_30r1jl,Time has a way of allowing situations to cool down enough to examine our part in it.  The other party or parties get to cool down too and hopefully do the same. As we cool enough to detach ourselves from the problem we can see that we planted the seeds the situation sprang from ourselves.  Until we understand and acknowledge this we are unable to approach making the appropriate repairs.  Its important if not vital to understand that we are defined by our actions. We are what we do.  Our actions are all that are ever seen by other in spite of how we sincerely feel.   The axiom here works to our advantage when we understand this and live by it.   When we get clean those around us remain skeptical for quite some time.  We are not entitled to be deemed trustworthy. We must earn this virtue back on our own through persistently practicing right behavior. Sometimes in spite of our finest efforts this never occurs. We brought this on ourselves through lying and manipulation.I have no experience with suboxone but I have plenty of experience with heroin and methadone. Kicking isnt fun and games but it doesnt last forever and rarely goes on longer than a few days.  Unfortunately without help from those qualified to give it we often pick up again and are right back to where we started. Very few of us make it on our own.  With the right outlook and perserverance we can ensure our recovery while demonstrating right action to those we hurt.   We do this by getting involved in a program and giving it our all.  ,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,cpv8hj2,1,t5_2rdsb
3607671,0,t3_31muw2,Congrats on gaining another benefit of recovery we start to earn our family and loved ones trust and love once again.Remember the basics. First you have probably heard what fear is as an acronym Future Events Appear Real. As long as we surround ourselves in the program and do what the program recommends we really have nothing to fear. By staying in the now and by staying focused on doing the most right possible thing everything will turn out better than it did before. As for your old party buddies or whatever they are you will be completely boring to them once you say nope enough times. It was my experience that once I stopped doing what they were doing I was a persona nongrata. It is  ok to say Yes to yourself by saying No to another. If they dont like it you like yourself so so what. Right?Look at what you typed you do good things. You have already found meetings. You have found a job that has people in recovery. Both of those acts are super positive. You already are planning this but attend a lot of different meetings and trade phone numbers. Each meeting house and each time slot at that house has a different pulse. Find the place that feels right. You know enough to be able to trust that feeling. Finally once you have the meetings that you like find a sponsor or mentor or whatever. If you have one in your old city that is great. It isnt against the rules to have two for support.Remember those rooms are for dealing with life. And one of the biggest hugestestest things in life is moving to a new city. Even normals wig out when they move. Even normals completely wig out when they have to move back home. Yet we are lucky. In every town we have our brothers and sisters who know exactly how we feel. Expect to need to go to a lot of meetings and be ok with it. Remember life is full of feeling and emotions. This is our first times to really face life. Luckily we dont have to do it alone.There are those promises in the books and we all get them if we do the work. Once you get settled once you get your meetings schedule down and once you start working with a local sponsor it will be time to start working with newcomers. You have enough time under your belt. There is that old saying that we cant keep it if we dont give it away. There will be dozens if not hundreds of people that you can help with your experience strength and hope.  There is nothing that can make one feel at home more than being a part of family friends and recovery.  Congrats again!,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,cq3i14p,3,t5_2rdsb
3683904,0,t3_32j0dt,Does your memory go back as far as the day you decided to get sober? Can you remember how you felt then? Do you want to relive that?Youre at a turning point not just in your sobriety but in your life. If you want to be one of those people who seem to be stuck in their lives who can never seem to get beyond   or  days who continually come in and out and who are stuck in a selfcreated pocket of a sad banal and miserable existence by all means go ahead and pick up. Its all still there waiting for you just like it was the last time. But if you honestly want to change your life for the better if you want to stop caring about what a bunch of losers think about you dont take a drink or pick up a drug just for today. This is no dress rehearsal this is real life. It began a long time ago. The way to gain confidence is to refuse to give in to your addiction. Call a sober friend call your sponsor if you have one if you dont have one get one make a meeting read a bookdo anything but whatever you do dont drink or drug. I guarantee you that you will feel different tomorrow.,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,cqc6tz7,1,t5_2rdsb
3692524,1,t3_32lnbn,This wont go over well especially in a sub that may as well be called REDDITSTEP but... downvote hereAs someone who struggles not just with the God aspect of step programs but moreso labeling yourself as a powerless diseased lifelong addict that has no control over yourself and should credit all of your success to the program I feel your pain.  And as someone who shot dope for five years and then quit without NA Ill say this  I dont care how you put it  if youre clean for a week a year or a decade youre NOT fucking powerless.  People think that they want to stop using because they go to NA and forget that they go there in the first place because they want to stop using.  Recovery is about selfempowerment and learning to cultivate the WILL to quit.  You do have to want it.step programs help people sure but the same way that Christianity or Islam helps people overcome their fear of death.  Recovery is about selfdiscipline not selfdegradation.  Your addiction is not a lifelong label man  its a shitty period in your life when you decided too often and too easily to abandon your cares and just say fuck it Ill get high.  People quit because they want to and because they decide enough is enough.  You dont have to hit bottom you just have to want to quit.  Too often that coincides with their entrance into step programs which is a shame because none of them realize its themselves who have the power.Good luck to you  as someone who knows you wont quit and you wont get fully into the NAAA mindset either until you really want to.  And once you really want to you wont need the  steps anyway thats why they have a  success rate in the first place.  There are alternatives.  SMART Recovery is good its just scarce.  It may work for you though.  PM me if you ever need to talk.  Sorry I could only offer my opinion but thats all anyone does here anyway.Using will lead to jails institutions death andor cults.  Maybe someday the majority will find another way.  ,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,cqd6779,0,t5_2rdsb

In about two and a half weeks Im going to walk in a graduation ceremony for my bachelors degree which I actually officially earned last December. This week I learned Ive been accepted into a masters program in my field.The truth is that I didnt go to the school I wanted for my undergrad but I learned in recovery that its ok. I have a BA from a yearold regionally accredited Catholic university so what that it wasnt the large state school in town? I dont have to take myself so seriously. I couldnt get over my past in one year or two years or five years clean. It took time and work. The good news is that you can learn how to forgive your past too.

4052950,0,t3_36xwmw,I think the biggest thing that holds most people back isnt so much their fear of everyday social stigma as it is the fear that it will be a block to finding or continuing in employment. Especially in an age of Facebook and the like its all too easy for someone to stumble across sensitive information like that if youre sharing it very publicly and given that any future employer is someone youve never met before they arent going to know oh but shes a great person really. Having said that at the same time its hard to imagine that ever changing if more of us arent able or willing to put ourselves in a position to aggressively make the case the addiction isnt some kind of inherent moral failing.I think too much of the problem stems from our public health policy vis a vis drugs though across the western world we teach kids and the public an extremely twodimensional drugs are wicked and evil dont do them or you die approach. I remember my drug education in high school being done by an abstinence group who basically said that word for word I was ironically slightly high at the time. It does nothing to prepare those who are going to go off an experiment to do so safely and it ingrains very negative judgemental positions of anyone who does in everyone else. Its the same message that in turn gets filtered through our media and reinforced in adults. The fact drug abuse is severely criminalised when so much of it ought to be medicalised definitely aggravates the problem as well.I think if youre going to change attitudes its going to take the work of advocacy groups to change the political and public policy reality and its only after that youll start to develop a culture where people can be more honest and change perceptions of people around them.,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,cri9n4n,2,t5_2rdsb

I spent a lot of years ruminating about how things just didnt turn out the way they were supposed to. If Id learned how to accept things and move on do my best at whatever I was interested in doing not allow others opinions of me to mean so much I might have avoided a lot of pain. I turned to alcohol to deal with severe emotional pain because I didnt have other coping skills. Later I turned to opiates for the same reason.

We are all different.I grew up in a fundamentalist Christian environment and I have considerable baggage with the concept of Godreligionhigher power. For me the way I keep myself going with sobriety is by telling myself that I CAN do this that I have the power and the ability to save myself and that I can be proud and take credit for my accomplishments in recovery. For me the idea that I am powerless over my addiction does not motivate me to be sober quite the opposite. What does motivate me is Believing in myself and proving to myself how strong and capable I am. Like I said different strokes for different folks.

For me switching from heroin to suboxone was nothing more then an alcoholic switching from whisky to beer.  Try vivitrol ,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,d3uncpj,1,t5_2rdsb

And I wonder what the perception is of you looking from the outside is?People noticed a change in me when I was high all the time and it wasnt flattering at all.  My selfimage was way off from reality.I liked the stoned pizzaforce better because that little voice that secondguessed everything I did shut up for a while and all the anxiety went away.  But the truth was I went around most of the time completely oblivious to the way my behavior affected others.  I was not functional in the sense I was a better person I was full of chemical arrogance and did stupid things and took foolish risks and treated people badly.TBH it took a lot more for me to see how I was not only ruining my own life but I was ruining the lives of the very people I claimed to love by my drug use and drinking.You have to look very hard at your definition of functional and ask yourself if the person you see in the mirror is really the charming energetic person you want to be or if like me there is an insidious downside to that drugfueled persona that you arent willing to admit.

9028609,0,t1_d7lpiro,Late reply. Just saw this post and wanted to clarify something with you if you have the time to reply. You said youre interested in trying total sobriety and I was wondering if you have already or its something youll be doing soon.   Ive been giving total sobriety a lot of thought myself and I havent discussed the issue with anyone yet. When I saw this post and your comment I swore it was a sign.  Ive given up what I considered to be my two worst addictions but I still take one low dose Xanaxday and I smoke cigarettes. I think the reason I want to give it all up is to try and have nothing to rely upon but my mind when faced with anything that would normally make me pop or puff. Another reason is the odd feeling I have when people ask if Im still clean and instead of saying yes I say No booze no opiates.   Do you feel like you must stop everything in order to proclaim sobriety? I still dont have a sponsor and you are kind and sort of in my position. If you can share a bit more of where you stand on this I would be so grateful. Thanks! ,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,d7x3hph,1,t5_2rdsb
9029664,0,t3_53xwhx,From the brief description you have given the most obvious problem you are dealing with is honesty.You are doing drugs and hiding that fact from your parents so you are lying to them.  You are following a set of directions taking medication going to school getting a job saving money based on that lie.  So if you think that doing those things will result in success in any form or fashion you are also lying to yourself.  The idea that you can continue on the path you are on  doing cocaine to the end of the year then going to another rehab under the false pretense of travel to avoid admitting failure to others will probably do more to destroy the relationship between you and your parents than simply admitting defeat now.  You are doing nothing but trying to rationalize continuing your drug use.While it may be difficult for your parents to accept that their prescription for fixing things is not working for you the simple fact is that it is not currently working and so finding another path is crucial to your recovery.  They sound like my own family  very wellmeaning but utterly unfamiliar with addiction and the manifestations of the disease and so the cure they suggested only addressed the symptoms without getting anywhere near the root causes and was therefore ineffective.A couple misconceptions very common to addictsalcoholics that I would like to point out.  The idea that I cant stay cleansober without being in rehab is false.  Were it true millions of former addicts and alcoholics would still be locked away in various rehab and detention centers never to get out.  Also the idea that I cant get to meetings because my schedule is too full is similarly false.  were that true then the millions of recovering addicts and alcoholics who go to school and work and also raise children and do volunteer work and otherwise contribute to society would similarly be unable to make time for meetings and the rooms of AA NA CA and the like would be empty.No I have been in exactly the same spot you are currently in  pretending to others that I am abstinent when in fact I am not pretending to myself that other people are completely fooled by my behavior when in fact they are not.  Pretending that at some mythical future date I would quit drinking and using when in fact my past history showed me unequivocally that I would continue to drink and get high under any and all circumstances unless I dropped all the lies and truly sought help.Either the deceptions and the use and the denial stop today or not at all.  There is no next year or next month or even tomorrow when it comes to quitting.  There is no painless path to putting your life back on track while meanwhile pretending that things have been just fine all along.You can either get off the track you are on or lie to yourself that the trainwreck is approaching.I wish there some easy way out but I searched for years and found none.  And the stories I hear from others who have been in similar circumstances are the same  until they stopped lying to themselves and others nothing worked.Thanks for posting I hope this helps.  Sorry that I could not sugarcoat my answer.,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,d7x81mf,5,t5_2rdsb
9033415,0,t1_d7x81mf,Honesty is not the answer here because it would destroy her relationship with her family and could have adverse consequences for her job.  Absolute honesty as preached by AANA is never a good answer because there are so many wrong views about addiction in our society.  Sometimes lying is a useful abuse reduction tool.  And not giving information to potential abusers is not lying its common sense.  The problem with dishonesty has to do with the intent behind that dishonesty not the dishonesty itself.  The important thing is selfhonesty here.  Certainly some of this deceit is about avoiding dealing with her problems but not all of it.  ,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,d7xo958,-2,t5_2rdsb

10487174,0,t3_5q2wtl,First of all you told us the truth.  Virtually every addict is a liar and when we start being honest it is a step forward.  You should be proud of that.  I usually isolate when I am in my addiction.  It sounds like you dont like being alone and that propels you into your addiction.  Please get out and be around others.  Go to meetings go volunteer where help is needed.  This can be local churches humane society or a charity that needs people power.  Being alone can lead us to brooding about our problems and boredom is not your friend.  Doing small things for others or even yourself makes a big difference in a day.  I used to go to many  step meetings just to be around people that understand what I am going through.  Start working your program of recovery.  Get phone numbers from others in recovery and reach out.  Call when you are having a great day and call when you arent.  This is how you start building a support system.There are many of us that have been through what you are experiencing.  It is OK to ask for help.  It is even necessary.  You have already started by posting your struggle.  Thank you for reaching out with an honest expression of where you are.  Remember that you are learning a new way of living.
