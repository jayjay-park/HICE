217903,0,t1_cf382fo,I took a quality jarrow calmag vit d supplement with some other minerals in substantial or maximum recommended dosage for quite a few years until a dr. i spoke with suggested that something in the long list of preventative supplements i was taking might be causing the migraines. I thought about this very hard but he was actually a dr. I knew personally other wise i would have ignored that. at this point i pulled the plug and did a reset of everything i was taking in I weaned myself off all supplements including the Bone Up and went to a completely restricted diet of basically tomatoes and chicken. So i ate raw tomatoes cooked tomatoes chicken chicken soup... you get the idea.

277155,0,t1_cf96sdm,So thats really interesting because I have... I dont like smoking it because it burns. So I did edibles. I tried about  different times and only had one good experience. The other four times I think I odd as much as that is even possible with weed. I was throwing up time was warped and moving incredibly slow it was super scary. The other three times were just as bad but minus the throwing up. Also Ive tried sativa and indica and one if them makes me feel super paranoid dont remember which one.The other thing about weed is that I cant seem to function like a normal human on pot. Many times I need  the relief when Im working and pot will make me sort of worthless. Ive even tried the pot pills portioned and not only did it not help my pain it just fed up my perception of time and my breathing was really off. If you have any suggestions on what types of weed are better for pain and how to allot the amount so I dont over do it Id be open. Its Rx legal where I live so I could try again. ,migraine,cf9hn80,2,t5_2qr75

Try and learn what you need. Everyones different and you may only need a gram a day to feel good. Or less. Whats important is to buy the good stuff White Widow Jack Herer White Berry etc. Dont get the cheap stuff and look onto some websites to verify the strains you are offered.Take this as seriously as any other medication. You have to find the good stuff pay the price and learn how much you need to live pain free.Ive been using for a year and a half and my life has changed since I have less migraines.Edit  as for the method I use I found out that joints are best for me and vape isnt good at all for migraines with aura or very bad pain.

Its around that time that you finally start to feel the massage part which I will say does feel pretty nice. Its getting through the first part that sucks. It doesnt sting for me like some others have said its more like someone screwing a screw into my scull at the main electrode point in the center of the forehead.

1256885,0,t1_cib05id,I think my problem is mainly in one eye too.  I may try an eye patch for using the computer or watching TV if the problem persists.  Thats a good idea.Appointment went about like I expected.  After a motor function eval and a chat about my normal migraine patterns he basically concluded that this was probably just part  of a larger migraine.  He told me to come back if it persists through the week so if Im still having trouble come Monday Ill make another appointment.  Now the interesting part is that I went straight from there to my eye doctor  optometrist not an ophthalmologist but I figured it was worth a shot anyway.  I got my contact lens prescription updated and that seemed to help a little.  Im still having problems and now Ive got a headache again eye strain? but the weird almostdoublevision thing is at least manageable now I can watch TV without too much trouble and using the computer is almost normal and easy again.

The next set wasnt until I moved across the country and started with a new doctor probably  years later. Six years after that I started seeing a new doctor because my old doctor developed a God complex and the new doc actually advised against additional scans. He said they are used to rule out bleeds tumors etc. if nothing had changed in my pattern and there was no family history or cancer etc then he didnt feel new scans were necessary caveat he had access to the precious scans. All bets are off if the new doc cant see the prior scans.Hope this is helpful!,migraine,cjaq03l,2,t5_2qr75

1944860,0,t3_2gwpg4,I disagree with the standing opinion that theres no nonchemical help at all. Problem with migraines is you have  migraineurs and at least  completely different sets of migraines. Natural things that help me a littleRelaxation techniques like deep relaxation yoga picture seeing auto hypnosis whatever.Drinking a lot of water even if its super hard to force myself. Rehydrate! Water with lemon and salt help.Pickle juice.Absolute darkness and quiet. Cant have a maskecause warmth on my head triggers me and cant have earplugs because then I hear my pulse and breath so agonizingly loudly that I go crazy.Sex i. e. an orgasm helps tremendously but normal sex shakes me around too much any motion is wrong. Feels like my brain is made of pain the consistency of jello and it gets juggled around and smashed into my skull. You might be more helpful eating her out. She might try to fight you before the end because it gets worse before it gets better.If her body intelligence is high it might learn to donwhat mine does most of the time Knock her out while it repairs making her sleep almost unwakeably deeply without moving for about  or even more hours. Shed wake up exhausted and need normal sleep. Ice packs on top of my head are great. Ive heard some like a hot water bottle that would kill me.Eating a little bit helps sometimes but with all the nausea it can be quite a challenge.Tiger balm or peppermint oil on the temples or on the pillow above my head  thar stuff is no fun in the eyes.And it helps me to know somebody cares but at the same time I want to be left alone. So if my wife just pokes her head through the door every hour or so and asks whether I need something if Im awake thats ideal for me.Holding hair when barfing is pure social gold. As is bringing a bucket if the way to the toilet is too hard. Then taking care of the bucket. Softly massaging the temples is good. I guess hands and feet would be nice too but I wouldnt know. Neck and back tend to be knotted but its too easy to grip too hard and cause more pain.But all in all I have to tell you youre great. You believe and dont belittle and care and try to help. My wife has started to do all that only after her first own migraine. Which I wished upon her for obvious reasons. Now its ok I wish she never gets one again because I love her and frankly because its a pain in the butt to care for a migraineur. So kudos to you.,migraine,cknk21j,1,t5_2qr75
1966904,0,t3_2h6uw5,I had two types of triggers  immediate triggers and gradual triggers.  I say had because the triggers still exist but I can manage them effectively.  I drink and love coffee and all my health professionals had mindless responses about how caffeine caused migraines.  In  years I should have a nickel for every time I was told that.  I would quit coffee many times for months and it didnt help.  It must be in every medical textbook under migraine and on every Intro to Medicine  test.My early desperate fix for a migraine and visual disturbances was a large amount of caffeine and OTC pain meds like Excedrin. Ive had doctors tell me that caffeine both caused and treated my migraines and caffeine was always labeled the bad guy.My triggers unlike many others were allergic responses. I react to mold mildews dust and dust mites specific chemical vapors and any foods that contain or raise my histamine levels.  The faster my histamine levels rise the faster the migraine trigger.Now getting to your post  soy is a wellknown food that contains high levels of histamine and also known to cause an allergic histamine response.  Allergies are not created equal and some people have different histamine response.  In my case a large fast rise in histamine would have a faster trigger.  A slow rise seems to have a tipping point so things like mildew would build up and eventually trigger a migraine even though it seemed like nothing changed.In your post you mention a new office job. Something people frequently react to is carpet  or actually the mold and mildew in carpet and sometimes the vapors from new carpet. The carpet can look just fine but you dont see whats growing in the pad underneath. Some offices put carpet over concrete and form breeding grounds. You might not be in an office basement but the building HVAC is recycling all the crap throughout the building and sharing it with everyone.My solution after  years of searching was antihistamines and caffeine.  Sudafed and caffeine by day Benadryl mg by night.  Ive taken Oxycodone mg and still felt pain yet Benadryl dissolves my worst pain in  minutes.  It didnt make sense the first time this happened.You also mention visual disturbances which also drove me nuts. I no longer have them.  Bright flickering lights fluorescent lights that flicker driving into sunlight sunlight on reflected on water sunlight reflected off of snow all that could  but not always  trigger a visual disturbance in me. I had painless ocular migraines where Id have sparkly lightning bolts and a small loss of vision for an hour or two.  It turned out for me that caffeine fixed my visual disturbances quickly  generally in  minutes or less.  It doesnt work for everyone. I drink a large amount of caffeine  enough to make me fidgety.  Yeah Starbucks! People react to different things and our reactions are different.  For me it was allergic responses.  I got a list of common foods that contain or release histamines and recognized triggers I wasnt aware of.  Now I carry antihistamines with me and eat and drink  and live  with impunity.,migraine,ckq7oju,3,t5_2qr75

Theyre either too weak or so powerful I end up in agony from the medicine itself i.e I took one mg Codeine tablet and that was traumatic to say the least...it made my attacks feel insignificantI know the feeling with the pain though  It can vary as you said from dealing with it to curled up wanting to end it.I hope you get your Migraines under control again really appreciate the advice. ,migraine,cngehyu,1,t5_2qr75

2811676,0,t1_cnnmvio,I can only say that if you can find somewhere quiet  then let it out.  Usually this sorts it out for me if I have the energy.  Hopefully knowing that you are not alone makes it not a big deal  and it will just pass in time.  I hide out in my car in the car park for a couple of hours and try to have a quick nap I just got a new car with tinted windows  soooo good for hiding in the back!  People at work know the deal and leave me alone.  In a couple of hours I can be back to work and absolutely fine.Again I am very similar with tip of the tongue accents and actually just not listening when people are talking to me when having an attack.  People at work have seen me with a proper migraine and are really OK with taking it slower if I need it.  More recently I just come out and say Ive got a migraine dont worry about it just bear with me.  I had to do this in a big client meeting on Monday  they were pretty cool about it.  I finished up got to the car and hammered it away so I could be sick.  I find that shutting my eyes when people are talking at me helps but can confuse people who dont know me because they think Im not listening.  Actually Im listening twice as hard!Ive never got any visual distortions.  However the deja vu is interesting.  When I have an attack I get a thought or a song or a sentence locked in my head.  I cant shift it or get out of the loop.  Honestly sometimes I think that this alone makes the migraine worse.  Its usually a line in a song usually a pop song I hate but sometimes its an action that I regret or something I want to do.  I cant get out of the loop I cant get the next line in the song or make some logical decision I just gotta keep repeating whatever it is that is locked.... for hours....  People tell me that is weird so I dont tend to bring it up much.Only just started reading rmigraine I know a few migraine sufferers but we dont tend to talk about it.  whilst I wouldnt wish this on anybody  its nice to know that its not just me if that makes sense?.

2869522,0,t3_2syw6y,I suggest asking to lay down. The first time I had botox done I passed out because I am very squeamish around needles. Now every time I get it done they have me lay down and its a total breeze. It really doesnt hurt much and it goes really fast at least with my doctor. I have been getting botox every  months for about  years now and I dont know what Id do without it. It doesnt take my migraines away but it makes them much more bearable. Only other thing is to give it at least  rounds before deciding whether or not its working for you. Botox builds up in your system over time and becomes more and more effective. Some people dont notice any relief after their first few rounds. I didnt notice much relief until about my rd round of injections. ,migraine,cnu9kgi,2,t5_2qr75

3066789,0,t3_2v98dz,This is such a similar story I have fibromyalgia and I suffer with chronic migraine. So much of this sounds like classic fibrofog to me and yes it does feel like postdrone goes on forever however I think its more likely that you are in the midst of a FM flare up.The clumsiness and poor coordination IBS type symptoms vertigo spasms fatigue exhaustion... these are classic fibromyalgia symptoms. What I will say however is that it may be worth asking about having an MRI if you havent already had one especially as you seem to feel that this episode appears to have been triggered by a severe migraine attack. At the very least this flare up is different.Presumably youve also had a blood test to check your sugar levels owing to the gastroparesis. If not get one booked. Known causes of gastroparesis include diabetes and if your blood sugars are fluctuating it would certainly explain a lot of the symptoms. Personally I find it hard to determine how long my postdrone phases last because my trigger symptoms start up to two hours before my attack then the migraine itself can last several days and then hangover starts. The problem is before that clears the the next migraine has already started! Not to mention I get different types of migraine caused by different things hormonal fluctuations changes in the weather food intolerances hemiplegic migraines probably caused by TIAs... Add to that my fibromyalgia with which I have been symptomatic since the age of  well Im pretty pathetic. I would advise you to try and get in with a pain management team as they will be able to help you devise an individual coping strategy based on your circumstances. They will be able to signpost you to services you may not be aware of for example I receive a lidocaine infusion on repeat to help treat my pain. Its a rare service but good grief has it helped.Migraine on its own is already a widely varying and complex condition. Add in fibromyalgia and youve got a huge battle on your hands. Youre going to need a good support network and that will include medical professionals. Symptomatic treatment is fine but you will also have to start implementing pacing and prevention. Im  and already Ive learned that battling your way through pain doesnt work. It will turn around and bite you in the butt. Granted treatment and awareness has improved so much within the past few years with both conditions but even so now is the time to get to the root cause and then work up. It may take time but it will serve you in the long run. Just keep the people who need to know in the know. I hope this helps in some small way. There are many supportive people on here who are more than willing to offer advice and information. Theres also rFibromyalgia which may help to offer some insight.

3181968,0,t3_2wgx74,Try to trust your doc. I know its hard but theyve prescribed these things because they think the benefit will be greater than the downsides.On the topiramate youll see lots of negative reviews but it really helps lots of people with minimal side effects. Others react badly to it I did but if it doesnt work or is unbearable you can always ask your doc to taper down. Its a preventative medication so it takes a few weeks to a month before youll notice it working.The prednisone is a steroid and works really really well at busting chronic migraines and cluster headaches. The side effects can be really crappy... especially in the first several days but will level out and youll probably see migraine relief after your steroid burst. Some people are migraine free for weeks or months after steroids so its worth a try. Make sure to taper down as instructed or youll be in for a bad withdrawal time. Prednisone can have bad long term side effects but only if you take it for months or more. A steroid burst is unlikely to cause long term trouble like diabetes and osteoperosis or adrenal insufficiency... especially at your age.I dont have any experience with the first drug but Ive seen lots of other migraineurs use it as an abortive when they feel a migraine coming on... its pretty common.,migraine,cort6ij,1,t5_2qr75

3200425,0,t3_2wpeby,Auras can be pretty divers. I dont get deja vus but I get dizzy and something just seems wrong. Its like a dream but not quite. My geometric distinction breaks down completely two just like my brain adds new shapes to the image like triangles or rectangles or bizarre shapes or just omits some. Like faces get a bit distorted and shapes just dont seem to be right. The thing about the aura is that it really depends on where it happens in your brain. The visual cortex is a prominent example for auras you get those scotomas blocking vision flickering and stuff. But the aura can affect other parts too. Some people have auras in the motor cortex unable to feel a limb or move it been there too. Some people cant talk right or start losing the ability to understand spoken language. Im not a doctor or a neurologist but I think if you have the aura in the right place you can have those deja vu like experiences.I wouldnt worry too much. Just do some basic stuff and self checks. Make sure that it doesnt last much longer than an hour. The aura most probably will happen before a migrain so it should be pain free. Make sure you can still talk right and move everything and listen to people. If something feels odd or its different go see a doctor. I cannot repeat this often enough. An aura can be an aura or an aneurism or a stroke. If you have any doubts call a doctor or an ambulance. With these things its better to cry for help without having anything serious than having permanent severe brain damage because you didnt call for help.,migraine,cotq22l,1,t5_2qr75

We went to a doc right away who was afraid it was a stroke. MRI showed everything was fine and my neuro confirmed that this can be a common aura for people with basilar or hemiplegic migraine conditions. Its good youre getting an MRI just in case but you have a diagnosed migraine condition so its most likely that. I get the scary stroke aura when Im in a bad cluster or when my hormones are going up or down drastically that big bad one was postpartum had more when changing birth control or on bad periods. I also get worse aura when Ive been chronically stressed. Im sure youll be ok. Youre doing everything you can working with a doc going for an MRI. If they find something you can go from there.

It sounds like your experience is somewhat the opposite.  In any event I totally realize that everyone reacts differently to different medication and just because a study made a certain conclusion about the general population it doesnt mean that it is true for everyone.  I really didnt mean to either judge or cause a stir about the topic sorry.  Ill update my list to include a fuller discussion of opiates.

The entire thing ends up being horribly complicated given the unique combination of polymorphisms one can have and whether or not they are expressed.The short and sweetGet DNA profile from andme.com  takes about  monthsPlug into other means to get health related info free basic methylation profile     detailed   constantly updated links mutations studies done with your mutations. Promethease and livewello give interesting ways to view your genetic data how rare a mutation you have may be how significant it can be how many studies are linked with it and what they are. Both do things better than the other. Honestly it was worth it to have both in my opinion.If you have a decent amount of methylation heterozygous and homozygous AND have health ailments you can review the pubmed and other studies done concerning those particular SNPs. For broad overview the following are the sources I used to weed through it all and try to formulate a relatively cheap gameplan      this is the simplest way Ive seen it broken down.   relatively informed forums               Yaskos book seems solid enough Im not quite sold on her and her specific supplements and tests.    Youre good at digging. There are plenty of preliminary studies on a lot of the SNPs. Some of the big mutations that are often mentioned are MTHFR CT and MTHFR AC.

4376300,0,t3_3b4ccr,I just had one done a few weeks ago of my brain and neck with and without contrast. There was no issue with my metal fillings first off. It was a closed MRI and I had to lie absolutely still for about  minutes. They gave me padded headphones to listen to Pandora and if you can deal with it ask to listen to EDM or dance music because then the knocking and thuds blend in with the music. About halfway in they pulled me out put a butterfly needle in my arm and injected the contrast and I had no reaction to it. Slid me back in and did the rest of the MRI. I felt absolutely fine during the MRI but I had a hell of a migraine afterwards. Not sure if it was from the knocking or the contrast or just the stress of it all but just be forewarned.

4875893,0,t1_cu94wsh,Theres a few ways. Migraine with aura patients are at a higher risk of stroke when they take a combo pill vs progesterone only. If you have migraines with aura its recommended you be on a mini pill shot injection or IUD only. Some birth control pills have a risk of causing migraines and if youre on a pill when diagnosed with migraines usually they try taking you off of it to see how it influenced it just this week someone posted in migraines about how she had her migraines end when she stopped her birth control pills. Usually the pills that cause migraines have higher amounts of estrogen or an older generation progesterone but there are women who dont follow this rule. Birth control can be a tool to help reduce ovulation and period migraines. Hormone fluctuations can cause migraines so using a newer progesterone method to settle cycles and even use to limit periods to once every  months Is common. ,migraine,cu9584a,3,t5_2qr75

I now wear a sort of stretchy headwrap thing when I am feeling migrainey that keeps my hair against my head which alleviates the weight and keeps it off my neck.

Well it gets worse. Its in a tiny blacked out room. It rotates and you dont know what direction its going in or when it stops. Its bizarre. Then they put a pattern of random dots on the wall and either rotate the pattern or the chair. You can never really tell if youre moving or not. That will make you about to puke in like  seconds. It really helps habituate fast though.At home I watch a few videos on my computer. Full screen. Its several rows of boxes that scroll horizontally or vertically across the screen. Youre supposed to pick a row or column then track each box with your eyes as it enters from the side of your screen then when a new box appears track that one etc. It gets me so nauseated I sweat. Haha. But again it works.More physical exercises include sitting on a big exercise ball staring at a point on the wall and then bouncing up and down for a minute or two. I also rotate my head in full circles making sure to have my eyes track my environment with the movement. There are a lot of athome exercises you can do.

In this country if you dont have a minimum of a BA you are going to be stuck working some crap job for crap wages or busting your hump for good wages in some trade that wont make accommodations for your migraines. A BA will get you a decent job with a decent company or on a management track. I wouldnt even worry about what kind of job right now cause honestly the chances you will end up doing the same job you study for for the rest of your life is minimal. A generic BA or BSc is fine. e.g. I studied EconPSc and ended up running a newspaper. Go figure.Your conditions? Take them one at a time. You dont say what kind of meds you are on. First I would deal with the anxiety and depression. Get something for that. Then make sure you have a good migraine rescue med in a triptan plus some kind of pain killer. Are you on a daily preventative? You will need to try a bunch of different things until you get one that fits you. Have you tried botox? Some people swear by it.If you absolutely need to live on your own perhaps you should look at moving into residence. I know it will balloon your student loans but it doesnt look like you have a lot of other options. But honestly if you can tough it out at home that will be your best option. Remember It will only be for a couple years and then you will graduate get a job and be able to get your own place.

6167992,0,t3_4016tt,My neuro has told me repeatedly EDIT Chronic Migraine is defined by  headaches a month.  This is due to possibility of some presenting as onesided and others being bilateral.  Its kind of a weak symptom check in my mind but there are very few methods for actually assessing symptoms other than patient experience they have difficulty IDing with MRICT andor blood tests.He has stated once you meet this threshold your underlying migraine is considered primary causing and drives other pains associated with headache.The common misconception is that it NEEDS to be one sided or present with Aura.  Those are likely indicators but dont   of the migraine sufferers population.  Ive had both one sided bilateral and aura without following pain.  Its can truly be a crap shoot.  But at your frequency Id recommend talking to your doc or finding a neuro that specializes in migraine.  Also start a journal so your st meeting will include some data.

6186813,0,t3_40baoc,I teach high school. Fortunately they arent as obsessed with strong scents as middle schoolers and like you I explain after the one or two incidents of kids spraying stuff and it isnt a problem. Have you explained to students why you have that strict policy and that you would appreciate their not wearing body spray to your class? Ive managed to make teaching work with a supportive administration but it can get overwhelming at times. Some days I have to leave early but most days I power through with overhead lights off. If you dont have one invest in a cheap floor lamp. I also have a frank conversation with students who are generally understanding when I explain that I cannot raise my voice that day and cannot think clearly to answer all their questions but if they write them down I will get back to them.The hardest part sometimes is keeping up with grading as an English teacher. Sometimes I have a string of four or five days where I just cannot grade anything. Even after the migraine with the hangover my brain is just useless. In those times I get really frustrated and stressed but again I just communicate with students parents and my admin to let them know that I will get things back to them as soon as possible.If the fluorescent lights bother you like they do me you might try Gunnar glasses or something similar.

Anyone who is not also a migraineur or a sympathetic family member in the largest sense of that word has long been absent from my inner circle.I know that if I have a weatherinduced migraine at least half my friends will be incommunicado because we share a lot of the same triggers. We all know that we will not be buying tickets for events in the faraway futurewe generally decline wedding or graduation invitations that involve expenses for the hosts. We know each others food idiosyncrasies. We are loving and gracious with each other and know that a persons absence is not a snub. We find other ways to commune.In one sense the circle of family and friends is limited but being accepted unconditionally and not being blamed or attacked for conditions we cannot control is truly a blessing.

8316218,0,t1_d5h2bor,The oddest thing happened I ate what I thought was tuna packed in water with a simple green salad. If I get hives from a food I can set a timer for  minutes and they will begin popping out on my face and neck and if its really bad they will spread across my torso. I got the really bad version so that sent me to the tuna label and I found soy in the ingredients. Who knew? I am a serious nut case about eating the most natural foods possible due to all my years of migrainesso I looked through my cupboards and was shocked at how many products contained soy specifically soy lecithin. I was sad to see that it was the main ingredient in the nonfat spray that I was using to cook with and also the butter spray I was using on popcorn. So all those products went in the trash.After the closet was purged of soy products the hives stayed away. I had an old pattern in which hives could potentially lead to nausea which could potentially lead to migraines. That cycle I am glad to say seems to be history for me. I never say never but eliminating the soy has been a major improvement for me.As to the chocolateonce I started reading the labels I was just crushed to see that soy was everywhere. When the Enjoy Life brand became available for a while in my Kroger store I bought the chocolate chips and I actually bought a box of their cookies. I hadnt eaten cookies in years so it was a lovely treat. I can yammer on about this topic endlessly so if you have other questions dont be shy.,migraine,d5h30se,1,t5_2qr75

You should call your PCP. If your anxiety is super high it could either be a symptom of the thing thats wrong too. Until you can see your doc try to focus on something comforting present and soothing. A favorite movieTV show soothing music etc. If your vision is making you anxious try something you can do with your eyes closed. Drink gatorade and take some vitamins for your exhaustion preferably complex B vitamins. And something salty probably wouldnt hurt either. Take care dude. I hope everything turns out ok.

I still get other forms of migrainesI could easily be the poster child for the slogan Ive heard repeated over and over Migraines Change. Cervicogenic migraines though are the first ones that I have been able to anticipate so I can prevent their onset. This is truly priceless information for me. The beauty of the cervicogenic diagnosis is that it provides me with a clear trigger and I can prevent most attacks just by paying attention to my body and doing what I need to do to prevent them. Its a little like learning not to step in front of a speeding truck. If you stay out of the way you wont get hit.I still practice all the good habits Ive learned over a lifetime of painsleeping regular hours eating in a way that keeps me healthy drinking plenty of water and getting electrolytes staying out of the sun wearing sun protection and sunglasses and hats or visors taking supplementsand keeping my rescue meds an arms length away. Its all part of the package.And I get to choose the members of my medical team. My physical therapist is there as a backup and my doctor pcp will give me a referral to the p.t. on my sayso I dont need to see pcp first.

While not exclusive the fact that you have a single side that hurts tells me that you are likely correct in thinking you are having a migraine. Good plan getting the CT. It is good way to see whats going on inside. Id suggest going to a neurologist. My GP tried to help yet only ended up giving me bad information. Life changed for the better once I found my neuro.

I am on the days weeks and months scale.Next is hearing loss Long term the hear loss is regular and progressive with menieres. that means it doesnt get better after the attack is over. VM can be irregular and can fluctuate. While there can be permanent hearing loss. You dont always have hearing loss as a symptom. But majority of hearing loss is sudden. Unlike the gradual loss seen with menieres. My VM I dont always get ear fullness and lost now. but it does still occur  of the time. and sometimes I have ear pressure and loss without vertigo.But the biggest differances is auras.  if you have auras then its migraine. Thats usually how I can tell ones coming. In fact during the diagnosis process I didnt even realize that I was having auras. I went through  ENTs before I got the one that said its VM.

Im sorry to say this about people who spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and many many years on an education but many doctors dont know what they dont know. Its taken me seeing seven doctors and multiple CT scans and MRIs before anyone even mentioned the possibility of migraines. From what I understand though a CT scan is not sensitive enough to pick up what might be causing your symptoms. I think theyre more used to look for vascular problems. Doctors ordered them for me after a car accident to check my chest for internal bleeding and when they suspected my numbness was due to a stroke. An MRI might be better to make sure there isnt a tumor or lesions in your brain. Sounds like you need a doctor that can look at things with a fresh set of eyes who wont be so dismissive though.

I am  and have been on and off medication for migraines since I was . Were there meds I needed to stop because they made everything worse? Certainly. Did I have to stop medications because they didnt even make a dent? Sure. Have I gotten into the nasty cycle of medication overuse headaches because I was popping ibuprofen like tic tacs and taking immetrex for my chronic daily migraine because I thought I had no other options? You betcha. However what helped in all those cases was a new preventative or a steroid dosepak to get me out of the MOH headaches. I have drastically changed my lifestyle I am meticulous in my diet to avoid triggers and see a therapist for stress management and sleep management.

10223590,0,t3_5m9w31,I love mine. I always have tons of tension in my forehead which makes it really difficult to sleep out a migraine or just plain sleep but if I put on my cephaly  minutes before I go to sleep I can usually relax enough to start to fall asleep. As others have said I havent seen any decrease in the number or severity of migraines but it is wonderfully relaxing and a very useful alternative to just waiting for my painkillers to set in. Ive had days where I just keep it going for a few hours at a time probably not recommended as my eyes twitch like nuts after a long session like that and it keeps me more or less sane and functional. I can answer emails and the fog seems to dissipate a bit while I have it on. My migraine generally comes back pretty much fullforce about  minutes later though so you decide how useful it is. I find the  for electrodes a fine deal when I remember the sanity and clarity I can gain in the middle of a migraine with it. Side note I have the old cephaly I. I dont know how the cephaly II differs but Ive heard its lighter and you can ramp up much faster maybe? I dont know. I dont plan on spending a ton on the new one as the old one works great for me right now.,migraine,dc2wg97,1,t5_2qr75

But I agree with you on allergies I think theyre playing a much larger part in everything than what every doctor Ive been to is saying. I dont know where I would exactly look into this deeper though or what youre implying I do. I was planning on moving like I mentioned above to rule the cat allergy out.And as for abortive drugs I googled that and found nothing of relevance.

10366545,0,t3_5o5ki1,Theres def a serotonin connection with cluster headaches so Id imagine it could play a role in migraines too.  If youre a woman who has a menstrual cycle youre at a much higher risk for migraines than a man.  That tells me that hormones play a huge role in the development of migraines.  Hormone changes can also trigger serotonin highs and lowswhen your estrogen levels dip during PMS week your serotonin dips with it often triggering symptoms like migraine insomnia amp moodiness.

10475314,0,t1_dcvbhly,Your blowing this way out of proportion. I just looked at my hospital discharge papers they gave me  micrograms of fentanyl citrate via IV. Im aware its deadly if one was messing around with it this is the problem with the current heroin epidemic in the United States because its often laced with unknown amounts of fentanyl causing ODs. This was given in a controlled setting by the ER and was already in liquid form. Its not like they are mixing powder with saline solution in the room with my wife amp I. It was given because the ER doctor felt the advantages of it outweighed the risks of it being administered. They dont give me fentanyl everytime I go sometimes they use tordol an NSAID instead with the same  other drugs Diphenhydramine benadryl amp zofran for nausea. I still fall asleep from the benadryl amp wake up a few hours later amp typically its finally gone. I would never shoot myself over a migraine Ive been getting them since I was  years old.

10607917,0,t3_5rtr2b,Yes you need a neuro that listens if you have one but odds are you didnt need a neuro at all much of the basic stuff can be done with your family doc if theyre willing. Having a basic neuro exam is one thing but imaging because of how costly it is is often not a firstline thing. Topamax can be shitty but if you read the accounts you also probably read that its been awesome for a lot of people. Id suggest grabbing the sidebar list logging if you arent and making another appt. wyour regular doc. You dont mention what else you take but if youre taking stuff daily or nearly so researching MOH is also a good idea. Take all of your research to your family doc. If you trust them tell them that and that youd prefer to work through this with them if they are willing. In addition to the log a habit diary will be useful. You mentioned being on the pill some research into that if you have not yet is a good idea too as some of them can make migraine worse. ,migraine,dda4ip5,10,t5_2qr75
10613606,0,t3_5rtr2b,I agree with ukalayna you dont necessarily need a neuro but you do need to find a more empathetic doctor. I try to stay away from big hospitals they tend to be too busy to deal with chronic cases or at least they were with me. I thought I would get more educatedspecialized help but it always was more impersonal rushed and they were more frustrated with me showing up with an illness I had for years that hasnt killed me yet to them that meant not life threatening so not that serious. I had my best luck at a private pain practice where they only saw chronic patients so they knew exactly how to deal with me. They told me I likely got bad service because its not easy to treat chronic pain patients its more like a long study they may not have even known how to help since it isnt covered extensively in school but its most likely not what they signed up for so they try to rush you out with some pain drugs to try.  All prescription drugs have nasty side effects unless its a sugar pill. If you want to go the drug route you are going to have to weigh your options take the chance and stick to it for a little bit to see if it works. A good empathetic doctor might be able to help you figure out a way to change things in your life to try to battle migraines more naturally avoid triggers diet etc but that will require you take very good notes so you can share a detailed summary of who you are and what your lifestyle is like when you visit them. I take long form notes and then made a bullet point list of some talking topics on a separate sheet of paper so I can discuss it and remember everything when I meet a new doctor otherwise I seem to blank out from being nervous and the appointment feels worthless. Finding a great doctor is really hard but when you do its very comforting. Good luck!,migraine,ddapnxh,1,t5_2qr75

10879842,0,t1_de1srxz,I did not intend to overwhelm you but in order to find out if he has any diet triggers your son has to read every label diligently. In the end he may not have any diet triggers. I stopped eating out at restaurants with the exception of an organic farm to table restaurant. I bring my own food or not eat at all at social functions. I understand that can be especially hard for a  year old boy and I hope he will learn to understand that food is not worth the headache but sadly you wont know if he is sneaking in processed snacks at school or at friends.I agree with not drinking commercial iced tea during an elimination diet. Majority of them contain artificial sweeteners like potassium acesulfame. I found out to my dismay that Bigelow tea puts the artificial sweetener stevia in their teas without putting it on the label. I had to go to their website to figure that out. If he really wants tea I would recommend getting the loose tea leaves from health or organic food stores and steeping it in cold water overnight in the fridge. I recommend english breakfast or gun powder for the desired iced tea taste. Downside is that there is caffeine in teas and they can have more than soda.

I still get ice pick headaches every few hours and the longer the day goes on the more the constant chronic pressure comes back but I definitely feel better in the morning and early afternoon than I have in a long time. I go to the gym a lot so I think Im just gonna have to stop surviving on nothing but the cookies and cakes that are always in the break room and eat real food so my concern about weight gain is probably just one of those momentary freakouts.

11616736,0,t3_65rzmc,I genuinely cant offer any help but I wish you all the best with your pregnancy and general migrainerelated health both during and post pregnancy. I cant imagine what that must be like. Good luck and best health to you!,migraine,dgcrmse,8,t5_2qr75
11621185,0,t1_dgcryot,Im using Headache Diary Pro on Android. Its pretty useful for logging migraines.,migraine,dgd9t4w,1,t5_2qr75
11622389,0,t1_dgdci7u,Hard to say. Possibly stress.  Possibly too much drinking.  Or maybe some other reason.,migraine,dgdeq78,1,t5_2qr75

11643010,0,t3_661zxi,Ive had so many brain scans all of them normal.  But if I had a brain scan for every migraine that lasted forever my head would glow.  My neuro only orders them when something new and extra troubling pops up.  Perhaps see if they can shoot some magic meds into your through an IV before they irradiate you again?  Also if you dont have a good long term neurologist perhaps look into that too the ERED isnt a substitute for a headache specialist andor primary care doctor.   ,migraine,dgfqyvl,1,t5_2qr75

11764857,0,t1_dgtaxrk,Came here to say this! Im a big big tea drinker but I mostly drink herbal and green tea which are lower in tannins but Ive had to give up black tea especially bagged black. Gave up red wine too since its higher in tannins than white. FWIW my migraine app specifically asks me if Ive had tannins that day so it must be a pretty common thing. ,migraine,dgtkrdc,3,t5_2qr75

11784950,0,t3_685ap3,I went to a third party Dr. Told my neurologist about it and she thought it was a great idea. I just got my card this week. I had to bring in three office notes from my dr with in the last year. There is a way to do it if you dont have office notesvisits but having mine made it really easy. Only took me one week to get my card from the time of my apt.  Good luck ,migraine,dgvv2qf,2,t5_2qr75
