4857359,0,t3_3hb0td,Almost every Bikeshop will allow you to fill up your tires free of charge.I know two mechanics in my neighborhood that have hoses with compressed air outside their shop so you can fill up at any time of the day. One would be in the Konradstrae between Goethe and Kirchstrae. The other in Erwinstrae corner Turnseestrae.Then there is the Fabrik Habsburgerstrae between the gasstation and Aldi where they have a pump to prop their door open during working hours which you can use if you need to. If you need to repair anything on your bike but dont know how and what tools to use you can always go to the Fabrik  Selbsthilfewerkstatt on working days between  and  pm where they will show you what you need to do and let you use their tools as much as you want. ,FRcycling,cu6t1um,3,t5_32twc
