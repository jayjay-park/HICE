9891076,0,t1_daw3sk0,I want to sell at cost because theyve just been sitting in storage.  with all the stuff included? I forgot this in the OP but I also have  th anniversary summer. Im not sure I want to part with the pin for much less than what the one on eBays going for but Ill think about it. And the archives situation does suck. Maybe if a couple people find a way to email the right person at CC they could be persuaded to put up Kindle editions? Considering all the attention theyve paid so far to a small fanbase I wouldnt be surprised. Those books are too good to be so rare.Edit if you get the fan books too you can have the pin. I think  in all is fair for that,LittleTailBronx,dawtwf8,1,t5_31q09
