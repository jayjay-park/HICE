1457952,0,t3_2attsk,Im in NDT in that area and I believe all three major companies may be hiring. I know TEAM does rope access but you may need to relocate to get that. Most of the work on this area is pipeline and fab shop requiring a lot of travel and time away from home. All three companies will hire a green hand  and give you training. You need to obtain your level certs. If youre looking for an education before you go into NDT I would look up Hellier NDT Spartan College and Ocean Core. None of those schools are in the area though. ,nondestructivetesting,ciz12lf,1,t5_2z29u

5642864,0,t3_3r4zii,For training purposes I dont use a flow chart although it would be pretty to make one and I like the idea.  Maybe Ill work on one unless you already have started on this project... If so let me see what you have so far.I use a process called differential diagnosis which is a method to eliminate as many things as possible then interpret what you have left. For example on a typical radiograph of a piping weld the following is observed  A dark narrow jagged line resembling a lightening bolt which is positioned in a longitudinal direction in the center of the root. A.  Direct interpretation would lead you to classify the indication as a crack or cracklike.B.  Using differential diagnosis or Indirect interpretation would eliminate porosity slag or tungsten inclusions because they are round or irregular in shape.  Slag lines could be eliminated because even though they appear linear they are often intermittent and have some density changes.  Incomplete penetration could be eliminated since the image of one or both pipe bevels can be seen which are viewed as straight lines in the root area. A transverse crack can be eliminated because this indication is longitudinal. Incomplete fusion can be eliminated because is usually occurs at a fusion zone between passes or along a bevel.  The only indication left is a crack.,nondestructivetesting,cwwjvfh,2,t5_2z29u
6690781,0,t1_d0bawn8,Yes sorry INTRA is probably closer to what I meant.Basically company certs are only good for that particular company. ,nondestructivetesting,d0bdvxo,1,t5_2z29u
8057247,0,t1_d4lmgr7,I could see there being that many. Especially with the was being just like asnt in the regards of fail asany times so we can get the most money out of you possible,nondestructivetesting,d4lplbh,1,t5_2z29u
8285345,0,t3_4syq2g,Well if you have any OJT that would help. Not much you can really do other than study. I dont know what don bosco is but if they have a course worth a damn then you should be able to pass an employers test especially right after graduation. and which company?,nondestructivetesting,d5d86dt,1,t5_2z29u

9207064,0,t1_d8it71w,I would say not consistent. Turnarounds are usually scheduled for  year intervals depending on the industry equipment and product being made. Oil and gas processing requires more corrosive chemicals so basic inspection needs to done on a routine daily basis while turnarounds are scheduled for the very thorough inspection and maintenance. I would say pipeline is a bit more variable with last minute inspection and repair needs. My company has a few offices that all they do is cover TAs. They travel the country and world to all different refinerys doig TAs. You can stay on the circuit as long as youd like. TAs usually have a day and night shift  hours long and  days a week. They last anywhere between  week to a couple months depending.,nondestructivetesting,d8j2be1,1,t5_2z29u
