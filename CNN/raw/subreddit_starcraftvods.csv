100530,0,t1_cepop44,Haha thanks for the feedback. I definitely agree the sound isnt balanced. This was the first cast of the night so I had a few minor adjustments to do. As for the black space I do that on my videos occasionally. It is intentional. Sometimes especially in VoDs that are advertised as rushes people will use the time stamp to spoil the match for themselves. Its just a little trick I mix in on occasion  I will admit its a bit longer than I had initially intended but it wasnt worth reuploading just to fix D Thanks so much for the feedback!!!Is your name a reference to the Stone of Tear from the Wheel of Time novels? ,starcraftvods,cepvjq6,1,t5_2scxx
