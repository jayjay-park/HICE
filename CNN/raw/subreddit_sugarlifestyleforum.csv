3589602,0,t3_30xtxq,As an SB I can say that I definitely do not expect the guys on SA to be of average income for the area. I expect them to be making an above average income or have considerable wealth regardless of their location. First they need to be doing pretty well for themselves to afford even a practical allowance for one SB. Second I dont want my SD to be giving such a large portion of his income to me that Id feel guilty about it. I want him to be making enough money that my allowance is only a small part of that. He doesnt need to be a millionaire but he cant be spending almost all of his disposable income just on me.,sugarlifestyleforum,cq1fxlv,3,t5_320gp

Im also horrific at monogamy so I dont enter any relationships of any kind now without saying that Im not very good at commitment and likely wont be able to.

Other times I am looking to mentor someone give a helping hand with finances tech toys or what ever to help her out.   There are occasions when I am looking for an emotional connection someone who I hold and cuddle with  simply enjoy her body next to mine.  Then there are times when I need someone with a flexible schedule I can trust and have a heart warming sensual moment when words are not needed and I just want to make her smile and she makes me scream her name.  Unfortunately there are times I meet a woman who are all those things and the lines between Sugar and full blown Mistress is erased.   Since Im married those women tend to temporarily hold the keys to my heart and I eventually have to sabotage the arrangement because eventually it goes beyond  at some point to regain my grip on reality.    Why do I do it?  I like to give... and ultimately I like to receive what I am craving.  Note  Confession of a Married SD.

4532559,0,t3_3d5hq8,Good ideas! Though I would caution against the OPI set since the OPI mini bottles have a really crappy brush compared to the full size and get goopy a lot quicker but thats just personal preference. Butter London or Deborah Lippman are also more high end nail polishes that many girls would appreciate. Chocolate is always a good idea maybe something to pick out together at a Chocolatier to get an idea of an SBs tastes. I agree that I can never have enough walletclutches. Kate Spade is a classic Michael Kors also makes pretty nice things in that price range. You cant go wrong with neutral colors black navy a light blushnude color these go with everything.Id like to plug spa gift cards. Theyre the absolute best gift I could be given to pamper myself. I love love love a good massage yet rarely splurge on myself. Plus most massages offer a wide variety of services massage facials manipedis some even have salons so Im sure most SBs could find an indulgent service they enjoyed. My amazon wishlist has some SpaFinder gift cards on it as they can be used at many spas in the US. Edited to add more things I thought of a nice sheet set. Sounds silly but I upgraded to  thread count sheets and theyre the best thing ever.Someone in another thread suggested Ray Ban sunglasses. Theyre about  and a nice gift. Plus who doesnt need sunglasses this time of year? A former SD bought me some nice pricey panties. Not strictly lingerie but like everyday wear panties that were just super high quality.

4649422,0,t3_3em4rb,The OPs situation is something that I can relate to. Sites like SA are geared towards a certain type of value proposition which is giving the option of a younger attractive woman to an older wealthy man. However financial arrangements encompass more than that dynamic. You have guys that who can pull attractive women but are willing to pay for nostringsattached. You also have guys who can pull nice looking women but want to experience their dream girl. Then you have guys that are looking for nothing more than a call girl.Regardless when you are in your s a lot of the pricing that women propose in the bowl doesnt add up to the value it would bring to you. For a  year old man it may be perfect but it just doesnt make sense for a younger attractive man to pay that much.What I intend to do is proposition women in the real world. IMO nonestablished SBs would tend to value a young attractive man that offers them a moderate amount. Many of the women in the sugar bowl have their sights set on making a certain amount and will only accept that amount regardless of how appealing the guy actually is. I would believe that nonestablished sbs would mentally have a sliding scale on how much money they would need to sleep with a certain guy based on his attractiveness,sugarlifestyleforum,ctgmenj,6,t5_320gp

Did some local touristy things since he was also new to the area. Did some shopping covered. Tried some fun restaurants. I received a lump sum that is in the ballpark of what most girls here ask for a months allowance. We did a second trip where we travelled together cross country for about  days. I received the same allowance on this trip which I felt was very reasonable because I got more out of this trip. I had never seen the beauty of the Rockies or the sun setting on Salt Lake City. I shot my first gun went wheeling through the desert of Oregon. I stayed at some very nice hotels ate some awesome food and we had some good quality time together.

The majority of SDs want the benefits of a relationship minus the full commitment relationship drama and complications.

I take issue with the idea that someone can dictate what I can and can not do as an adult in my private life  especially when it comes to sugar where common courtesy can go out the window ghosting etc.Most of the time I prefer to be with just one person if they can meet my needs but other times it can be fun to have variety.

You seem to know the right things to say but youre saying them all in a row without anything personal its pretty clear that you looked up what to say in an SB profile and posted it. I would make it more personal like what you like to do in your spare time what you studied in school or what subjects you liked in school and more about what your ideal arrangement is. Less about the ideal man and more about the ideal arrangement. say youre looking for a companion a friend a mentor etc. Unless youre just looking for NSA without all that in which case stick to NSA.

These men try to disguise what they really wanta prostitue. Not that there is anything wrong with that it is just different.  These men are typically the ones who have nothing to lose they are young single and are not in a high profile career where their reputation is at stake. Unlike a SD the SD is entitled and has no respect for when a woman says no. He constantly pushes his SBs comfort zone to get what he wants. SDs will grow closer to their SB and do more for her while the SD will become more distant and greedy as he realizes he can do less and less while still receiving the same. When confronted SDs are defensive and deny the existence of genuine SDs.

I do enjoy meeting people but I like to get to know them a bit first before any sort of sexy time!

Is there anything in my city that you have not seen and are interested in visiting? I would very much like to enjoy your company and get to know you further. This shuts down lots of hooker lookers. By asking what kind of arrangement they are interested in men like this think its code for how much will they pay.

Condom is not a panacea against STDs.  It has very high failure rate as a contraceptive both virus and bacterial are much smaller than sperms so can get through the barrier much more easily. Regular testing is a good idea even if using condoms. A safer practice than condom is finding a real SD who is willing to be in a longer term sugar relationship with you asking him to show you his test results andor asking him to pay for your test can be among the first steps for him to show his commitment to you.,sugarlifestyleforum,d1vm6f4,1,t5_320gp

7373743,0,t1_d2fuuxt, k is quite reasonable for weekly meets. The meets should be short  hrs. The pattern I was referring to is based on my analysis of the regional allowance threadformulating a bedroom apartment rule in the process.The rule says that you can reliably project a typical short  hrs or so PPM or weekly meet allowance rate for a city by consulting the cost of renting onebedroom apartment in the downtown area of that city. I did not myself offer any good explanation for this rule but a lot of other members did so quite well. Here is the threadTo make this work for you areatype numbeo your city  in your google search engine.Cost of living your city name should come up as your top link.Click on the link and scroll down to Apartment  bedroom in City CentreDivide that number by  to estimate the fair PPM value.For example according to numbeo a centrally located onebedroom apartment in Philadelphia PA will rent for about  which should also be a typical  shorts meets per month allowance for the area. This translates into about  per meet. So I think this is what you should aim for and then scale it back to  k given that this is what you would be happy with if needed.Also note no matter how much you need and whatever the cost of living is if a market is saturated as appears to be the case in most northeast rates will fall. econ .I wish you luck.

This was an ugly experience for you but if you are diligent and watch for the signs it doesnt have to happen again!Also if this was the first time you had sex I would recommend a much much steeper allowance to bareback.

Nobody should be expected to be held to a minute reply window but it is about priorities and not playing games.  If someone is interested they will get back promptly  maybe as soon as work is out for the day done with a meeting class etc. It also depends on the nature of the conversation.  A general hello how is your day can have more leeway in replying.  For me it is  hours.  After that I presume they are not interested.If we are in the middle of a conversation and a question is put out there a couple of hours tops is the window.The above is more for POT status SRs.

Please tell me if Im going to far or Im incorrect but it seems that youre just looking for a way to get out of this relationship. I know what Im about to say will sound a bit weird but just trust me. You keep pointing out that shes elite hot are you perhaps uncomfortable with how attractive she is? While most people say that they would definitely fuck an insanely hot person if they had a chance if faced with a situation where they can they cant. This might be happening to you or Im being a dumbass who likes to be an Internet therapist. Since it seems like youre most likely going to dump her just tell her that a situation has changed in your life and unfortunately you can no longer see her anymore. Tell her that you enjoyed you time together. Make sure to do this over text. Then block and delete her number. Stay off of her social media and get on with your life. If you see her in public and she causes a scene you put on the best performance of you life pretending that you have no clue who the hell she is.

Since I typically dont do long distance so theres usually no worry about compensating her for an inordinate amount of travel time and I usually meet at a Starbucks instead of a fancy restaurant so that spending a lot of time getting dolled up isnt something she has to do. Even though the coffee place is usually nearby her like less than  blocks since I would go out of my way to meet her instead of the other way around.Heck some times for her to get there I offer a credit card number for an Uber ride and back or send an Uber to her and back and the part that irks me is even after all of that she gets all selfentitled expecting money just to chat over coffee like its WhatsYourPrice.com and a real date. And sometimes this is even after she drops the oh and I only do platonic. No sex where in my profile and our texts ahead of time were pretty explicit on what would be expected on both sides. So I am TOTALLY with you on the baitandswitch thing  I feel your pain!As to the money part I usually will discuss allowance amounts in general ahead of time but monthly amounts arent given until after PPM sessions where chemistry intimacy and trust is assured.

Youre a Tumblr fake. An SB posts about enjoying sex with her SD? Shes downvoted by the prudes.To me it comes down to there being a lot of immatureemotionally unbalanced people on this sub. I dislike the fact that we have to pander to the lowest common denominator because we cant have frank open discussions without someone getting called a salt daddyjohn or a fakeescort excusing those ladies who have identified as SBs and escorts. Is the answer to ban multiple topics? Maybe but it isnt the sort of solution I would personally want to see.,sugarlifestyleforum,d54unki,6,t5_320gp

8566070,0,t1_d6bvuhi,Im beginning to wonder if youre a troll. Assuming you are notgt Finally part of being an SB is convincing the man that its fun to be with him. But its not. Thats why you have to pay for it. See what happens if you stop paying. You will stop getting what you want. That should make it clear to you what is really going on.If this is what you truly believe in your heart youre going to have a hard time in the sugar world because both you will be unhappy and so will your SDs. What youre describing isnt the sugar lifestyle. Perhaps its escorting and even there I have my doubts.Good SBs dont convince a man that its fun to be with him they have fun with him and theres no convincing needed. You seem to think good SBs are pretending  theyre not. The sugar is what lets things happen its not something that makes up for a lack of attraction but makes up for the time the SB wont be working the effort she puts into the relationship and to be on her best behavior and as a sweetener that lets the SD come out on top when shes deciding who shes going to spend her limited time with. If attraction werent an issue and it is as you describe SLF wouldnt be filled with threads of both SBs and SDs bitching about not being able to find a match and having to go through dozens of POTs to find someone that worked for them.If a SD stops paying and stops getting what he wants dont assume its the SB thats not interested. I have a SGF  were I to stop paying yes Id stop getting what I want because shed be forced into working full time and it wouldnt be worth it for her to pay hundreds in airfare every month to visit and shed easily be able to land a guy who would support her instead of a deadbeat nonpaying splenda daddy. But that would be about finances not attraction.In a nutshell if you dont actually likewant to be with your SD youre going to fail in sugar. Money is immaterial  to this. Real SDs will pick up on your dislike of them and move on  quickly  to someone that wants to have fun in the sugar bowl with them.,sugarlifestyleforum,d6cc6cw,3,t5_320gp

Sometimes SBs get so caught up in merely reaching a certain financial threshold call it X they forget that there are real people playing in this field.  Certainly you should aim to accomplish what you feel you need to but being open minded and genuinely taking an interest in your SD if you feel the chemistry is there can pay bigger down the road.  A good example  I was with one SB for a while on an agreed upon monthly allowance.  Out of the blue one day shortly after she got her allowance she called our arrangement off saying she got the money she needed for her goals and to take care.  She may not have really liked me clearly the case so good for her for moving on but I was about to double her allowance because I just got a promotion at work.  The time we spent together was fun and looking back she really wasnt that into me so I am glad I did not pony up the extra cash.  But she never was open minded to building a sustainable SR that could last more than a couple of months  she looked at the SR as merely a cash register and feigned interest in me.  That was in my earlier SD days and I made many mistakes and learned much  its led me today to focus more on genuine interest between the  of us and it works out better than anyone can imagine.,sugarlifestyleforum,d6iwrt7,2,t5_320gp

8771646,0,t3_507gq9,If the credit card is on some stranger name rather than his then its likely fraud. He either registered that card with someone elses name then put your name as one of the authorized user of the account. If you use it and the account holder doesnt pay it back. The bank that issued that credit card will try to get in touch with the account holder. If he or she denies to open such account then they will open an investigation as to who opened the account and who is spending the money. Chances are you will get a lot of heat for the fraudulent activity. He doesnt need to know your SSN to authorize you as a user for a credit card all he needs is your full name. If the account holder is anything other than his full name then it is likely to be fraudulent. If the credit card has a high limit why cant he just call the credit card company and have the credit limit on the card decrease? ,sugarlifestyleforum,d724dwc,6,t5_320gp

This will give you a chance to chat with folks involved in kink and do it in a nonsexual setting most munches are held in a private room in a restaurant or other public venue. You can ask questions and get referrals if you want to explore your interests. The Ds community can also give you very valuable tips on screening partners as well as telling you who to stay away from i.e. dangerous wannabe Doms who think BDSM is an excuse to abuse their partner.  www.fetlife.com usually has the best listing of local munches for any particular area.

I think you should allow yourself to settle emotionally a bit then take stock of your thoughts and feelings. Also when I was new the fear of the older man was still quite strong.

As a good gfSBfwbpartnerwhatever label here I always aim to make him think make him laugh and make him a little horny. Youve got to be able to engage him in conversation even if its something that might not be of interest to you. Youve gotta be confident and you also have to be committed. Stand your ground and dont let anyone take advantage of you. Youve got to be street smart to keep yourself safe while also most importantly being someone your SD thoroughly enjoys being with. Every guy is different. Some will be really chatty and you just have to listen and laugh at his jokes. Some will be more quiet and may be shy at first.

8947691,0,t3_52rnd8,Thank you. I think this tracks what some of us have been seeing anecdotally.A lot of legit SDs and SBs are leaving the site as a lot of new people have joined that have no clue what a sugar daddy or a sugar baby is. One of the best methods for searching has been looking for SDsSBs who are recently active but have an older join date.They changed the wording in the allowance part to lifestyle expenses a while back. Now when people join they just put in high or substantial without understanding what that means. Its amusing especially when you see it on a profile where someone says they earn k annually.Id consider myself a more traditional sugar baby. My ideal arrangement would be to be someones mistress. They take care of me financially and I devote my time outside of study to making sure that everything in life just works for them. Looking for that on SA right now is impossible. Even guys who have been looking for that in the past are now going  and meet me at X hotel. Im sorry but theres no time for me to make any kind of emotional connection and no time for me to get to know that person so I can actually take care of them more than just physically. It just really peeves me because they do actually want an escort but they dont like thinking about actually hiring one. And you can try to turn them off that mentality by having requirements that you actually meet for coffee etc but in reality thats not what most are after.I think the site is pretty toxic too. Like its starting to damage the brand. Like people make offers that I might be comfortable with accepting in person but because its come through on the site and theres so much bullshit and drama there that you think eh its probably not real anyways why bother.I think freestyling is now where its at if youre looking for someone genuine who will take care of you if you take care of them.

9254215,0,t3_574v4e,Caffe Reggio is lovely  Macdougal St.lots of little nooks especially to the back and left. They are openly until am most nights. FIKA has many locations but the one I like the best is its Tribeca location at  Washington St. Its open until  most days and you can usually find seating. They also have a wine bar. I think the ones at  th Ave. amp  Lexington Ave. have more seating. Ive met the owners amp interviewed the chocolatier the Tribeca location is also their chocolate factory so you can see his marvelous creations. I love supporting them. Kaffe  is also in Tribeca at  Greenwich St  Irving Farm Coffee RoastersI adore the location at  Gramercy because its homey and feels like NYC to me and not manufactured. I used to meet my ex who worked at The Nation there after work and even though its tiny we never had an issue finding a table. Sugar Hill Cafe is in my neck of the woods at  W. th St. Its cute. Added bonus if the MampG goes well and you want to spend a little more time together but not sextime you can take a walk afterward down to st to see Alexander Hamiltons house amp see a tour in the daytime or climb up the steps to City College and get a greet view of both the neighborhood and the NYC skyline to the south. Its a great place to sit a chat. French Roast Cafe another latenight spot is less cozy but roomy. Two locations  Broadway at th and  W. th St. at th Ave.Third Rail Coffee has more seating than youd expect for the East Villageat  nd Ave. Sugar Cafe is a place I love best veggie burgers in NYC IMHO and its more dinery than coffee shop but you walk in to a case full of pastries and chilled gelato so it works. When the weather is nice they open all the walls full plateglass windows so the entire place is openair. And its an amazing location for people watching or going to sit in one of the pocket parks after.  Allen St. basically the SE corner of st Ave and HoustonThe Library at the Nomad is a hidden gem and one of my favorite. After pm you have to be a guest to go in. Ive been know to hang out at one of the other bars there just to see if someone will let me in! Anyhow if you can get a time that works for you and call them to verify that the Library is open to nonguests on that day at that time get the name of the person you talked to in case there are any issues to avoid embarrassment this would be my top choice.  Broadway at th St.Rankings. Library at the Nomad. Caffe Reggio. Sugar Hill Cafe. Irving Farm Coffee Roasters . French Roast Cafe UWS. FIKA Tribeca . Sugar Cafe . French Roast Cafe West Village.

9416048,0,t1_d999o4k,Its doubtful the real economy has been getting better for the middle to lowerincome people since . The much cited improving medium household income number in  may well have been the result of declining divorce rate people cant afford to divorce and millennials not just kids in their s but also people in their early s now failing to move out of their parents basements. Both trends result in lower new household formation and statistically more income earners in the same old households with the very very old shuffling off the mortal coil at normal rate eliminating some very low income households not being replaced by new low income households headed by youngsters just joining workforce. Hence improving medium household income its  the mirror image of declining medium household income in previous decades due to divorces splitting income of one household into two households.. The much cited dropping rate of uninsured among the middle class and the poor actually result in lower disposable income in their pockets after paying for the insurance something that they did not pay previously and still could get healthcare at emergency rooms anyway. So the net effect of program has been a newincreasing tax on the middle class and the poor. Chief Justice Roberts was ironically correct in pointing out that Obamacare is a tax law.. Massively increasing government deficit spending starting in  and  artificially drives up GDP number and consequently per capita GDP number however the inflationary effect of such deficit spending hit the middle class and the poor much harder they spend higher percentage of their income buying consumable goods that go up in prices or shrinking packaging a phenomenon often neglected by the BLS data collectors and they have less exposure to the capital markets that benefit from new money creation.  Government deficit spending is literally crowding out individual choices in the market place we know the lack of efficiency and deleterious effect of government bureaucratic choices vs. individual choices.. The drastic decline in the restaurant industry this past year is highly indicative of declining disposable income among Americans.  I had a pet theory that the jump in the restaurant sector in  was partially derived from the rapidly expanding sugar phenomenon as was the Apple iproduct craze.  Now both seem to have become passe.. If the middle class and the poor were indeed experiencing rapidly improving living standards we wouldnt be witnessing so many riots rising crime in major cities and general discontent in the past  months.. The newly enacted minimum wage laws have the interesting effect of preventing the young from getting their first jobs so they have to stay with parents preventing new household formation therefore benefitting medium household income statistic . . . if them sitting on their hands eventually result in them committing crimes the incarceration cost runs up GDP much more than their productivity in their first jobs so GDP and per capita GDP will also go up as a result of the law forcing some youths into prisons instead of going to their first jobs.

SDs are not paying for sex.  Theyre paying for an arrangementrelationship the time and companionship and affection of a beautiful young woman that under normal circumstances probably wouldnt even give them the time of day.  And once you get to know one another and the relationship develops obviously sex naturally becomes a part of it.

He may not reciprocate this monogamy from you but reciprocate in terms of steady long term support having two SBs gives him enough variety so he doesnt have to replace either and he can afford to keep you both and require monogamy from you both so its still a closedsystem among the  of you.,sugarlifestyleforum,d9j64hg,2,t5_320gp

Maybe you should have a nice chat to make it clear what kind of experiences you are looking for and properly schedule it so you dont feel like an escort after every encounter.

In this cycle neither candidate provided any solid evidence of what their policy actually was in fact it appeared to radically change in each speech they made. Which means how a person voted primarily depended on how they were brought up to vote the bias of the news outlet they visited and which candidates speeches they watched and whether the rhetoric style struck a chord. Things like morality policy ethics  they dont really factor into modern elections. I surely would not have voted for trump...

9963196,0,t3_5i6iro,If it must be on the Internet then it must be true.  Be wary of stories and aspirations you read about others without legitimate verification.  I recently visited a high school class   kids in the class  more than  of them thought they would earn  or more in their careers.  Realistically and statistically only  max will.  Another anecdote  I remember first starting my business.  I used to take work for  per hour provided the hours were on my time.  One client said that was all he paid but I could work whenever I wanted as long as I gave him  hours a week.  Sunday morning and Tuesday late nights did not have much for me in terms of my preferred billing rate.  So rather than watching football I decided to earn  and build a relationship.  Today my billing rates are anywhere from  per hour depending on the type of work  I would not be where I am without taking the cheap work.I never felt getting hr. was a reflection of my value  I looked at it as an opportunity to make a few extra dollars when I would normally be making none.  Since you are new I suggest the same mindset.Do not mistaken my advice as encouragement to take cheap or lowball offers.  However be open.  The guy offering you  PPM may end up being able to get to  PPM after a few months.  If you like the guy and he treats you well and takes you to nice places the  is just a bonus.I have met with POT SBs that have turned down my  per month allowance offers based on various factors.  At the end of the day they were just not that interested in me but they cited offer being too cheap.  Well one called me  months after blasting my cheap offer?  Guess who would have been exponentially better off with an extra  taxfree in her pocket just by entering an arrangement?  Instead she is still seeking her match.I am not sure what your income is but if you find a guy you genuinely like spending time with and are attracted to meeting x a week for an extra  per month of income taxfree is generally nothing to be scoffed at.  Whats better?  The guy that gives you k per month for  months before vanishing?  Or week guy that means k for the year.  If you are enjoying his company and time it should be the easiest money you ever made.You can keep looking.  You do not have to take any money if you do not want.  You can hold out for higher offers.  You do not have to have sex with anyone.  But being offered compensation to meet with someone on your terms should be a win.My best SRsSBs have expected the least and received the most.  We focused on connection and mutual interest vs. a business deal.Be open minded  seek out those you would want to spend time with anyway.  You have the time.  Some SBs claim they do not have the time  that is not true.  It is just priorities.  Find someone you want to make a priority.  Do not agree to anything without you feeling comfortable and taken care of on some level.  A girl the other day told me she should have gone to work after a great evening out where I handed her a  gift card towards some of her Christmas presents no intimacy involved and I spent another  easy on drinks show tickets not to mention my time and sanity.

Youre paying either way lol.Im sorry and this isnt completely directed solely at you but this whole argument is getting annoying.  By not wanting to make it transactional you guys are making it a way bigger deal than it needs to be.  PPM will always feel somewhat transactional.  Youre paying someone every time you see them.  Youre in a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Theres always going to be some degree of transaction when money is involved its impossible to avoid.  If it really makes you that uncomfortable youre probably not cut out for it.  Pay the allowance enjoy yourselves move on.  All this discussion of the best way and is it transactional or not blah blah blah just makes it so much more significant than it needs to be.  THAT is whats making it transactional.  It is what it is.  Personally I prefer venmo or PayPal because I dont have to count it out I know its all there.  Yes I know you can be scammed if you dont know how to use them properly.  If theres cash I would only assume they would ever count it out the first time.  Most people have the ability to be somewhat discreet.  This whole argument just makes me thankful that I have a monthly allowance.  Thats about as far as you can get when it comes to not feeling transactional.  Im paid and then I dont think about it for another month.  I know some people dont like monthly allowances but it feels the most natural to me.

That was ok but made me very cautious and I would have them verify their identity or at least that they were indeed the person in the pictures through various random ways. I would also never divulge who I am to the person until they did.Honestly I have way more to lose than they do.

10483620,0,t3_5q50tr,While it is never the SBs fault for being scammed I feel like a lot of the guys who are out to do this you can usually pick up a few red flags in their behavior.  A super heavy emphasis on the sexual side of things before meeting is a red flag as well as wanting to be intimate upon the first meet.  Another clue is that alot of these guys tend to try to skirt around talking about money and allowances.  Anyone who avoids talking about money probably does not have the best intentions.I always let POTs know that Im not comfortable sleeping with a man I hardly know.  Anyone who stresses on needing to meet up that very night or just meet up in general before give even discussing your expectations is not looking for an LTR.  I also personally steer clear of anyone who is only in town for a few days because who knows if that is even true it just seems like a perfect way to pump and dump.More red flags are a someone who does not seem to care to get to know anything about you at all.  Thats because they only care about sleeping with you and then moving on to the poor next girl.  A real SD wants to get to know you as that helps build a great arrangement with a deeper understanding of one another.  So lets say you screened but you still ended up on a date with a guy.  He seems nice and youre going to be intimate.  Never pay for a hotel yourself.  Always ensure you receive your allowance before you sleep with him no matter what.  I dont care how much you like him or what he promises dont do it.  That way even if youre pumped and dumped at least you were still paid.  If its the first time count it discreetly.  Later on as trust as built it is not necessary but in the beginning I feel it always is.  Trust is earned over time not just given freely.  In the beginning cash is king.  A check can be cancelled or bounce a gift card can be empty or drained remotely as well as a debitcredit card.I say this coming from over a years worth of experience in the bowl.

Some amount of sugar would have already been given without much in the way of intimacy.I get the feeling that others take things at a more expedited pace... Or without an actual connection.

10656827,0,t3_5shlw8,.  I also think on the SB side failing to be assertive is a huge issue.  So many women are afraid to be assertive because they dont want to be labeled as a bitch.  Thats not the case.  You can be assertive without being rude and remaining gracious.Ive been sugaring for a while but only recently found this sub.  In the past few days and going back and reading older posts it has been mindblowing how so many SBs state that they were afraid to ask for it or were shamed into not talking about money.  If you dont think that you can stand up to a man thats much older than you I dont think the sugar bowl is a good place for you..  I know that the primary reasons SBs join the bowl is for financial reasons I dont deny that and I dont think there is anything wrong with that at all.  However I dont think it is smart for the decision to come from a place of desperation or uncertainty.  The wrong kinds of men can smell that from a mile away and will do everything they can to take advantage.  It will cloud your judgement cause you to overlook things you normally wouldnt and do things out of your comfort zone.  No amount of money in the future is worth compromising your present safety.,sugarlifestyleforum,ddf64n3,6,t5_320gp

It is a little unusual that you havent gotten a mampg in three months as an SD. Since were getting your POV its possible what you consider getting along is actually boring or lacking initial chemistry to a lot of these girls. And it could also be that you waited too long before asking to meet in person. For me if Im texting someone regularly then I expect to make plans to meet within a week maybe two if theyre traveling. Interests seem to drop off substantially after a week in my experience. People get bombarded with pots so you kinda need to put a voice and face to your profile as soon as possible. Theres also a small chance your number is high enough to make them think its a scam. It really doesnt need to be substantial but a pot talking about a higher than average allowance in the first couple of messages could raise some suspicion.

11721791,0,t3_677uxp,Its only reasonable in LANYC if youre talking about the most desirable women on SA at the level of accomplished models or instagram models say k followers perfect bodies etc.If youre talking about average goodlooking college girls then yes youre most likely overpaying dramatically unless youre physically repulsive.  Even in SF the highest PPM spot Im aware of those are very high numbers.The next time you try setting up an arrangement start lower  say .  The response to that will tell you all you need to know.  Or create a fake SB account thats as attractive as the girls you regularly go for.  See what kind of offers you get.,sugarlifestyleforum,dgop18m,5,t5_320gp
11727068,0,t3_67c3ip,I chatted on SA with an  yr old still in HS just to feel her out metaphorically people!.She wanted me to drive to her small town and take her to a local Days Inn. I had visions of her father both brothers and half the high school football team in town finding us and rearranging my face. Obviously I did not take her up on the offer.There are  yr olds who do well with SRs.  I took one who graduated early and is in college just to dinner and a show hugs and kiss goodnight only it was fun. But if I were you I would keep it to local SDs with prominent public profiles that are easily verified online someone with a lot to lose if he messes up.For sure do not fly to anyone.  Dont go to anyones home.  Dont get in his car.  At least not until you know him well.  Read about the different scams on here.  And be patient a SR can be whatever you and your SD want it to be.,sugarlifestyleforum,dgpal0c,3,t5_320gp

11732318,1,t1_dgp6ipp,Excellent. No you are not a pro. You are exactly the kind of SB that men like me want to find. If UC means University of Chicago look me up.

11735046,0,t1_dgpowkt,They might. Im reasonably there with quicker meet ups but if its right now then its definitely more escort than SB. Though sometimes it really is the flake factor. Flaking happens far less after first meeting and happens more the further out you schedule things.Of course if its meeting at a hotel right away thats just wanting a cheap escort because a guy knows a girl is new.,sugarlifestyleforum,dgq73yb,2,t5_320gp

I was hoping to find a way to have those accounts deleted like you can now. I assume this deletion of inactive profiles will solve this? Thanks.,sugarlifestyleforum,dgtr0br,2,t5_320gp
