5271411,0,t3_3n7ejz,Ive got three bets today gents. Ill be posting more often now work has calmed down.Heracles vs. Heerenveen. Heracles to win  .Heracles are currently unbeaten at home played  and won  whilst their opponents Heerenveen only have one point away from home this season. Heracles recently beat giants PSV in their last home game and have scored  goals this season the second highest in the league no surprises that Ajax are top. Heerenveen have only scored seven goals this season with only two of them coming away from home. Heracles finished strongly last season with their only loses coming against PSV and Ajax whilst Heerenveen struggled in the Europa League play offs. Key part Heerenveen did win the same fixture last season . However at this point Heracles were not playing for much in the league whilst Heerenveen were competing for a playoff spot.  Heerenveen are a good side but they have beer Eric Dier this season. Im confident of a Heracles win here.Table Heracles  rd Place Heerenveen  th PlaceForm Table Last  Games Heracles  nd Place Heerenveen  th PlaceSeraing vs. Royal Antwerp    Royal Antwerp to win  .Lets start by saying Royal Antwerp are a big club who have been stuck in the second division of Belgium for the last  years. They are currently top of the league and are going to be hoping to push on and carry this form through to the end of the season to be in with a chance of finally getting back into the top division. Antwerp are currently unbeaten away from home  wins and a draw and are top of the league with no losses. Seraing have lost their last two at home and have conceded  goals  in these games. Antwerp have only conceded twice away this season the only goals their conceded and are unbeaten against Seraing in their HH history. Im extremely confident of an Antwerp win here I just cannot see Seraing causing them any issues especially with how poor theyve been at home against lesser clubs in their last two games.Table Antwerp  st Place Seraing  th PlaceForm Table Last  Games Antwerp  st Place Seraing  th Placeand now for....LucasTheBeards VALUE Bet of The DayRotherham United vs. BurnleyBurnley to win  .DNB on Burnley is a massive  .!Whilst Burnley havent been brilliant away from home  games  win  draws  loss they have came up against much more difficult opposition compared to a team like Rotherham including Derby and Ipswich. Rotherham have been pretty poor at home only winning  game out of   draw and  losses only scoring  goals whilst conceding . The odds are probably big because Rotherham did beat Birmingham last week at home . Burnley will be hoping to get straight back into the Premier League this season and are currently sitting one place below the play offs whilst Rotherham will be fighting relegation or midtable at best this season. Obviously the Championship can be very unpredictable so it may be worth taking the DNB. Whilst new record signing Andre Gray is doubtful Burnley still have the majority of their attacking players from last year apart from Danny Ings and Id fancy them to score a couple against a weak Rotherham tonight.Table Burnley  th Place Rotherham  th PlaceForm Table Last  Games Burnley  th Place Rotherham  th Place,footybetting,cvlhd5n,2,t5_38ovq
