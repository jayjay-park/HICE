2906890,0,t1_cnyb2lw,Hi RooSong  yes the Oncologist also gave me the option to amputate her forearm and the cost is about .  The sarcoma is localized to just her right paw and it hasnt spread yet I dont think.  Its a low aggressive sarcoma so she said it probably will not spread up the arm.  But when she told me With surgery and radiation therapy we expect  local tumor control for  years which in veterinary medicine is a very good prognosis I rather go that route because those numbers are pretty good to me.  I just think amputating a limb when shes running ok for now and not showing any pain or suffering is a bit severe to me.  If the goal is not met then I would just leave the arm alone and see if it comes back which will most likely come back and keep an eye on it and if it does come back I will probably then amputate the arm with the funds I receive on the online fundraiser website.  I just dont have the heart to make that decision of amputating her arm when I see her happy and running around for the time being especially after I just did a surgery on her and shes healing okay.,ShibaInu,cnyiqmi,1,t5_2suzp
