4411087,0,t1_csmuhe0,Aww I am sorry for your loss. Ive had this orange blob since she was a sprightly  week old kitten I cant imagine losing her.It is tiring but worth it. The running joke in our house is that to lose  lbs you just have to stand up and the cats will fall to the ground. If you are sitting or laying down they are guaranteed to be on top of you.I have requested that if I die they be rehomed to a quadriplegic with a lowgrade fever. Their idea of heaven is a permanent lap that is incapable of shooing them away with irritated arm flailings. They also are too lazy to make their own body heat if it can be avoided.
