1590153,0,t3_2chtdw,To lessen the devastating effects of deforestation in Haiti the Lambi Fund of Haiti is planting one million trees in Haiti raising awareness about the root causes of deforestation and educating communities throughout rural Haiti about ways to address these problems.,haiti,cjflybl,1,t5_2ql9x
1661694,0,t1_cjoigod,I think Haiti could use charity and development aid. I think that France is unlikely to pay much in reparations and that the statue of limitations on a legal suit does not work in the favor of Haiti. Beyond that there are massive public health problems in Haiti. ,haiti,cjomaf8,1,t5_2ql9x
1708329,0,t3_2dsj56,I strongly disagree. You get what you pay for. The hotels also need to thrive on the market. They make a big investment coming to our country so there is no reason for them not to able to set the appropriate rates. All the biggest hotels are completely booked during the summers with foreigners that actually want to come to the country. The rates are the same in other Caribbean countries such as Santo Domingo Barbados for high class hotels. If you hold the bigger share of the market while maximizing your profit there is no reason for you to bypass that. The only way tourist stays will go down is if more competition comes in. I think this is an invitation for businesses because the market is wide open. I also think this video is somewhat offensive because of the way she goes about putting together her family responsibilities and the reason our country is not open for business. Absolutely ludicrous. Haiti ap f progr! ,haiti,cjuhvyn,2,t5_2ql9x

9405464,0,t3_581hqo,Not casting any negative light but I do need to warn anyone who chooses to donate that they do so of their own volition.  rHaiti bears no responsibility for any fundraising activity.  It appears to be legitimate and their Facebook page does have updates that go back a number of days with images that do not at this time appear to be duplicated or pilfered from elsewhere on the internet.Again user beware when donating money to any organization or fundraising effort.  Thank you.,haiti,d987iy2,1,t5_2ql9x
