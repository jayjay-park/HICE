42455,0,t1_cccjxxf,I personally think that You Take My Breath Away is much more haunting. The part where it says I will find you.. And the harmonies come in gives me the chills everytime. The slow parts also add to the overall feel of the song though a bit exaggerated. The dynamics of the choral bits fluctuate a lot more on it It goes from breathy to strong to breathy again and it feels like youre breathing in and out irregularly just to match the song.,queen,cej9j8v,1,t5_2s4ze

I have also gone on record as saying that its actually a shame they couldnt work something out with George MichaelsThe guy stole the show at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in  in my opinion and would have made for a great lead vocalist for the band if they decided to tour once every three or four years or something like that.,queen,cfk4jfd,3,t5_2s4ze

1957174,0,t3_2h2v20,He has a really good voice but he has little to no charisma. And I kinda wish he didnt use the halfmicstand. Im sure it was meant to be a nod to Freddie but it came across as him trying to be like Freddie because he doesnt put enough of himself into the performance.I know I sound like Simon Cowell but Im just being honest. And if the name of the show is any indication I guess they dont care about any of that stuff anyway. They just care about how good of a singer they are. And if thats the case he did an incredible job.,queen,ckp1j2z,2,t5_2s4ze

10846413,0,t3_5v10i6,I like the general consistency of Queen and Queen II the most I think. Theyre kind of like concept albums for them. SHA tho is probably where they begin to find themselves as individual songwriters beyond May and Mercury. That being said News of the World is probably my favorite because its song to me are generally their greatest of all time with the only song I dont like being Who Needs You. But saying I dont like it wouldnt be true its still alright and I like it but its not up to par with the rest. Get Down Make Love is kinda creepy and weird to listen to but still an alright song. When it comes to Queen tho you have to disregard the idea of each album having a distinct sound. Each member of Queen has completely different writing styles that dont let albums have that consistent sound like most other bands. But thats all. Have fun listening to Queen,queen,ddyqc5h,3,t5_2s4ze
10872406,0,t3_5v9h9s,I dislike Innuendo and The Miracle and put Hot Space and Made in Heaven before them. I know MiH gets a lot of bad reputation around Queen circles but the the kinda ambient sound on it mixed with that Queen uniqueness is something unmatched. As for Space it was ahead of its time. Soundwise you can find a lot of closeness to Muse and if it was released today it would probably do quite well.,queen,de1etdh,3,t5_2s4ze
