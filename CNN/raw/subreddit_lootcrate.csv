I am a new subscriber March and I was a little let down by the Titan box. However I realize that its impossible to please everyone. The April box was awesome and I think it was definitely worth my money. I hope you guys stay positive! You do a great job and in the end its a business. People getting mad over how much money you make or whatever else they complain about is silly...the point of a business is to make money. You still offer a lot of cool items and a relatively unique service. ,lootcrate,ch09xb8,3,t5_2wph0

Especially since LC and the competitor have not given out Funko since January .Why hasnt there big some sort of big announcement about this? This gives you a huge leg up on your competitor box.The Funko contract is probably your biggest selling point right now especially since you started included tons of card stock items generic unofficial items and your own Lootcrate Labs convention items.EDITSo which is it Lootcrate?

2382063,0,t1_cm41kc0,The good thing about Loot Crate is that they seem to have their finger on the pulse of geek culture and are able to provide products that usually the majority of subscribers of all ages would enjoy. I think Power Rangers is an extremely niche product at this point that only caters to the nostalgia of a very narrow range of people.     Lego is great and I think there are very few people that would take issue with anything from them but as a  year old who was too old for Power Rangers when it first came out and has kids who have also outgrown the show Id frankly be kind of pissed if I paid for something from that show that I would ultimately throw out.    Of all the crates Ive gotten only Fear was a miss for me but thats more due to me having left the horror genre behind years ago not the quality of the product but I can at least acknowledge that a lot of people would love it I cant say the same for any power rangers merch.,lootcrate,cm64q76,3,t5_2wph0

Just saying I dont like these items and leaving it at that is barely constructive and not very effective feedback.I dont want pure positivity I dont even imply it. I just want people to stop whining and actually either provide constructive criticisms or stop using lootcrate. At a certain point after months of getting shit you dont like or want it is probably time to move on right?I dont like these items because... and I would prefer... are infinitely more constructive and effective than the current lootcrate is not very good amirite? circlejerk.Feedback without insentive does not change companies. If they make money they are successful  even if their customers are unhappy. Or do you expect that major companies are going to give you what you want even when you pay and accept what you dont want?

3261006,0,t3_2x5aqe,I just got February box and I am going to be honest I loved it. The game cards were for a game I have been wanting to play with but just wanted to try it before buying my eldest son loves the hex bug hes just old enough to think its cool my hubby loves the book and the dice and my youngest likes the vinyl figure. So all in all its a really great box for my family. We always get the tshirts in mens small so that if I want to I can wear it or if I dont then the kids can have it. But I have come to realize that loot crate you must be in to many different genres for it to be worth the money. ,lootcrate,cp00jb8,1,t5_2wph0
3326094,0,t1_cp7ds1q,You are completely correct and with the amount of crates that they ship out each months mistakes are bound to be made. That doesnt mean that theyre intentionally trying to screw this guy out of his money like he seems to be insinuating. Even when you had a problem with loot crate they did eventually send you a replacement which they seem more than willing to do for everyone not receiving their crate this month too and theyll eat the cost. People just need to be patient and work with them as they try and fix the problem. This will unfortunately take some time as they have to figure out if its honestly just shipping delays or if the crates are lost theyre still a company that needs to make money in order to stay in business so they cant afford to send a bunch of people two crates. This guy just needs to be patient and understanding not posting comments that make him sound like an angry unreasonable ass.,lootcrate,cp7ehyi,2,t5_2wph0

Keep in mind Loot does spend money to get stuff in crates and in the delivery etc. A bunch of stuff we pay for but they pay for it first and the money we give them reimburses them and gives them a profit.I dont think lootcrate could afford a crate that expensive and delivery on that size crate would have a higher tax thing internationally id most likely have to pay a on delivery import tax.

If that happened to you scan your computer and just go find your original email with original link.Secondly do you remember the projected delivery date before the change? Sometimes the delivery date will vanish if they are rescheduling the date. Often I will have a shipment coming in and it will be delivered early because they have another package of mine needing to be dropped off anyhow. Third are you sure you arent just being directed to the fed ex smartpost tracking system? If fed ex isnt in your area already they will drop it off with your local USPS who then can drag their feet delivering it to you pump the tracking into USPS. ,lootcrate,cxs6ywo,4,t5_2wph0

Personally I think the core is fine and occasionally subscribe if there is a IP I like.Re other sub services I have used all the meal delivery services at one point or another and love Sun Basket and Blue Apron. Quality and value are high with both.I have also subbed to FiveFour and Fashion Stork.  I dont recommend either of you are looking for a value on clothes. I think the quality with FiveFour is better than fashion stork. I also like the sales from five four.Hope this helps there are lots of subs sites out there each designed to cater to a specific need. Good luck!,lootcrate,dg247up,1,t5_2wph0

Ive been waiting for a replacement shipment for my January loot for her since the end of January. First they told me it would ship within  days then they told me by the end of february. Then it was mid march then by the end of march. Then I was told they were shipping into april and now Ive finally arrived at by the end of april and they totally swear thats the right time frame this time.Like legitimately the support person I talked to said weve been assured this is accurate but werent they assured the other dates were accurate? They keep telling me they have the product and that isnt the issue. But I seriously have my doubts. I paid for something in December that was NOT a preorder and nearly  months later I still do not have it.Something is seriously going wrong with lootcrate.,lootcrate,dg9suuu,3,t5_2wph0

Ive had to contact them a few times now for various reasons and they are always great at resolving my issues... Just an excessive wait time sometimes though.,lootcrate,dgptxuw,3,t5_2wph0
