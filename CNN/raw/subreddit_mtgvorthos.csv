How old was she when she died in the original timeline?  She probably has been gone for years in this timeline which is why Taigam believed her to be dead.  ,mtgvorthos,cp5hsyv,2,t5_2wf9l

6531616,0,t1_czuwtsk,gtThe idea that a planeplanetnature spirit can absorb their energy......what?!That is literally how they were chained in the first place. If you dont buy that then you dont buy the entire concept of what the Eldrazi have been set up to be replacing them with something else that youve constructed based on the Cthulu mythos. Consider that the Eldrazi are not Elder Gods and that Zendikar is not early turn of the th century Massacheusets. And that the Magic storyline is not a story written by an emotionally disturbed shutin trying to describe his schizophrenia and borderline psychosis via fiction.This is the problem with referencing Cthulu people get Batman syndrome.gtNuh uh Batman could survive a nuke using his Batfallout shelter and radiation using his bat hazmat suit.gtWhat does he eat?gtRobin,mtgvorthos,czux5tn,1,t5_2wf9l

8136179,0,t1_d4ugdj7,Yeah my theory is close to  conjecture and any type of reasoning to these questions wouldnt be to far off from because master plan. Im just trying to hold on to the idea that Yawgmoth could still be a thing. If anything perhaps with Nicol Bolas and Tezzeret working together Tezzeret could become the new Father of Machines as part of Bolass master plan.  theres just too much that cant be answered due to their paths never crossing and Yawgmoth having a very detailed storyline.,mtgvorthos,d4ukwpc,1,t5_2wf9l
8193541,0,t3_4rjs8n,I can only speak to the modern story and I choose to ignore A Test of Metal but yes but not like Ob Nixilis who is very Saturday morning Bolas tends to be more dry among other things. Nicol Bolas has wheels within wheels. Hes a stronger telepath than Jace so not much slips by him. He prefers indirect approaches and long schemes and doesnt show himself till hes sure he has the upper hand. Also generally everyone underestimates his power.When he gloats theres usually not an opening.,mtgvorthos,d51qt29,4,t5_2wf9l
