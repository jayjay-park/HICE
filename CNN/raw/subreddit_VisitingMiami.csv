4420622,0,t3_3blaay,You can easily take the metro.  There is a free minitrain thing that takes you to the airport metro station no idea why they didnt build the station m west AT the actual airport.  Next take the train no worries about platform or anything there is only one line to the Government Center stop.  There switch over to the Metromover OMNI LOOP LINE though both others will actually go to your station just loop around the wrong way! a free automated train that will take you to Riverwalk station directly in front of the hotel.  Total cost . time  minutes,VisitingMiami,csnxtgm,2,t5_31qup

You can have a bbq and walk to the ocean. No south beach crazyness or overpriced parking no naked people and the water is usually nice. We have a yearly cabana and its heaven on Earth! ,VisitingMiami,dg87eij,1,t5_31qup
