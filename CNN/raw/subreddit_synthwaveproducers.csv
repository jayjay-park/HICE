5275385,0,t1_cvkb7yk,My mistake. I made the assumption seeing darkwave artists associating themselves with synthwave artists. ,synthwaveproducers,cvlznwo,1,t5_39rwz
5822464,0,t3_3uxfdi,I havent really but Im sure there are a couple going on. Might just have to keep asking around certain subreddits.I do think they are good for introducing newer artists to people so Id be interested in listening to them if any are in the works.,synthwaveproducers,cxium2y,2,t5_39rwz
6096757,0,t3_3yx9oa,Happy new year I hope it was awesome. Longtime producer and new to synthwave I thought I would share the learnings on making my first synthwave track a WIP remix of a House track   Having the right sounds go a long way the instruments that really made the track more synthwave was the right selection of drum synth and bass sounds in that order.   I made use of two reverbs one s short and one s long both long by todays standards. The shorter reverb went on everything  and the longer one was used in addition to the shorter one on everything but the main vocals main guitar drums and basses.   I added chorus to things that I wouldnt of expected to. Generally chorus went on a lot of things.   For a remix even if the original track is not synthwave you can change the arrangement and tempo to fit.   Tom fillsrolls are awesome   Heres my track  let me know what you think  Edit updated the track,synthwaveproducers,cyin04x,3,t5_39rwz
6357203,0,t1_czbg3kk,I agree. I think itd be more acceptable if there was even some sort of personal message or input from the developer. But right now its very much just a lazy plug for their product. ,synthwaveproducers,czc8sn8,1,t5_39rwz
7095387,0,t3_4corlm,It depends heavily on the song. As the other poster hinted at variety is nice. Even if you go for a rather simple kick snare kick snare pattern try to spice it up with some fills every so often.,synthwaveproducers,d1kmr6h,1,t5_39rwz
