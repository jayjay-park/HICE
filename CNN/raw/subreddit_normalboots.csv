188149,0,t3_1w92u6,Theres tons of sites out there where you can set up blogs. Makes sense that the blogs on NormalBoots are for the content creators of NormalBoots. Thats just my personal opinion though.,normalboots,cezvbal,2,t5_2uefx

277388,0,t1_cf9fhul,I dont know. I would want to know if the Youtubers I were watching were being unruly to their fans. I feel like when you become this popular you have to sacrifice some or your privacy. This message was aimed the same guy that donated a very expensive game for projared. I would be pissed too if I were Gabriel. ,normalboots,cf9iigp,-1,t5_2uefx
282529,0,t3_1x9jm4,As much as I love PBG I have to say his voice was annoying me the whole time. He sounded over the top the entire episode and it was getting on my nerves. I love ya PBG and I loved the episode but tone the excitement down a bit! I was watching with a friend and he wanted me to close the video for that reason,normalboots,cfa1qmk,-1,t5_2uefx

327660,0,t1_cfepssi,It seems like YouTube would give them a more upfront payout however thank to the subscription system. Thats my theory anyways as to why Jon is simulposting on NB and YouTube as well as why Jared is keeping a lot of stuff on YouTube first. basically to generate some stater funds to allow them to generate a back catalog of the new ultra high quality stuff. Im probably totally wrong about that though. Please correct me if you know the real reason.,normalboots,cfeqdzv,1,t5_2uefx
341082,0,t1_cff7927,I believe ProJared only puts his long scripted and edited reviews the ones with his intro  on NormalBoots and everything else is just on YouTube. I suspect this is because he has a lot of content like Lets Plays and stuff like that that isnt viewed as NormalBootsworthy and hes using NormalBoots to host his most polished stuff.,normalboots,cfg4fre,1,t5_2uefx

444227,0,t3_1z4n8o,Projared is running a numbers game with his flabby neck flesh but egoraptor is going for a quality over quantity approach letting them have sufficient space as to not have any chins overtake another and letting stubble grow to emphasize the curvature of the chin. ,normalboots,cfqt4w6,5,t5_2uefx
