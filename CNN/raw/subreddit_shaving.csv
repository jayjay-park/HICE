This part of the whole process is probably whats prolonging your blade life but almost certainly not for as long as you claim.,shaving,cijx2ei,0,t5_2re8f

1940666,0,t1_ckmxhvt,The way the blade sits inside the razor changes the way you shave I noticed that when I used the micro touch the blade does not sit perfectly straight this causes your face to get  and you wont get a close shave but since a style like the merkur is only  peices it always sits perfectly straight and you will get a comfortable shave assuming you have found the right blades for your skin as well as a shave soap or cream you are also comfortable with using.,shaving,ckn1o3a,1,t5_2re8f

4795849,0,t3_3gkm48,Safety razors are a good choice.  You can reduce a lot of waste.  The razors which hold the blades are sturdy and last many years or generations.  The consumable piece is the razor blade which is just a wisp of metal.  It has minimal packaging and is recyclable.Many safety razor users also eschew aerosol shaving foam.  A brush and shaving soap are used instead.  The brush will last for years.  You can put a soap in a container you already have.  If a hard soap does come in its own container that container is typically reusable and recyclable.This can be done quite cheaply.  Startup costs are about  for a good kit including razor blades brush and soap. Blades are about  cents each in quantity.  Soaps can be had for  that will last three months.  To reduce packaging and increase economy you can also buy a full kilogram of soap at a time like Cella  This will last about  years and cost about .On top of that I find that safety razor shaving in this manner is more effective and more enjoyable than cartridge razor shaving.,shaving,ctz20f9,7,t5_2re8f

8457612,0,t3_4vi9b2,Its more a question of technique than anything else. The only problem with the razor is that it may be limiting how you can shave.Generally speaking you want to shave with the grain WTG to reduce your stubble then across the grain XTG to get reasonably close and finally against the grain ATG to get rid of the last vestiges of your whiskers. With a blade razor that means youve put a blade to every point on your face at least  times which may be too much.You could try skipping the XTG pass and see if that gets you acceptable results. But I personally was never able to get a close shave on my neck with cartridge razors.The alternative is to use fewer blades.  blades are better than   are better than  and one blade is ideal. The Bic  Bic Metal and Gillette Guard are all good options. IMO though the best option is a doubleedged safety razor. Theres a learning curve but once you have figured out how to use it effectively itll give you incredibly close comfortable shaves every time. You can further improve your shave by using a good lather  that is the kind you build with a brush from traditional shaving soap. Theres a small upfront cost   will get you started with good stuff. Going forward though its dirt cheap blades range from less than . to about . each.The only downside is that it can become a hobby. On rwetshavers and rwickededge there are plenty of people who own dozens each of razors brushes and soaps some of which are ludicrously expensive. Stay away from those guys if you want to save money.,shaving,d5yqili,4,t5_2re8f
8750028,0,t1_d6ywqxu,You can shave with a DE with a few passes and look presentable.  This wouldnt take a tone of time maybe  minutes.  It may not be super smooth but you will cut down a lot of the hair.  This works for me but my facial hair is not dense nor dark.It also depends on what you want to sacrifice  time or money.  DE shaving cuts cost modern cartridge razors cut time.  I was broke when I started DE shaving and I havent looked back because its just a nice thing to do for yourself.

Not going to name any specific product so you can decide what to roll with.I recently started using a shave cream instead of the gelfoamcanisters and it works really well for me for as little of it I need to use.

11334613,0,t3_61pzx6,This will depend on how smooth you want to get. With  weeks of growth any razor electric or not thats meant to give a smooth shave will struggle. Youll most likely need a trimmer to take the lions share of the length off than a finish razor electric or not to get smooth. If you want to just control the length skip the finish shave.,shaving,dfgrbk1,2,t5_2re8f
