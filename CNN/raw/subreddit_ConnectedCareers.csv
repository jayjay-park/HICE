118196,0,t3_1vewnt,I remember playing Madden .  Next Madden I can think of would be the st one that came out with the PS when it was released cause my dad would play with me and Id go for onsides being the dick little kid I was and he refused to play madden with me after that.  Then I got back into it with  ? whichever had Vick on the cover because I went and played in the Madden Challenge tourney when I was  yo.  After I went on a hiatus here and there just buying the game to play for fun or do franchises with my buddy and then this shit happened in M and Im stuck and I cant get away,ConnectedCareers,cerw2dv,2,t5_2ut8e

953804,0,t1_chcp17g,Pass rusher at OLB is the  need if you ask me. Trent Cole wont be around past this year and even he isnt as productive as someone playing ROLB in our scheme should be. In my opinion you draft Barr for his potential. He wouldnt start this year hed come on some rd down passing situations but mostly he would sit behind Cole for a year. A WR would be nice too dont get me wrong. But I dont know that we need one in the st. Safety is also not set but having  set and two competent players competing for the other spot is better than weve had since Dawk left. ,ConnectedCareers,chcpevg,2,t5_2ut8e
