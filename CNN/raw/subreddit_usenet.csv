148804,0,t1_cevdfjp,Go to the server config section. There is a way to see your server settings. Once of the options is Connections. I believe Frugals limit is  but you should verify. Here is a screenshot of the config page I think its from an old version but you get the idea. You may or may not need all of the connections that you are allowed. You should try different combinations and see what works for you. If you can reach your maximum connection speed with fewer connections thats great. Fewer connections will be more CPU efficient.,usenet,cevdobv,3,t5_2qucj

In that case you cant just select episode four you have to download everything.Now the same thing but with torrent where the seeder is just seeding the season pack of ten episodes.

Not to mention all features like datarot protection snapshots replication deduplication etc. To direct to Unraid or most SynologyQNAP solutions has nothing to do with the question related to a filesystem.  As those products are simply NAS systems most of the case they do run licensed software neither they NAS systems setup with ZFS. If You want a NAS box the better approach is FreeNAS ZFSGuru and NexantaStor all with ZFS filesystems from raidz up to raidz.  Currently we do use raidz setups  drives  drives designed for recovery on plain FreeBSD boxes with fiberchannel interfaces. However ZFS on mac seems to be a great solution to store data on the OSX Client and Server with the possibility to use indexing and search facilities.  ZFS is the best road to follow not such solutions such as Synology or Qnap with a crappy raid slow performance and most of them without ZFS. ZFS is the currently the best filesystem.

I think it would be fine. Like you said your bottleneck will most likely be either your Internets upload speed or your Sonys CPU.gt I want to have the ability to control the server remotely so if Im in my weekend apartment with the rMBP and want to download X I can give that order to the server found at my main apartment it will download and I can play the movie from my rMBP.To do this you can port forward the ports that NZBDrone Couch Potato etc. on and then youll be able to access it from the internet. Recommended that you put a password on it of course. gtIm not really sure what is transcoding. Transcoding is the converting of on video format to another. This can be because the device doesnt support a specific format. It also is used when your internet cant handle uploading the full video files you can lower the bitrate for a lower quality video file.You could always install Plex your Sony to try out first. Of course you dont need your full movie collection on it. If it cant handle the transcoding you might want to look into building a computer to do put everything in.

I used to use SABnzbd off my PC and really liked it I think I went to SBNZBget because of the search providers I cant remember exactly but that makes the most sense to me.  I feel much better going with what a lot of people here use instead of being a one off.I looked at nMatrix registrations are closed and I dont even see a way to add that into Sonarr.Dog costs  and I have zero problem with that but I have no idea how to send bitcoins and I do see how to add that into Sonarr.Is there an invite or something you can send me for nMatrix?  I need to figure out how to send Bitcoins to get Dog going.  I can do that.I bought NZBgeek previously and am using that for now.It seems like its downloading episodes which is great.  Even beyond that on Sonarr its showing me the download progress.  Very cool!I installed Couch Potato and Im futzing with it but this looks really amazing.  I love how you can choose variables on a movie like the rating and from what site and itll automatically download it.

My current one goes down at around  connections. It seems that you are fine if you stick to LAN copies  connection speed tests a handful of connections and I bet you Steam would work.Torrent and usenet can go towards hundreds of connections and I dont believe routers that go for  bucks or less can normally handle them.Try permutating your list of servery and see if that mbps was random. Maybe sab prioritizes one at  mbps per connection and your router crashes or limits at around  connections. If there are one or more such servers in your list hope another gives you more performance per connection than one or more of the others.Of course this is only a guess and personal experience.,usenet,cojew9f,1,t5_2qucj

I dont know anything about their specific server settings but if thats what Frugal gives you then use them.gt Question  I cant get box setup in Servers because I cant seem to find the right port settings. I cant seem to find them on the site. Where do I find these settings?box is a usenet indexer isnt it? That doesnt need to get set up in a usenet client SABnzbd the usenet client doesnt really do automation. To use a usenet client manually you simply load it with a .nzb file amp itll start downloading from your usenet provider. The .nzb file itself you download from your indexer website. No indexer settings required in the usenet client. If youre doing something more advanced there might be indexer RSS or something in the usenet client but thats not what youre trying to here since youre trying to coordinate automated downloads using Sonarr.gt I have sonarrs download client settings set to SABnzbd Host port API username and passwordThat sounds right.gt I have box setup and Sonarrs Indexers URL and API Key.That sounds right.gt Question  I cant get frugal in to Sonarrs Indexer settings because I cant find an API key in my account area on their website.

6761198,0,t3_48aoen,You can consider this as an economic problem not technical like you said everything can be decrypted given enough timeSo first the law enforcement are more likely to go after uploader because they distributed copyright material way more than downloaders do maximizes the profit from fines etc and minimumizes lost prevent further downloadsSecond they would more likely to go after torrent users. Torrenting has a much bigger user base and much easier to track down they dont have sslSo Id say if you dont download a crazy amount maybe gttday of content you are safe with Usenet.The reason is mostsome Usenet company are based in another country if say FBI want to go after you they need to pull some strings on a foreign government and they have to provide something in return I guess theyd rather user their leverage on something bigger? And if they dont corporate with foreign government they will also have to fight on court because the Usenet providers will fight not to give out client info or as little as possible this is the key to stay in business once you give someone out people starts to leave you immediately. Or if they choose to decrypt your SSL connection. It is possible but again its a economics problem they will not spend  resource to decrypt your SSL if its only worth ,usenet,d0inxpa,2,t5_2qucj

7857330,0,t1_d3yvweu,What I paid comes out to just over mo and I see that as quite a bargain. I tried Giganews a couple years ago and was extremely disappointed. While their retention was over  days at the time the completion rate sucked. It was as if  of each upload was dropped each month  meaning everything older than a month required PARs. If it was a year old it needed  pars  years old needed   PARS... and anything much older than that was too damaged to download since few people post with more than  PARs Before than I was using Newsguy.  I think paid around  for  months and after a few months I received an email telling me to keep myself below GBmo on my unlimited account.So my experience with NewsDemon is the best of the three. ,usenet,d3z8got,1,t5_2qucj

9126061,0,t1_d88p259,I can make a case against VPN actually. Its been revealed that agencies when they see user using a vpn tunnel will consider that very act suspect. So it makes  you look suspicious and may get you put on a watchlist lol. Later because they collect EVERYTHING on the internet and sort it later they may try to line up whats going on at both ends of the tunnel or collect other clues because you looked suspicious! Its also been shown that agencies have often forced the vpn providers to cough up logs or other information. Only a couple swear they wont or cant do this but how can you can trust that day in and day out if its even true to start with? Govt also has many secret plans of attack we dont even know about.So IMO VPN is a waste of money and potentially puts a red flag on you whereas youd otherwise just be obscure because youre a straw of hay in a haystack.

Everything youve posted so far sounds like network congestion    Im getting  megabytess as soon as i start but a few seconds later it drops to That is the description of congestion along the network path or of traffic shaping possibly by your ISP.  Im including quotes from other threads which are relevant.gt Internet routinggtThe other large issue is you are halfway across the world from all  providers servers.   gt Download speed is heavily impacted by latency.  Latency increases with each additional hop introduced in a network route virtual distance between a server and a client you.gt Physical distance and virtual distance are highly correlated.The longer the route the more hops are introduced.There is little you can do to reduce hops and latency when physical distance is far.gt The TCP window is reduced as latency increases thus decreasing your maximum download speed per connection.gt Also as previously discussed and implied just because you get  MBs from one connection from a DDL provider at some random datacenter in Dallas doesnt mean youll get the same output with multiple connections from a different provider at another datacenter in Ashburn VA.gt Routing plays a big part.gt Think of it like roads and traffic.  A provider plots a course to your destination but to reach you they could take an infinite number of routes.gt  Some routes may be congested with traffic some might have speed limits.   Some routes may be forced to take detours..     Private roads may yield shorter routes with less traffic but may not be accessible to all.gt Thats a simple analogy but one most people will relate to.,usenet,df51udz,2,t5_2qucj
