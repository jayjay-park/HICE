1460352,0,t3_2atqnm,My roommate and I would go there on Friday afternoons for beer and cheap   pizza. Then there was the time we were there in the winter time after a sizable snowfall. A guy kept running up and down the main aisle yelling SNOW BALL FIGHT IN  MINUTES. SNOWBALL FIGHT IN  MINUTES! His goal was to get half the bar on one side of the street and everyone else on the other. Mike and I went outside because we were leaving anyway and it was just him on one side of the street against a couple other people. He was super into it and a few people threw snowballs at him while he dove behind parked cars. The whole snowball fight couldnt have lasted any longer than  minutes.,BallState,cizbwss,3,t5_2sh8j

8406255,0,t3_4r7tvq,Ill be a senior this year and Ive been in a lot of clubs during my time. I suggest joining hall council if you live in Lafolettee. That was where I made the best friends I kept. If you want a real club then join the belly dance club! Dont worry if you dont have any rhythm we teach you what you need to know! Its a lot of fun and helps you to become more selfconfident.,BallState,d5sbsp2,1,t5_2sh8j
