6718731,0,t1_d0dguhh,I may be going on outdated information but if I remember correctly healing them provides a temporary boost to your reputation to the faction which then slowly returns to a value close to the original but a little less than what you started with. Continuously healing members of a faction should make them like you eventually.,Kenshi,d0e9wwi,1,t5_2td4i

10139646,0,t1_dbt5bbn,My dustwich production is through the roof now so much so that Im having to fill a shopkeepers backpack and sell them just to make room for more production so that my farmers and cook can level up.I did recently recruit a medic but his athletics skill is awful. Maybe Ill bring Burn along because hes pretty good right now.Ive got my main character and Burn fighting a Shek warrior on a roof with some training katanas for the time being so hopefully theyll be able to stand up for themselves a little better soon. I think Ill go try to slay some river raptors and bandits in a little while. Picked up some of those thieves backpacks so fighting while holding lots of food and first aid kits wont be a problem. Thanks for all the advice.,Kenshi,dbt77wg,1,t5_2td4i
