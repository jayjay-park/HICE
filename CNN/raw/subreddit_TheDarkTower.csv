333307,0,t3_1xws23,I recently finished my quest to the Tower as well and I loved the ending. Like you I think the events at the top of the Tower are an opportunity.  I see it as Rolands personal journey towards enlightenment. The fact that he has the horn indicates that he is indeed progressing. I loosely equate it to Groundhog Day Roland keeps making the journey over and over until he improves himself enough to move on to the next plane of existence. Gan is giving him the opportunity to better himself each time. but thats just my take. After giving it some time to simmer I plan to go back and relive the journey  ,TheDarkTower,cffbg7w,10,t5_2run7

As a joke he let her see the green orb and when she looked in she gained an insane amount of knowledge on history culture and society explaining her bardic knowledges.

2661570,0,t3_2qgjrk,Im actually extremely fond of Walters death as he succumbs to his own hubris by underestimating a damn baby. As an arrogant trickster he doesnt deserve the noble death a duel with Roland or any of the katet would provide. Getting offed quickly and humiliatingly is everything he deserves and Im glad thats how he went. Mordreds death does kinda totally suck nuggets though. And in regard to the Crimson Kings death well from a writers perspective I absolutely love it as a culmination of all the metafictional work King does in books   and  and I love it for its simplicity. I agree that it isnt viscerally satisfying in the way that we want but it forces us to understand that the bad guy has more or less been Roland the entire time with Walter the CK Mordred Blaine TickTock Man the Wolves whomever are only seen because Roland is dragging himself and his friends through these dangerous encounters time and time again. The death of the CK to me reinforces the ideas that are laid out in the coda and it serves as a reminder that Roland has done no one any favors by dragging them through Mid and EndWorld and that while the katet may love Roland and may have loved the adventure they are all ultimately killed on their levels of the tower and most likely in the keystone world as welleasily erased from their parts of the towerand are left to live out their replacement lives on a lesser level and with no memory of the man and the journey that brought them together. To me the ending isnt bad because of how easily the CK is killed.To me the ending isnt sad because of Roland having to go back to the Mohaine but because Eddie Suze Oy and Jake lose the only real family theyd had left even if they are all together drinking Nozzala around the warm comforting Toren hearth. ,TheDarkTower,cn5ztfy,15,t5_2run7

2931677,0,t3_2tq0op,Hello I think someone already explained that at then end of The Dark Tower and Roland is reset he is sent not back in time but back to the beginning of his quest through the desert. If you reread especially The Gunslinger you will notice that Roland in The Gunslinger is not the Roland that is in The Waste Lands I believe this is because his mind is still reeling from coming through the door at the top of the Tower. So all the things that have happened havent yet and he has to proceed through them all. As far as there being a purpose to the loop that is for you to decide remember this is  a story and all the meaning you take out of it is for you. The things SK might intend may not be what you pick up on and you may pick up on things he did not intend so dont get hung up on what does this mean because that is for you to decide. What does it mean for you that Roland must relive his quest? Do you think the fact that he has the Horn changes the quest in future iterations? All that being said like SK says its not about the ending but about how you go there. You should reread them it almost more fun than the first time around!,TheDarkTower,co1cdfp,1,t5_2run7

By the way I hate the Detta honky mafa portions of the book. They are cringe inducing. I hope King finds them embarrassing. But either way they are basically irrelevant. There is no way Sony is going to make that a major portion of big budget film. I think that if they make a giant change like casting Elba they will lose a big chunk of their fans. Being willing to make a huge change like that is indicative of a general attitude of holding the original work as only a loose guideline.

6677876,0,t3_473sdd,Spoilers below. TV show and Book. Proceed at your own risk. Im sorta kinda enjoying the show so far. I did not like the first episode the second is better and more like the book. Though it has lost much of the nuances from the book. Though they are kinda bringing it in through some of the flashback scenes. I didnt like how Sadie was already introduced in the first episode and how her character was handled. They changed from Maine to Tennessee for some reason. The build up and story about Harry Dunning in Maine was an integral part of the story and it seems they are glossing over it. It also sets up the harmonizing past idea. It also ties in with IT which is also getting a remake soon. Also they changed the color of his car. While minor I dont like it. I really hope they dont skimp out on his time in Jodie or in Florida. This was what made the story. I found myself not caring about what happened to Kennedy but more about Sadie and George and Deacon. However looking at the cast list on IMDB and Wikipedia it seems they are going to. There are quite a few main characters in the book that arent listed on the cast list. And I thought they were at one point. Franco is doing an amazing job as Jake. Though why they didnt use the George Emberson name is beyond me. Also the fact he has an IPhone bugs me. It was a small detail in the book how he was till rocking the flip phone but an important one. The dude they got to play AL is the way I imagined him. The actor that plays old Harry Dunning is how I imagined him to be. The Yellow Card Man is not done in a good way so far. He played more of a role in the beginning as well as throughout the story. Ive not heard any reference to the JimLa yet which also bugs me. So far I think Ill enjoy it. But it remains to be seen if I think it is a good adaptation.  is my favorite non Tower book by King so far. It took the place of The Talisman and Black House. The ending was amazing. What I will say is if this is how the Dark Tower movie will be treated slight differences while keeping the same feel. I think Ill enjoy that as well. ,TheDarkTower,d0a1u2w,5,t5_2run7

7629279,0,t1_d35uqxg,Thats not really the point.  The point is Odetta developed in her mind what is essentially a caricature of an angry black woman.  She has internal conflicts with her identity and race as a welloff socially conscious black woman.I think Odetta feels like an outsider or an imposter.  She feels weak and tame by her condition and upbringing .  She is a victim of racism but she has little connection to the struggles of other people of her race.Odetta is the uncle Tom.The Detta character she creates is the direct opposite of that or the rejection of all of that.  That relationship is very much intentional on the part of King and complex.  Detta is simultaneously a racist incarnation and a defense against that same racism that informs the character.This is why Im critical of the Elba casting.  Race issues in the book arent as simple as honk mahfah like some people claim.There is a lot of complex layering involved that I think is undermined for what seems like a pretty heavyhanded political reason.,TheDarkTower,d39ep81,6,t5_2run7

8815383,0,t1_d77f6ky,I dont disagree with you but if the near infinite possibilities are all canon on some level of the tower or some iteration of the journey then any talk of whats canon and whats not is moot. As for me I guess Im most interested in what went through Steven Kings head as he constructed the world. As for the fact that Mordred inherited his spidery side from somewhere I guess I dont see Mordreds nature as being so...genetic. King uses spiders as his goto ultimate evil creature fairly often see Pennywise for instance it could just be shorthand for his evil nature. However Im noticing that in the Dark Tower concordance which King did depend on to write the books it says that the Crimson King has a true dual forms that vacillates between a Satanic redeyed Santa Claus and a scuttling spider. So I think youre right but in having trouble identifying if the Crimson Kings spider form ever manifests in any book. I dont remember Insomnia that well could the spider form be in that book? Or was this an idea that King never used and Robin Furth picked up and ran with for the comics?,TheDarkTower,d77hmba,2,t5_2run7

But it is definitely different from the rest.I would recommend giving the second book a solid try. It becomes very different very quickly. If by the middle or end of book  its still not grabbing you thats probably the sign to stop. But there is a reason why the authors notes at the beginning of the first book says that King was always finding himself wanting to tell people to skip the first book because of the exact reason youre running into. It just fails to grab many peoples attention.Personally I think the first book might be my favorite in the series though the fourth rivals it... but again its a very divisive book even among the fanbase to the point that even the author has acknowledged the change of tone and pace moving into the rest of the series.,TheDarkTower,dg29idw,2,t5_2run7
