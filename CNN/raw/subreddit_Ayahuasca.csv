1227703,0,t1_ci7pmfv,gt And I say that with all sincerity. Bullshit. Your ego is prompting you to use whatever slippery justifications you can to stay the way you are. You came to us with your story. I gave you my interpretation of it. You are free to accept or reject that according to its truth for you by which I mean its actual truth not how much it offends your selfimage. You are also free to check it with others get other opinions.However you instead are trying to argue with me about whether or not I have the right to suggest anything to you. Youre trying to induce me to reject my interpretation on your behalf to withdraw it so that it doesnt hurt you. You are now fighting to try to get to be my healer although your advice comes from the place of pain and if followed would draw me into your darkness. Your ego is telling you that Im patronizing you that I know nothing about you and suggesting to you that you be patronizing and insincere at me to make me go away and stop threatening it.This is why you have the problems you have. This is why you cheaped out and why you ran away. You fundamentally fear facing up to things. You sabotaged your own process. You found out that ayahuasca would show you things that you didnt want to be shown so you ran away from it. Im telling you things you dont want to be told so I am now the enemy that has to be brought down so that you dont have to listen to me. I suspect that this happens to you in various ways often.Youre framing this interaction of ours as a clash of egos  as if it is a power relationship and youre feeling like Ive unfairly exercised power over you. I have no power over you. I cant make you do anything. All I am doing here is holding up the mirror. Look into it. Stop grabbing at it and trying to turn it around.,Ayahuasca,ci7qgb7,0,t5_2s8ss

2043345,0,t3_2i785b,What sort of realizations did you have?  I ask because I wonder if you were supposed to make some behavior or life changes to follow through with it and perhaps you havent.Or can consider diet and environment since then too.Many people seem to believe that the days after an Aya session a person tends to be very open and suggestible to other peoples energy.  It all sounds very woo woo but I think there is something to it in that if you want to really move forward you have to be mindful of who you surround yourself with the attitudes you cultivate etc.Feeling the oneness that psychadelics can help us tune into is wonderful but integrating that feeling into our own life can indeed be really difficult.  The point is to remember that the unity of things is always there and the power of experience is always with you in every moment if you only know how to look for it.Perhaps now would be an excellent time to start on some meditation.  I thought Waking Up by Sam Harris to be an excellent primer but there are many out there.The point is that the investigation into consciousness and reality you start with ayahuasca needs to remain part of your life even when not on ayahuasca.I hope that helps gl.,Ayahuasca,ckzjyuq,4,t5_2s8ss

3428440,0,t3_2zhqvc,If you havent done anything but smoked I really wouldnt go trekking afterwards. It can be a lot of process even if you are a seasoned user. I did two ceremonies over the course of three days I was completely fine after both of my trips. My girlfriend on the other hand who is a seasoned user of psychedelics had a really rough time with the medicine the second night and it took her a few days to fully recover. I would give yourself a few nights to process the experience and decompress back into waking life a bit more. I really wouldnt underestimate the potency of ayahuasca.  As for people having somewhat terrifying trips both nights I had people partaking in the ceremony that not really taken psychedelic substances before and they got through. When we were sharing our experiences the next day they revealed that they had some pretty scary visuals giant spider eating them bugs eating their eyes and this was combined with consistent vomiting and in one case one man even pooped his pants. Its a solely personal experience though. The only guarantee is that there is no guarantee that you will have a bad trip or a good one within those three ceremonies. There are people that have never taken any psychedelics and have cleared through a lot of their mental emotional and spiritual baggage and there are also people that have taken a lot of substances and have suppressed these experiences that need to be brought to light lol. Funny enough youre the one that knows best if theres stuff that needs to be addressed and sometimes you have no idea at all. Just go into it with reverence to yourself for the experience you are about to take in and reverence for the medicine and its ability to help you heal. Sorry if it got a bit rambley but I dont recommend trekking right after at all. Feel free to message me if you have any question as I also did it in Peru.,Ayahuasca,cpj2g4l,6,t5_2s8ss

The authors advise caution.In the  article MAOI Contraindications published in the MAPS newsletter Savinelli and Halpern fail to distinguish between MAOA and MAOB inhibition even though the article is ayahuascacentric.Jonathon Ott wrote a lengthy reply its interesting but not authoritative. He puts too much stock in his own ability to eat tyraminecontaining foods. Clearly caution here too is advisable.

4823855,0,t3_3gwoc7,A lot of the taboo surrounding menstruation probably comes from religious and social reasons and might not be directly related to the effects of the medicine. Many cultures consider women who are menstruating unclean or something along these lines and that is the only reason why they are excluded from group ceremonies. An experienced curandera I am familiar with specifically includes and welcomes women who are having their period to her ceremonies sometimes giving special thanks during the ceremony for the fact that there is a menstruating woman in the group.  The counterargument is that menstruation is a time where a lot is going on in the body something is lost a lot of energy for lack of a better word is being moved and the experience might therefore be more difficult  some even say more dangerous  during menstruation than otherwise. But any experienced shaman will be able to deal with any difficulty that comes up during a ceremony.

5305236,0,t1_cvp5g5f,think of in the Jungian sense. Mother Ayahuasca both does and doesnt exist as an independent external entity  she is the manifestation of an archetype which are models that exist at the collective unconscious level of the psyche and communicate via symbolism amp visions.Shamanism IMHO is the process of using entheogens to break down the veil of paroketh  the preconscious  so that you can communicate directly with these archetypes. if your subconscious wants to communicate with you it will utilize an archetype that represents the qualities of the information in question.so in one sense Mother Ayahusaca only exists in your mind. however due to the fact that objective reality doesnt really exist its actually just the shared  consensus attributes of all subjective realities information from your own psyche can manifest in the external world in your own outside universe. nothing really exists outside your mind. so archetypes can manifest in ways that effectively makes them external objective entities and they appear to be in the physical universe because technically they are.Mother Ayahuasca is probably the same archetype that manifests as Mary Venus Isis etc.  she represents the same qualities. she can communicate internally and externally. but theyre both the same thing really because theyre just  sides of the same coin  sides of a division that doesnt really exist.its easy to think of those archetypes as deities because of the fact that they usually manifest as outside entities.so at the end of the day it doesnt matter if you believe that theyre internal or external entities because theyre gonna do their own thing anyway.,Ayahuasca,cvpt0b6,2,t5_2s8ss

5712553,0,t3_3t7hhk,From the Vimalakirti SutraSariputra Goddess what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?Goddess Although I have sought my female state for these twelve years I have not yet found it. Reverend Sariputra if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic would you ask her What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?Sariputra No! Such a woman would not really exist so what would there be to transform?Goddess Just so reverend Sariputra all things do not really exist. Now would you think What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?Thereupon the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Sariputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the goddess transformed into Sariputra said to Sariputra transformed into a goddess Reverend Sariputra what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?And Sariputra transformed into the goddess replied I no longer appear in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! I do not know what to transform!The goddess continued If the elder could again change out of the female state then all women could also change out of their female states. All women appear in the form of women in just the same way as the elder appears in the form of a woman. While they are not women in reality they appear in the form of women. With this in mind the Buddha said In all things there is neither male nor female.Then the goddess released her magical power and each returned to his ordinary form. She then said to himReverend Sariputra what have you done with your female form?Sariputra I neither made it nor did I change it.Goddess Just so all things are neither made nor changed and that they are not made and not changed that is the teaching of the Buddha.Sariputra Goddess where will you be born when you transmigrate after death?Goddess I will be born where all the magical incarnations of the Tathagata are born.Sariputra But the emanated incarnations of the Tathagata do not transmigrate nor are they born.Goddess All things and living beings are just the same they do not transmigrate nor are they born!Sariputra Goddess how soon will you attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood?Goddess At such time as you elder become endowed once more with the qualities of an ordinary individual then will I attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood.Sariputra Goddess it is impossible that I should become endowed once more with the qualities of an ordinary individual.Goddess Just so reverend Sariputra it is impossible that I should attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood! Why? Because perfect enlightenment stands upon the impossible. Because it is impossible no one attains the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood.Sariputra But the Tathagata has declared The Tathagatas who are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges have attained perfect Buddhahood are attaining perfect Buddhahood and will go on attaining perfect Buddhahood.Goddess Reverend Sariputra the expression the Buddhas of the past present and future is a conventional expression made up of a certain number of syllables. The Buddhas are neither past nor present nor future.Their enlightenment transcends the three times! But tell me elder have you attained sainthood?Sariputra It is attained because there is no attainment.Goddess Just so there is perfect enlightenment because there is no attainment of perfect enlightenment.Then the Licchavi Vimalakirti said to the venerable elder Sariputra Reverend Sariputra this goddess has already served ninetytwo million billion Buddhas. She plays with the superknowledges. She has truly succeeded in all her vows. She has gained the tolerance of the birthlessness of things. She has actually attained irreversibility. She can live wherever she wishes on the strength of her vow to develop living beings.,Ayahuasca,cx57576,3,t5_2s8ss

San Pedro is gentler more heartopening medicine and you get to be one with the warm fractal ooze of existence for a day. Very refreshing. Also great for microdosing every few days when you get home subperceptual doses to build up some contentment with life. The cactus is legal in the states and fairly easy to prepare.

This is quite a well known phenomenon though it is unfortunately not talked about enough.  I personally have witnessed over a dozen cases of this in various degrees people having visions of things that simply arent true things that just dont add up.  Above all Ive experienced it myself.  More than once Ive got visions about things got super excited and months later realized I was totally delusional.  It happens it sucks and it would especially suck if I hurt someone close to me by following my vision.My close friend has been working on an ayahusca retreat in Peru for years.  We recently had a conversation about all the things hes seen go wrong.  I mean hes seen a lot go wrong we just talked about a few instances where people got visions about meeting a soul mate.  One woman left her husband for a guy she met on retreat because she had visions about it.  Shortly after it was a mess.  The guy ended up being awful it lasted less than a month.  She deeply regretted leaving her husband.  This stuff happens and people caught up in it deserve our sympathy and respect and not us trying to accuse them of playing victim.My post is a bit harsh because yours was harsh.  I swear usually Im a lot nicer.  But seriously be careful about this victim blaming bullshit.  You can really throw people into shame or guilt any number of unnecessary states that arent helpful to their growth.  The key here is that shes honest with herself honest with how she feels.  She feels betrayed?  Thats fine let her feel that process it and be true to herself.  Thats how people heal by being honest with themselves.  If they are feeling negative then they need to process that not switch to positive.And just listing her feelings as negative is a judgment in itself.  Its OK to feel horrible and its totally necessary sometimes.  This is how people grow and mature.  Its literally growing pains.  To deny ones difficult feelings and switch to a positive state of mind is to repress ones truth.  And then it ends up unacknowledged in your shadow and it can get heavy and manifest in sickness or anger or any number of ways.  Real spiritual work is not about being positive.  Its about coming into reality.  Its about fully accepting everything without judgment.  To judge things as good and bad positive and negative thats just further fracturing your sense of self.  Were trying to work towards wholeness were trying to be honest with where we are at.  We are not trying to be positive to think positive because thats still only one side were ignoring a whole other side of reality and that always leads to problems.Im extremely weary of your claim of being highly spiritually trained or educated.  Did you read the secret and now your a spiritual guide?  Why dont you try reading a real book about spirituality like Cutting Through Spiritual Materialsm by Chogyam Trungpa or When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron or Touching Enlightmentment by Reginald Ray.These books speak to the dangers of denying ones difficult feelings they talk about the importance of acknowledging ourselves fully and deeply honestly.  Acknowledging our deepest truths as ugly and uncomfortable as they are.  Anyways I hope you pick up one of those books and realize how dangerous it is to simply go positive and deny difficult feelings.  That is not how people heal.,Ayahuasca,d0y7zuq,9,t5_2s8ss

Then to find out how long you need to stay off the meds before ceremony look up the med in Wikipedia and find out the halflife and multiply it by .  Also if there is a contraindication stay off the med for  hours after the ceremony. As for allergic reactions to ayahuasca they seem to be extremely rare but the strategy you describe would work if you are concerned.,Ayahuasca,d31h9fg,2,t5_2s8ss

I wish I could talk to someone else who was in between like me.Hey whats up.    New age types who wave crystals around and think they can divine some truth from a deck of cards and such confuse people and muddy the waters.  You dont have to believe everything that other people say is spiritual.  Skeptics and rationalists have an extremely limited perspective and usually dont even understand Science they say they believe in.  But how do you know when something is true?  Serious question. The most important question maybe? How do you detect a lie how do you know when youre reading something that is bullshit when its false a mirage smoke and mirrors?  You can see and know what you need to without drugs   I guess some people might need help but not everyone does.  They can just get real with themselves.  When you believe in things you dont understand then you suffer.  Superstition aint the way.,Ayahuasca,d3fo14w,1,t5_2s8ss

8141893,0,t3_4qpjo6,Asking legitimate and important questions such as these is not a bother whatsoever. Your situation is quite unique. It is possible for ayahuasca to cause a psychotic break. The only way I would recommend working with ayahuasca for you is with a strict extended dieta at a retreat center. This would ensure an beneficial and safe environment for ceremonies as well as plenty of time for integration. ,Ayahuasca,d4va5rs,2,t5_2s8ss
8261576,0,t3_4slde1,Wow seriously? Arrogant much?You werent even drinking Ayahuasca. Rue seeds and Mimosa bark are NOT the same as Ayahuasca vine and Chacruna leaves! The effects are not the same the spirit and vibe of the experience isnt the same. Rue was much different for me than the experience of Ayahuasca has been. And the spirit of Syrian Rue even recommended that I work with Ayahuasca instead.Ayahuasca certainly has a powerful spirit very loving and motherly at that and has helped me overcome the very worst of my depression and anxiety and has forced to me really look at who I am and want to be. Ayahuasca has caused me to awaken in a very powerful spiritual ways often through uncomfortable journeys. I relish it though because I am a far more positive person now than I was before. Ayahuascas power is not an illusion at all.Youre experience does not apply to anothers just as my experience does not apply to you.Please think before you make extreme presumptions.,Ayahuasca,d5a970d,4,t5_2s8ss

9075166,0,t3_54hxvg,If you feel the call go for it. But also trust your gut If your gut tells you no it may not be the right time. Before i did ayahuasca Cannabis was never very psychedelic for me. After it became very psychedelic. I also ended up quitting cannabis If you are worried you can ask for smaller cup at first. In Colombia they often have allnigh ceremonies till the morning So youll get the chance to drink multiple times. I was dead scared before my first ceremony but it changed me in ways i couldnt dream of.  Its a good idea to do it in a guided ceremony but do ALLOT of research on the centerretreat you want to go. There is allot of bad ones but thats more a problem in Peru. Just dont expect Ayahuasca to be a magic bullet. She can show you the way but its ultimately you that need to do the work for it to have long term benefit. And even if it is not a recreational drug You are allowed to enjoy it. And it can be extremely enjoyable but also can be hardthough work. And you need to be able to let go...... ,Ayahuasca,d82orqv,1,t5_2s8ss

9758710,0,t1_daftt4q,I just wanna say that I was never trying to play the helpless victim card here Ive already admitted that my bad judgement helped put me in a vulnerable position. In fact Im perfectly fine with taking part of the blame for putting my own safety at risk. It doesnt matter to me either way. And I agree that poor choices can get you in with bad people.But none of that changes the fact that the shaman and the agency also share part of the blame and that a crime was committed against me not the other way around. The shaman obviously is a creep. And I very clearly signed up and paid for the ayahuasca ceremony that was on the agencys website and they didnt deliver that. After all that Leonard said to me about how trustworthy his shaman is why isnt he answering his phone now? He was very responsive until when I felt in danger with the shaman and tried to call him. And then complete silence. I think its perfectly fair for me to post here against trusting these guys with ayahuasca. ,Ayahuasca,dafz9us,4,t5_2s8ss

You can learn and grow from both.Although I experienced the healing presence a couple of times the biggest help I got was from a voice inside me. When things got difficult to handle thats the voice that told me what to do and showed me how to heal myself. I would say its definitely worth a try.

11610614,0,t3_65nuvp,Glaucoma is painful and in the longterm debilitating due to the loss of sight however it is a treatable condition that modern medical science has well under control. A diagnosis is a good thing your mother has been experiencing the symptoms already and now she and her doctors know what the symptoms are and can take action to treat it.Im not meaning to dismiss it or be unsympathetic glaucoma is a serious problem. However it seems to me that horrible and tragic news would be along the lines of a death or a serious major injury and unexpected implies an accident or no prior symptoms of any kind as can happen with some types of cancer. I suggest that you absolutely would benefit from serious consideration for yourself ideally during the ayahuasca ceremony of why it is that your mother receiving a diagnosis of a disease she has presumably suffered for some time and may have suspected for some time as the primary symptoms are wellknown occurs this way to you. There is something going on in your parentchild relationship that you dont consciously know about and would be better off if you did.Also lots of puking is part of the real healing.
