I am looking to buy a car paying monthly over a  monthish period. I want a car thats around  but as expected I cant seem to find a reasonable insurance quote anywhere. Just wondering whether anyones had any joy? Both my parents who would be on the insurance havent got any claims etc I live in a registered D area according to the insurance area bands I can keep my mileage below  and keep my car on my driveway. Just wondering whether people gone with NFU and basically good companies who could do a reasonable quote.,HealthcarePricing,d0zcfxi,1,t5_2yk0c
