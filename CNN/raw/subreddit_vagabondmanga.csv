7799619,0,t1_d2y5mra,bit late never realized there was a sub for this. Could not agree with you more. Absolutely love the rice paddy arc with Musashi and Kojiros story was finally kicking off until the hiatus. My brother got put off by it cause of the lack of action and the farming which seems boring to some. Im completely the opposite although i really enjoyed the fights i must say that musashis spiritual growth through cultivating rice paddies and helping out the villagers just seems to fit perfectly into his journey. Its a shame the hiatus has cut Kojiros story short just before it got going. Really hope he doesnt decide to give up on Vagabond cant say i enjoy his new manga REAL not my style.For the art however i have to disagree slightly. Dont know why but the more a reread the last arc the more the art grows on me. Granted its not as detailed as the rest but somehow it starts very weak and slowly gets better almost matching his understanding of the rice paddies. Especially since the last few chapters the art seems to almost be back to par. ,vagabondmanga,d3sqkua,3,t5_2z1lg
