Reason for this is that you can unlock several MT modules for free from the HTs if you properly plan it out.That said I dont mind the Chinese stuff on occasion.  The T has an ok gun if you stick with the mm low pen but decent reload and accuracy but I found the mm to just be too slow and inaccurate to be of much use.  The IS is more of a second line HT as it has an excessive reload until the second mm while also not having that reliable of armor.But even with all of that I still find the tanks decent to play.  Also the LT line can be pretty fun but take a bit to get used to.  Great camo and viable gun choices mm for more dpmcounterscouting mm for more pen and more reliable damage against higher tiered targets.,RDDT7,cuvtiqa,1,t5_2vsfd
