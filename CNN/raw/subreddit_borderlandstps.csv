745922,0,t3_22oikm,It sounds as though Wilhelms skill tree will actually add robotic parts to his body. In other words youll make him change from mostlyhuman to something more akin to what we fight in BL source devs. Gearbox has also stated that hell have a shouldermounted cannon and also be able to digistruct minions Id assume repairattack drones.Please let Nisha have a sniper tree. Please. Andor a skag mount as was used by her Deputies in BL.Claptrap is short which the devs say will be a bonus in terms of a smaller targetable body. It will also change his viewpoint a bit so you actually see the game from a lowertotheground perspective.His skill tree should make him kinda crappy at opening doors keep him from running out of oxygen robot and reduce damage taken explaining why he was such a fun torture toy for Captain Flynt. In BL he also gets a module that turns him invisible.I think I read or saw somewhere that Claptrap is the most mechanicsdriven of the characters so he should make for fun experimentation.Sad that we dont have a siren to play this goround.,borderlandstps,cgp2ga3,2,t5_31a9r
