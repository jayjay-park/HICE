11054865,0,t3_5xuzfy,Hes got such a charming face.  Im glad to hear that hes doing better now! I know thats been a lot of hard work on your part and his. Its great to hear that its possible for them to be more confident and comfortable outside. ,reactivedogs,del1tlv,3,t5_3jbj2

11081113,0,t1_deo113u,Thats probably what I should have done but instead I thought oh ffs theyre just squirrels and decided to power through it anyway. It went...okay.,reactivedogs,deo18qs,1,t5_3jbj2
11082896,0,t3_5y3j7q,I read through the website a while ago and did the previous version with our older dog. As others have said it works really great if you have access to safe environmentsscenarios to practice. With our older dog it turned out that there was an outdoor agility class at the park behind our condo and the park was onleash only so we could walkjog the couple miles to the agility class and then very gradually get closer and practice staying under threshold. Unfortunately now that we live in CA and not VA we literally cannot find anywhere where people dont let their dogs off leash even where its illegal and we keep running into at largeloose dogs which is a dangerous situation for everyone. Honestly the environmental difference and my inability to keep him feeling safe was enough to have made me consider whether we should keep him or not. Im fully convinced if we still lived in VA he would never have actually become reactive in the first place  ,reactivedogs,deo8it1,1,t5_3jbj2

11365422,0,t1_dfjyn1g,Thats good. My dog freaked out with a mesh muzzle but loves he basket muzzle. I just kept feeding him treats out of it. Id put it in my hand and then add treats. Id let all me dog take treats so he saw that they werent afraid of it. I did that at random times for a couple of weeks. Then Id put it on him without buckling it and give him more treats. I did that for a few days. The first time I buckled it on him I had someone help me. As I was buckling it they put a spoon full of peanut better in the gap for treats. Not sure if the Morrco has that a wider gap near the mouth. We did that a few times. Once he got that the muzzle meant limitless peanut better he was all in. I make sure to use it and treat him out it at random times so he doesnt just associate it nail trims and vet visits. ,reactivedogs,dfk8yzb,1,t5_3jbj2
11445201,0,t1_dfsdg51,Well no I wouldnt go back to the first trainer.  I went to her website because looking at trainers and wanted to see how she described herself.  The different philosophies are confusing.Ive been at it for a while so I have no illusions about meds.  I know the point is to bring down the reaction and wont solve his issues.  With everything we try I hope for that magic pill but I know its not realistic.  I posted the long list we tried on one of those Monday threads.  Right now hes on Paxil.I would have no problem being given the tools and working with them if the tools worked.  But the fire in his brain when he sees a trigger is so great that nothing works.,reactivedogs,dftaxh6,2,t5_3jbj2
11492342,0,t1_dfyn6qg,We survived but I definitely had some mean things I wanted to say to this dude. ,reactivedogs,dfynmdn,1,t5_3jbj2
11580499,0,t1_dg8ngqg,Yes but I would probably call my vets office for a recommendation. Its important to get a good one. ,reactivedogs,dg8nmup,3,t5_3jbj2
11684052,0,t3_66odwo,This annoys me so much too!  I had the same situation yesterday.  I was talking with a neighbor and we were just sitting on a park bench.  My smaller dog who is reactive to bigger dogs was leashed and sitting on my lap.Out of no where comes this big yellow lab that my dog has had a bad experience with before comes charging in our direction off leash.  My dog starts to get tense and I immediately shove a high value treat into her mouth to calm her down.  The owners of the lab are no where to be found they are around the corner much farther behind their dog.  My dog starts to growl to warn the other dog not to get close but she keeps coming closer.  Now my dog is cornered no where to run sitting on my lap and she starts to bark loudly.  The freakin lab keeps coming closer and closer like a dumbass who doesnt recognize dog etiquette.  Next thing you know my dog is barking her head off and finally the owners are in view and call their lab back to them.  And now Im the one with an aggressive dog with no manners?  F those owners.  If I had seen them coming I would have just left.  But somehow they think its okay to have their friendly dog just run around free range.  They know my dog doesnt like their dog but they dont seem to care.  Sorry for venting in your thread.  Just wanted to share that I know your frustration.  Its awful.  It sounds like you have a great dog!,reactivedogs,dgkekob,2,t5_3jbj2
