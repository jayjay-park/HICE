1816642,0,t1_ck7dkrg,I dont want to take focus away from OPs post but I feel like that line deserves some elaboration. Humor and lightheartedness can help better a bad situation but emotional intimacy is the glue that actually keeps two people together. And emotional intimacy cant completely form until youve experienced all the shades of someone and all the shades of yourself. In some cases two peoples love has to be on the verge of ultimate severance until they realize the love that they have for each other.,UnsentLetters,ck8370x,1,t5_2seir

Learn to love your home for yourself not because it pleases others. Youll feel more at home and better about yourself in return. Youll connect with others better if your house and you are more true to things you enjoy. Working out isnt for other people its for you.  Maybe train for ks for charity. Or work your way up to marathons or triathlons. Youll meet plenty of like minded men or women that way. And if they do come to your home they want to see a reflection of you not of a magazine you found.Take pride in your own stile.

Looking back I shouldnt have agreed to stay over.He went into this situation knowing that this was the sort of behavior that fed my crush that made me hurt when we hit critical mass every  months and I felt like I had to ask him what the hell was going on between us.I recently pushed Danny away from me because I needed to let my crush die. I have absolutely made mistakes with how Ive interacted with him and Im actively working to make sure I never make the same mistakes again.Looking back he has pulled so much bullshit both on me and on the other women he interacts with.  Everyone Ive talked to about this says that hes too intimate with women in general that it makes them uncomfortable.  Were getting his roommate to talk to him about it because unfortunately he wouldnt take us seriously.This was the one situation that makes me the most uncomfortable.  When I agreed to sleep over with him I was agreeing to share a mattress.  He was the one who turned it intimate.  He took it beyond what was appropriate for friends despite knowing that I was trusting him to be my guide for what was okay for friends to do.  Ive only realized two days ago how inappropriate of him that was.Basically tldr I made mistakes with him but for this and so many other situations he has been in the wrong.,UnsentLetters,cm8o5sl,1,t5_2seir

Donate those books to a library put them in little free libraries around town if there are any in your area or sell them to a used bookstore if you feel like you want them gone.

I always leave our visits crying because ill miss him but with sore sides.Even though I didnt know this friend very long its been a long time since I had someone who made me laugh so much.

Broke up with me because according to him I had become too needy during a period of unemployment job let go half the staff because of cutbacks. True I was a little down on myself but not to the extent he would want to believe. Anyway about  months later we end up running into each other and kinda started dating again. This time living apart. Everything was going better than before. I would go stay a night or two but both of us had plenty of me time something I believed greatly contributed to the last fall out. He was actually fun to hang out with. Not the stress ball he was previously. He was very busy with projects and I began to notice time we spent together became less and less. Then about three months ago I said something minor he didnt like and ltPoof!gt He ghost me again did the same the first time blocked me on all social media leaving me for more of the heartbreak I painfully endured just last year. I KNEW I shouldnt have began seeing him after the first time but I had always thought he was the one. That he could never fit into the mold of the normal relationship and rules of engagement. Again... Here I sit night after night broken hearted wondering why he hasnt contacted me. It sucks. Prepare yourself.,UnsentLetters,d5fh8bj,1,t5_2seir

Doesnt stop me from feeling remorse for being spineless during our relationship. Ive thought about talking about it other times but after about a year or so it feels like the window of opportunity passed.I think one of the big reasons Im thinking about this is I am in a very serious relationship now and I think back on this in hindsight realising I should have done better.

11487481,0,t3_63ybdo,Send this girls regrets. The only impediments to happiness are our own involuntary restrictions on open and honest communication. I hope to not rant EDIT Failed sorry but what Ive learned in the last  years here is how fucking stupid I was for spending the first  unwilling to spew out my goddamn brains and feelings. Maybe had I done just that I wouldnt be always an instant away from blowing my own fucking brains out.Youre fucking dead wrong re your belief that you cant confess that nobody wants to listen.Its possible that this is exactly true  that indeed your person doesnt want to listen. Well guess what you arent going to feel better until youre true to yourself and find out definitively. What if youre wrong? If youre wrong you get what you want and they listen. If youre right you realize what an uncaring piece of shit asshole they are and suddenly have fuel to rise above. You have ultimate certainty.I used to think exactly that. She doesnt want to listen to this boys regrets. Guess what I learned? It turns out during the first  years of separation she did. During year  she moved on and began new relationships. At the end of year  here I am with the same fucking regrets only now exasperated with additional years. You are dead wrong about thinking you can just selfsacrifice and hold it in. You want to know what holding it in and being stoic by sacrificing your interests and your own need to express yourself looks like? It looks like me.I frequent rsanctionedsuicide. It isnt a question of if its a question of when. I will kill myself someday. I wasnt always this way.lawlyer will die by lawlyers hand. Maybe it will happen when diagnosed with a terminal illness. Maybe family will be able to cope better because of said terminal illness. I dont know. I guess theres a chance I drop dead of a heartattack or die in a car accident and if so Id be lucky for sparing my family additional pain for selfinfliction caused by a death. But Im not that lucky. Most likely it will be a cancer diagnosis. Or if my parents die first then maybe Ill feel free. Or fuck it maybe Ill die on impulse one late night while intoxicated. The only thing stopping me from that so far is not owning gun and fear that my AC vent cant hold a noose. I dont want to tie the rope to my balcony because children and other neighbors will be outside and it could be possibly traumatic. The best way will most likely be to purchase a firearm call  and then blow my brains out in the bathtub. It is the safest way to spare those in my life from immediate trauma. Ive been thinking about death for so long that it at this point seems inevitable that it will be me who kills me. And most likely even the cancer will be self inflicted from alcoholism chain smoking or chewing tobacco.Ive browsed unsent letters searching for answers for five motherfucking years. For the first four of them all I had to do was pick up the goddamn phone and call her. I didnt because I was a goddamn coward. Afraid of additional pain and misery I accepted the current pain and misery. The secret to ridding yourself from it is to be real and honest from the get go. No more dilly dally.Pick up your fucking phone right now. Call them. Say what you want to say. Your potential path splits depending upon their reaction. You get A or you get B. Maybe C D E. idk depends on your situation.Regardless you get an answer. You know where Im at  years after trying to be a man and suck it up and ignore my pain? Im still exactly where I started except this time Im tired and frustrated. Im tired of stagnated. Im tired of not making any progress.Sometimes you have to get worse before you can feel better. In the case of long term relationships Ive learned  or perhaps relationships in general  is that unless you take a deep breath and rip off the bandaid you will never move beyond your current state and instead continue to resent yourself for failing to remove the bandaid.Im sorry for the rant. Just its been FIVE FUCKING YEARS. I DONT EVEN KNOW WHO SHE IS ANYMORE BECAUSE I NEVER TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO REPAIR AND TRY AND FIND OUT.OP do not be like me. Act today. Tomorrow at the latest but that cant be a regular concession. Be open and real and see what happens. I can tell you write now that if this was written by my person I would be elated. Our ability to communicate was such complete utter horseshit. Im going to take my own advice and call her with a restricted number because mine is blocked right now and leave a voice mail. I am justy so fucking tired of this purgatorylike limbo continuing. OH MY FUYCKING GOD I ONLY WANT TO DIE BECAUSE IT IS UNCEASING IT NEVER ENDS AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT FELT LIKE ANYMORE TO BE RID OF IT. I am literally being driven insane because of my inaction and because I for a time wrongfully assumed that this boys regrets were merely a burden too.No. Fuck that. Be real to yourself today because tomorrow you might have the chance. And then youre left with regrets for failing to confess your previous regrets when you had a chance.FFS uthrowawayrn now Im fired up.. Send confirmation that you acted. You cannot begin to understand how frustrated and volatile I am re past failure to act. Fucking act. Dont make the same goddamn mistake I did. I will try to act now but at this point I know Im only one attempted communication away from a restraining order. Hah and before you judge me know that Ive never done anything. I never drove to her house her work called her. All I did was occasionally send shitty walls of text in my most vulnerable moments at  am while drunk.ACT. NOW. I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU REPEAT MY MISTAKES IM GOING TO SHIT A BRICK. I DONT EVEN KNOW YOU. ACT GODDAMNIT.The benefit to acting is that if you succeed you get what you want. If you fail you have certainty that you didnt. It is infinitely better than continuing purgatory. Imagine the state youre in now but continued indefinitely. Welcome to my life. I did well for a while.  years in I was drinking regularly.  years in I was a high functioning alcoholic.  years in I was a moderatelymediocrefunctioning alcoholic.  years in I received my first Fs  of them and cannot get out of bed. Im facing fewer options now. Drop out kill myself retake. I mean whether I do  or   is going to happen. I will someday die by my own hand. The only question is when I fail to prevent it. If not now if not within the next year eventually. One of these days Ill get liver cancer from drinking lung canceremphazema from smoking mouth cancer from chewing tobacco. If I havent worked up the courage by them to blow my brains out in the bathtub Ill do it then. I guess I continue to have hope that one day shell be willing to talk to me to hear me out.At this point I dont even want a relationship. I just need closure on the last  years. I dont know why I cant move on before getting that. Either one day Ill get it or one day Ill cease to feel. Those are the only two options.FUCKING CALL THEM RIGHT NOW LEAVE A VOICEMAIL IF YOUY HAVE TO.
