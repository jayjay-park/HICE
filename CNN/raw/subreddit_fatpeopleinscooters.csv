4256129,0,t1_cs5dimd,Not intentionally. I always drop a few lbs in the summer as my job involves trekking across most of Manhattan I could take transportation but I actually enjoy the light exercise between being in offices and like taking alternate routes to see what each street has to offer.To be honest I got very lucky. I work in technology but still get to move around a lot. I think a desk job would have been like a death sentence to me. And I get that. working out reminds me of the inverse of cigarettes. If you start you dont realize you feel better until you stop and suddenly feel like shit. I feel like my body is falling apart if I dont at least get in some form of energy expending activity in every day.I wont BS though my slightly large size is all because of my diet. I eat terribly. kind of the catch of being a single guy with a demanding job. I should work on that...,fatpeopleinscooters,cs5dt2v,2,t5_31ih0
