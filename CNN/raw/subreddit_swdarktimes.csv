He strolled over to the bridge window and stared at the fleet before him awaiting a response.TO Task Force Magnus CommandFROM Moff HarkusMEMORANDUM New IntelTEXT The intelligence recieved from Operation Anvil was a code of old Separatist and early Imperial encryption. We have discovered the code translates to deep space coordinates containing a major communications hub. We believe this is the center for Elbtrunns communications throughout the Grumani sector as such Magnus is tasked with its elimination before continuing with the invasion. Typherrius bit his lip as he read the response. Another hindrance to the invasion... How many more before they could put an end to the Moff? Neverthelesscommand was right. This wasnt going to be a repeat of Jutrand. It was a slow methodical and calculated attack designed to deprive the Moff of any possible resources before the last possible second. The communications hub would require more than just a scout team. It would surely contain more considerable defenses and thus would require a strike team rather than infiltration.

As well she can carry up to  people aboard her ship if need be.Equipment Crinyaclass light freighter RD astromech droid. DH blaster pistol.Height  cmWeight lb kgAppearance Link imgur. Backstory Born on Ertegas as a farmers daughter Ayrenna grew up around heavy machinery and endless fields of grain. The few settlements shed been to were quaint and by galactic standards backwards nonames.She had grown up resenting the pastoral groundbound lifestyle her parents seemed to love. Dirt felt wrong in her hands. A little passed her sixteenth birthday she took a landspeeder from her parents barn rode until daylight and arrived at the Capital city spaceport. Selling off the speeder to some shadyenough salesmen she took the first ship outbound.Its been many years since then and now Ayrenna nearly forgets what dirt beneath her feet feels like. Sleeping to the sounds of a hyperspace drive felt more at home to her than any night shed spent on Ertegas.Growing up around rough men and women whom varied in occupation between miners pirates thieves and mercenaries the young woman learned to be quite shrewd cunning and proved hard to catch.Finding her way aboard a privateering vessel as the former captain likened to calling it she had spent a few years there working her way up to a respectable firstmate. Upon the captains untimely demise the crew abandoned their cause and left seeing the young woman as unfit for the role. To this she sold the vessel and all cargo it held at the nearest dock and used that money to purchase her new ship The VaractylAll but abandoning her pirate upbringing she took the lessons learned and applied them to businesses such as shipping and trading. Her nomadic lifestyle and search for the best deals lead her far from her home to the Sanbra sector where shed been tipped off about the need for supply runners. Soon after arriving it became clear to her that shed been working for the rebels. As shed been outside of galactic law as her last occupation and no doubt already held a bounty on her head she decided to become a fully fledged member of the alliance. uCarbonKat uAnAngryAnimal,swdarktimes,ddgshj4,1,t5_3ae8f
