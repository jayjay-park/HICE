8319119,0,t1_d58dw3w,I totally agree with everything you said. Its true  are definitely the best and have lions share of the greatest moments in the show. But  have to exist because otherwise it would feel like it got cut too short.  Its like how people hate seasons  and  of the office because of no micheal. I actually enjoyed  and  because I like james spaders character but also because the office was more than just the micheal scott story.

Mila Kunis was  when she got hired for the show and basically phrased it Im  for the filming etc. so they would draw the conclusion she was already  and could sign a contract.She was  when filming started but barely.And I think youre right.

10677626,0,t3_5n0o0q,I agree. But right after Eric and Donna did it she went and told Jackie that it wasnt good more or less and then gets mad at Eric for getting mad at her and that really bothered me because as much as I understand her telling her best friend about it Im a female trust me I know she has no right to get upset at Eric for being upset about it... Like wtf? There were a lot of times she should have just gone directly to Eric rather than other people. Also when she told Hyde about her parents. I understand she could probably relate her problems to Hyde better but its not like Eric has no right to be bothered by that?  But then again its TV. And sitcom TV people problems are hardly ever real problems just lack of communication and articulation of emotions. ,That70sshow,ddhbei9,1,t5_2sooy
