So long as someone isnt neglecting bills putting themselves in debt or hurting themselves what gives us the right the judge how they spend their discretionary income?My collection isnt that big but Im still shit at packing for any trips. Between my ADHD and lack of ability to organize and the fact I vary the colors I use for my shadows and lip colors I always have to give myself options. Ive just learned to compensate for my deficits in executive functioning and planning by bringing more than I need because at least then I have options and Im okay instead of trying to narrow down and forgetting something important. I do this with everything school bag clothes shoes toiletries and I inevitably forget something anyway. Not everyone can plan out every bit of their life ahead of time and not everyone wants to.it isnt that hard to plan outfits and makeup for a weekend away.Please consider how you phrase stuff like this. I used to let comments like this get to my head and make me feel like shit for my ADHD and executive functioning deficits that make planning and organizing so difficult when it seems to come natural to anyone else. Its not worth the stress. So what if my bag has things I dont need? Id rather do that then spend the time fighting with the anxiety of trying to eliminate things from my bag or making it easier to forget something. Its not worth it to me.

6859860,1,t1_d0tjfsz,Maybe its because I already knew those things everyone was bringing up and I assumed OP did as well but she also never said anything was new or innovative. To me it personally wasnt hard to see her point or where she was coming from She simply brought up a thought about current make up and immediately people started to correct her. Even when she further tried to explain her thought process everyone started coming down on her harder. Yes its great to talk about makeup history and whatever else but thats not what she posted about  if I can remember correctly it also couldve been a discussion rather than a FUCK YOU NO OP OMG U DUM! she worded her thoughts poorly and every one started to be all Omg excuse me do you even know about makeup?! It was ridiculous in my opinion. Im sure she doesnt think makeup started  years ago and was never used before today because she never said that. My point is just that it was pretty clear what she meant and Ive even seen other MUA posts about it before. Just because she didnt acknowledge makeup history or previous trends she was attacked. To me personally it just doesnt make sense how no one seemed to understand where she was coming from.Yes makeup has always been excessive and dramatic  with certain trends through our time however todays makeup is that god awful Instagram trend with the crisp lines false lashes over drawn liquid lips. Its basically drag makeup. compared to the drama of the s alone its excessive to me. Sure the s had weird placement and bright colors but there wasnt social media and people pushing  products down your throat with  steps to makeup. Primer oil primer spray primer baking setting powder cream contour and powder contour setting spray and dewy spray. Its just a lot. I personally took it as thats slightly what op was trying to convey it made sense to me even though her delivery wasnt clear but hey maybe I am wrong and thats not what she meant. Im not op so I dont care and I will never know!,muacirclejerk,d0tvhg0,-1,t5_31lye

7184867,0,t1_d1uj65i,srs While I dont dispute being an asshole and I feel for you and your countermates that people behave like that  I do a shitload of research up front especially on ingredients before I buy anything and I wont waste an SAs time if I am not going to keep something. I return less than  of what I buy which is why I have a makeup closet and I spend less than  hour every month if that returning anything. I dont buy anywhere near as much as it appears that I do considering I bought a bunch with a code from two stores.  If a sample is available I will get one and I appreciate any SA that goes out of their way to make one or answer my questions. I will buy something to try it out when I cannot get a sample or its not sold where I can obtain it which is sometimes the case. I ask for cards their specific hoursdays on or off so I can make sure theyre there when I come back.  I like having a relationship with a specific SA which I do at each of the two Nordstroms we have here. All of them happen to know what I like dont like and have a list of ingredients that I dont agree with and if I ask about something they will shoot me a text that says hey that product has xx ingredient in it so lets skip that.  Skincare specificallyI dont mess with that a lot I dont introduce new things often because I know what works for me and I dont want to deal with a reaction.But if I try something new especially something that I was really excited about and it sucks or doesnt work for me after several tries I dont use anything just once I am not going to just keep it just because someones counter or store might get dinged.,muacirclejerk,d1uuupq,-11,t5_31lye

7497917,0,t1_d2ug6yn,I think your features are always going to look a little more dramaticenhanced because of your natural lip color and lash extensions but thats not a bad thing. If you want to look more minimal less brow product would probably help you move in that direction. Also I have no idea what condition your skin is actually in but the skin on your face looks pretty smooth while I think I can see a few natural freckles on your upper chest. Perhaps allowing a bit more of your natural skin textureimperfections to show would give you more of a nomakeupmakeup result. I think its natural to be defensive of something youve created. But now that youve seen how getting circlejerked makes you feel maybe dont come here after youve made a post.

Also its almost as if the name of this subreddit is MUAcirclejerk not random facebook group circlejerk. Theres been a problem for a while with this sub becoming really fucking shitty and attacking people instead of general trends or absolute ridiculousness but its extra shitty to be taking photos from random facebook groups like this because at least on MUA people for the most part know about this subreddit and that they might be poked fun at. Some rando from facebook doesnt know that and its gross to take their photo and post it on another website all together to make fun of it. I know youre trying to be funny but this legitimately makes me uncomfortable. This isnt poking fun at someone who has posted  posts in the last three days or lampooning how every single post is about the Modern Renaissance palette or making fun of the circlejerk around Jeffree Starr. Your friend sent you this photo to make fun of it and you posted it here to make fun of it. It just feels gross to post it to a sub with k subscribers to make fun of ya know?
