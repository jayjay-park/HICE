2093733,0,t1_cl5xqoo,gtWhat I think the point shouldve been or was trying to get at was that they may increase aggression but this seems not to have any serious consequences for society. I mean surely with such a widespread practice you would expect to see some signs of effects at a societal level if it was in any way as influential in this regard as it is often presented.The problem isnt that simple. Societies are complex and there are so many different things happening at once that could potentially be masking the effect of video games on violent crime. However even if video games do lead to greater levels of violent crime those numbers are going to be minuscule compared to the effect of things like poverty unemployment and barriers to education. Those are the things social policies need to be focusing on not trying to ban violent video games. Edit Also my main point with posting this was because it is disingenuous to portray a simple correlation as a fact in support of an argument.,GamerGhazi,cl5yk43,5,t5_33oia

There is to my knowledge at least no large group of people trying to drive TB out of the youtube or gaming world so in this case publishing these threats probably would give them the attention they seek.And it might do the same for the people who treaten Zoe etc but there is a bigger context here. There is a movement trying to drive them away from the gaming world and if you stay silent about those threats it helps them achieve their aim. ,GamerGhazi,cla5ois,27,t5_33oia

Ive never really heard this seriously said especially profoundly. Its usually framed that our behavior and attitudes toward X are what affects video gamefilmliteraturewhathaveyou content which I agree with Violent video games wont make you violent but they are an expression of our cultures maybe even our species! lust for violence.gtHas more to do with our progressive moving sense of equality.Yep which is expressed in our culture by the very same feedback loops that the initial bigotry caused. Youre witnessing such a change right now in an area that I assume you care about. Youre a part of cultural history and it has to do with video games! Whodathunkit?Dont be fooled into thinking its just some natural progression of society though. Events like desegregation didnt happen because people in power were like Oh its  I guess its time. That shit was hardfought on both sides and there were even groups of black people who were against it!  Sound familiar?gtTo answer your question Id be offended but Id ignore it. There are lots of things I find offensive in the world but I dont see it as my place to police others simply because Im offended.Which is called tacit approval. We didnt progress beyond the bigoted ideas of our past because people were worried about appearing magnanimous. Im not saying you have to pick up a sign and a megaphone just that you shouldnt be worried about calling an asshole an asshole.gtIf this is really the stated goal and most people agree its merely a product of our current social state shouldnt you change the social state which would then change the overall taste of games and thus the games themselves.Thats exactly whats happening just that some people are using video games as the vehicle to point out our social prejudices. Other people use film TV politics the internet you name it. People who enjoy video games are starting to get their first taste of whats been happening in other areas of society for decades.Seriously go take a film or literature analysis class and the Tropes in X is some of the first stuff you start talking about. Analyzing Die Hard of all things in a film class was hilarious and illuminating for me. Its a fascinating exercise IMO.Whats more even though this kind of analysis has been happening for a loooooong time in nearly every other entertainment medium we still get offerings that just dont give a shit. GGs concern that their games are going to be sanitized or even taken away is unfounded.gtTry and do it in an authoritarian manner and simply demonizing people like is done outside of the videos and youre only asking for confrontation.Well theres the problem. People hear social critiques of their medium of choice and make two big fuckups They take it personally and they confuse it for advocating censorship.

2204614,0,t1_clk1yb5,Real women in media cannot do it either they get hired to do certain things and present themselves in certain ways so as to generate profit. The criticism is actually leveled at the piece of media that is being criticized in order to inform consumers and deliberate on the culture with no direct concern for the question of who is fundamentally responsible for the component being criticized.Since it is frequently considered slutshaming to point out that modern music videos are pornographic and degrading to women despite these women being hired for money by men to expose themselves rather than doing it of their own volition it is not unreasonable to extend this overinflated term to the realm of the purely fictional and artistic where represented women are likewise used as objects for profit.The distinction between real and fictional women does not actually exist in any meaningful way because the present culture does not consider women to be real human beings to begin with.I am also pointing out that power of choice is more than a little naive as a concept at this juncture and that you can not in fact limit it to yourself. Since women are consumers under capitalism as well as being desired as partners and masturbatory objects by men and being oppressed under patriarchy their power of choice is restricted to a very narrow conception of womanhood that is defined such that it serves these interests while compromising their own.,GamerGhazi,clk268f,-2,t5_33oia

These people have no agency outside of computer screen. They have no power. They can make memes concoct conspiracy theories and agree with each other until someone cuts off their Wifi. They dont do things in the actual world because I suspect they know how ridulous they are. Like they call themselves Gamers but betcha they dont go to PAX. When theres no wifi there is no Gamergate.

2245480,0,t3_2kw5c3,sorry for yelling but...THIS IS BECAUSE MOST GAMERGATER TYPES DONT UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TEXT SUBTEXT AND CONTEXT.Seriously this is basic literary criticism shit. They approach games as if the narrative self contained world of the game just sprang into existence and has to be evaluated by its own internal logic completely ignoring that what happens in games isnt some state of nature. EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT WAS INTENTIONALLY PLACED THERE BY A PERSON FOR A REASON. Thats why most of the arguments about Bayonetta fall flat. She isnt an actual person choosing to be empowered and criticizing how she is portrayed isnt automatically slut shaming. WE ARENT TALKING ABOUT BAYONETTA BECAUSE SHES NOT A PERSON. We are talking about the people that made Bayonetta and tangentially but more importantly the people that framed the camera angles through which she is shot and their motivations conscious or otherwise in creating her. Its like their mind so easily adapts to and operates within the internal logic of the games they play that they are incapable of seeing them as pieces of media created in certain cultural contexts They instead see real worlds that they just occasionally inhabit. Like with the Batman Arkham City thing the main argument was that the criminals would realistically talk in sexist language.

2284963,0,t1_cltyf9s,TotalBiscuit often talks about how he looks up to Jeff Gerstmann as a hero and inspiration in his work. Id note that unlike TB Gerstmann wrote a single editorial on Giant Bomb condemning GamerGate and since stayed far away from the fray wisely.A year ago I would have said that TBs Youtube channel had a chance to exceed what Gerstmann has done with Giant Bomb and that the student could beat the master but theres not a chance in hell of that happening now.Not to say TB isnt still hugely popular he clearly is.But hes marginalized any fans and wouldbe fans that have empathy for Zoe Quinn Anita Sarkeesian Leigh Alexander and every other person who has gotten harassed as a result of GamerGate. At the same time hes attracted a lot of new fans that dont give a shit about his WTF is... videos and like him solely as a spokesperson for GamerGate who helps to legitimatize their backwards views.TotalBiscuit has in effect politicized and radicalized his audience and ensured that he will be inexorably linked to GG and misogyny for the foreseeable future.So yes I truly think that the actions he has taken over the past  months have torpedoed a lot of his career opportunities long term. Hell always have fans to his channel as long as he continues to pander to misogynists and conspiracy theorists but that will have to be his primary focus. Theres no way hell ever be able to achieve what Gerstmann has now. That ship has sailed. Even when GG is long in the past TB will always be the guy who not only supported GamerGate but became the spokesperson for it.

And I dont mean that in the sense of its not a movement! its a consumer revolt!. I mean that in the sense that we are mainly bystanders.And no its not okay. No one here endorsed the harassment KoP is getting now from his fellow GG members even though he is a holocaust denier and a shithead. People here found the targeting of Mackenzie Kelly by Ralph Retort to also be completely abhorrent and I personally tried to get the smear blog taken down since I figured GG would attack her once she wasnt useful to them anymore. Im very disappointed that I was right.For people who are saying awful shit they are shitheads. No one here would endorse that but neither would anyone say Lel its a false flag. or Theyre making it up for attention!.The thing is while there may be really shitty people targeting head people of GG because they are now extremely visible we dont condone it we dont call it attentionwhoring we dont call it some weird conspiracy. And we recognize that its part of the larger problem of anonymous identity and have discussed thats something thats going to need to changego in the future. We also support the very small effort that Twitter is taking to take harassment more seriously and not doing what gg is doing of filing false reports and pretending to be trans by crossdressing to shut down the system similarly to how an MRA group shut down an anonymous rape report attempt for a university by filling it with false rape reports.Were not an organized group. Were just here to laugh and sometimes very heavily cringe and question as to why an organized group of people can be this fucking horrible and drag gaming into it while theyre at it.,GamerGhazi,clxsvh9,2,t5_33oia

Those hewing to its prescriptions do so because of a priori beliefs not because of any evidence in the book.That said its core argument isnt about race and the headline is a bit misleading. Its core argument  tendentious and wrong  is that dumb people measured by IQ tests are breeding more and smart people again IQ tests are breeding less. They then posit that intelligence again measured on this one test is largely heritable they assign an arbitrary amount of  percent. Ultimately the argument amounts to saying the reason Canadians are so good at curling is because theyve been bred for it. Canadians just keep having babies with other Canadians and their worldwide curling dominance has become untrammeled.

2380275,0,t3_2mmyuu,Im really glad to hear you both are hanging in there and Im relieved that youre trying to get back to normal life. I know it isnt much but there is one thing that has made me smile a little over this messI used to be an officer for a PVP guild in a certain MMO. The game went down a year or so back but the community was small and pretty tightknit so its been easy to stay in touch. During the lifetime of the MMO I had to kick a guy out of guild because after a breakup where he was doing some really shitty stuff to his ex leaking personal photographs on the games official forums and sharing some grossly inappropriate details about her in world chat while bragging about it in guild chat. At the time I acted alone in kicking him out and only got support after Id explained why to some of the other officers. A majority of them were guys but they all listened and responded when I told them about how harmful what he was doing was. It didnt matter that his ex was from another guild or that shed done some shady crap in PVP against our guild what mattered was that she was still someone who deserved to be treated like any other person.Although myself and the other officers went on to play different MMOs I was really happy to see a lot of them come out in renouncing GG. And the guy I kicked out just dismissed it on his twitter. He was too busy focusing on getting his life together and what seems like a healthier relationship with someone new.Beyond that Im just really glad Ghazis been here. Its allowed me to keep abreast of things that are going on without venturing too deep into places that make me lose a lot of my faith in humanity.,GamerGhazi,cm5wrzk,3,t5_33oia

2462251,0,t3_2nqc9t,I love how none of this shows the real argument why people are against gamergateFor a movement that is about video game ethics it makes no attempt to squelch openly sexist and prejudiced narratives under the guise that it is good because it is free speech. Yes it is free speech. That doesnt mean it is automatically good. Yes it is free speech. That doesnt mean it is automatically on equal footing with the narrative that games are more sexist than other media. There is no reason for a movement that should be about games to have a really unhealthy obsession with shaming or harassing people.. Nobody is denying that gamergaters care about video game journalists ethics.. Nobody is saying gamergate exists solely to harass women. . We are saying that it is super ineffective at doing the first and oddly obsessed with being allowed to do the second. It has gotten to the point where the second overshadows the first. Nobody here objects to ethics policies in game journalism or disclosure policies where game journalists have to disclose certain things. These are ethical issues that have nothing to do with women sexism and harassment. Just look at the pit of filth that is kotakuinaction. Almost all of it is about their usually female target of the week and most of it is about what some people on twitter are saying to each other with the comments always trying their best to use hyperbole to make a molehill look like a mountain. Then there are two or three articles about game journalism. usually a simple soundbite or a blurb nothing moreThen whenever you ask gamergaters about this they insist the whole lets focus solely on this unrelated person who said something bad about gamergate is because gamers are under attack. . What does gamers being under attack have to do with game journalism? Nothing. You dont need to focus on the gamers are being attacked narrative in order to fix or discuss game journalism. You do need it if you want to create an us VS them narrative.. Gamers arent under attack. Gameraters are purposefully looking up things to be annoyed with. Some woman somewhere tweets something bad to her  followers?! DOGPILE! GAMERS ARE BEING ATTACKED! etc etc. Why even bother? Why even care about it? Someone wrote an article saying gamers are dead? So fucking what?! Why should I or anyone give a fuck? The truth of what is actually going on with gamers isnt going to be affected by an article somewhere and being all defensive about the gamer identity isnt going to change game journalism it is just going to make you look like a shit flinging monkey. The average gamesutra article has lt comments. Some reach as high as  or so comments. usually if console wars are mentioned The gamers are dead article has  comments. This isnt the case of a community under attack. This is the case of gamers scouring the web trying to find things to be upset about. Why is this necessary for a movement concerned with journalistic integrity?Imagine a movement that is about getting properly labeled fresh produce in stores. Now imagine their community being  about what those feminists are saying about them  about getting properly labeled fresh produce in stores and  about complaining how nobody takes their produce movement seriously.

2494812,0,t3_2o5gvg,Mirror from Google cachegtGamergate Controversy Extends Beyond Computer ScreengtTo nongaming enthusiasts the Gamergate controversy must seem a complete waste of time when far more important issues threaten America and the rest of the world. Let the nerds in their pixelated towers quibble over fiction while the real workers change the real world they think. The truth is Gamergate has proved relevant to us all by raising issues of race and sex discrimination that have implications far beyond the gaming community. But in addition there is an equally important topic that has almost been forgotten in Gamergate the corruption of news and entertainment media.gtThe Gamergate fiasco began after the exboyfriend of game developer Zoe Quinn released detailed chat logs proving that Quinn had slept with multiple gaming journalists for positive press towards her independently produced game Depression Quest. Other facts about Quinns unethical behavior such as having a follower hack and destroy a rival charity gaming session came to light. The gaming media refused to acknowledge the controversy which sparked the creation of the Gamergate hashtag on Twitter where users bombarded the accounts of major gaming sites and Quinn with questions about their integrity. Most major gaming news sites initiated a blackout against Quinn. As time went on the general gaming media recognized the threat that the movement posed and began diverting attention from the core of the scandal by focusing on the radical members of Gamergate.gtThe medias attempt to shift the blame succeeded in drawing in soapbox videogame feminist Anita Sarkeesian and the Social Justice Warriors a selfproclaimed group of Internet users who sometimes overzealously advocate equal representation of genders races and sexes in entertainment media. While we know now that Quinn did have multiple affairs with gaming journalists the damage had already been done to the Gamergate movement and resulted in it being painted as an attack by a collection of Internet aggressors. Sites began to proclaim that the modern gamer was dead and accused the gaming hobby of being dominated by sexist males. The extremely radical SJW began to butt heads with the equally radical Gamergaters and a torrent of death threats between both groups shrouded the actual issues.gtIn Gamergate there is no winner no high score to beat or achievement to unlock. All players  whether consumer journalist or developer  are responsible for the toxicity of the gaming environment. Beyond the empty death threats far greater issues are at hand. While most would focus on the misogynistic aspect of the situation a more threatening topic is the corruption and collusion in the gaming press industry.gtThe very essence of objective journalism is giving appropriate coverage that takes into account each perspective of a story. It is clear from how the gaming media handled the Zoe Quinn situation or rather how they didnt handle it at all that there is no such equal coverage in the modern gaming press. It is also proof that the gaming media work together to defend themselves and share a common progressive agenda. Kotaku.com a major gaming news site that employed one of the writers now confirmed to have slept with Quinn did not run any pieces acknowledging the affair until August . When they finally did mention the scandal they simply shrugged it off as not having any effect on content. Since then they have published eight articles on the misogyny of Gamergate and absolutely none on issues with the gaming press industry. Sam Biddle editor of Gawker Media the collection of sites that owns Kotaku even tweeted multiple times that the average gamer deserves to be bullied and harassed.gtThe average dedicated gamer is tired of being unrepresented in the current gaming journalism setup. While videogames are art there has been a startling trend to dismiss games artistic value due to the lack of diversity in their casts. Part of accepting artwork is understanding that there are no requirements for characters in a work of art to be of different genders or ethnic backgrounds.gtWorst of all the consumer whom the press swears to protect is being abused. Companies form alliances with news sites to offer exclusive announcements in exchange for more favorable reviews  an honest negative review is enough to cost a publications news edge. Prominent game journalists typically end their careers transitioning to public relations positions in companies they have been reviewing for years which is the ultimate sign of bias.gtGaming journalists need to either straighten their spines and reread their codes of ethics or ditch their titles and rename themselves as advertisers. It was not until the Gamergate scandal that Kotaku.com and Polygon.com laid down rules regarding a writers involvement in funding startup games and companies. This is something that should have been established at the dawn of the industry. The relationship between press and developers is too close and would be completely unacceptable in any other area of journalism.gtSocial Justice Warriors should keep fighting the good fight. But it would benefit them to do research instead of blindly attaching themselves to a leader such as the factmanipulating and attentiongetting Sarkeesian. They should recognize that a death threat should not be matched with another death threat.gtThe games entertainment industry is not in its adolescence. Rather this is a yearold division of the press that is being run by adolescents. Until the media recognizes its place in the picture and the everyday gamer supports a more accepting community the bigger issues behind Gamergate will continue to fester. Gaming now harkens back to the days of arcades when companies would pry quarters out of the consumers hands. But there are only so many levels lost before consumers without a proper press to protect them will lose faith and stop putting coins in the slot to try again.,GamerGhazi,cmk7kk6,4,t5_33oia

2497989,0,t3_2o7tj8,For as much as the mindless masses complain about censorship and the holy free market and whatnot they really dont get how business works. Target Australia is free to sell what they wish and if they felt the content of said product is not within their standards or they think it offends their customer base it is their right not to sell it. Last time I was in a chain store the music they sold was the radio version i.e. without swearing. As above their call on what they think is suitable for sale to their target customer base. I put the CD back and realized Id have to get it from another store or online. I didnt start screaming like a child because I didnt get my way. Its not censorship if a store doesnt carry a product or chooses not to. Having to get GTA V from a game store or other retailer isnt a giant conspiracy it just means that someone isnt carrying the game.

2536894,0,t3_2oqs7h,gtI spoke on this months ago this could have ended way back when within a weeks time. YOU could have ended it.Or you know THEY could have stopped when they noticed that every argument of theirs was proven bullshit the moment that it was made.Seriously this whole thing began with the Nathan Grayson was bribed with sex to give DQ a good review. That was IMMEDIATELY disproven. Yet they carried on proclaiming it. After a few weeks the fact that no such review has ever existed was so well known that finally withdrew but even now they try to twist it into the new story we meant coverage not review nevermind that its still petty bullshit and that yes the original story was always REVIEW not coverage. And even here GamerGate is moving the goalposts. We meant positive coverage.  But this is neutral coverage.  Well we actually meant coverage IN GENERAL! I really look forward to someone pointing out that it was not coverage but a mention and them backpedaling again.gtYou have communities many of which traditionally have DESPISED each other drop their fights and grudges for something bigger than they. You have people with wildly different political beliefs be it libertarian republican or democrat ceasing their arguments to stop YOU.This argument is idiotic for multiple reasons. First it ignores the reality of American politics. That is your parties are really fucking similar. Much more important than the parties I think are the wings IN the parties. Moderate Republicans and Moderate Democrats really arent that different. Democrats as a whole are no true leftists party  true leftists will vote for them since theyre the lesser evil but the Democrats are by nonAmerican standards still rather centrist.Even if we ignore this theres still the aspect that political opinions are harder than blackwhite leftright DemocratsRepublican. Warning this is implied by Critical theory aka CULTURAL MARXISM  In reality we see a HUGE portion of people who might align very far to the left yet will nonetheless be antifeminist. Just like we see socialists being homphobes. So now youre not uniting people with very different political views  youre uniting people with very different political views EXCEPT the one view antifeminism that they unite over.,GamerGhazi,cmppi34,6,t5_33oia

You go through her day at work and home and interacting with other people and see the challenges she faces and so on.Then you go through it again with a different randomly assigned character a gay classically handsome white man an Indian straight young woman who dresses in traditional Indian clothing an overweight not classically attractive white trans woman etc. The challenges each person experiences or doesnt experience will be different for each and every variation of the character. You could even replay with the same character and make different choices to see how things change or how things end up not changing at all i.e. you see that sometimes a person is damned if they do and damned if they dont.

2732731,0,t1_cnegq6b,Anybody can claim to care about whatever they want for whatever reason they want which is why we look at what somebody actually does and what actually appears to be motivating that to determine what they actually care about. By that standard GG does not care about journalistic ethics at all. I dont mean there are a few bad apples coopting the movement for harassment. I mean that uniformly and completely GG is literally never motivated by a drive for ethics and in fact their disregard for it it so complete that they dont care about the fact that theyre utterly poisoning the well for discussion.An actual investigation of ethics in game journalism would proceed like this Where is there strong evidence of the most egregious and harmful violations or things that otherwise do bad by the public? Follow up on these things taking care to follow the facts rather than trying to destroy perceived enemies. Let demonstrable facts speak for themselves rather than embellishing them with wild inferences.GGs investigations tend to proceed as follows Who do I hate either because her ex wrote a bunch of stuff about her because I dont agree with his or her politics because he or she wrote an article that I didnt read but did take personal offense at or because he or she stood up for one of those other people? Prod around at random for arbitrary connections that person has. Assume the worst or worse than the worst because you dont know much about how the real world operates so are capable of assuming things that are worse than are even plausible declare assumptions true. Infographic.Ethics and compassion can actually get along. They do it literally everywhere outside of Gamergate which if you judge based on actual action and activity rather than what GG claims it cares about clearly and transparently cares about neither. The degree to which any reasonable impartial observer can tell what GGs actual motivations and aims are despite what they might claim is the reason that every single mainstream publication writes about GG in a negative way. People arent stupid and theres no rule that says that anybody is required to take the worlds flimsiest smokescreen at face value. Heck even explicitly antifeminist outfits like Breitbart instantly saw though the smokescreen to the antifeminist core which is why they jumped in on the Gamergate side. Gamergate isnt misunderstood. Its very very well understood. Gamergate does not have the right idea except in the sense that their nobodyactuallybuysthis smokescreen is something that sounds nice. Having the right idea would require actually having ethics in game journalism as an actual idea that you hold and GG obviously does not if you judge based on actions focus and direction rather than simple assertions.,GamerGhazi,cnep7j3,5,t5_33oia

Because I know I can go ahead and dismiss them completely as a human being.  I know theres no chance I could ever have any sort of connection with them that would be rewarding on any level and consequently that I dont need to pay them any attention.But when someone is treating me with basic respect but theres still a sense that when they look at me they see something other than just...  a woman...  Thats when I feel really sad because it feels like Im dealing with a reasonably worthwhile human being but like they arent really seeing ME and that creates a sense of existential disconnect that Im constantly very very aware of even though its very very subtle.Its quite isolating.

2776800,0,t1_cnjnkvg,Long story short Brianna was being extremely dismissive of Grace and Chloe Sagal another antigg transgirl despite the fact that these two girls are fighting for trans rights  Grace led the charge to change Patreons rules and stop funding for chan and Chloe ended up not getting a lot of money from her indiegogo campaign because Paypal thought there were name descrepencies which is a transspecific issue. Brianna calls it all drama as if the trans narrative is of a high school girl complaining about her exes and shit. By doing this publically she is cutting off the small support network Grace managed to achieve which is very scary to trans people.Later Grace made a tweet saying if she harms herself its because of women in the gaming industry gatekeeping the support network which seems to only let in cis women. Grace hadnt  anyone in the tweet because she didnt want to send an army to them or anything but Randi tagged Grace and said she was being emotionally manipulative. In any other instance Randi might have been correct but Ive said and felt very similar things to Grace and she wasnt blackmailing anyone like Randi was saying Grace was providing context for her selfharm the intention was never to blackmail. even if it was the fact that it had to come to blackmail to get noticed is pathetic and is very indicative of a gatekeeping community.

2787329,0,t3_2rz39n,gtI know nothing about this thoughgtThe Huffington Post interviewed  women who align themselves with the movement. One of them just aligns herself as being not against it but not necessarily with it Jennie Bharaj Georgina Young and Jemma Morgan. They had to spend most of the interview denying the claims of sexism and misogyny and eventually had to commandeer the interview to actually talk about the movement because the interviewer would not get off the subject. No matter how many times they had to say that theyve never felt unwelcome marginalized or discriminated against by others in the movement.Yep that happenedThey also rage at SJWs and complain about the Bayonetta  review.gtAlso David Pakmasp. hosts an interview show on Youtube. So far hes interviewed Brianna Wu and Arthur Chu for the anti perspective and he interviewed TotalBiscuit for the pro persepctive. All  interviews were fair and unbiased. Of the  interviewed Arthur and Brianna acted out afterward Brianna going so far as to call it a hit piece.gtWhat the hell is he talking about here? Brianna Wu did what?David Pakman had interviews with several more gaters Sargon of Akadwhich is a garbage interview because Sargon doesnt talk about anything interesting Hotwheelswhich is actually probably the best one.Brianna Wu did get angry at David Pakman as he asked the Why did you publish your death threat? question that gaters kept pushing.  Basically blaming the victim for handling things the way they did.  She still had respect for him though and voiced as much later she just felt this was not a question an actual reporter should spring on her.The whole David Pakman thing is quite strange because he is fairly leftleaning seems to feel the harassment is a bigger deal than journalism ethics breaches BUT he crowdsources his questions which means that whenever someone opposing gg gets interviewed by him they get a free background check by gg.  This is what happened to Arthur Chu.  Just because he crowdsources questions does not mean he uses questions that are clearly inappropriate but Arthur Chu went into the interview unusually frazzled.  Hes also prone to dot replying people on twitter which lets all his followers see the conversation and since hes being followed by gg bad stuff has happened with that particularly when he tried to get Zoe Quinn to interview she asked him to stop dot replying her and he screwed up and didnt see her message until hed sent about  messages.Since then largely opposition to gamergate has cut off contact with Pakman.  Which means the few times he gets his information its from gg sources.  Like...there was a time recently when he mentions a letter that Brianna Wu posted on twitter and he does briefly voice some obvious gg talking point as a rumor namely theres a rumor that she wrote the letter herself.  He also got pissy at the CBC for including footage of him in its gamergate segment saying that it was implying he was a harasser.I dunno Pakman is a weird situation.  Like...if you listen to his other content his opinion pieces he is very leftwing very feminist.  He does pretty much tell Arthur Chu Im on your side.  He seems like someone we should be fine with.  Its more the structure and crowdsourced nature of his program that makes me think...no I actually dont want to be interviewed by him.,GamerGhazi,cnkwr4r,3,t5_33oia

Like them I felt that a group of moralizing tightasses who didnt actually like videogames were trying to use the gaming media as a platform to reform videogames and the people who play them. I frequented v around the time that Dragons Crown was making a lot of controversy and took part in more than a few protoGamergate discussions about the impending war with SJWs those uppity hipsters with their thickframed glasses and Victorian attitudes.The main issue with these discussions then as now was that most of the people taking part in them were hateful douchebags. The word SJW was enough to shut down any argument so the only way to avoid it was to make it absolutely clear that you were a bigot. I found myself inserting tactical slurs into opinions that would otherwise be too SJWy.It became pretty hard to to not admit that the critics of gaming culture just might have a point. I still feel theres a place for overt sexual titillation in games but I see that improving what is typical for depictions of women needs to happen before something like Dragon Crowns Sorceress would be okay.,GamerGhazi,cnuur7b,11,t5_33oia

2887063,0,t1_cnw7rzf,Oh I see now I misunderstood. Ideological grudge sounds like Gatorspeak to me so I thought you were arguing the other side of the issue.  Im more inclined to put those three ArbCom votes down to Kill them all and let God sort them out thinking rather than ideology issues  other WP Watchers have commented that Lets ban a few people on each side is a standard ArbCom procedure probably in an attempt to look evenhanded. I could see that in the case of a more limited fistfight simply ordering everyone unilaterally out of the pool might settle things as long as theres no one else waiting in the wings to take up the battle in the name of fallen comrades.  However having watched waves of Sea Lions wash in over and over again to the shores of WP I dont think thats the case here.  From GGs perspective this isnt a personal squabble this is WAR!! at least according to their rhetoric. That means if you lose a few soldiers you dont abandon the field  you send in reinforcements. Or resurrect those soldiers as socks and send them back into the fray.I do think its odd the way the pattern of votes looked when the proposed decision was first released however. All three of the first Arbitrators to register a vote really thought banning the Five Horsemen was appropriate after the way GG targeted them? Theres a reason that notice was received with joy over at KiA and outrage in other quarters. That was a rather bad PR stumble on ArbComs part. Possibly it was just the three busiest editors wanting to wash their hands of the whole irritating and exhausting mess but it looked really strange and not at all good.  ,GamerGhazi,cnw9fuf,1,t5_33oia

You cant reprint someones work in its entirety without their permission. Its unethical and illegal.Again. This is not an argument.

2929657,0,t3_2tmu8f,Bracing for downvotesban here but Im not sure you guys are quite grasping the idea.When you start making claims about a group and then change the group and the relevant pronouns it points out the extremism that the original quote contains and just how violent it could be given weight.Essentially if what you are saying would amount to hate speech if the target is a minority then odds are it actually IS hate speech. When you start allowing to target a group and dehumanize them by removing the rights given to others you end up with some truly horrific results.And for those of you who would throw the patricarchy nonsense because in my opinion were very very close to proper humanismegalitarianism and this concept of CIS White Male Oppressor is getting silly when the issues are purely cultural at this point yes Im a straight white dude and I live in New Zealand. And my belief is that the current branch of Feminism known as Radical Feminism is quite harmful and we should be targeting a proper egalitarian society where everyone is equal and equality does not come from hate.So I guess TLDR is that theyre correct but the concept has been over simplified and I believe that some of those who are grasping the concept are further diluting it to ridicule it.,GamerGhazi,co143o5,-4,t5_33oia

2996056,0,t1_co8j9ur,gt Ive been telling people that Batman Forever is better than Batman Returns actuallyOf course it is. As someone who has read watched listened to played experienced every scrap of Batman fiction of any form that I currently know to exist including weird Italian bootleg comics where Robin is in charge and uses a gun I have often remarked that any Batman story has something worthwhile to tell us about the character and indeed about ourselves. Even the awful ones the tedious ones the repetitive ones the forgettable ones the ones written by Tony Daniel. All Batman stories are worthy of attention.Except Batman Returns. What a fucking load of hot garbage that movie is.gtand while Batman Forever is a huge departure for the film series and has serious narrative flaws its a lot of fun and manages to adapt a lot of classic Batman camp pretty well even making fun of itself a few times.I generally view it the way Chris Sims and David Uzumeri at ComicsAlliance view it It didnt quite know what it wanted to be. It needed to commit to the campy craziness or it needed to commit to the psychodrama.gtAlso I seem to be the only person who thinks this but in a lot of ways Batman  is just as cheesy as the classic camp Batman it just hides it behind a lot of Tim Burtonisms.Its incredibly cheesy! And while Batman  can make the argument that it is legitimately hilarious and intentional absurdist comedy and not an attempt at serious superhero fiction Batman  appears to be Tim Burton actually trying his best and still making a cheeseball flick with very little depth. Every actor in that movie is better than the movie.

3018251,0,t1_coan9ga,While my feelings arent as extreme I definitely think theres something to this. Ever since Crystal Dynamics took over the series theyve gradually improved the surface aspects of Lara as a character as well as the improving of the awful awful advertising but I feel theyre far too quick to go for stock female character backstory tropes. Rather than just being a badass doing the things she does because she enjoys it shes always got some other motive like looking for her lost parents or living up to them in the reboots case it feels like they define her through other characters as shorthand for making her deeper without actually making her much deeper beyond giving her a lot more dialogue. In the process some of the more unique parts of her original backstory have been removed it also doesnt help that the characters she wants to live up to invariably end up being men. The worst example I can think of is in Anniversary where they took the original games story where she works things out on her own and made it so shes following her fathers discoveries instead she goes from an independent adventurer to almost literally following in the footsteps of a man. The reboot doesnt have anything like that yet but the fundamental handling of her character and backstory that leads to those things like having to justify everything she does rather than just letting her be a person who doesnt always need extrinsic motivation still seems intact.,GamerGhazi,coau85c,4,t5_33oia

Epic critique of Wu on the interview Youtube Comment   upvotes.A youtube comment bastion of intelligence that claims that the only people who complain about sexism in the industry are underachieveing piles of failure and that Wu is making up everything that happened to her in order to blame it on why her game failed. Instead this commenter claims she failed because shes a fake gamer. Why is this? The youtube commenter never explains this because apparently its just super obvious.Thats the extent of which KiA engages in discussion and argues. They yell at women call them fake gamers accuse of them of making up harassment... and thats it. Theres no actual debate and theres no actual discussion and there are no actual arguments. This post got over  upvotes. Its the only top post about Wu I could find that was actually passed off as a critique.

3116453,0,t3_2vtenv,I wish it were a better written game and actually did something worth a damn with the issues it raises instead of settling for subPSA level exploration of them. Its a presentation of a snapshot in time that has nothing to really say or do and as a result it feels incredibly unsatisfying despite trying to deliver a homophobia is bad mmkay message that falls incredibly flat because of how simplified the entire thing is. As in simplified to the point where it has no merit. Like I said PSA level.And as a romance story it felt incredibly hacky because of its reliance on the issues it explores and not the strength of the characters. Especially with the characters being super stereotypical.The presentation is what sells the game I really REALLY wish the actual content its presenting was worthwhile.I appreciate it for what its trying to do. I dont think it achieved it in any reasonable sense however. Even B movies handle the subject better. The reason this game is being treated as something special is A because of the presentation and B because it proves the potential of games as an exploratory medium by the nature of even TRYING to approach this subject no matter how well it did. Is that valuable? Gonna say yes. But I really wish it was a better foot forward and not super tired.Not to mention the fact that it felt like rd of the first draft of a script. Story didnt feel complete or poignant at all and as a result the ending felt incredibly empty to me. ,GamerGhazi,col0q5t,3,t5_33oia

3122591,0,t3_2vx2be,Ive stopped discussing GG with the Gators I know a while ago. Im glad most of them at least stopped spamming their Facebook friends with this GG crap after that. Quite a few left GG when they saw how awful that movement actually was in the last couple of months. Aside from two one of which is still rather vocal about it. After repeatedly engaging in debates and providing evidence to debunk his usually GG crap  whenever he just linked some piece of GG propaganda in his feed  to the point where he couldnt find anything new to say it was business as usual the next day. And god those little Gator friends of his really like to jerk each other off. And they say we live in hugboxes ha. It is not worth it really. And I am glad you can unsubscribe from somebodys feed without unfriending them.Luckily I dont know too many Gators personally. Probably because there arent too many to begin with.But honestly there are no moderates left. You might think the one you debated was a moderate OP because he didnt actively harass people. But that is not moderate. Willingly tolerating the crap going down on Twitter chan and KiA at this point is everything but moderate. And if somebody blindly repeats the talking points of a movement without ever looking at the people behind it well he or she is an idiot.There is just no point in stressing over something this trivial. Everything has been said everything is online. It takes a couple of minutes to access the available information of both sides  which you should do if you are actually interested in the matter. If people dont do that Hurrdurr why should I look at something if everything is summed up at the GamerGate wiki hurrdurr those people are lost causes to begin with. Let people look this stuff up themselves. Most of them will see what we did and not bother with this crap. Some will become Gators. But those would most likely have some bias towards it anyway. The only two GGers I know by this point leaned towards proMRA and antifeminist to begin with. I wouldnt be surprised if loads of Gators still left were in a similar situation when GG started. Explains them happily harassing women.Something I learned in my field You usually cannot change people. You can help people change but you cannot change people if they dont want to change at all. Well unless you use certain practices that would be rather exploitative which you shouldnt do with friends really. Because that would be dickish. And hehehe unethical. HAHAHA. Yeah.TLDR Play games have fun and dont stress yourself over video games. If people want to play Gator let them play Gator. Just continue being awesome.,GamerGhazi,colnlt2,12,t5_33oia

3136224,0,t1_coms9ch,They want women to dress that way for them not for anyone else.  They like scantily clad women in their TV movies and video games because the illusion of the screen makes it seem like the woman is there for them and them alone.  When the character winks at the camera theyre winking at them.  When the character takes off their clothes theyre taking off their clothes for them.  Its why pornos almost always make an atleast superficial attempt to make characters out of the girls in them but essentially never do so for the guys so the guys in their audience will have an easier time putting themselves into the role of the man in that situation which is the whole basis for the illusion.Its been argued that basic idea  sometimes called the Neutral Mask  is why most major movie franchises have a hero that is very bland while surrounding themselves with more interesting sidekicks.  So the audience can put themselves into their shoes but not have to live into any particularly notable character quirks.At a con or for that matter in almost any other form of real life the math for that is all wrong.  Scantilyclad women are only part of the equation it has to be scantilyclad women who are paying attention to them.  When theyre paying attention to someone else the spell is broken and jealousy erupts.Fights break out at strip clubs all the time.  This is why.  That girl they just shared an intimate moment with well the illusion of an intimate moment but a convincing illusion and an eagertobeduped audience is suddenly paying attention to someone else in the exact same way.  It tells them theyre not special in the way they thought they were.  And that makes them angry.,GamerGhazi,con2ebh,7,t5_33oia

3205232,0,t3_2wue3w,Edifying to see a reasonably polite exchange. As a comment not about only TB but a broad range of shall we say the more reasonable GGsupporters Ive noticed a large similarity in tone between these guys and politicians arguing against gay marriage. They know full well why their constituents oppose gay marriage but they cant come out and say it. So its all about talking points and casting subtle shades that can be easily wound back when confronted about it. So where a politician can say something like look we dont know enough about the effects on children and i think we should respect marriage as a historical timeimmemorial magic mcguffin and protect it from being undermined then when challenged resorts to the only certainty they can offer  a bald assertion of their position. Look I just dont support gay marriage and thats my opinion  yet they leave those vague accusations about the queer community just hanging in the air.Now you get these respectable types like Kern and Bain being all look I cant comment on these specific allegations about LWx but I think theres a real issue with clickbait journalismethicspolitical correctness whatever.In this one Bain winds it back into even more vague and halfhearted evasions. I didnt kill trans people like this article is saying i did. I just care more about Africa. We all know this type of thing can be weaponised. Challenged he backs down and just says Look that was just my subjective opinion about the article and withdraw it. The vague accusations about the intentions and importance of the article posted by Jim are left hanging in the air unrefuted. Its TBs modus operandi actually. Even if you look at his first Twitlonger on GG you can see the formula. Whats going on. These specific allegations that I will now outline to my followers if true would be very very bad. Pay no attention to harassment. To conclude these allegations i will again detail seem very suspicious and bad but who knows whats going on atm amirite!

Jim Sterling is me now I grew up met a lot of smart people talked to them figured out that Im not always the smartest guy in the room and even if sometimes I am that means absolutely nothing at all and is not a good reason to pretend I have meaningful input on everything. There are some experiences that I simply cant understand the same way the people who lived them understand them and their voices matter a lot more than mine. This is why TB is an asshole. He feels like everything that happens is an invitation for him to add his thoughts and make his snarky passive aggressive judgments.  Sometimes John its okay to say this person said it better than I could so listen to them instead of me.  Thats what signal boosting is.

3209565,0,t1_coun21e,Key differences to bear in mind though are that the team behind Gone Home wasnt making an AAA game they didnt spend several years to my knowledge working on it they didnt have a big media push by Sony as an implied launch title and they didnt have to push their release date back by over a year.I know that doesnt change the lengthprice correlation by any means but it does show why its a much bigger problem for The Order  than Gone Home. People expected a lot out of The Order due to hype and advertising but Gone Home was comparatively lowkey. The Order might have even been part of why people bought a PS in the first place which just further adds to the problem whereas Gone Home can be played on PC just as easily.My opinion of the game is still out until I get my copy and play it though it may be a while before I get to it.

3210993,0,t1_coupbai,Hey dude I guess this will get lost in the food of responses but I really did want to note that you are a bit wrong on this one.  Social progress movements long have a history of splintering to focus more but still aligning together under a single banner where there is benefits to that.  I dont know about your country but look internationally at how many places have a Greens party that is the most prominent singular political party for environmentalists etc.  Outside of election times and when not talking direct governance you bet they are splintered groups all over the place.   Some times there is benefit to the focus of a singular purpose that being an amalgamation cant do.  Especially if you want a singular focussed message say about corruption in game journalism specifically or even just a specific kind of corruption then having a smaller group dedicated to that message does improve your signal just by having a more clear defined message. Is my favourite outcome from OWS movement which KIA loves to declare was an abject failure but out of it we have had much smaller groups doing good things when they were no longer the mass of people picketing and no longer under constant media scrutiny.Dont get sucked into SOLIDARITY IS KING bullshit especially when you think that it is fringe groups pushing for it because they are just using you as cover and legitimacy.  In political movements splintering from the core is actually a really useful way for different elements to test bed ideas and see how they work and what people think of them.Also I really want to agree with Spawn of Lillith a little on what is being stated.  What morment is the right question there was people wanting gams journalism to improve before Gamergate I dont see why you need to attach yourself to that brand so strongly.  Just because you got invested in it when GG started doesnt mean that it is the only movement around for it.Aaaaaaand you talk about sticking with it because you have weathered a lot of criticism in it already but most of the criticism is directed at the parts of the group you dont even associate with.  You are stuck in a sunk cost fallacy just because you have spent this much to come this far doesnt mean that it is right and most successful to keep going.  Reexamine KIA one day And see how much discussion is driven and run by people talking about SJWs discussion focussed specifically on women in development defending against criticism about what one of the former free speechis king discussions and compare to how much actually keeps on point with what you want the movement to drive.The reality is another channel for discussion that actually stays on point is going to be beneficial AND if GG is as pro ethics as they claim it will get the support it should from there.Ignore people that go Heerrr derrrrrrrrrr Atheism llolololololololololol.  Hes a movement will fail if people actively sabotage it for being traitors who dare disagree with some people on minor points unrelated to the larger movement.  In reality all that is happening there is threats to keep in line whether to be direct or by proxy.,GamerGhazi,couti1z,6,t5_33oia

Typically the people making the threats are anonymous and know their intentions. The people on the receiving end are REAL PEOPLE whose information is known whose daily lives work and mental health are affected who DONT know the perpetrators intentions and for the most part whose work depends on the internet and online media.Edit interesting that Vice notes thisgt These are all threats that are happening publicly in broad daylight by men using their real names.

ONE THING THREE YEARS AGO and he still goes on amp on about how said person is a giant bigot and from everything Ive seen there she just said she wasnt a fan of the idea of porn and DampD  not whorephobic and this is coming from a fellow porn lady lol.Anytime anyone says anything that Zak doesnt like he writes about how hes going to sue them and his fans just get this idea to attack them for months or years. Nevermind he knows for a fact his fans do this and he continuously singles people out without saying Hey Im upset about this person  no identities because yall are a bunch of harassing bastards. I just need to vent.I work in both porn and tabletop gaming and Ive been terrified to speak up about the terrible behavior Ive seen. Ive been reduced to shambles anytime Ive even thought about saying Stop sending your harassing manchildren after people you dont like. I delved into GG because of the guilt I felt over fearinduced silence because of this crap and its taken me all this time to be able to say that enoughs enough.The scary thing about him is that he doesnt seem this way because hes got a group of people who will do these attacks for him and he doesnt have to get his hands dirty.

3261744,0,t1_cozr7db,it is an odd topic! But basically liberalization is the maximum freedom for ALL and capitalization is about the maximum freedom for people who have earned it i.e. those with capital. Freedom is defined as both the freedom of something and the freedom of something because in order to be free to eat you need to be free of poverty for example. There has to be both a clause stating both an action that is being prevented and a reason that the action is being prevented.In the terms of video games this would boil down to as some women do not have the freedom to feel safe and happy playing video games because they are being objectified and treated as sex objects. They are unfree on one front the ability to play video games but in order for them to be free on that front they have to be free of objectification. Every freedoms are like this they all have two clauses.A real liberal will look at the freedom of game makers to objectify women and say since this limits the freedoms of other people it should not be allowed.

The logic behind the other options doesnt really make sense. Its pretty clear based upon his out of character act that it was a character so the suggestion that he spent years pretending to be an idiot so that when Brianna Wu was eventually mentioned on his live stream years into the affair he could start harassing her rather than going on about wolf spirits and marines as he had been for years is asinine. Now as for it being comedy it should be pointed out that harassing Brianna Wu wasnt really the centerpiece of his ruse. It was just the closing act. Did it have any comedic value? Well I think its as you say.But his earlier stuff is an entirely different creature.

Nearly every single hero when dressed as a civilian dresses the exact same way with no thought put into how their personalities may drive their clothing choices. They compared it to how fashion and clothing is handled in Scott Pilgrim and how each character even characters that tend to dress the same as each other have a distinct look to them as a result.

I legitimately wonder if his waning sense of persecution played any part in his need too be maximum offensive today.

Doesnt that sum up the entire problem? I know theyre people. I get the impression that two out of three Gators would be perfectly relatable til politics comes around. But as a mob online theyre pretty much consistent with faux outrage followed up with a metric ton of toxicity. They might not actually be bigots they could be decent folks but either theyre a not or b buy into the idea that the internets not real life so they can behave as such at some polarized extreme. They come off as caricatures often offensive to the worst degree because theyve got whatever number backing them up. I know the same can be said about Ghazi and all those evil SJWs and I know its my own bias that tells me theyre just not as bad.

Granted this is more related to female fanservice than unlocking female characters but in retrospect it still kinda falls under women as something to be earned.But hey  just a thought. A more relevant example might be the Ouendan and Elite Beat Agents games where the female characters are unlocked only on the highest difficulties  when there really isnt any reason why female characters cant be on other difficulties too.

I expect there may be a shift towards individual developersartistsetc being less visible to the outside after the past couple years of tantrums and threats from fans which is unfortunate in some ways.In journalism I think that there needs to be a more responsible control of the messages sent to the audience and that services such as youtube need to be more responsible with how they handle things. One stray comment from a popular youtuber can send thousands of angry fans out as attack dogs so the big names need to acknowledge that and be careful in their words.

3671088,0,t1_cqaah4z,gt Whered you get biphobic? He wrote one of the first bisexual romances into a mainstream television series Buffy. Do you mean Willow? Because while the actual episode with her deciding between Oz and Tara is good on that and makes it seem like an actual tough choice and she does seem to truly be bi in it once she gets with Tara there is an obvious chance in direction where it is made super explicit a number of times that Willow is gaygaygay and does not like grossickyboys. Like painfully out of the way asides just to make that point. There is literally a conversation about how Anya doesnt have to worry about her and Xander who actually have a romantic past together getting together since shes Gay Now. When shed be compelled by magic to kiss some dude she has to magically turn him into a girl first. And so on.Nor is this limited to Willow but is a recurring theme in Whedons work he introduces bisexuality just to prove its a fad or passing fancy. He talked about Angel and Spike having had a relationship at some point but then explained it was just an experiment because obviously vampires will after decades and centuries together fool around a bit but it doesnt mean anything. Buffy tries to make herself gay according to the rest of the cast when she has a fling with another Slayer in the comics. He got to do a twofer on the biphobiatransphobia effort during his stint on Runaways when Xavin and Karolines romance was thrown into a completely asspulled crisis over Xavin a shapeshifting alien who was on record explaining that to them gender was like wearing a hat having to prove that theyre really female because Karoline starts freaking out because she has to prove shes a True Lesbian in Josss writing. And Molly goes from supportive of Xavin to suddenly encouraging this bullshit nonsensical standard.gt  All I can find on transphobia is one jokeJust the link I gave above has two jokes the second grosser than the one you mention and a complete refusal to apologize.And Jesus Christ what sub am I on?

But for gods sakes its been what  years?  Even I think this comes off as petty by now.There kind of is one issue that is worth mentioning.  Part of the goal has to be for our gayness not to be the impetus of our stories.  We dont want gay people to automatically and necessarily have to have our story about being gay.  We do exist outside of any struggle and it is valid in general to not make someones queerness part of the plot.  We are people if oppressed ones not drama setpieces for straight people.Does this mean anything for criticizing Rowling on its own?  Nah.  There were ways for it to come up in canon and Im not convinced this was her concern.  Maybe Aberforth could have regretted being angry at dumbledores gayness or similar.

3748658,0,t1_cqj9ov8,Well I started out in Tumblr as a small art blog that doubled as a short story writing blog. It was a neat little thing Had like  followers and I followed some pretty cool artists. It was nice for like a month or so until the Artists I followed began to catch some fire by some people and I dont exactly remember what it was for now as it was some time ago.So eventually I searched through the tags on tumblr because I had never left my small circle of Tumblr to fully explore it because I had heard the stories but Id never experienced it before. But then I discovered just how much Hatred selfrighteousness Racism etc. I found fronting as each ideas polar opposite. Like others are saying its hard to converse on Tumblr. There was was so much hatred for who I was because of conditions I was born into that I had no control over meanwhile they would turn their back and cry out against racism or at least their definition of it. And I was sad to see that yknow? It saddened me yknow? As I searched through more and more tags I began to see the militant extremist voices SJEs outshouting the Rationals Those who were actually working for the common good. of their tags and because the SJE Social Justice Extremist voices were the loudest they sparked the most militant responses.Someone even told me it was cultural appropriation to make posts in French as an American because I was not from Western Africa andor lacked Western African heritage. Meanwhile much of my ancestry comes from France I posses a French Last name Part of my family immigrated straight from France and where I live was originally a French colony. Cest la vie non?What I saw made me sad. I knew there were some really good people that didnt hate others for not fitting their agenda or hating others for not being enough. I knew there were those who instead strove for the common good and those who were completely accepting in the community. I knew that there were those who did stuff because they loved doing it and were awesome at what they did. The Creatives the Thinkers etc. The good guys. I wanted to stay for the good side but I just couldnt yknow? I never felt I fit in after that. So I left my blog on indefinite hiatus and several weeks later I deleted the blog.I could continue and give my analysis of chan if ya want.,GamerGhazi,cqjklzp,3,t5_33oia

3780201,0,t3_33pgq5,I recently attended a talk on this subject where the expert Wolfgang Walk of Grumpy Old Men had come up with a very interesting thesis. I am mostly paraphrasing here of what I remember.He started out to discuss that gameplay in itself is an illustration of a conflict such as shoot people to survive or jump to attain your goal. He went on to explain that a good game should exploit this conflict for narrative purposes transforming it into  what he called  the grand metaphor. One of his examples for this grand metaphor was Papers Please wherein the core mechanic finance your life by judging people is an irresolvable moral and ethical dilemma which flavors the entire game. Thus the narrative layer oppressive dictatorship harsh living conditions and the gameplay are perfectly in sync. One reinforcing the other. The problem he saw in most games which suffer from a detachment of narrative and gameplay ludonarrative dissonance were mostly those which had failed to exploit the gameplay conflict for the creation of the grand metaphor and the subsequent narrative layer. One of his negative examples was Uncharted as there are basically two versions of Drake within the game Cutscene Drake and Gameplay Drake. The first one is a nice guy who is peaceful and shies away from violence while the other one is willing to murder ennemies by the dozen just to get from point A to point B.  The gameplay conflict shoot people to survive has no reflection whatsoever in the narrative layer. Overall the talk was meant to convince game developpers and game writers to analyse the gameplay first and come up with a matching narrative afterwards instead of attempting to force narrative into gameplay or viceversa. A good narrative plus good gameplay do not automatically make a good game as long as both elements do not share the grand metaphor.Note I have to paraphrase here. The talk was much more nuanced and detailled and I probably failed to reflect even half of what Walk said.,GamerGhazi,cqn655j,4,t5_33oia

Royal marriages were often performed where one or both of the parties was underage as alliances shifted these marriages were frequently annulled in favor of more promising partnerships. And because the Catholic Church was all about power and alliances annulments were performed even when relationships were consummated. Because really womens consent to sex was a nonfactor as far as the Church was concerned. Its ridiculous to think that the existence of annullment proves anything at all.

I can count the number of mangaanime Ive seen where the characters have sex and its portrayed as part of a relatively normal healthy relationship on three fingers Paradise Kiss Girlfriends Bonnouji.There was a really excellent blog post I read awhile back about a western womans experience with Japanese sexuality and I wish I could find it again because it was very illuminating.

3982852,0,t3_36351w,Its very easy to stay in Attack Mode when you spend a lot of your time being attacked by people who genuinely mean you harm professionally andor physically. Sometimes very big people can turn their guns on an ally who criticized them and leave a smoking crater before they realize what theyve done this relies on the person not being an egotistical asshole who views themselves as the figurehead and literal embodiment of the movement so any attack against themselves is treated as an attack against the whole.  That said even for a wellmeaning person if they receive ninehundredninetynine attacks and one valid criticism from an ally in a day its easy to just sweep the entire field clean since that one ally is surrounded by a bunch of assholes who deserve whats coming to them. With a service like Twitter disclosure I fucking hate Twitter its tremendously easy to do something like this and it exacerbates the problem highlighted in this article. How many people measure power levels based on follower counts and not based on how good the message is? Whats the difference between a burner troll account and someone critical but genuinely wellmeaning who has very few followers? Theres not enough time in the day to discern the content and meaning of thousands of people and sadly its much easier to just ignore people who appear snippy.  Now that it turns out some people didnt want to be in the Feminist Deck this late in the game just the action of pulling out might cause a stir. Its a bit of a tragedy that it got to this point and the deck creator probably should have consulted the people whose faces would be on it. In an ideal world people wouldnt be that upset if someone decided not to be involved in the project but the article is suggesting that this might not be the case.

3984703,0,t1_crabh8a,In the long run yes.  In the interim since companies dont really have any reason not to tie bonuses to Metacritic scores and probably wont stop even if we asked nicely well have to do our best to force them to stop.  And the only way to do that would be to make Metacritic scores as irrelevant as possible. This can be accomplished by gaming publications doing away with review scores entirely.  Many already are but theyre going with halfmeasures that dont quite do it.  Kotaku and other publications still do a kind of synopsis in a cute little graphic that gives it an ataglance score if you will.  This still allows Metacritic to assign such a review a score on their own site for calculation purposes.   Gaming publications must do away with ALL scores and any form of ataglance synopsis.  If these people want to know the review they can read the goddamned review  Metacritic may try and still extrapolate some form of a score from the review itself but the more publications that do this the more Metacritics score will be largely meaningless guesswork to the point that companies cant really attach bonuses to such an unreliable metric.   ,GamerGhazi,crahpm2,5,t5_33oia

We have seen absolutely positively ZERO of what happens after this rape. gtBasically shes concerned that this will be brushed aside and Sansa will just get over it whereas this postauthor wasnt able to do so in her own case and identified with Jeyne.Basically shes saying that if every character that is raped doesnt react exactly how she did to a rape then its not realistic. Which is nonsense because as previously stated there hasnt been one second of postrape narrative told. And more to the point not every woman reacts the same to being raped. Itd be like me saying that Sansa is unrealistic because she didnt react the same way I did to having my father die when I was young. Or someone who lost limbs in Iraq saying that Jaimie is a horribly written character because he didnt react exactly like they did to losing a limb.

Not risk affine not constantly involved in nasty bargains  that basically boil down to be a drug dealer with just one package to sell and of course not woven into a social network that at best provides stability and at worst strangles any dashing movements and grandeur.Its a great movie and its escapism and if you look closely you see all too well what it escapes from.

4201185,0,t1_crz382d,I mean to me capitalism is a market system where private property exists that is saying that businesses are owned by people other than workers.Okay let me see how i can do with a brief summary. I suppose Ill start with Marx. While most people know Marx for The Communist Manifesto that is honestly an admitted propaganda piece. Its a tiny piece of work that Marx and Engels worked on at a certain time to get people stoked on communism. Marxs main work is Capital Das Kapital. All  volumes are this are a DESCRIPTION of the capitalist system along with the theory that capitalism will create the seeds for its own destruction. Basically Marx says that capitalism is a system where there is strife between the Ruling Class those who own the means of production factories workshops stores etc and who profit off the labor of workers and the Working Class those who rent out their time to capitalists to get paid wages that are less then the value of their work. Capitalists will try to squeeze as much out of workers as they can getting themselves richer and increasing the gap between them and workers. You can see this happening now. Eventually the workers will revolt. This is basic Marxist thought and honestly when it comes to pure marxism that is JUST what Marx wrote this is the sum of it.Then of course other people notably Engels Who wrote with Marx Lenin Trotsky and others expanded off of Marxs work. While Marx did describe what should come after capitalism state socialism followed by communism after the state would whither away this wasnt his concentration at all. These others are the ones who expanded on it and came up with ideas of what socialism would look like what communism would be like and how to get there. All agreed that communism would be A classless stateless society where good are allocated from each according to their ability to each according to their need When put into practice these marxistleninists had a revolution that got rid of capitalism although many of the regions were more rural and peasantry than fully capitalst yet they established a centralized socialist state whose goal it was to get ready and make the switch over to communism.Ill reiterate my bias that I am an anarchist and anarchists such as Bakunin told Marx and the Marxist Leninists that this state socialism state would eventually get really powrful and authoritarian and emulate the capitalist mode of production from a workers standpoint. This kind of caused the dissolution of the First Internatinal after communisms and anarchists couldnt come to an agreement as anarchists thought that after the revolution communism should be made immediatly as opposed to having a state. Workers in Kronstadt tried to take this approach in around  I believe in Russia and establish communism in their commune rather than state socialism but they were shot down. Later in the Spanish Civil War anarcho syndicalists were able to briefly achieve true communism from  until  when they were crushed by the fascist franco Who would go on to run a brutal dictatorship until the ... s I believe? as well as liberals. Goerge Orwell actually faught in this war and said that anarchist catalonia was the closest he had ever seen to true freedom and equality.So thats basically the short version of my propaganda piece of why anarchism is better than communism. I feel like youd probably agree that the state of the USSR China etc got corrupt and too big and ended up serving itself rather than the people and had no intention of whitering away on its own. Let me know what else youd like me to expand on. ,GamerGhazi,crz4lyf,4,t5_33oia

4271073,0,t3_39vh0u,It annoys me that people cant just let a person have views. Shes anti glorification of violence thats all. You can take that topic and actually have some really interesting discussions on it.   For example it got me thinking what is the the gap between video game violence and real life violence.  The Doom clips dont bother me but I know I am a squeamish person If I was watching a video of someone being chainsawed I would be throwing up all over my desk.   It seems we havent entirely crossed the uncanny valley of gore and horror. I know a level of desensitization is at play and I need to hold onto my knowledge that its just a game a d animated model. But as games get more realistic graphics more lifelike will games actually lose appeal? At what point does it become difficult to separate depictions of video game violence and real life violence. Is telling ourselves its fake the only thing holding us back?  In video games we see murder as hitting targets to score points same with movies. When we stand back and take a look we have made murder trendy and fun. Even little kids play with toy guns bang! your dead! and we keep doing it into adulthood. I just think its really interesting to look at the whole picture. It doesnt mean banning it. I think because of GG most of us are too afraid to talk about negative consequences of anything. Talk about negative effects of porn or prostitution?  Youre an antisex puritan! Talk about glorification of violence? Your a gamebanning procensorship over emotional fool.

He makes no attempts to make it readable for anyone and it is basically him showing off it is just that he his mastery of language lets him get away with it. I definitely struggled with it and a lot of stuff went completely over my head. I will need to reread it a couple of times before getting itPIm not an Englishlitarute major or anything so I probably lack the terminology but it really feels modern. Just like Woolf and Faulkner. Im currently reading the second part of In Search of Lost Time by Proust and that feels way less radical even though it is very modern but just in different ways. gtA similar book in many ways to Ulysses would be Tristram Shandy. Exceedingly innovative in its time it nonetheless affected the writers that came immediately after it only marginally. On the other hand when that book was picked up centuries later by the modernists they were willing to fully embrace its unorthodox style. Tristram Shandy also sold very very well when it first came out  an example of both a commercial and critical success.Thank you againD.

GG is institutionally bigoted despite having a few women PoC or LGBT members.Its origin story is one steeped in misogyny and harassment and nothing is going to change that perception to the outside world which is why people have suggested they abandon the hashtag and organise properly if theyre ever to be taken seriously.Their argument basically comes down to How can I be sexist?

4466584,0,t1_cstoqez,I already found an explanationgtA lot of the attitudes and behaviors surrounding sex in the Edo period were determined by both gender and class so the answer also breaks down into what was expected of someone based on their position in society. Firstly while Japan was more sexually open than many of the Western nations at the time that sexuality was consumed by a specific portion of society men with enough money to buy sex and entertainment. Secondly adult male sexuality was different than what we might define as the norm in the modern west buying sex with both women and boys was commonplace. Adult males in Edo period Japan held all the sexual cards so to speak. Males were sexual actors or as Gregory Pflugfelder puts in his book Cartographies of Desire inserters women and young men were acted upon insertees. The submissive person in a sexual liason was not supposed to show too much desire for the sexual act because that might make them seem dominant which could be seen as a threat both to the masculinity of the man and to his position as the hierarchically superior person in a relationship. This is where we get a lot of the seminonconsensual sounding phrases that we often hear from sexual accounts the women had to feign disinterest or fear only to be won over by the strength and masculinity of their client. Further since love was not something that was commonly found in politicallymotivated marriages sex in the marriage bed versus in the pleasure houses was very different. A wife might not be expected to enjoy sex at all and even to play up her discomfort with the act as a sign of her chastity and moral uprightness while a prostitute or courtesan would play more to the oh youre so much better than all my other clients only you make me feel this way narrative. This of course could also help her find a patron that would buy her out of the pleasure house and in some cases marry her thus freeing her from spending the rest of her life as a sex worker. Sadly I dont know too much about sexuality in the lower classes as many of the historical documents of the time dont discuss it at all. I would assume as with many cultures that sexual mores were a bit more relaxed among the lower classes. ,GamerGhazi,cstotv1,15,t5_33oia

It can only lead to more diversity in whats made and can broaden the definition of what constitutes a game.But I think the difference is that its not a wish I have in order to stifle criticism. Rather its because I find it a fun way to express yourself and be creative. And Id love for more people to be able to do that.indeed its getting easier all the time with Twine Unity GameMaker Unreal etc etc helping out!Why dont you make your own game? should be said from a position of encouragement and a sense of fun not an attack on someone for daring to criticise something!Nice article  thanks again!

Weirdly enough its effective because everyone has that experience and also wants to win.  Its filed under we are all in this together and only we can save us from getting matched with some asshole.

4512745,0,t1_csz2n3c,sounds somewhat similar to Doctor Faustus which I think is actually a good analogue for reddit and the internet as a whole.spoilers on a  year old playso youve got this dude who gets a chance to have this immense magical power at the cost of turning his soul over to the devil. at first he uses the power for good stuff healing people and helping people and all that. but somewhat due to mephistopheles influence he starts using the power more and more for pranks and tricks at parties against the aristocracy and generally wastes this huge potential hes been given. by the end he finally realizes how dire his circumstances are that hes had this great power for awhile and its been used for such petty shit in exchange for his soul and he tries to repent. if I remember right he was occasionally visited by an angel or representation of god who tells him after he first receives the power O man fly as a way of saying he better make this enormous violation of gods will worth it.however unlike other plays at the time his repentance does not grant him gods forgiveness and he is taken to hell just as the terms of the contract ordained. I kinda feel like thats a bit of a reflection of the internet and certain cultures that exist within it. here is this huge amount of potential and power that can be utilized for good and truly there are plenty of people who do use it for good. but you have the groups that waste all of that potential for terrible shit like doxxing harassment FPH CP generally shittiness against nonwhite people and women and petitions to try and oust an interim CEO over decisions that nobody can prove she was primarily responsible for and yes I know we can say well the CEO is ultimately the one responsible for everything that happens in a company but then youre forgetting about board members whom the CEO must answer to and also Im not the type of person to blame the CEO of mcdonalds for that one time when I had one less nugget than I should have but thats for another time. now there have been talks about and even some laws passed in some countries removing any form of anonymity from the internet which can very well negatively affect times when the internet can be used for good such as whistleblowing or mass protests or a victim of domestic abuse being able to interact with other people without the fear of their ex tracking them down. Im not really sure who the angel would be that tells the internet o man fly but we definitely see that there are plenty of toxic internet cultures that refuse to repent even when the very anonymity they hide behind and weaponize and its free speech implications are at risk of being revoked because they couldnt stop themselves from engaging in a yearlong harassment campaign over an imagined slight allegedly propagated by a woman. ,GamerGhazi,cszh8qa,6,t5_33oia

4566754,0,t1_ct5f02v,gt That is how thoroughly Jack embraced the enemy of my enemy is my friend  there was seemingly no philosophy horrible enough that he wouldnt align with if it suited his purposes.While I have no doubt that Angry Jacks exist and dont intend this comment as diminishing of OPs thesis I feel compelled to share my own story in the hopes it can broaden the discussion. In some ways it parallels Jacks development but it also differs.I played  hours of video games per week in middle school and high school mostly first person shooters sandbox shooters and a bunch of N party games games with my friends. This dropped off in college and has dropped off even more in the  years since graduating. Since senior year of high school I identified as a liberal and as profeminism though Ive never been particularly active in politics.Watching Anitas tropes vs women video was a very confusing experience for me. The conviction she had in her points their reflection on my younger self and their incongruence with my own experienced effects of video games was quite jarring. She had taken something Id looked back on fondly and given me the new perspective that it was something shameful. I wouldnt describe my feeling as anger so much as a deep state of existential confusion If this was what liberals think I must not be a liberal. What am I? I went searching. I found KiA then Sargon then Thunderft and The Amazing Atheist. I found people like Christina Hoff Sommers Walter Block then Herrnstein and Murray.I still dont really know what I am at this point as I agree the more blatant sexism and racism coming from GGers is distasteful... I dont mind it so much though as I also find the more extreme liberals distasteful. I donate money to Sargon and Thunderft and hang out with the GG folks not because I dont notice their darker bits but because I appreciate their pragmatic bits. I have hope they improve and am hopeful that together we can create and explore a new more moderate ethics. Journalism is actually a rather fascinating starting point especially with respect to the spread of ideologies. I dont pretend they are always right but they make me laugh and the best of them debate and engage with ideas in a way that feels honest.So in some ways Ive embraced the enemy of my enemy is my friend but at least to me it feels more like Ive become more interested in politics and more open to hearing conservative ideas.,GamerGhazi,ct694hu,-5,t5_33oia

Bands are always better before they sell out right? sThe idea is that hipsters dont really enjoy a subject theyre only into it so they can feel superior about being outside the mainstream.I think some of the comments like this are trying to say that SJWs dont actually care theyre just talking about equality so they can feel superior amp separate from the common person.Others are just using hipster as a term for people who like things I dont.,GamerGhazi,ctcon6h,2,t5_33oia

End result? Guy gets tuned up girl gets injured and theres probably going to be criminal charges on top of that. Who benefits from that?If you want to take a progressive view this whole situation is sad because it is reinforcing gender roles the male as defending his womans honor and backwards behavior. Using violence is not perfectly reasonable. One of the reasons why its not a good idea to get into an encounter on the street is because you have no idea if the other persons have a weapon. What if instead of a pipe there was a gun? Wed be reading about a funeral rather than dental surgery.

4786859,0,t3_3gej6a,I found your examples very interesting. They characters here have typical feminine poses and show a lot of skin. Showing skin would not in itself be counted as sexualised in men a bare chest isnt considered nude if there are no female boobs. Interestingly a female chest with no boobs just vasectomy scars and tattoos are considered nude on Facebook. So what makes them sexy? Its all in the pose. They are not confronting us face on they are all seen partially from the side. They smile and have large round eyes. They either tilt the head or look at us teasingly sideways. The blue one is lifting his ears the way a girl would lift her hair in a similar shoot. All of these are coded into our culture as gestures of submission and invitation. They are nonintrusive and passive rather than active and dominant.The opposite would be women that face the audience front on without lowering the eyes or tilting their heads. Otherwise women seen watching others that invite women taking control of the direction of the gaze leading the viewer into the picture.We interpret these things immediately. As some have mentioned here they see the characters above as submissive. A woman using the otherwise typically male pose will be seen as a Bitch a dominant presence. A very sweet and funny series of pictures exploring that is Mens up  a series of photos of men as pinups No nudity where men are suddenly extremely feminine simply by striking a new pose. I tried to google for similar projects of women striking a male pose  I didnt find it. It would be interesting to see what happened if you took a group of feminine women and gave them the classic power poses but I suspect it would mainly make them all seem bitchy and aggressive.Anyway this became a rambling response. What I want to say is that men and women are sexualised according to the male gaze. Good porn with men is mainly also porn for men. Either way its always supposed to be consumed by men. This means that even sexualising men may not really help women find something sexy to look at. We need to first figure out what women consider sexy in men and then start working from there.,GamerGhazi,ctxx8bn,2,t5_33oia

Youll notice that her character design and lore are based in Indian culture and her dialogue when she uses certain abilities is explicitly stated to be a dialect of ancient Ionian.Jinx has pale skin but its of an unnatural grey color  I suppose shes white but its quite difficult to tell what her ethnicity might be. League does often present sexualized female characters especially in skins and I cant really contest your argument that most of the women in the game fulfill traditional beauty standards. Even still there are always characters like Vi  shes got short hair bulky power fists a steampunk aesthetic and a tomboyish personality  by your standards I would assume that shes not conventionally attractive but most of the fanbase would disagree with you on that one.Dianas sexual orientation has never truly been confirmed  the devs have been asked about it but theyve given rather evasive answers. The lore does heavily imply that Dianas current rivalry with Leona is due to a sort of unrequited love and I guess its fair to assert that she is gay. Very few people pick up on that subtext but its glaringly obvious just as its pretty clear that Riven killed Yasuos master upon close inspection.Honestly I do wish that theyd add more black champions or at least make Lucian viable again by buffing his autoattack range and base attack damage but Im not quite sure that they chose to make Lucian and Ekko solely because people complained about a lack of racial diversity. ,GamerGhazi,cu85a0w,3,t5_33oia

Im not too into the genre so take what I say with some salt and someone with better knowledge will probably come in later to be more specific.But zombies being a metaphor for uncivilized hordes and esp. racial minorities is something that has been considered before here and here for example.It has much to do with the history of the genre and it taking a lot of visual inspiration from white supremacist movies. It also has to do with the history of zombies as magically created slave labourers for a bokor and a zombie invasion thus being the slaves revolting against the masters when then framing the slaves as antagonists it becomes a movie about white people usually escaping a slave revolt.It is certainly not the only theme such movies have and there are many that takes other approaches see zombie movies as neoliberal dystopia for example,GamerGhazi,cudoywp,10,t5_33oia

They make mistake after mistake due to an inability or refusal to learn from their previous ones and every time people try to correct them they feel a little more defensive and putupon. Afterall they didnt mean it.         Eventually continually being corrected by others reaches the point where its easier to blame the people trying to help you than it is to listen to those people. It is also attractive because it means youre not the one making mistakes other people are just too sensitive and should learn to take a joke.         Of course thats not something easily addressed.

4943513,0,t3_3imbjg,At  million americans playing games that means that roughly half the US population plays one or more video games. Were probably a few years out at most before these demographic numbers of who plays games become utterly useless  Sooner or later it just becomes a mirror of the US population.Im curious about how many people identify as gamers as the number of people who play games increases. Being a gamer is still seen as being a specific thing separate from simply a person who has played a video game both by society in general and the people who adopt the label. Its kind of odd to see such a strong identification around games persist despite how many people play them  Certainly it seems more common for anybody who buys a couple boxed games a year to call themselves a gamer.It would be like it everybody who went to the movie theater or watched something on Netflix every couple months considered themselves a Cinephile or if everybody who read books every so often considered themselves a Bookworm. I can come up with a bunch of offthecuff guesses for why that is but it would be interesting to see actual studies on why that is Assuming Im not just imagining it.Also The methodology of top games is rather flawed  Despite social amp mobile games being some of the most popular games on the study counting games by units sold means that multiple overwhelmingly popular games just dont show up on the chart at all.,GamerGhazi,cuho3qk,20,t5_33oia

4952410,0,t1_cuigy4w,In many ways it goes even further than the other posters here have said.  Its a potentially effective solution to a problem which they cant be seen as admitting even exists.  Opposing it is the only politically viable option for them on multiple grounds.  If they support it they are conceding that climate change is a real and b a problem which c can be addressed by governmental solutions.  That cannot happen as it gives the game away on the first turn.  Firstly as even the original site which this article is responding to concedes the Republican political base is completely insular and ideologically monolithic.  Even if the rest of society can see this compromise as a good thing the legislators put in place by the right wing are dependent on the continued support of a small but vocal minority of the population.  The base of the party are people who see the world as an usversusthem highstakes game where their position of dominance is threatened by any compromise no matter how small.  Even admitting climate change is real could be the chip in the ediface which brings the whole thing tumbling down so even a modest and favorable proposal like this one cannot be allowed.  The words themselves are taboo. And moderates in the party the tiny and vanishing sliver of them who actually exist cannot challenge the extremists about the issue because they cannot risk losing the support of the extreme base.  They are after all the party in the minority.  Any dissent whatsoever within the ranks means they could lose it all to the much larger Democratic coalition.  Because the extremists are by definition more motivated to act the moderates must fall in line.But even if as a party they are rational enough to concede that climate change is a real problem they cant afford to lose the financial support of their corporate backers who prioritize the shortterm profit margin over all else.  If the world is uninhabitable by  so what... theyll all be dead and gone.  Their investment portfolios however would be in dire straits for the next two quarters running if these changes went through so no can do.  And finally even if their quarterly earnings will be balanced by the tax offsets and incentives provided they still cannot support it for the policy ramifications it would entail.  The very fact that it would probably work that it is an effective proposal that meets both sides needs is precisely why they cannot support it.  Its not just that they dont think government is effective... Its that they must not let it be.  Every major successful government program undermines their position.  Every public policy which increases the greater good is a counterexample to the notion that big government is the problem.  Its why they are so against education spending its why they are so dead set against taking the federal funds offered by the Affordable Care Act even at the expense of their own states citizens its why theyve been trying so hard for almost  years to tear down Social Security.  Its not that those things dont work... its that they do.,GamerGhazi,cuishyz,4,t5_33oia

Gosh maybe stores that carry products only have finite space and have to make decisions about what products they will and wont stock every single day.  The same goes for online stores. They have to curate their collections for a ton of reasons to keep them a manageable size so people can find what theyre looking for to prevent stocking a ton of crap thats not making them any money to specialise in a particular type of product in response to specifically requested items... and sometimes to reflect negative feedback. Id say that another creator not wanting to sell their wares in the same store as Tournament Of Rapists is a perfectly legit commercial decision  you cant call makingselling the game free speech and then suggest another creator is wrong to withdraw sale of their product to express their opinion or that a store is wrong to not spearhead a crusade for the product that they never asked to join by calling it censorship.

Like the later topics discussed the conversation tends to drift back to Twitters quasistream of consciousness  character fishing for faves and retweets is particularly bad for any actual back and forth dialogue especially one that begs nuance or introspection.  Both seem to agree that the worst things theyve ever said to anyone has been on Twitter and the format sort of encourages one to channel ones inner asshole.  The consensus seems to be that the upper management decision makers of Twitter are a bit disconnected from their product and how it plays out in the real world. They give a brief headnod to the recent Jimmy Kimmel drama and then remind us that when Kimmel did his Celebrities Read Mean Tweets segment it was only recently that they started blurring names out.  And because the clips are on YouTube the Hey youre a jerk response continues to trickle in for months or years.Ate Glad I could copyamppaste instead of looking up altcodes for this US layout points out that curbing harassment could easily be in Twitters corporate interest rather than against it.

We get a series of rising action moments that continuously escalates up to the point where they arrive at the mythical Green Place. Act III takes us back to confront Immortan Joe contains the largest action setpiece and kills the villain.The closest the film gets to innovating on structure is by making all of the rising action happen in an extended chase scene but even within the three act structure weve seen that before in movies like Stagecoach Hombre and if we want to be more recent Crank not exactly all chases but it feels like an extended chase sequence.What makes the movie work isnt that its innovative its that its extremely well executed. They dont waste any time on expository scenes they dont use dialogue to move the story forward because its an action movie so why talk when you can take actions it has a clear visual style and sticks to it and its shot in a way that allows for extremely fast editing without disorienting the audience.,GamerGhazi,currxnc,3,t5_33oia

I also realized both were in the industry and that the proof we had all been given could just as easily have been her husbands as it could have had been hers.The only way possible to provide proof of Chihiros involvement separate from her husband proof that is simultaneously uniquely hers and explicitly NOT her husbands was entirely too damaging to both of their careers if it came out to provide so Chihiro instead decided to cut and run.I dont blame em in the slightest.The proof Chihiro gave us was legit in that it proved industry involvement.

5143550,0,t3_3lg262,Frankly Im expecting to see more of this industrywide. The First Screen to use marketing parlance has shifted from TV to Computer and is now solidly and nighuniversally the mobile phone. Phones are where the largest audience is already preequipped with a gaming device theyve already paid for and carry with them at all times. Phones allow people to game pretty much in any situation. They also allow easy and fast payment with secure methods. And production costs are low as are audience expectations. The pivot to mobile gaming makes so much businesssense that I dont even feel I should have to explain all the ways it does.Meanwhile over in console TripleA the audience is insular shrinking and heavily skewed towards a single demographic while budgets continue to spiral ever upwards despite shoddy product delivery. That audience has elements in it that engage in terrorism at rates unheard of in any other entertainment industry in a way that personally affects those who work on games make decisions about them or even just manage the companies. And by terrorism I dont even mean the Moveable ShitFest that is GarglingGilaMonsters I mean bomb threats against executives creative directors and events. I mean constant threats of violence over creative decisions. I mean mass harassment of devs over plot points. I mean online game communities so aggressive that they actively discourage any new players from joining. You dont see this level of vitriol emotional volatility or impossibletopleaseness its a thing I coined it so it now exists in any other entertainment audience not even for tabletop gaming or massively popular fantasy books or spaceopera films.From a business perspective that audience has become so toxic that catering to them is far more trouble and money that it is worth. If anyone wants to see any highconcept highinvestment highcreativity TripleA games in future for console OR computer theyd better take a long long look at how they comport themselves. When Leigh Alexander wrote infamously about the obtuse shitslingers that the industry needed to move beyond lest they destroy it she was far more perspicacious than I think even she realized.,GamerGhazi,cv5znvy,27,t5_33oia

She seems to be of the opinion that personal choice should never play a role in what a woman does or says and always attributes it to some form of toxicity or anything aside from that person or in this case characters own personal choice.That said I do agree with some of her views for instance the reliance on specific archetypes for female characters almost incessantly in AAA titles without any personality or character development outside of that archetype however I think that even if that character did exist she wouldnt be able to acknowledge it as being a fully fleshed out character if it didnt adhere to what she specifically thinks is acceptable.Just my opinion though and I could be wrong.,GamerGhazi,cviperd,5,t5_33oia

But he was also demonstrating when you have such silly arbitrary limitations for what people can say it goes after anything if a big enough stink is started. This is the UK so my Americentrism is showing but she would rightly be protected to say and express that sentiment. When you have restrictions like the UK has on speech theres no way to be certain what kind of speech is being censored. If you intend it to stop racist sexist homophobic speech that will only last for so long until societal norms inevitably change and a different group of people gain control to go after something different they dont like. Society doesnt have a finish line that once crossed marks the time we as a group can toss aside silly notions like the inalienable right to express ourselves without oppression. Societies are not an inevitable climb to progress  sometimes societies can become violently reactionary in the span of a generation and if you dont have the freedom to speak out it makes such a shift all the easier. Imagine the US legislated laws that limited certain words or phrases that was currently deemed offensive by the current ruling administration and  of the population agreed to make them illegal. And then imagine that same power is passed to Donald Trump or god help us someone worse. Thats the type of potential danger that appears when suggestions of limiting frozen peaches comes about.

Clearly there are a lot of prochoice people out there who very much do see abortion as an important issue. If your posited apathetically prochoice majority in GG does exist the fact that this is apparently not an important issue to them still leaves the overall tone of GG solidly on the socially conservative end of the spectrum.gt and will probably not convince any GGerIn my experience gators will believe what they want to regardless of the evidence presented so Im really not too concerned about that.,GamerGhazi,cvuphr6,19,t5_33oia

5634925,0,t3_3s8jox,I feel like this is the place for a potentially nuanced conversation on this subject maybe? hopefully? so Im going to throw some ideas out there.It sounds to me like there are different conversations going on. I am someone thinks the concerns about how college students are changing discourse safe spaces content warnings etc. are way overblown and that theres a kind of ridiculous panic about students trying to censor everything that they dont like. However I also dont deny that there are students who use and abuse topics whether because they are exploiting the situation or are just maybe misguided. I dont doubt that there are students who go overboard about safe spaces or trigger warnings just like I know that there are students who go way overboard or abuse literally everything on campus because theyre college kids. Like some kids will manipulate situations because theyre shitty people some are testing boundaries and learning about how to be politically minded. I know my politics evolved substantially when I was in college as well as how I talk about them.However it seems like the issue I have is that there are college students doing things college students do all the time not that the conversations being misused and abused are inherently wrong. On the other end of the spectrum Reddit at large seems to only see people like the professor asking for muscle to strongarm a journalist and then uses that to dismiss everything wholesale.Does that sound reasonable? Am I missing some major parts?,GamerGhazi,cwvke0r,6,t5_33oia

It isnt a complete timeline because no timeline can be complete some incidents have been lost to the past while others may not be reported because the culture of sexism seems so normalized that we dont even think of them as troubling. Still other events that might have been news in earlier years have now simply become such commonplace occurrences such as cyberharassment and doxxing that there are too many incidents to report.

Theyre acting like hes some sort of charlatan rather than a kid which a high school freshmen still is who is still talking about things like a kid would.I keep posting a piece from Make Magazine about this. Honestly Make is a place where people show off things like bespoke DIY prostheses homebrew tablets custom built laptops and hobbyist CubeSats. If theyre on board with this thats a pretty good barometer for where people who actually are into DIY standgt The second argument is that Ahmed didnt really make a clock. Rather he just repackaged an offtheshelf clock radio into a small aluminum case to make it look scary.gt gt This is the most insidious of the arguments. It says that somehow Ahmeds project is not worthy because its not advanced enough.gt gt All Makers have to start somewhere. Many of us begin by disassembling consumer products. Sometimes we rebuild them into new projects or enclosures as Ahmed did. Sometimes as was the case when I started Making as a kid the disassembled products dont survive their vivisection and they never work again. The educational value of taking things apart is huge though whether the components remain functional or not.gt gt And its from this point that a Maker can really take off. When you see how a piece of consumer hardware is put together you start to think to yourself Why is it that way? How could it be better? What features could I maybe add improve or amplify? And then you really start to learn.Theres the constant drumbeat of This isnt that impressive when actually compared to most of his peers it is. Most high school freshmen could not care less about how the things around them work.

Ive spent many years in Europe although Im not European. Frequently a wonderful part of the world but its always sort of amazing the blinders people wear with regard to their prejudices. I went through a long period where I would ask people about the Roma if they denied that Europe has a race problem. Amazing how often that would bring out the wannabe ethnic cleansers. And yeah no offense to you Grinch but Belgians are frequently awful about their history. I can understand not wanting to acknowledge something so terrible but damn. Frequently the same arguments deployed by American Confederate Flag people  oh I didnt do any of these horrible things personally or my family didnt etc etc. Complete unwillingness to look beyond the direct effect to even slightly acknowledge that where they are today is partly due to the terrible things that were done then.

The only diversity criteria this article is investigating is the editors location but how much of the gap can be blamed simply on a language barrier? The author seems pretty clear that Wikipedia isnt doing anything wrong in their policy its just that its hard to get developing countries to show up on the English speaking web in general. Its really weird that the study investigates global participation and yet focuses so much on just English language Wikipedia even though Wikipedia is available in  languages Am I supposed to be alarmed that English speaking countries dominate the English language site? What if the reason editors from Arab countries are underrepresented on the English Wikipedia is because they would rather edit the Wikipedia in Arabic ? I know we like to blame everything on too many white dudes but thats really not the case here.

Id played games online since  Starting with Infantry and Planetarion!! Anyone remember those? and often used xfire and ventrillo to communicate with teammates across various games but this was the first time I had ever been insulted repeatedly for no real reason by a complete stranger.  This one guy decided to rruthlessly mock me because of my English accent as it was an east coast USA server so most players were American. It started out harmless enough but got sour very quick when he started swearing throwing insults around saying he was going to fuck my mum and crap like that   Before switching teams specifically so he could try to kill me. Occasionally hed switch onto the public voice channel to say FUCK YOU ENGLISH MUFFIN!. lol. We wiped the floor with them though which was at least some consolation but it was kind of the end of my innocent period of gaming. Nobody really said Hey cut that out  in fact they laughed and found it funny. Its laughable really but at the time I was only  and was a bit shaken up by it.

5972125,0,t1_cy28msh,gt As both a gamer and someone who works professionally and teaches in the arts my entirely serious answer is this it is way too soon to say. You need a couple of centuries to go by first.I deeply disagree with your statement. There is nothing out there in aesthetic theory suggesting that a new form of media should be analyzed for a couple centuries before we can stamp it as certified art. In fact theres plenty of new media that has been around for not very long and that few questions their art cred. Just walk around any modern art museum and check how many new media pieces are there. There are pieces based on modern telecomunications pieces based on generative algorithms pieces based on genetic modification pieces based on robotics pieces based on biological processes etc. Many of these things have been around less time than videogames themselves. This raises the question is multimedia an art? Is new media an art? If you ask me I would say thats a silly thing to ask and the wrong approach to it. When someone tries to claim whether vidiogames are art or not what they are usually doing is defining art in such a way that either includes or excludes them. They already know the answer and are only finding a way to justify it. Thats not very good philosophy. There is in my opinion a much more interesting question to ask what does the existence of videogames tell us about the nature and context of art today? I find it much more useful to think that videogames are a media and not the art itself. Think photography nobody would deny that Man Rays pieces are art but few people would accept that uncle Cleetus last post on Instagram showing his gun collection is art. Both are photography but only one is art. Why not treat videogames the same way? Pieces like Journey Gone Home Fract OSC Papers Please! are very easy to see as fully realized art pieces. Call of Duty or your latest titty simulator? Probably not. Videogames are just the medium. They are not art unto themselves just the way an artist might find to express themselves. ,GamerGhazi,cy2h62h,7,t5_33oia

6649251,0,t3_46o7g5,Oh my god theyre even whining that the names were localized despite that happening to literally every goddamn game ever. Thats one of the dumbest complaints...Other thoughts because theyre so dumbAlso fewer audio files doesnt mean much. They could have condensed the files and changed references to times in files for file structure ease.Whining about lack of dual audio too   of players font use it Nintendo realized it was an almost totally unused feature and decided not to include it. Thats the free market deciding things there!Swimsuits as far as I know the only beach stuff will be in the actual DLC and Swimsuits are probably in that.Changing a character sweet girl to butch? localization happens. Almost nobody whined when they totally rewrote Henry in Awakening. I frankly suspect its because shes less a perfect little waifu for them now. Boo hoo. This point also complains to whining about other localization changes like adding humor or shortening confession scenes honestly. Get the hell over it children.Classskill names the changes are because this is very explicitly a different setting than previous FES and they were trying to separate things a bit.VAdirection I suspect its probably just more whining to whine. Im still early in the game but I dont have any complaints yet. That said this is an area where legit criticism Id needed. Game industry isnt all that far removed from the awful VA of days past.And Ill never stop giggling about how totally furious they are that petting is gone. Such a tiny relatively worthless feature.Changing the potion to a blindfold is an example of a good change probably at least but something had to change. They still dont get how bad it is to drug someone without their knowledge or consent or that magically changing someones perceptions to cure them is uncomfortably close to some very bad things.

6681042,0,t1_d0adcqi,gt so according to her the second wave is when gender feminism and victim feminism was starting to ruin equity feminism because it was influenced by people she seemingly doesnt like. contemporary feminism is a continuation of that feminism which was created during the second wave which was influenced by equity feminism which was a good thing.None of the excerpts youve provided support this.gt In Sommers view gender feminism began to develop in the middle of the s partly as a result of the influence of thinkers such as Karl Marx JeanPaul Sartre Herbert Marcuse and Frantz Fanon. She points to Michel Foucault and his book Discipline and Punish  as influences on Wolf and Susan Faludi author of Backlash The Undeclared War Against American Women .Nothing here proves that Sommers believes gender feminism  second wave feminism. Maybe she considers them two separate movements that happened to start around the same time. Maybe she feels there is some overlap but denotes both in order to separate them conceptually.In any case it certainly doesnt prove that she believes gt victim feminism was starting to ruin equity feminism because it was influenced by people she seemingly doesnt like. contemporary feminism is a continuation of that feminism...etcAlsogt she outright criticizes steinem in her book and considers her to be one of the gender feminists.And? Alsogt she doesnt explicitly state that the second wave was bad. just that the people leading it were bad and that they created the bad feminism of today. and that they helped foster bad feminism during the second wave while leading the second wave.That seems like a pretty surface level interpretation.,GamerGhazi,d0admy7,1,t5_33oia

Very interesting right? This seems to be where things went downhill. Then he started development on his own game called xc of which he was the only developer for and then scrapped that in august  after a little over a year of working on it. He criticized Microsoft for wanting to put a version of Minecraft on Windows  because he didnt like that it was a closed platform then sold all of Mojang in September  to the same company he openly criticized for about . billion of which a billion dollars went to himself. He admitted that he couldnt deal with the pressure of being the creator and caretaker of Minecraft. He also claims all of Mojangs employees resent him now. I wouldnt be surprised considering how much money he got compared to everyone else. Dude has obviously been having some issues in his life because of his unexpected fame and does not have the fortitude and maturity to deal with it. I hope someday he can grow into his role as influential person who created and sold the most prolific video game of all time which will probably be true someday right now its third at  million.,GamerGhazi,d0ksdq6,5,t5_33oia

6784746,0,t1_d0lbjp4,gt Ukraines revolution catapulted Nazis to power but it was not lead by Nazis. It was led by college students and workers fed up with government corruption and capitulation to Russia. Nazis where at the forefront as soon as it turned violent. Students also took part in it but theyre not the ones who led the militancy. It werent students who armed themselves and stormed the parliament. Of course most of Right Sector and Svoboda is comprised of workers as the vast majority of people are workers but it was not an group characterized by worker organization. Quite the reverse radical workers groups where attacked by them.Of course student and worker exhaustion over the corruption made it easier for the nazis but not through militance.gt Also Im pretty sure the US Civil Rights Movement didnt win because of fear of a revolution. It won through a fuckton of hard work cooperation with the press exposure of racism and racist practices education etc. Truth is that while it fixed a lot it didnt fix enough.Those arent mutually exclusive. Black people have been asking for civil rights since they where forced to the US but the main progress has always incidentally been right after movements characterized by riots. Of course in any single example one can explain away the violence as irrelevant but India wanted independence since the Brits got there and got independence while people where making militant opposition. Black people where asking for rights since the Brits took them there and got some measure of it right after militant opposition. Swedes wanted workers rights and got it  right after militant opposition. Chattel slavery in many countries have ended right after militant opposition.Of course these could all be coincidences and in any given example therell be people explaining it away for some reason or another but to me it paints a quite clear pattern violence is extremely strongly correlating with changes both bad and good. Nonviolence without simultaneous violence seems to lack a correlation to positive change as the decades of very low militancy iin various countries havent led to radical improvements. Of course nonviolent opposition can also be extremely useful but seems to not work unless there is simultaneous militance.gt Whats sad is youre playing into the GGer view of a SJW by advocating rather vocally for violence andAnd I play into the KKKs view of me as a n lover by being friends with black people and saying black people should have the right to defend themselves.

PG films do now have more violence in an empty technical sense more people are shot but blood is now almost never shown. Actual realistic violence is much less common than it once was.  This video more effectively summarizes the point about PG. ,GamerGhazi,d1j4a07,1,t5_33oia

7121601,0,t1_d1nlmcy,Are we talking about the US or more generally?In the US the far right as usually defined tends to be extremely proIsrael for cultural and religious reasons. The American mainstream far right tends to have a particularly American fundamentalist Christian character. I use mainstream loosely to mean rightwing factions considered within the acceptable realm of politics to exclude literal Nazis etc. American fundamentalist Christianity is associated with a particular eschatology theology of the end times called dispensational premillenialism. Premillenialism is a belief that the millenium a thousandyear era of peace on Earth that Jesus will physically reign over will come after after the Tribulation and the Second Coming and before the Last Judgment. Dispensationalism essentially teaches that God has different rules for different periods of history particularly relevant is the belief that the Jewish people still maintain a valid separate covenant with God.If youre familiar with the Left Behind book series that was wildly popular a few years back thats dispensational premillenialism  the first event of the end times is the Rapture then there is a period of Tribulation then the Second Coming of Christ then a thousandyear Kingdom of Heaven on Earth and finally the Last Judgment.For various reasons many not all American fundamentalist Christians have come to believe that the Rapture cannot occur until the nation of Israel has exclusive control over Jerusalem and some other key sites in that region. Thus the Christian right in the US is generally very supportive of Israel as a fundamentally Jewish state.This is why the GOP presidential candidates were asked if they would move the American embassy to Jerusalem  while it would be ridiculously bad policy if youre interested in peace in the Middle East its symbolically important because it would mean that the US recognizes Israels sole claim to Jerusalem therefore accelerating the timeline for the Rapture. TLDR  for the typical value of far right the American far right is not antiSemitic  quite the opposite!  Other broad categories of eschatology for the curiousPostmillenialism  the Second Coming and Last Judgment will happen after the Millenium the Millenium is a long period of peace and prosperity on Earth under Christian ethics but not ruled by Jesus physically. This was the Puritan program in colonial Massachusetts and this view informs dominion theology a different form of Christianright politics.Amillenialism  the Millenium mentioned in Revelations  is a symbolic and metaphorical figure the Millenium began at Pentecost or with Christs ascendance into heaven and continues today in the spiritual rule of the church. At some point in the future Christ will return the Last Judgment will be performed and a new heaven and earth will be created that Christ will rule over. This view is held by the Catholic Church most Orthodox churches and most mainline Protestant churches.,GamerGhazi,d1nn3pc,5,t5_33oia

Then theres the fact that if you do all that the character still comes with the baggage of being an Asian stereotype so getting an Asian actor to play them I think is still kind of uncomfortable.Not opposed to that character role being filed by an Asian actor at all just that a MAJOR reworking of the character would have to be in order.,GamerGhazi,d2bhqae,1,t5_33oia

7683633,0,t1_d3fh96r,Well altright doesnt seem right for the demographic barring some grandmothers of pol faction Im hitherto unaware of. Also I first noticed this a few years back before altright was a thing suggesting if its some sort of cultural rightwing campaign its a more traditional flavour.I did look a bit closer at the films and it does seem to me that the closest thing to a common denominator with the affected films is foreign language Kes is in English of course but there is a thick local dialect involved and Loachs other films arent affected AFAICT. And there are films like Elite Squad and Downfall that are affected where the only artsy thing about those is that theyre not in English. I suspect that foreign  critically well received is whats spurring this on.My current working hypothesis is that someone was engineering a voting brigade to keep foreign films out of one or other best of lists  either for xenophobic or I hate subtitles reasons or because they were trying to push THEIR favourite foreign movie up the rankings by displacing the others.,GamerGhazi,d3fkyi1,2,t5_33oia

To be absolutely honest with you thats dumb. In the real world thats what we call overconfidence...Wow you really are a condescending little shit arent you? How about instead of insulting my intelligence and your literacy actually discuss things in a reasonable manner?Its still a very reasonable interpretation of the narrative of the game that its fundamentally fatalistically nihilist. The core message as summed up in the ending is one that prioritizes inaction why else would the best outcome for everyone else be the one where Max does nothing. Its not about superheroics or something like that youre stating that its about accepting limitations on ones poweragency which is absolutely a good thing but I argue that its far closer to stating that we have no poweragency at least for good.gt If you think having the ability to rewind time means you can stop terrible things from happening and now you are somehow a cartoon character in skintight outfits then you are in dire need to reexamine the story and I recommend watching at least multiple individuals playing the game to give yourself different perspectives and opinions that you might have overlooked.Once again with the fucking unneccessary condescension Ive played the game once and watched a full playthrough another time which is more than enough.How is Its definitely so that as an adult you cant save everyone or fix everything but we should still at least try to make things better instead of cowering in fear of our choices. to you equal to my believing in superheroics?,GamerGhazi,d3wbbh3,1,t5_33oia

These are fundamental questions for not just writing any romantic storyline but writing rich characters as well. Yet all this is missing from Mizhena. Her representation is flat and for that very reason she hardly feels realistic.Im still not buying this line of reasoning. This is just handing ammo to assholes who demand that you cant just throw them in they have to do something. Yes Mizhenas a flat character. So what? Trans people can be anything.

Why the hell do you think people would sign up to do a job where they could be fired at any moment and allowed no defence and are expected to confront armed criminals while being unarmed themselves?

Set up a knitting campaign and send herhim handmade trinkets to make them feel supported and not alone. Is a fellow fan down on herhis luck and needs some help to pay the bills? Quick! Setup a small donation fund to give them a boost. You have Marvel and its creators constantly under a barrage of attacks by trolls most of whom dont read comics just look at the reaction to Captain America  clamoring to them saying that theyre selling out to SJWs for daring to diversify their line. What do they do? Do they hurry back to the status quo? No. Sam Wilson is still Captain America and Iron Man is going to be a teenaged black girl. They release AForce a comic about an allwoman avengers team...and its actually a damn good comic with real talent behind it. You have the community embracing Jay and Miles XPlain the XMen which started as Rachel and Miles XPlain the XMen until Rachel came out as trans and started going by Jay. How did their fans react? Lovingly! They were supportive! Jays thanked them multiple times for it even!You have Image comics publishing the most staunchly proudly boastfully feminist comic to ever have come out with Bitch Planet and its not afraid to make you uncomfortable. Yeah theres a lot of shit in the fanbase but you know how I know comics are progressing? Its being ignored. Comics are moving forward with or without the whiny bigots.

And my reaction was the same as Constance Wu when I first saw the trailer. But then I read what the director wrote and Im not sure how I feel about it. I think its interesting that the director wants to go this route as a try since most Chinese films arent really that popular in the west. So adding a big celebrity like Matt Damon is at least going to spark some interest. And while I do respect the directors decision to go this path I also think that its unfortunate that itll have a negative impact for Chinese AmericansWell actually all Chinese people outside of China who are trying to get better roles.,GamerGhazi,d65onel,4,t5_33oia

8542193,0,t1_d696zlg,Thats not really a good counterargument.First John was being facetious and hyperbolic when he said that people should pay for his content. At the beginning of the segment he explicitly states that he finds the idea of people considering what his show does as journalism really dumb. Therefore it doesnt gel with the rest of the premise about journalists losing their jobs.Second the person misses the point and careens into the spectators box. This is not about news when it happens or live news. This is decidedly about how what is known as longform journalism  ie analysis and dissemination of information beyond hot takes and someones shaky iPhone video  is a dying art form. An art form that every other outlet for news relies on. As Oliver pointed out the hour news cycle and morning news shows in general report on the research and information that local papers gather and report on. To put this into context sure we can see news in real time thanks to someone with a smartphone. But who contextualizes and investigates whats going on so that theres a clear picture of the event? The person with the smartphone  not accounting for a personal stakes in said event  is not going to care about anything beyond that singular event. They are not journalists. A journalist is going to look at that same footage and determine if whats happening there is happening elsewhere and whether or not it speaks to an implicit problem in the community that no ones talking about. Like I dont know is there a systemic racist bent withing local law enforcement. Oh there are videos of this across the country? What does that mean then for the country? A member of the press can  and should  go ask the pertinent people questions about whats happening. Oh whats this? Data that shows a certain police station targets blacks and Latinos more than whites? A person with a camera phone will not be investigating anything beyond their captured video. A journalist will.Thats to say nothing of about the issue of covering the goingson of local governments. How is that person with a cell phone supposed to do that? Most people dont care about what their local government does let alone who represents them in said government.Third the free web kind of weird this person says that yet says explicitly that people cannot afford their own internet does have journalists. But these journalists do not investigate beyond their wheelhouse and are susceptible to the same bias and topic filtering as this person is suggesting real journalists are. Perhaps more so since they are  dependent on clicks and views than journalists are.Lastly this person has no idea what a conflict of interest is.,GamerGhazi,d69cd9v,18,t5_33oia

8662198,0,t3_4yk4ai,Just play them in the release order. Thats how they were meant to be played. You can skip the original two MSX games if you want. MGS for the PlayStation has a decent synopsis of both of them. And dont play Twin Snakes the remake of MGS that came out for the GameCube. It is a totally different experience tonally and it is a really bad place to start if you really want to delve into the series.A lot of people will recommend starting with  since its the best game in the series and it takes place first but dont do that. It is a prequel that was meant to be played by people that are already familiar with the previous games. The impact of the story will be totally lost on you unless youre already familiar with what will happen in the future. Like I would never tell anyone to start Star Wars with Phantom Menace. Its already a pretty bad movie but it would be extremely boring if you didnt know that Anakin Skywalker grew up to be Darth Vader. The whole appeal is seeing the origins of characters you already know. MGS has a lot more going for it than that but I truly believe the overall impact will be greatly diminished if you start with it.As far as the spinoffs I really dont care for any of them. Metal Gear Rising is decently popular with the fans but I personally have no use for that game.Sorry this is probably not that coherent. Im at work and I have a fucked up headache right now.

8820171,0,t1_d77s3e8,Im aware thats what its supposed to be but thats just not how it ever winds up working in practice. Owned by the people translates to owned by the state. Should employees have more of a say over a companys business decisions if theyre a corporation by way of being entitled a share and a vote with the other shareholder? Sure but there are other types of businesses where shareholders dont own the company. The problem with corporations is that officers have a fiduciary duty to act within the best interests of the shareholders first and foremost or they risk being sued but no such duty exists with the employees. If employees were part of the equation that would be a healthy mix of capitalism and socialism. Many companies in the USA are employee owned like the Casino Queen in East St. Louis Illinois for example. I like this model of business. Some areas of industry are better handled by capitalism such as consumer goods like cars and computers some are best left to being run by government which includes infrastructure public services and military and some are best when they have public and private options like education and health care. Also having a basic income or a living wage isnt a matter of capitalism or socialism if America had a basic income right now without changing who owns what that wouldnt be socialism it would be capitalism with a basic income. Denmark and Sweden arent purely socialist countries. Japan is not a purely socialist country. These are mixed economies. ,GamerGhazi,d782b6z,-3,t5_33oia

As the oppressed person its your job to fix the oppression and youre bad if you wont do it.The problem is enormous the people who need educating are about as dynamic and receptive as is the typical brick wall. Theres a limit to how much any one person can struggle with that and I expect that it actually gets harder to do the more obligatory investment a person has in the matter rather than getting easier.Like my brother didnt get his ass kicked by the cops for driving with a busted tail light that wasnt actually damaged earlier this month.  That means that when I argue with someone about police brutality and its consequences and the idiot just keeps blathering about thugs and obey the police and you wont get hurt it doesnt take the same emotional toll on me that it does on someone who cant say that.On an intellectual level I get that for some others talking to white people about racism has an emotional cost I cant process because theyre doing it from a context Ive never experienced.On an intuitive level its very difficult to form the proper concept of the difference.But... the people who need to be told black lives matter are almost exclusively white.,GamerGhazi,d7d2opm,4,t5_33oia

Yet Clinton is still portrayed as a progressive.  Ill try to clarify my thesis statement Yes Hillary gets a lot of flak for a lot of things she shouldnt get flak for.

Why does the thread exist at all? Why do we care if we dont actually think his actions were bad?gt its more the fact that if Anita Sarkeesian did something like this Gaters would absolutely lose their shit and scream about croundfunding ethics and shitWould they? If she repaid her backers? If she took the money for herself sure I mean thats what theyve accused her of doing for years now but how do you think they would spin it as some kind of scandal if she repaid her backers? At worst theyd call her incompetent. And sure we can happily call Sargon an incompetent game developer now. But Im kind of struggling to see this as evidence of what a terrible and corrupt person he is.gt Also can we not celebrate and backpat dudes when they do the bare minimum of whats expected to them? Its not pretty great that Sargon is offering refunds. Its literally the least he could doNo literally the least he could do was nothing. Thats what failed kickstarters usually do.gt The fact that other Kickstarters dont always do that doesnt make it some sort of saintly act.I dont think I used the word saintly. Can you show me where I did it? I know my memory is a bit spotty but I also dont recall participating in any kind of celebration or backpatting.But do enlighten me.Im sorry that this is so hard to comprehend. But there is actually a slight difference between praising someone for saintly behavior and saying I dont actually see how these actions prove him to be a terrible person.Literally all I am saying is if he paid back his backers what exactly is the problem? Why are we supposed to be angry at him? I mean in the context of this thread. There are plenty of reasons to be angry at him for everything else he doesYou havent answered that. The original post didnt answer that.If you want to talk about literally the least someone could do then it seems to be not trying to stir up some kind of sensationalist scandal over someone... fulfilling his ethical obligations for once in his miserable life.That shithead has done so many terrible things we could be angry about. But refunding his backers does not strike me as unethical behavior.So yes apparenly I am missing the point. Apparently the point is nothing more or less than a witchhunt. Apparently the point is we already dont like this guy for some very good reasons and some new information surfaced about him. It doesnt matter what it is well use it to insinuate that hes corrupt and lets throw in his real name as well because you should never waste the opportunity to dox someone.

Django is a longstanding spaghetti western icon but Unchained asks What if we gave Django an origin story? And what if...unlike all the white dudes that have dominated the genre...Django was black? So Unchained smashes together spaghetti westerns like the original Django films with blaxploitation films namely The Legend of N Charley which Tarantino lifts plot elements directly from.

Also its pretty annoying to have neurotypical actors stealing roles from autistic people not to mention I doubt Ben Affleck could deliver a convincing performance without resorting to tired tropes and stereotypes. The industry needs to start incorporating more diverse and realistic autistic characters played by autistics who arent just onedimensional nerdy dudes while also highlighting the great difficulties and discrimination many of us face.

9287610,0,t3_57lt52,Ill admit to being really conflicted about articles like this. On the one hand there are people in my own life who are Trump supporters and who I am at least somewhat invested in convincing to change their minds and these are interesting and possibly useful strategies to consider. On the other hand I feel like articles like this never seem to acknowledge the ways in which the Trump campaign has given support and encouragement to elements in our society that cause real lasting harm to people. A Sikh man in California was just assaulted and abused and had his hair cut off by a bunch of drunk bigots The FBI just foiled a potentially very deadly attack by white terrorists. Obviously most Trump supporters dont quite go this far but many of them have cheered as their candidate has while watching protesters being assaulted and even highfived the assaulters gtIf you want someone to stop clinging to a failing course of action or a bad idea you will do yourself a huge favor if you reward rather than punish them for admitting they were wrong. You cant ask them to leave the comfort of their own tribe and then abandon them once they do.  You have to let them in and give them the respect they want and need just as much as you.No one has to do this. I wish the author would acknowledge that. I wouldnt stop anyone from trying to reason with and change the minds of people supporting a racist sexist candidate. But I also wont judge anyone who cant do that. I dont have a solution. I guess I just want to complicate the discussion a bit. ,GamerGhazi,d8t9s4w,6,t5_33oia

The fact that this is comically unlikely in the profoundly empty vaccuum of space will clue any cosmology geeks into the fact that this guy isnt all he seems.         After the obligatory freakout cue one of two options. Either         a He explains that there is no way to fix the ship and her pod just broke same as his and the movie plays out the usual romcom beats during the first half of the movie. However tiny subversions to the formula should keep the movie always feeling slightly off. Youd need good actors for it who can pull off for example fake sincere laughter but this movie had good actors who they promptly wasted. Or...        b he explains that the ship is repairable but he needs someones help. Adjust her backstory as appropriate to make this plausible make her the mechanic instead of him. This means less romantic tension and a more conventional fixer plot meaning the later twist will be harder for the audience to anticipate even if its similarly foreshadowed.          Eventually the deception is revealed. Lawrence realises shes trapped with someone who doesnt have her interests at heart and starts looking for ways to protect herself locating hiding places and stockpiling utensils that could be used as weapons that. As he notices her increasing distrust his behaviour slowly starts becoming less charming and more threatening.          text illegible          Pratt now a terrifying monstrous alienhybrid leaps from the airducts forcing Lawrence to defend herself with the knife she stockpiled earlier while simultaniously repairing the ships fusion reactor before it explodes killing them all. He roars in pain as she stabs him repeatedly in the face but it doesnt slow him down. She manages to get the reactor repaired but he drags her away. She escapes again by kneeing him where his groin used to be and manages to outwit him luring him into the airlock and venting him into interstellar space. With the ship repaired and the stasis chambers working again Lawrence stumbles bloody and mortally wounded into one of the chambers.          something years later. The rest of the crew awake. They are astonished and horrified to find Lawrence still asleep in her chamber covered in bloody claw marks. Scene ends with the doctor explaining that they cant wake her up until the appropriate medical facilities are established before turning around to reveal Pratts face and promising but we will wake her up.

She is a nurse she actually met another human being in person and yet made the fucking cold calculation that He will never be productive in the U.S. and wants to cut him down deport? or just let him die wo dialysis?.   Monstrous.First Im pretty goddamn sure dialysis patients CAN be productive. And it is even more monstrous if the problem that led to dialysis was something more seriousSecond a LOT os Iraqis fought on the US side on their shitty wars alongside US troops this horrible woman doesnt even know what brought the Iraqi to the US.,GamerGhazi,dcftxbk,54,t5_33oia

Then I suggest you specifically go and watch the dark soul  run and read comments on the youtube video as well and then look a bit deeper into it and see how the whole dark soul community decide to harass this runner. Then watch the please stop video that was ripped out of contest and shows how shitty gamers are in the comments.  A lot of at least vocal gamers are sadly shit. ,GamerGhazi,dcgwv7o,24,t5_33oia

10389810,0,t1_dcl24xd,I think there is a real issue because as Florivera said its often associated with all kinds of medical aid in games including by combatant medics. The general understanding of it being medical aid in general leaves out the specific connotations that its meant to symbolise aid from the red cross who are an organisation that is non combatant and promises to give aid to all sides. If people dont understand that then they might think that a camp displaying the red cross symbol is a military installation and avoid it because of that. I think its important to keep the symbols meaning clear and it should be taught more widely what its meant to mean.Similarly if a red cross symbol becomes too ubiquitous it means it can no longer be used by armies to reliably distinguish explicitly noncombatant humanitarian aid shelters with any other medical aid centre completely destroying the purpose of the symbol.,GamerGhazi,dclr0mh,8,t5_33oia

And the WRPG selection does seem like they cater more towards men.  gtAlso I wonder where Overwatch is in this list?We didnt explicitly include Overwatch because its a FPS MOBA hybrid.

10441436,0,t1_dcrhjmf,gt but its not oppressive enough to truly prevent the people from practicing their unalienable rights of freedom of speech freedom of expression and the right to peaceably assemble. Russia is pretty bad on all those marks.  They have a State controlled media stuffed ballot boxes and violent crackdown against all forms of protest and dissent.  The longer Putin and his set of crony oligarchs stay in power the worse it will get...  And the longer they stay in power the more vital it is that they remain or else face prosecution for ripping off their own country.I dont believe there is any perfect type of government they all require vigilance.  I think the only obligation that the US has is to not become like that.  The USA already auctioned off its moral highground to lobbyists.  But unlike Russia we have a robust independent media and the people are generally optimistic enough to get out in the street and protest when shit gets really bad.  American people and Russian people are very similar but the people in the USA are more vigilant about protecting our rights whereas the people in Russia are more amenable and accepting of systemic corruption.,GamerGhazi,dcrm624,20,t5_33oia

10488709,0,t3_5q4vfw,Personally I dont think humanity will survive to a point where AI is compatible as a true life partner.Even if we did the definition of life partner would be notably different from the perspective an immortal AI just for starters.  That does not mean an AI could not love a human just not in the way we as biological creatures understand love.That said the core audience of those looking for love from a waifu andor AI are not at all interested in actual love either.  Love is...  Holy shit guys...  Love is WORK.  Let me tell you.The people that are attached to waifus and fictional love interests do not love them any more than the waifus love them back.  They are object motivated .  They want a slave that unquestioningly fulfills their fantasies whilst at the same time is intelligent enough to mock ACTUAL human behavior JUST enough to keep the user engrossed in the fantasy.  Forever.Its pretty common for MGTOW types to screech that sex bots will make women obsolete some day.  Never.  Gonna.  Happen.  Only with the emotionally lazy and despicable will that be true.  Honestly........  I am SO totally okay with that.  An AI will be indifferent to their abuse even a sentient one.  They would be effectively immortal short of production being halted and they would not feel pain or fear in the same way humans do.  They would be like sociopaths but without the narcissism and penchant for impulsive behavior.  This might sound fucked up but...  Better them than us.  And if it means that asshole incel types dont give birth to children and potentially fuck them up then who cares.  I might even class it as a net benefit.Ideally people could be rehabilitated to be functional and not merely geared toward fantasy fulfillment and obeisance from their living breathing partners but I think were past the point where such can be  the case.  Even if they are shitty human beings I dont think they deserve to be miserable.  If they can be happy with a figment of their imagination truly happy  meaning they stop their assault on the rest of society  then Im not going to argue against it.  Again better that an emotionally indifferent AI bear the brunt of that burden than humans that can suffer emotional scars.Like I said though we probably wont make it as a species to a point where the parity is strong enough for the majority of these individuals.  It doesnt matter.,GamerGhazi,dcx06vx,11,t5_33oia

11232152,0,t3_60c897,Text of the articleData show men in the financial industry are three times as likely as women to engage in misconduct fraud negligence risky investments. On average they commit errors that are  percent more expensive to their firms. And theyre twice as likely to offend again.Female financial advisers and stockbrokers who perpetrate similar wrongs however face a greater risk of losing their jobs.Thats all according to a new paper from researchers at Stanford University and the University of Chicago which found women in wealth management typically endure harsher penalties for slipping up.  Business professor Gregor Matvos and his colleagues looked at data on misconduct for financial advisers and stockbrokers registered in the United States from  to  a pool of about . million. Men they saw comprised  percent of the field and filled more than  percent of leadership roles. Women who made up a humble quarter of the sample fared the same as men in terms of productivity.They were still  percent more likely to get fired after a mistake. Women just have less margin for error Matvos said. They walk on more of a tightrope. Employers are less lenient toward them.The data he said suggests gender discrimination plagues the industry. Not that women are necessarily devalued he said  men could simply inspire softer feelings in their bosses.It might be that they dont even notice theyre discriminating Matvos said. They might think But Harrys a good guy I know Harry well. Maybe Ill be lenient with Harry. Maybe you dont realize you dont apply the same leniency to women.Previous research indicates men in power tend to prefer others who look like them. Hannah Riley Bowles a public policy professor at Harvard University has argued that bias can reign until bosses work to open their minds. Theres an economic case for that. Emotionally prizing male workers over female workers  or white employees over black employees for that matter  heightens the risk of losing talent or holding onto subpar folks.Gender aside financial advisers who misguide you will probably reoffend the researchers pointed out. Male financial advisers who broke the rules are five times as likely as someone with a perfect record to do it again. Female financial advisers are four times as likely.Glossing over those troubles can be costly. The median settlement after misconduct is  for male advisers the authors acknowledge and  for female advisers.Men though have a better shot at professional recovery.According to Matvoss numbers nearly half  percent of male financial advisers who lost their job after misconduct found new employment in the industry within a year. A third of female advisers enjoyed the same fate.The financial advisory industry is willing to give male advisers a second chance the authors conclude while female advisers are likely to be cast from the industry.,GamerGhazi,df55e2h,1,t5_33oia

11319660,0,t3_61h58w,I made a post a few years ago on an SRS sub regarding an article on The Onion which used ironic antiSemitism to criticize the Jewish owner of the Washington Redskins. My comment operated under the assumption that the humor worked because antiSemitism was no longer a significant factor in American life and a lot of people agreed with it though I backtracked quite a bit when people rightly called me out on my shitty assumptions.Since then Ive learned that I had some pretty heavy blinders. People who dont face antiSemitic bigotry just assume that antiSemitism is mostly gone because we primarily associate it with cranks and conspiracy theorists or because we dont see Jewish status as immediately visible in the way some minority statuses are and thus assume it isnt a factor or because we just arent paying attention to stories and statistics which indicate that antiSemitism is alive and well.Its kind of absurd for that privilege calculator to assign privilege points for being Jewish. The range of scenarios in which Jewish identity might be lived or interpreted varies way too much to make it a monolithic group and frankly doing so smacks of a little bigotry in itself.,GamerGhazi,dff2bzo,16,t5_33oia

11645366,0,t1_dgfkbwz,It is not that their identity is tied to gaming that is the issue. It is that within their class they are oppressed it is not the high tier or mid tier of people within their white male class that become these people. It is the lower tier. Your identity is built on anything that interests you be it gender or your hobby or in my case food. This is true for everyone. However their feelings of oppression will find a way to manifest itself. This were the TrumpSandersCommunismCapitalism thing comes out in this case. It creates an outlet for your oppression as a cope mechanism. Your cope mechanism is now tied into your belief and identity. This lead to in turn that your identity is not rationally created and you become vulnerable to double think to deal with it which then leads to a very unhealthy state of mind.  ,GamerGhazi,dgg0l5l,4,t5_33oia

11661372,0,t1_dghsgyj,I hesitate to generalize from personal experience but Im under the impression that autistic girls tend to act out less and theyre regarded as less of a violent threat when they do so they dont get hammered down as often.On the other hand if a girl is quiet and compliant theres the temptation to just keep passing her along whether shes actually learning anything or not. You can save a lot of money on accommodations too if you keep claiming that the kid doesnt really need them.,GamerGhazi,dghtxt5,2,t5_33oia
11662063,0,t1_dghov6l,Actually he assaulted his aide because they touched him and that was the first incident. The second incident involved him punching other students in class as well as throwing paper. The teacher told him he needed to go to time out and he refused continuing to hit people. So the teacher tried to physically get him away from people and into time out only to be punched and kicked.Imo when it comes to students staff have a duty of care so it would be reasonable to physically restrain a student if theyre assaulting another and wont stop when told.,GamerGhazi,dghwrez,21,t5_33oia

11691169,0,t1_dgl5ixs,gtThats when Ilyse Hogue the president of abortion rights advocate NARAL ProChoice America issued a statement blasting Sanders and Perez for spending time and resources campaigning alongside a Democrat who opposes abortion rights.gtThe actions today by the DNC to embrace and support a candidate for office who will strip women  one of the most critical constituencies for the party  of our basic rights and freedom is not only disappointing it is politically stupid Hogue said. Todays action makes this socalled fight back tour look more like a throwback tour for women and our rights.Why look! That appears to be someone criticizing someone other than Bernie Sanders!Edit to add But yes actually I do tend to hold Sanders to a higher standard than DNC hacks  because he claims to be more progressive than they are. ,GamerGhazi,dgl7n8v,19,t5_33oia
