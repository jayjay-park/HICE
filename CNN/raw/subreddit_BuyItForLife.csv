A good pillow is expensive so its a big investment to screw up if you choose the wrong one.Quick procon listDown pros Classic soft light readily available.Down cons Flatten out with time and lose the neck support.Memory foam pros Varying levels of firmness available molds to headMemory foam cons Can get hot can be heavy effing expensive if you get the wrong one.Buckwheat hull pros Firm hard almost serious neck supportBuckwheat hull cons Smells like dog food sounds like grape nuts and the average pillow weighs roughly a ton.Personally I like buckwheat hull but totally understand the cons being a big turn off for most people.,BuyItForLife,cehvdyv,3,t5_2ss1q

I could make the belt myself for much less but thats because I already have the strap cutter strap end cutter hole punches buckles keepers diamond chisel overstitch wheel awl skivers bevelers burnisher dyes and finishes.  Look at it this way you saved yourself the cost of all of those items as well as the time it would take you to learn how to use them effectively.  The value to you may be higher to purchase a long lasting belt than to pickup a difficult to master hobby.  That all said any belt sold should have the edges burnished.  This is to reduce the wear on the belt loops on your pants.  I dont know what the makers business model is or whether the high price is intended to lower demand to a point where they dont get backlogged but adding another  minutes of time per belt to chuck up a burnisher in a drill press and run the belt along it to produce a better product doesnt seem like a bad tradeoff.,BuyItForLife,cf41qft,3,t5_2ss1q

I bought a Steelseries Ikari Laser mouse three years ago and after countless hours of daily use it still works and looks exactly the way it did when it came out of the box. Steelseries has actually retired the Ikari but you can still find them on thirdparty sites Amazon.The black one has a textured top button area but I went with the white edition which apparently is easier to find nowadays which has a hard plastic glossy top. I like the feel better and I find that a lot of textured plastic eventually wears smooth though I am not sure if the Ikari would suffer from this. It is lightweight but feels pretty solidly built and has nice big friction pads the bottom that should last quite a long time mine barely show any wear at all. Cable is thick securely fastened to the mouse and really long. It has a handful of fancy gaming type features but you dont need to use them if you dont want. A year ago I wanted a mouse I could travel with and got the Logitech G wireless mouse after hearing of their quality and design. I dont have any complaints about it but I really only use it when I travel or visit family. Logitech is a good company in my experience but I cannot reccommend the Steelseries Ikari enough. ,BuyItForLife,cf6nxwq,1,t5_2ss1q

In fact my back and shoulders ached nearly constantly when sitting in that chair.  No amount of adjusting helped and so it finally had to be returned.I got a Leap in exchange and its been nothing short of perfect.  The Leap is even more customizable than the Aeron and is allday comfortable.  I have no complaints at all.I will say that Im mystified that the Aeron was so terrible for me since all signs point to it being a great chair.  The Mirras at work are notable both for their allday comfort and for the fact that they break so often.  Definitely not something Id spend my money on.

The trick is to get a seat with high heightweight limits and low first harness heights and tall top harness heights.

884758,0,t1_ch4tnz5,From what youre describing youre looking more for a light hiking boot more than anything. That particular niche isnt BIFL however on average youll get around  years or heavy seasons before youll need to be in the market for a new pair. If you go this route stay away from anything that has an EVA midsole those danners youre looking at included it wears down overtime. Look instead for PU Polyurethane midsoles as theyre more durable but they sacrafice in the comfort department a bit. For lighter loads like youre carrying you can get away with a nylon shank but be sure it at least has a nylon shank. As for linings I was never really fond of GoreTex its always made for a hot boot try instead for cambrelle or leather lining if you can find them though theyre not as waterproof as the GoreTex and theyre a bit harder to find.As far as what fits youre description that I know of...Lowa Renegade LL is what comes to mind. Id also look at the Keen Ketchum or the Lowa Ronan if you want more stiffness. Those are all a little out of your price range though. The Renegade is a winner from what youre describint though it comes in a GTX version as well if you want the water protection... keep in mind the leather lining breathes better. ,BuyItForLife,ch4um80,4,t5_2ss1q

949729,0,t1_chc8amb,Goodyear welt construction depends highly on the quality on the insole for longevity recraftability. In the  mile line boots Wolverine uses a fiberboard wrapped with leather insole which suffers from long term durability issues compared to boots that manufactured using full grain leather insoles. For example all of Wolverines competitors in the domestic goodyear welt boot market Oak Street Bootmakers made by PW Minor Red Wing Allen Edmonds Alden use full grain leather insoles. In goodyear welt construction their is a canvas rib called the gemming that the goodyear welt stitch is stitched through. This unites the rib through the uppers and to the welt. The welt is then stitched to the insole. The point being that the insole is the key component in goodyear welt construction and in goodyear welt construction the method is only as strong as its weakest link.

You had to send your measurements and the would make a jacket custom fit. I dont believe they are taking anymore orders but if you look around you could maybe find out if they still are.You could find some luck with a local leather worker some people claim that they have gotten custom made jackets for under .

In Japan the futon was on top of tatami mats at my friends place the futon was on top of hardwood floor. The tatami mat was slightly more comfortable.The best way to approach what a futon might feel like is to put a thick comforter on the floor and sleep on that. Its not quite the same but youll get the general idea. I find it to be very comfortable but I sleep exclusively on my back or side and I do not move much. It also helps to have a very good pillow but thats true on a bed too. I dont know if this will help your boyfriend or not but it shouldnt hurt to try.My friend bought his futon at a Japanese supermarketgeneral store called Mitsuwa.

1774095,0,t1_ck2s2av,ampampamp Mound system sfw gtgtA mound system is an alternative to the traditional rural septic system drain field The mound system is an engineered drain field used in areas where septic systems are more prone to failure due to having extremely permeable or impermeable soils soil with shallow cover over porous bedrock and soils that have a high seasonal water table gtThe primary waste liquids cleaning and purification action in a drain field is performed by a biofilm in the loose fill surrounding the perforated drain tile. If the soil permeability is too low liquid is not absorbed fast enough resulting in surface ponding of unsanitary liquids. If the soil permeability is too high or is exposed to fractured bedrock the wastewater quickly penetrates down to the water table before the biofilm has time to purify the water leading to contamination of the aquifer In either situation the mound system provides an ideal habitat for the biofilm and has the correct balance of permeability to assure slow absorption of effluent into the mound before exiting as purified water into the surrounding environment.gtgtImage iInteresting Septic tank | LSU Campus Mounds | Hopewell Culture National Historical Park | Flower Mound Texas Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcksr oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecksr.

When I was up there we all used leather and synthetic products and it was generally understood that the synthetic products generally have a short lifespan  years or less.To answer your question Id go with synthetic simply because its the better product for a cold environment and leather isnt. What youre doing is silly though its akin to saying planes are constructed out aluminum not leather therefore aluminum is better than leather. However when you make a reasonable comparison between a leather product and a synthetic product meant for the same purpose youll see that leather excels in terms of quality.As for your last little comment Ill give you this. Ive lived in arctic Canada for the vast majority of my lifetime I hunt I fish I camp so dont embarrass yourself and try to tell me I dont know anything about being outdoors.

Life time warantee for the original owners but they still gave me a discount of replacement parts either way I would have had to pay for shipping I think.  years in and I have had to replace both. If I called in a plumber it would have cost money as it is I needed some basic tools spent time on the phone with the company looked up the manual fixed the thing only to have another failure. After three failures on  sinks  I have finally swapped both out. Cookware wouldnt be that much of a hassle But still something to remember.Replacement is not the only cost for some things and for other things like tools you can damage an expensive part or get injured with a bad tool so the free replacement could cost you a lot more than the value of the tool.

Theres selection bias at work  just because your familys ltinsert object heregt is still in good condition doesnt necessarily mean it was BIFL it might mean that particular one got less use or was maintained better or just happened to have no minor defects in manufacture that eventually got the others.Dont get me wrong  some persons greatgrandparents iron pan that has seen daily use for decades is probably still really solid and probably was BIFL when they got it and remains so today i.e. if you happen to find one from that era being sold somewhere it would last through your life as well. However Ive had backpacks last well over a decade that had no business doing so particularly under the significant strain I put them through.

He had a friend with him and I did too but neither of them got involved with the actual fight. Im a solid  in these steeltoed boots lbs of fat and muscle and he was at least a foot shorter and lbs lighter. He was scrawny as fuck too. It wasnt a fair fight by any means but he threw the first punch knocking my glasses off my face. The adrenaline consumed me. I got a few punches in realized I was wearing my boots and kicked him twice in the left side. He tackles me to the ground and I bear hug him while hes on top of me pinning his arms to his sides while applying pressure to he spot I just kicked. He starts hacking up blood on my face as I continue to squeeze. His friend managed to pry him away from me but I dont think he could stand on his own since his friend was having to drag his fairly limp body down the road. My friend gives me my glasses and we get the fuck out of there. My friend was freaking out because I was covered in blood and he was trying to figure out the extent of my injuries. None of it was mine. I felt better than I ever had until the adrenaline wore off. I ended up with a fucked up shoulder for a few months a sore as hell body for a few weeks and some scuffed up boots.

For a fair comparison the author should have compared against a  modern day sharpener which at that price point Id expect to wipe my ass for me probably.So the survivorship bias is only saying that there were well constructed mechanical pencil sharpener being produced in the s like the Panasonic but also shitty sharpener being produced just like the same is true today.

And be sure you are talking with at least a store manager when you do this. I get instant results when I put a serious threat in front of them that could seriously effect sales.Also stick to your word and NEVER shop there again its definitely not worth it.,BuyItForLife,csyl3ef,2,t5_2ss1q

4673219,0,t3_3exzpi,Many modern cars will last.  The only thing that ruins a car these days is the manufacturers purposely cheaping out.  However materials and manufacturing is so good now that things dont really wear out or fail like they used to.  Rusting is significantly reduced.  Electronics and switch gear dont randomly fail anymore.  There isnt any dash cracking like the old days.  Seat materials are better and dont really weartear.  Engine build tolerances and materials are extremely good so good that we have to use a new weight and research has started on super thin viscosities.Today you end up with decade old cars with  miles that look and drive virtually new.You almost cant go wrong in the modern age of the automobile.Part of this also has to do with how massively competitive the modern car is for companies.  Consumers have gotten so picky and alternative options so plentiful that auto makers are forced to create something minimally outstanding.  There is little room for error anymore not if you actually want to sell your car.,BuyItForLife,ctjlz7w,18,t5_2ss1q

In that I had to click the button  times to get it to turn on. I think the spring lost tension.  Then after about a year of heavy use was impossible to use. Because the aluminum threading failed so the light wouldnt stay together.  The battery wont last for much more than  hours of on time so if you use it for your job do not expect it to last much longer than a year. If you are just going to use it around the house for this or that it may last you longer.

Its a little more expensive than it used to be and ought to be if you ask me but its very hard to beat. Very light for the amount of blade you get strong tip great lock and absolutely dissapears when clipped to your pocket hard for you to tell its even there.Steel is SV which benchmade has improved their heat treat on over time to the point where its great now.  There are also some limitedspecial editions available in other steels and special finishes for more money if youre so inclined.If you want a purely gentlemans knife both Lionsteel and MCusta have some great offerings in various styles.If you dont want to spend more than  bucks the best low cost all arounders are the Ontario Rat  and  and the buck vantage sv.   The buck is an unexpectedly low priced sv knife with bucks great heat treat.  I dont think it gets nearly as much love as it should.If you want to spend more than  bucks...sky is the limit and theres a lot more reccomendations I could give you but you get very very quickly diminishing returns after about  bucks in my opinion.,BuyItForLife,cxl94ct,2,t5_2ss1q

6441741,0,t1_czl2mto,There seem to be a lot of people who attempt this moving somewhere off in the wilderness and trying to live off the land and then a month later theres a Youtube video of them saying wow this is really hard! Did they not see that coming?Theres also the unfortunate fact that if youre making everything yourself including growing your own food youre probably not doing much else with your time. Theres a reason arts music literature and other noncritical pursuits have exploded in the last century or two and its because people arent spending all their time farming. Even the monuments from ancient times were possible only because there was more than enough food to go around to feed everyone more than enough so you could bring a few people over to build a Pyramid or whatever. Going back to the land sounds interesting and all but it also means youre just surviving and little else. Which isnt necessarily so bad since thats what most people do anyway...but I dont see any reason to romanticize it.I think theres a cyclical nature to capitalism where theres a boom in production once people get wealthy enough to buy a lot of consumer products so quality drops since production goes up a lot to meet demand. Then people get tired of buying garbage and start looking for better things or fewer things. I think this is one of the reasons were hearing a lot about China and India growing in consumption because in some ways its aspirational for a lot of people its the first time theyve owned a car or something like that which is not just practical but part of the good life or whatever you want to call it whereas in the United States there are plenty of communities of people living with less because theyve already lived for a while with the excess and have realized it doesnt do much for you.

Imagine if you will a hearty leather pea coat and that gives an idea. Assuming you love somewhere with a proper winter youll be glad you have it when you need it... and will look stylin when you wear it casually.For fishing I would look and check the main magazines and see if they have an option to purchase the entire library of back issues. I did that once with the Journal of Light Construction and boy they had some great old articles with excellent tips written by true experts.For weightlifting I would consider buying either a prepaid year of Planet Fitness membership using half the money or buy the  ebook set from baye.com a trainer and exercise researcher who has a lot of great information. Im not associated except as a reader.If I liked outdoors activities like fly fishing I might invest in some Smartwool or Icebreaker or other quality brands of merino wool base layer socks shorts etc. They can go a long way to making you comfortable in wetcold conditions.,BuyItForLife,d20tebr,1,t5_2ss1q

7262639,0,t3_4eshxb,Oh man so much well meaning but poor advice. I a used to be a canoe guide and b spend every weekend and vacation day in the mountains. Im literally leaving Saturday to do the BugsRogers Traverse which is two weeks of full on ski mountaineering. So heres what I suggest  for sleeping pads get one of the nonself inflating but super thick ones. Spend most of your budget here. I like the Thermarest NeoAir series and have one for summer and one for winter. Foamies and old school thin Thermarests are brutal to sleep on night after night  your hips and back will kill you. Bring a patch kit but in several hundred nights on mine Ive only gotten one pinhole. Other options are the Exped Downmat girlfriend who has a bad neck loves her UL or Sea to Summit has some really compelling looking ones. Spend whatever budget you have left on a sleeping bag. Get a mummy bag. Down lasts longer with care and packs smaller but synthetics handle moisture better. Given youre in a canoe Id get a synthetic bag you can abuse. MEC in Canada has great options but Marmot Northface Mountain Hardwear all have solid options. The more you spend the lighter and more compressible the bag  decide what is worth it to you. Seriously though I cannot overstate the difference a modern thick sleeping pad makes. They pack down smaller than the old style pads are lighter and just infinitely more comfortable which matters when you sleep on them night after night. ,BuyItForLife,d23plum,3,t5_2ss1q

I envy you being able to travel Europe. I have been to Oregon Cali and Alaska and my leathermans have all served me well. From the tiny keychain Lifestyle CS and Micra all the way up to my Super  and Charge. I bring them all with me lol because once you feel that feeling of wishing you had a certain tool on you and you left it at home when it should be getting pocket time is a bad one to have so far away from home. Maybe you will get bit with the bug and start collecting them too like some of us. For example I bought the Charge TTi solely because of the SV blade that they included. Naturally as a Spyderco and folding pocket knife collector also this sucked me in. BTW SV is a GREAT blade material as it holds its edge pretty good even through the hard usage. But then I branched out and after buying all the Leathermans I purchased a SOG Power Plier the black military issue one and it just spiraled out of control from there.

7577544,0,t3_4j2enb,Okay so Im actually heavily involved in the knife world and am going to give uBerzelus some information on his knife and fulfill your request for information on Spydercos and quality knives in general in the same post. Hope you dont mind!uBerzelus it sounds like you have a Spyderco Dragonfly  with ZDP steel which is absolutely part of their main line! ZDP is considered a super steel and has phenomenal edge retention but is an absolute bitch to sharpen and is prone to chipping because of its high hardness. The . blade is a nice size to be an unassumingnonintimidating office EDC.Spyderco is generally regarded as having okay to poor customer service. They dont offer blade replacements or much at all in the way of parts and are more than likely just going to tell you to buy a new knife. That being said they do make a quality knife. The Paramilitary  Manix Delica and Sage are all considered great knife lines. The PM is especially fun and addicting to Spydieflick open. Also anything made in their Taichung plant is pretty much considered legendary. Any Spyderco that comes out of their Taichung plant will be just about  perfect in every possible aspect. These are absolutely great knives that Id put onabove the level of some midhigh level Benchmades and midlevel ZTs. Anything that comes out of their Golden CO plant is also pretty nice.If youre looking for something truly BIFL and made in the US to boot! get a Benchmade a Zero Tolerance or a Kershaw if you cant spend that much. BMs and ZTs cost a bit more but their customer service is insane. Both are widely regarded as the premier knife companies in regards to customer service and their products all have exceptional quality. BM has had some issues with blade centering in the past but theyve gotten better about it recently. Some of my favorites include the BM Griptilian the BM  MiniRukus the BM Adamas the ZT the ZT and the ZT. Im definitely more fond of larger knives though. The blade steels used by ZT are typically more on the super steel side they tend to specialize in Elmax but also use M and SV whereas BM typically uses CPM D SV and occasionally M. BMs steels specifically CPM and D still have very good performance but wont have as much edge retention compared to something like M SV or Elmax. Theyre easier to sharpen for sure though.Anyway Ill stop rambling now. If you have any more questions feel free to PM me!

Even if they did have a shadowy conspiracy to make inferior products to increase profits thats not a stable equilibrium Theres an overwhelming incentive for one manufacturer to defect from that agreement make a better product capture a bigger market share and make more money than they used to.I think the simper explanation is that probably based on a lot of focus groups and market research and testing and so on they genuinely believe that consumers prefer a slightly smaller cheaper printer to one that will be easier to maintain in a couple of years time.And when youre comparing immediate features you can see on the shelf in front of you versus a claimed benefit thats hard for the buyer to evaluate the truth of and is uncertain and distant I think theyre probably right.,BuyItForLife,d3xsfm4,4,t5_2ss1q

8043461,0,t3_4pcswd,I got LASIK.  One of the best decisions of my life.Ill be honest though  the surgery itself was very unpleasant.  The device they use to cut the flap was very uncomfortable and when they used the laser to ablate my cornea i could smell it.  Pretty unnerving!  It only hasted about  minutes though and after a day I was pretty much back to .  You have to be very careful for a few months to avoid damaging the flap but for a sedentary guy like me that wasnt a problem.  I did get some halos but I already had some before the procedure so it didnt have a large impact on my daytoday life.I got it about  years ago and things are pretty ok!  My ability to focus on small text at a distance has diminished in that time but Im  sure thats just my lenses hardening naturally.This probably sounds pretty negative but its hard to put into words why its so good.  The best I can do is that it eliminated a large source of complexity in my life  glasses.  I never have to worry about losing or breaking them and I can do things I couldnt before seeing underwater wearing some head gear Any sunglasses I want etc.  I strongly recommend it but definitely do your research and dont cheap out.  Also make sure youre extra clear on any aftercare service.  I was surprised recently to find out that what I thought was free eye exams for life was actually only free for the first year.  Its not a huge deal but Ive essentially gotten locked into having a  eye exam every year because its a condition of the lifetime free adjustmentsupdates plan I got.  Fortunately my insurance coveres most of that and its a good idea to get them checked every year anyways.  If I didnt have insurance or could not easily afford that itd be a much bigger deal though.As opposed to PRK the optometrist I consulted with put it to me this way  PRK is only worth the extra recovery awfulness if youre likely to get hit in the face a lot.  For the average person its just not worth it.  I have been hit directly in the eye a few times since and my flap hasnt been dislodged so between what he said and my experience I suspect the risk is more from repeat trauma than a single event.

Remember though You cant trust any warranty unless it is in writing and the text covers everything you think it should cover.

I may try a few things they suggested. But they are an awesome company. They refunded my money and didnt ask me to ship the deo back. They even offered a few tips on how to prevent the redness and asked if I wanted to try out their sensitive skin version when its available for testing.

I like it enough to use as my sole OS at this point but there is no denying it is harder to use than more traditional OSes.  I have always been pretty careful with my computernetwork use so I dont know that Qubes makes me significantly more secure on that front.  But what it does provide is more granular control over networking as well as the option for a password store that is completely segregated from the network.  I particularly like being able to easily assign VMs to VPN services or a separate local network and know that all of that is working seamlessly behind the scenes.  I also like being able to quickly open a nonVPNed disposable browser for those occasional times when a Youtube video or shopping website is regionblocked for example.

9526291,0,t3_5batyj,I tend to avoid buying things from REI as much as possible now.  I loved their old no time limit return policy.  Not to abuse it of course but it was nice to know if I sprang for a  jacket that I would either love it and enjoy it or be able to take it back.  Or if it happens to fail  again within reason that I could do a no hassle swap at a local shop.  Now that their warrant is  year and they are still difficult with me on that from time to time I see no reason to shop at REI.  Their prices are often more than any other retailer on the items i like and I no longer see the point in paying a premium to get it at REI when there is no added value.  For better or worse nearly every brand I enjoy has atleast a  year warranty or a lifetime defects warranty anyway.  At my local REI the staff doesnt know enough to be of value and cant hold a candle to reading a few reputable reviews online.  I buy through amazon when I can or better yet a local small business specialist for running or climbing and the like. ,BuyItForLife,d9nbewi,24,t5_2ss1q

The Wyatts are made of USmade Cone Mills Denim with  Dyneema stronger than Kevlar. If you have a Chrome Hub store near where you live you can go try them on.Manufacturers claims about  Dyneema in denimgtDyneema increases the abrasion resistance of  denim by  tear resistance by  and tensile strength by .Ive worn one pair for two weeks straight and they really do seem bombproof so far while still feeling like nice comfortable denim. No changes whatsoever to the fabric aside from slight stretching overall as is the case with all new jeans. Chrome apparel also has a year warranty. They also offer free hemming but the seamstress at the Hub I went to advised me to wear them for a month before hemming to ensure they end up at the right length due to breakin stretching.Not a Chrome shill just went looking for some BIFL jeans recently myself.

The part number has even remained the same all these years.  Its a sacrificial part designed to break instead of burning out the much more expensive motor.  It can be purchased and replaced relatively easily.If you want to knead large batches of bread dough then the home models are not the ones you want and this is true for virtually any brand.  Get the higher end models which have always been and continue to be ultradurable workhorses but be prepared to pay for that KitchenAid or not.  Reliable kneading bread dough is asking a lot of virtually any home mixer at a reasonable price and the KitchenAid Artisan mixers are no exception.  That said they do seem to be able to tolerate the occasional singleloaf batch somewhat reliably.  If they do break they are much more repairable than most countertop appliances.For nearly any other regular kitchen mixing task the standard home models are likely to last a lifetime.,BuyItForLife,d9sx8f7,16,t5_2ss1q

9654368,0,t3_5d7hu7,Id be interested to see actual statistics on this because all I have to offer is anecdotal. Back in the day Moores Law was a real factor in tech upgrades. Every two of three years your stateoftheart PC or MAC would be functionally obsolete as the new machines were twice as fast and had twice as much storage. As a brokeass high schooler I upgraded my computer more than annually because castoff components and systems were always available for next to nothing from just a year or two ago. Also people often did singlecomponent upgrades like adding ram and larger hard drives as they got better and cheaper. People even frequently upgraded the motherboards on their PCs. Things like monitors didnt change as frequently though and were good for five years or more just like today. A lot more components were retained like cases and power supplies. Today we tend to more frequently just replace the entire system especially for things like laptops and handheld computers phones that dont have any replaceable components at all. I think stuff is changing more slowly these days and upgrades are driven by marketing and intentional withholding of new features to force users to upgrade. My iPhone  was the first phone I kept more than a year ever I only upgraded to a  because I ran out of storage capacity and the new one has enough to likely last me four or more years. Capacity doesnt change as quickly anymore  my Mac is three years old and the new ones have very similar specs and only slightly improved performance. Apple wants us to upgrade for new connection technology more than anything and I think more people will hold off on upgrading than ever before. PC manufacturers are struggling to stay relevant at all. I do believe we are moving toward less frequent upgrades than in the past and I think thats a good thing for the world even if its bad for business. ,BuyItForLife,da33o8c,1,t5_2ss1q

The result its to you it FEELS colder even though its the same temperature as the plastic one.

It also doesnt have an inside pocket so it cant really be folded into itself like the adult size can. The same is true for a rain shell I got.

The intent of lifetime warranties like this are generally a guarantee against failure due to manufacturing defects. Things like seems coming apart zippers no longer zipping buttons coming off etc. Some manufacturers are a bit more lenient with warranty claims. Accepting things that arent strictly a defect but still cause the product to fail think a rip in the fabric from being caught on something builds good will with customers and makes them more likely to suggest the brand to other people.

Thinking I should really start wiping them down regularly and maybe treat them a few times in their lifespan.  I work with clay which sucks the oil out of the leather and after time they start to fatigue where the foot bends and I think this is where water seeps in after a few months of use on mine.

Days of trying to sweep over poop and urine thanks pup! caused an excess ammonia buildup on its circuitry eventually resulting in a short.Circuits I understand.

As I said its a casual wear shoe for me that takes me half a mile from home to car and a few aisles at the supermarket. For what it is its fine.

Its an excellent lightweight option for rain in every season except Winter. It wicks away rain exceptionally well its comfortable and has pit zips for dealing with rain in warmer temps.I much prefer it to the older Columbia it replaced and if its anything like my older TNF items it was last a long time  I still have a Summit Series winter coat thats over  years old and going strong.
