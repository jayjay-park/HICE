4884432,0,t3_3hon9m,I have two theories. One is they could be amateurs who dont really know what to do and just planned out the attack part without realizing exactly what they were getting into. The other is they were simply acting out in ideology instead of a groups beliefs which could be anything from raising ethnic tension to attacking a tourist spot to try and stop foreigners from coming in along with western influence. That way the idea behind their attack has more power behind it since its not X group doing it that can get caught but just a way of thought that could come back up again.But thats just only two random theories off the top of my head. Just give it some time there will be more out there soon enough.,terrorism,cua7yvx,2,t5_2qnch

7964705,0,t3_4ob9u5,I do not believe this to be the case and to be honest although its good initiative and its creative and unique it is not a strong argument. In regards to Islam and Quranic and Hadithic injunctions against homosexuality you are correct in observing that it falls under Gods law that homosexuals be punished. The madhhabs which are Islamic schools of thought or jurisprudence legal authorities that house scholars and scholarly consensus for their populations of followers all classify homosexuality as an immorality. A sin. Punishable yes certainly. They differ on punishment.I mean I wrote a  page rage about the LGBT communities blindness to Islamic doctrine but did not post it. It detailed all of this. And then bam. This article comes out and Ayaan hit all the notes. Have a read.What you are correct on is that  We cannot ignore the connection to Islam however casual and homophobia.  The conflicting positions between that of a Muslim and that of a homosexual would be very challenging. Personally challenging.  There may be more to this but we may never know for now were guessing but it gives us a good opportunity to once again call for religious homophobia and injunctions to kill to be challenged.,terrorism,d4bb4kp,1,t5_2qnch
