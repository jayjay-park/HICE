2711513,0,t3_2r3aej,Have you explored PV at all? I few months ago I went to Nelsons at Terranea for the first time. The food is pricey but the drinks were reasonable given the location. What I liked was the the whole outdoor area is open. So you can get a couple cocktails from them bar and take a nice little stroll along the cliff. There are fire pits. Have you guys ever gone ice skating? You could go skating up at The PV mall  I think itss called Promenade now then go down hawthorne to pv drive south and take that to Terranae. Or if you wanna do fancy dinner Cafe Marmalade is upstairs at the pv mall. ,TheSouthBay,cncadt4,2,t5_35j17

3172307,0,t1_coqd3k8,Idea! That Los Angeles Robotics Club has been looking for a new place to hold workshops. They previously had an arrangement with the South Bay Entrepreneurial Center in Torrance but evidently that has ended. If youd be interested in hosting those events I can put you in touch with their organizer.,TheSouthBay,coqt3w7,2,t5_35j17
