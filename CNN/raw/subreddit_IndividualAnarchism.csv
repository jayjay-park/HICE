If they cant meet this burden then not believing in a God rather than just claiming you cant know of one exists or not makes sense. Its the same thing as saying theres a big purple elephant flying in the sky. If you cant prove this Im not going to say hmm maybe but we cant know for sure. Im going to say no there isnt. Im not going to believe thats the case until you prove it. Thats how logic works. ,IndividualAnarchism,czgi3f8,1,t5_3bmre
6395893,0,t1_czgmmtf,No I dont have any religious texts Id recommend because not one of them is founded in reality or has any shred of evidence backing them up from my perspective. If you think about life after death and you come to the conclusion that there is a God thats fine I respect that. What I have a problem with is when people blindly believe hat they are told without question like I suspect you do to be honest. How could you possibly think for yourself and come to the conclusion that Catholicism is correct?And please dont take anything I said personally. Im not sure how my tone is coming off but Im not intending to be mean or condescending in the least. ,IndividualAnarchism,czgnb89,2,t5_3bmre
