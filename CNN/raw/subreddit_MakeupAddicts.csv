10584,0,t3_1u8qhe,Fan brushes are great when you want a really subtle highlighter but if youre using a highlighter that already applies subtly you may want to use a tapered brush to get more of it to show up. Smashbox Tarte and Laura Mercier all have good options for fan brushes. For a crease brush I think it depends on how much lid space you have and how big your crease is. As a monolid the  only really works as a blending brush for me since my crease area is really smallshallow. I use a pencil brush to define the crease area. I like the Sigma E but its a dupe for the Mac . ,MakeupAddicts,cefn1k4,3,t5_2xwgx
13121,0,t1_cefrxn7,I understand that. But if OP is asking for contouring advice then am I wrong to assume she hasnt mastered contouring? When I first started contouring I made it too dramatic because I was following the guide. Everyone is at a different level.

23884,0,t1_cegzv19,Well first thing  you actually could create more space if you thinned your brows a little. I usually would never tell anyone to do that because I love thick brows but I feel like it would be easy for you to take off the more outlying hairs and still have essentially the same thicknessshape your brows are gorgeous btw.If you mean you want to create the illusion that the part of your eyelid below the fold is bigger I would apply a light nonmatte shade either of the two rightmost shades from your CdP quad or the top middle shade of Bios de Rose all over your lids until just above your natural crease. Then use your darker crease colors slightly above that fold.That being said you eye shape is totally gorgeous and the makeup youve done in the photo is perfect for it... if you want more critiques you could try submitting a try at something more dramatic. Darker colors are far less foolproof and it will be easier to see any problems you are having.,MakeupAddicts,ceh5hp0,1,t5_2xwgx

30233,0,t1_cehpe3g,Yeah sorry about the spacing. This was my first time ever posting something and when I had typed it in it wasnt a single paragraph so Im not really sure what happened. Did I need to double space? I only single spaced and maybe that was the problem.Im mostly focused on eyes and foundation I feel like those are the two first basics I should probably get down and then maybe move onto more in the makeup world like bronzer and things of that nature.The eye shadow I have is I think is Almay and the colors are like a pink brown and a light shimmery color. They dont even make the trio anymore thats how old it is.Im looking to start using makeup more often and start dressing up more this year as a new year resolution. So maybe a simple style of makeup for a simple everyday look and then a fancier version for date nights and going out with friends occasions.I think Ive seen the elf brand at Target but if I go to Ultawhich is the only big beauty store we have here in town will they have pretty much everything?,MakeupAddicts,cehvh7d,1,t5_2xwgx

To answer your question the contour should cup the highlighter earlier and curve in at the outer corners of your temples in a rough C shape.

The pencil itself is double ended with a glittery highlight on one end meh and is made of wood not plastic so does need sharpening. Its a creamy moisturising formula but not too slick or shiny and lasts pretty nicely. It does have quite a strong and odd scent to it theres definitely cocoa in there in combo with the moisturising butters I guess?

616917,0,t3_217k2x,Im so sorry you had an experience like that. I work at a cosmetics counter myself so I can give you a little bit of insight as to why they may have acted like that. And please dont think that Im accusing you of any of this. This is purely from a retail point of view. If a customer comes in with an unreceipted return of more than five unboxed used items we are automatically cautious. Its because at one point in all of our careers weve taken in a bad return and have gotten in trouble with managers because of that. Im in no way implying that your return was one of those just that thats an automatic red flag to any retail associate. Im all for returning products that dont work out because we all know how hard it is to find that perfect mascara or that perfect foundation.  The reason the cashier may have been so talkative was because she may have thought the transaction was sketchy. There have been times when Ive had a known ticketswitcher trying to do a return at my counter and Ive had to keep up awkward small talk with them while waiting for the manager to show up. The cashier you had may have just been super awkward and skittish. They were completely wrong to say any of that stuff to you though. You never ever want to imply that the customer is doing something wrong. Because they could be completely harmless and honest customer like you were.  They took your ID as a standard procedure for unreceipted returns. At our store we enter it into the computer and give store credit. It basically keeps track of how often you return items without proof of purchase. If you do it too much it limits the way you can get refunds.  What the manager said could have had a couple different meanings behind it. She could have meant it as a passive aggressive comment about returning multiple items. Stores are held accountable for returns taken even if they werent originally purchased at the store. Im not sure how Sephora BAs work but if its off of commision then that can suck but of course its just one of the crappy things you have to accept when working commision. Otherwise she probably was just trying to bring you back into the store. Lately all the cosmetics stores and counters have been really into clienteleing. You want those repeat customers who trust you and want to come back to you.Again Im not in any way implying you had any malintent or a bad return. I was just trying to give you the perspective of a BA. There is no reason for any BA to ever treat you badly or judge you. If you left feeling belittled and judged then there was a problem. Even if they were following their standard LP procedures they failed at their main job if you left feeling like shit. Definitely contact corporate or an executive office because thats an issue that needs to be fixed. ,MakeupAddicts,cgae7sk,5,t5_2xwgx

Starbucks sweet treats that looked good I refrained brand reps from bumble and bumble LM Givenchy Kate Somerville I got the oxygen facial treatment thing done it was amazing! and a slew more.This was not my first Rouge event and I had a MUCH better experience at this one than the last one.  I didnt feel crowded or hurried there was tons of sales staff no pressure to buy they were wonderful.I love my location so I got hugs from all of the girls they were SUPER nice to my guest....which may be an issue.  I brought my Mom she always uses my account when shopping there and she used my card to get the discount which saved her a pretty penny. We ran it  transactions however because I had a ginormous gc from the partners at my company and a store credit to blow through while she charged it on her card.  I am hoping this doesnt violate the terms of service.  If it didnt I got bounced into Rouge again today.

746553,0,t1_cgp0oj2,Depends on what your skin tone is and what you need. I am very fair but I have them all. Radiant is too dark so I use it as a contour  it would be much better on darker skin tones  maybe NC on up.Mood light is nice I use it a bit over blush or alone for a very subtle pop of color. Again on darker skin tones it might not work the same way or be a good idea.Diffused and Dim are good for adding a bit of...mmm like undertone correction in a finishing powder? Dim is beige and Diffused is more yellow I think  might have mixed them up. I used diffused ALL OVER my face and it doesnt affect my color at all so it should be fine on darker skin tones asj ust a simple finishing powder.Ethereal and Luminous are highlighters really. I use ethereal all over switch between that and diffused but I can get away with it since Im a ghost IRL.I really really like the products as finishing powders and I notice the difference when I dont at least have diffused on.I would definitely test them out of course but I loved them a lot XD,MakeupAddicts,cgp517z,2,t5_2xwgx

1312393,0,t3_29402t,I would suggest going with him somewhere with testers and trying some out. Since he would only be wearing concealer it needs to be a reeeeally good match. I would suggest a creamy concealer in a tube with a doefoot applicator like Nars radiant creamy concealer or a similar product because the creamy texture will blend easily and will look more natural but can provide good coverage. Places like CVS and Sephora do accept returns even on used products but it may take a few tries to find a good color match and that would be a shame to waste multiple products so I think trying in store would be best.     And on a related note Birchbox man had this article on BB cream for men.

1435323,0,t3_2ajerx,Hi there! My husband has celiac disease. Its nothing to fuck with. I keep my makeup gluten free as well. The most important thing for her is going to be powders and lipsticks lipstick for obvious reason powder because it gets airborne and can be ingested in small amounts that way but any makeup has the possibility of being accidentally ingested so shes wise to look for gluten free products. Heres a list of things that are safe just off the top of my head BareMinerals  Natures Source Minerals my favorite indie mineral makeup Red Apple Lipstick is an indie dedicated gluten free makeup brand. NARS Stila  Most Neutrogena check packaging Tarte NYC lipsticks Wet N Wild except Natural Blend Pressed Powder Natural Blend Mineral Foundation and Mineral Veil MegaProtein Mascara Too Faced EXCEPT Borderline Lip Pencil Revlon Matte Lip Balms Shiro CosmeticsAnother thing for your friend to bear in mind is the possibility of crosscontamination. The seriousness of this concern for her will depend on her sensitivity. Just because a product has no glutencontaining ingredients doesnt mean that it doesnt contain trace amounts of gluten. Gluten can contaminate products if the products are manufactured on shared equipment with glutencontaining ingredients or if any of the ingredients of a product have come into contact with gluten at any time this is usually outside of a companys control which is why companies will rarely guarantee their products to be gluten free but only say the products have no glutencontaining ingredients. Always Google first especially since information online goes out of date quickly. If your friend needs or wants her cosmetics to be absolutely guaranteed  gluten free she should check out the Gluten Free Makeup Gal. Afton the woman who runs it has very strict standards for gluten free and so there are no large recognizable brands on her listit is limited to indies. Keep in mind that this doesnt mean your friend has to sacrifice quality or variety. Indie cosmetics are often very high quality and have excellent customer service I know Shiro cosmetics is all the rage on makeupaddiction right now and for good reason if the swatches and stories are to be believed. It does mean she will have to invest more money time and energy into identifying which products will work for her and some products like liquid or cream foundations may be difficult to find. Best of luck to your friend. Feel free to PM me if you or she has any more questions! ,MakeupAddicts,ciw70b1,19,t5_2xwgx

I got a call today from DHL asking me what kind of makeup is in the box as well as what the bag is made of lol!  Then the rep told me it should be here within  days.  Awesome shipping on Zoevas part despite customs.  Glad to see the shadows look nicely pigmented.  ,MakeupAddicts,cj5yaq8,2,t5_2xwgx

1551579,0,t1_cj9qf87,Not OP but I did stay to watch the process and will happily describe what we could see since I get excited about materials processing haha.     Their process was visible to us for the most part it was clear to see them select the pigments and wax from their display and put them in a little cup but then the cup went below the table at my location so we couldnt see what was happening next but essentially it was being melted and mixed and sometimes we could see the scents being added. Then we could very clearly see them pour the pigment into the lipstick mold and watch while it set. Once set we could see them scrape the excess open the mold and insert the lipstick bullet into its case. We were also able to see them clean the lipstick mold each time haha which I mention in case anyone was nervous about colour contamination!,MakeupAddicts,cjarihv,1,t5_2xwgx

1711380,0,t3_2e0ccz,Charlotte Tilbury Filmstars On The Go Look In A Palette  Breakfast At Tiffanys.  I bought this a couple of weeks ago after swatching all of them and its lovely.  The cream shadow has a lot of depth and can be dabbed on lightly for a soft shimmery bronze glow or built up for something deeper and more complex and Ive also had success with it as a liner.  The lasting power is surprisingly good too!  The cheeklip cream is a soft sheer peachy apricot that serves both purposes well and is blendable and buildable.  Like most dual creams it lasts longer on cheeks.  The eye and cheeklip products go well together and its a really lovely little palette thats great for a quick easy and cohesive look.Edited to add swatches.,MakeupAddicts,cjuvqr0,3,t5_2xwgx

2104168,0,t3_2j006y,avoiding peppermint in anything you put on your face is a good idea because its a major skin irritant.Clinique isnt really going to have anything dark enough for you but its in your price range and their lipsticks especially chubby sticks are really good. they just came out with a matte lipstick line with some really pretty shades. you should definitely try Black Honey at the very least it looks different on everybodysheer on most people but its a little dark on me NW so it may look dark on you. its definitely really comfortable to wear.just so you know lipsticks are generally either longlasting OR moisturizing. find a formula that meets in the middle and add a lipliner to make it last longer. youd probably find MACs liners too drying and Cliniques are all too nude or red plus theyre waxy so id check out Urban Decays. you might really like MAC Nightmoth though its a really deep burgundy color so it might be exactly what youre looking for.,MakeupAddicts,cl7aa4v,3,t5_2xwgx

And just before the sale I got Travelsize Hourglass Veil Primer for my trip Hourglass Opaque Rouge mini in Canvas The sample set that had the KVD Bachelorette lipstick Smashbox eye primer UD liner etc MUFE birthday giftI also forwarded some orders for other folks so Im now  away from being Rouge again next year lol. I guess Ill probably end up making it though I didnt intend to. As for empties I finished my Anastasia Brow Wiz this morning and I have maybe one or two uses left in my Chanel Perfection Lumiere Velvet. Im very tempted to repurchase but I still have a lot of YSL TTE left since I didnt wear it over the summer. ,MakeupAddicts,cm54rka,5,t5_2xwgx

2731665,0,t3_2rbtxj,The Zoeva  Brow Line is my absolute favorite thing for Dipbrow. Its super thin and the hairs are short and stiff which really help with blending out a smaller amount of product if youre going for a more natural look but never scratchy.

I dont use the corrector because this thing covers great on its own. The price is the only downside but you get a whole little tub for it! Another positive note the fact that its in a pot I take my finger and rub it in a circle to warm it up and apply it to my under eye area with said finger. It applies so well. It can feel thick and cakey for those not used to heavy concealers and does need to be set by powder but fuck this shit is gold. ,MakeupAddicts,cufznau,3,t5_2xwgx

Ive been VIB since it started and have been VIB Rouge for the last  years.  Its been fun and indulgent.  But I was able to justify it to myself because it was basically a hobby of mine to stay on top of beauty trends try new things etc.  Im starting to feel too old for a lot of beauty trends now as opposed to sticking with more classic looks and have a better idea of HG brands so I dont see myself spending enough to renew my Rouge status.And if the vast majority of products you buy are also sold at Ulta then its definitely a far better value to buy there and utilize their reward program.,MakeupAddicts,cvwu3in,8,t5_2xwgx

I highly recommend her AcneBlemish Covering Makeup video and her Natural Flawless Skin video  theyre the top two results if you search Lisa Eldridge acne on YouTube.As someone with acne scarring this technique has been my best defense.
