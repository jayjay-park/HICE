8093736,0,t3_4q32rx,Your option are Aeroplan with AC or United or Alaska miles with AA or Delta. Both cost k rt. AC is the only airline with direct flights  but that will add about  rt in fuel surcharges and maybe a little more in other taxes. Personally I would pay  rt extra for direct flights on AC. If AC isnt available Id just pick whoever has the best schedule. You can even use Aeroplan  one way and Alaska tell other way unless its on delta which doesnt allow booking one way flights.    As you may or may not know Aeroplan allows one stopover on domestic flights while Alaska does not. So if you want to visit another city for free you can fly aeroplan yulsfoxxxsfo for k points.,churningcanada,d4pt4k0,2,t5_30hws
