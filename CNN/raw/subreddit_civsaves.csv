672649,0,t3_21rh3b,Thanks for this! I normally play on Prince and really wanted to play this save with the difficulty lowered to Emperor but I couldnt for the life of me figure out how to do that.At least with this save I can still fulfill my lust for having stupidly good capitals and try my hand at Deity.,civsaves,cggqake,1,t5_2yate

1426488,0,t3_2abkih,This isnt the right save. This is a Persia start. Not a bad start in the desert with tons of copper around but still not the right save. Might wanna fix that OP.,civsaves,civ35xj,1,t5_2yate
1974671,0,t1_ckr550n,Yeah you can keep restarting. Not sure if youll get the exact spot that way but you can get close. Advantage of this method is it doesnt have any restrictions. Someone with vanilla civ can load the map someone can play it on Settler difficulty or you could play it with any other civ if you want.If youre going to post another file look in your saves folder if youre on windows itll be My DocumentsMy GamesSid Meiers Civilization Saves. There should be a folder named single and within that one named auto. If you havent started a new game since this one the file with autosaveinitial in its name is the file you want. That save is the very beginning of the game before you do anything on the first turn. I think it gets overwritten when you start a new game though. If it did youll have to pick a manual save or a different autosave.,civsaves,ckr5buz,2,t5_2yate

2032724,0,t3_2i0tdn,The point of this post is that there are wonders I never build. Its always the same  wonders that I try to build. Plus Ive been playing on Emperor for a while constantly worrying if I will finish that wonder or the other one.  Sometimes I dont and its pure disappointment. So I decided to build every wonder just to see how they affect the development of the city.  The whole game took me  and a half hours because load time between turns are super quick due to there being only  cvis,civsaves,cky7cmv,2,t5_2yate

4529432,0,t1_ct1kfew,Feel free to repost this in rciv  as there are people who really enjoy using IGE and generating mapsgames. Im sure that there are quite a few people who can help you get exactly what you want as I really only discovered the save map function a week ago after  hours. ,civsaves,ct1kjvk,2,t5_2yate
4560188,0,t3_3dii84,Here is the save my loves Also a spoilerThis is my empire at victory if you want to check out city placement. I chose mountains gt rivers as I was aiming to win as close as to turn  as possible. Seville was my guild city as I managed to build Hanging Gardens and Petra there. Though this is only possible by manipulating the AI into wars. Good luck on that deity win! I would love to hear about your progress  My advice is to settle mountains and either massively grow population and go for a science win or mass production and go for a culture victory.,civsaves,ct5fgja,2,t5_2yate
