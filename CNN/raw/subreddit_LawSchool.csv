147944,0,t1_cev8neu,I dont know how some of my classmates survive on the student loan budget living in Streeterville. I found the cheapest rent I could in Lincoln Park. It takes an extra  minutes to get tofrom campus compared to living in walking distance... But Im paying under  instead of  and Im surrounded by cheapish restaurants and bars. Worst case if I took a cab to school every day of the semester I would still save money compared to living in Streeterville. I made the mistake of focusing on the red line trains when looking for apartments. For many areas the bus is a lot more convenient. There are express buses that run down Lake Shore Drive which get you to Streeterville very fast. A lot of bus lines to the campus area also let you off closer than the State St. red line stop.  There seems to be some event with free food once or twice a week on average. Any free food that is open to anyone will attract massive lines and run out pretty quickly so I rarely bother. The little cafe in the law school building has decent sandwiches and there are more food options down the street at the hospital.,LawSchool,ceva5jg,3,t5_2rb9g

162593,0,t1_cewxy17,Thanks.  Cites should be fairly easy because I just need to insert the name of the correct reporter in.  My midterm memo had no issues with the cites just the final.As for errors I feel like the entire page document is an error in itself.  I had a lot of difficulty finding relevant law and something analogous to the matter I was drafting the memo on.  I also had difficulty forming strong arguments.  I feel like if I took the course with a different instructor I may have done better or I may just be a shitty legal writer.In point  I just had a lot of trouble being consistent and noncontradictory.  I realized this when writing but due to overall exhaustion and lack of enthusiasm for the course and wishful thinking that everyone else would do as poorly and the curve would save me kinda led me to gloss over this.  I absolutely hated drafting that final memo  reading through literally  cases on Westlaw and using only  because the rest were a waste of time and not helpful at all.  Though I understand this is law practice I hate wasting time with useless material and dread going through this again to fix my memo.As to grammar spelling etc...before I turned this memo in I took a magnifying glass and looked at every single word.  I had my girlfriend proofread it twice.  Somehow I still ended up with grammatical errors like having the word of instead of to or the the in there twice.  So pissed at myself...I mean hell even one of my textbooks has a blatant typo in it and I paid  for the thing.,LawSchool,cewya5n,1,t5_2rb9g

Schools already attempt to do that by giving blacks and hispanics a lower admissions curve and Asians a higher admissions curve.  One problem with this is that those on the easier admissions curve generally are weaker academically.One problem with the general diversity argument is that it gives bottomfeeding law schools a justification to why they should be allowed to receive millions upon millions in student loans which are not subject to any standards.Cooley already does this.I agree that the legal profession is not served by being  white but a more immediate issue is the high debt and poor job prospects.

In terms of practice areas contract law can entail both litigation and transactional work transactional is the actual writingstructuring of contracts whereas litigation is what you would consider the more stereotypical lawyering side of them. Many types of contract law involve both some also include the administrativeadvisory aspect of contracts.

The only program I can think of that does have some private LRAP coverage is Michigan and maybe Harvard? but you still would have to deal with the tax bomb at the end.To answer your question in kind of the cop out way as others have done it really depends on your risk tolerance.  At the upperend of the T you probably have an  chance of getting big law.  A lot of people talk about the  year flameout issue but Im a little more bullish than many may be on this sub in that lateral positions are still pretty good outcomes.You have to balance that with over k of debt and the risk of not getting big law or PI which should not be viewed as a fallback mind you.

539531,0,t3_20bes6,Two general thoughts to begin I dont know if that common wisdom is actually wise.  Each students goals are bound to be different so the decision to go for a paid versus unpaid internship will be determined by the individual students desires.  I worked unpaid both summers at PD offices because thats what I wanted to do and the reality is I wont get paid for doing it regardless. Internships are important because you can learn about an area of the law with no strings attached and because your employer will likely be one of your references down the line.  Enjoying the work and doing a good job are important for the latter reason.I did public defender stuff both summers federal and state and until a different job came up I planned on doing that after graduation.For your  choice the reality is a lot of public defenders like to see people who do both summers at PD offices.  And believe me in the past few years a ton of people have become interested in the field it is not the kind of position you leave as a back up at least in the big prestigious offices it is the kind of thing that you dedicate yourself to.  For job stuff I struck out at many offices despite spending both summers at PDs having excellent criminal procedure grades and substantial bench and mock trial experience.  For whatever reason it is a field a lot of people want to get into.That is not to say that if you do a good job in your L summer at a PD office they wont want to hire you or something  it is simply a reality check that PD positions are coveted in a lot of offices and they have their pick of candidates.  If you really think you might want to be a PD having that L summer experience will make it easier come next year when you are looking at offices.  It is an awful drive however and if your real endgoal is JAG I am not so sure doing a PD internship over the others will help your application though I didnt apply to JAG.As for  it sounds like you arent interested in it.  To me that is more important than any common wisdom or the like.  You want to have an internship where you will dive into the work and enjoy yourself at least a little.  It is  weeks of your life that you are dedicating to the office.  But it sounds like you will at least get good experience and have a chance to work on your LRwriting skills.  That is huge. if you arent doing writing or court stuff Im not sure what the internship entails there.  Is it just investigating issues?  The red flag for me there is this imagine if you apply to do a JAG internship next summer and they ask you what you did last summer.  Will you be able to tell them something that will impress them or at least show that you have the background skills necessary to do the job?  If the work you will be doing wont be transferable to a different area does it serve a real purpose for you?  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that it seems slightly disorganized.  It would be a real loss if you were not given enough substantive work and you ended up twiddling your thumbs for ten weeks even if you got a good reference.  I guess my main point is that these  weeks are going to give you experience.  The question is going into next years interview process which internship will give you the best fodder for why the firmPD officeJAG should hire you?  Moreover what internship will you enjoy enough to knock the internship out of the park and get a good recommendation?  Finally youve said you want to do JAG and if not that Public defense but if not that DHHS.  Do you really know what you want to do or are you just looking at different career options with a general idea about what might be cool?  If it is the latter consider thinking about which place will allow you to find out if you want to make that a career. If you know for a fact that you want to do JAG look up what kinds of experiences they like to see on a resume and do that.Good luck.,LawSchool,cg1lnsc,1,t5_2rb9g

623223,0,t1_cgazlnk,I just want you to know that doing that is very unfair to moot court competitors. There are lots of things to judge someone on time management knowledge of the law knowledge of the facts eloquence etc.  You can judge them on how they organize their argument putting strongest point first but penalizing them for using all of their time is unfair because they cant know that you will be judging that way and usually the rubric for grading includes all of the items Ive included above.Remember that this isnt a real argument this is a competition where the competitors have to try to impress you and show you a number of things and it is unfair to replace all of the traditional grading measures  with seeing if a competitor knows that you want to see them make one argument and sit down.Having them make one point takes away almost all of the criteria they should be judged on and can easily make the competition about whose argument is stronger which is also unfair because the competitors didnt pick which side they want to argue usually.,LawSchool,cgb406i,27,t5_2rb9g
630188,0,t1_cganuu2,gtI actually really enjoyed the very structured nature of warranty law. I like that there are clear statutory structures that govern goods by class and purpose and I think it is really interesting how businesses can work within that framework to meet the needs of consumers.Having interviewed people I think this is a good piece of advice with the bold being the most important.Ive interviewed people and Im relatively junior so my comments are more on fit as a junior rather than fit for the firm. That said I feel that a lot of partners expect far too much in terms of fate decision this early on. The right approach which CorpCounsel perhaps made without noting fully is to show that you docan have  a passion for a field of law but explain what it is about that field that you like. That way even if there isnt a position in a particular area for you the transferable enthusiasm  skills you express can let a hiring partner keep you in mind for other roles. I was lucky. The firm I was hired by expressly preferred generalists who just wanted to apply the law however. Most dont so my interview technique was usually to match the things I enjoyed about law academically and always to caveat that if I didnt have relevant experience in study I like xyz but I appreciate it could be different in practice however abc makes me think Id still enjoy this kind of work but then to lay out briefly the intellectual skills that the field required that drew me to it. Depending on the firms advertising if theyre open to generalism you could then state that youd be interested in trying similar fields that interest  engage the skills you have. ,LawSchool,cgbwirp,1,t5_2rb9g

The good jobs are at the feds. hrs a week k  pay retirement weeks vacation time flex schedule of  days a week. The feds is where it is at these days. oh and Lower taxes. I do think your expectations are way to high. It is good to have a goal dont get me wrong but I would not make a decision on where to go to school based on where I can become partner because so few people do make partner at the big firm. You go to law school to become a lawyer and get educated. If you are going to make money you are going for the wrong reason. Especially these days. Big law is shrinking not growing. You can take in all the advice you want. What makes you comfortable and financially comfortable is the most important thing.  Where in Florida are you from? What type of connections do you have to the state and where you live and what type of connections does you family have? If you think you can get a big law job in NYC from a top  school that means you should compete for a very high rank at UF. High rank at UF can land you a very nice job in Florida with k salary in a much cheaper place to live and for law a more enjoyable place to work. ,LawSchool,cgkum3z,2,t5_2rb9g

If you decide to use something actually designed for notes like OneNote my favorite or Evernote then set up their cloud syncing feature. I cannot tell you how many times I see hey guys my computer crashed and I lost all my notes... posts on my schools Facebook page.Second actually take intelligent notes. What do I mean by that? I do not mean  blinding writing down everything the professor says  blindly copying the professors slides into your notes or  retying everything they point out in the casebook into your notes. Write down things they say in class that are actually important and force yourself to distill down what they said before you write it. You can always study the casebookslideshows later or get an outline from some nerd who did write down everything the professor said.

I had a judge who was an alum of my law school but other than that... no one. I think working with green attorneys is more helpful than a law student working with green Ls but in the end... you want the advice from people who have been there. I was given a boatload of advice from multiple attorneys in my county bar association but I did the hard work by building relationships.

1677929,0,t3_2djh02,IP is split into two different practices from what I have researched.  Patent prosecution the transactional side requires patent bar eligibility but requires an advanced degree a desirable field BSEE CS or a strong ugGPA to be really considered.  Patent litigation does not require patent bar eligibility but will be far more reliant on strong law school grades and law school rank.  Prosecution tends to land inhouse jobs better but litigators seem to have a reasonably strong market for lateraling into other law firms.  .  I would think that you are more suited for litigation than prosecution if your GPA is weak.  The good news here is that you can get into some pretty good schools including some lower Ts despite your UGGPA as long as you do well on the LSAT.  The law school recruitment is weak right now because of the bad economy so a stellar performance on the LSAT will really do the trick for you.  I would advise looking at schools on Law School Numbers to see how you would fare.  This year it seems like quite a few extreme splitters were admitted to Northwestern with lt. GPAs on the merits of a  LSAT some including decent scholarship money.  UVA and even UPenn are known to occasionally pick up a splitter and WUSTL and Minnesota will accept virtually any candidate who scores higher than their LSAT median usually  with extremely generous scholarships regardless of GPA easily full rides if you negotiate.  You can crack the T or T as long as you put all your effort into taking the test..  The hard part shouldve been getting your STEM degree.  There are plenty of better options to make a good living than going into law school.  With good networking and interview skills which law students need anyways you should be able to land a job especially as the market is improving substantially..  If you are going into your undergraduate field of study EIT cant hurt.  It is not particularly useful for law school however.  A caveat however is that EIT should absolutely take second priority to finding a job.  You should not be studying for this test instead of hustling for a job because the FE will not necessarily open that many new doors for you.,LawSchool,cjqnz1a,1,t5_2rb9g

2312429,0,t3_2lqx1z,Yes do not ask questions during class. Dont raise your hand. BUT I dont think itd hurt to email the professor in advance and at least see if you can get a copy of the cases in advance so you could have some grasp of what students are discussing. Lawkids are gonna tell you not to prep before school because you wont understand the material until you get to class. This just isnt true  its not some magic light that comes on the first week of class. Read the cases and try and figure out WHAT HAPPENED Facts WHATS BEING QUESTIONED Issue the RESULT amp WHY HoldingReasoning and the Rule that you can pull from the case. Its not some gift or some secret club. Youll read hundreds of cases youre first semester and each case will have a small takeaway that changes What youre supposed to know.Once class is over ask any of the students anything you want most will be very upfront and honest about their experience. Also youre probably going to be very bored in class  the daytoday isnt exciting and its largely read these cases discuss depart. Its once you get into your specialty courses that things start to get a little more interesting.Ask Ls and Ls what theyre doing for their summers and what jobs have been available. Itll give you a nice look at what opportunities the school is offering. Try to get a feel for what kind of law school it is. My school feels more adultoriented with students coming to class socializing in school then going home to their separate lives. Other nearby schools have a lower average age and are likely to focus more on the social aspects of college. Neither option is bad I like being able to leave school at school but the school culture is something to consider.Dont give a shit about the facilities. Are there classrooms? A library? Maybe a vending machine? Dont choose the school simply because it looks nicer. My school is easily the ugliest in the Philly but after the first week I couldnt care less its not whats important.My Personal Advice... and others will disagree. First go to school where you could see yourself working. Its the best way to make connections while in school. Second go to school in a major city. Others might disagree but theres a ton of benefits to being in a major city that you could see yourself staying in. The obvious is that you have the potential to network with many more employers. Interviews will also likely be closer to your school and youll have national employers come market employment in your city. The next benefit is the ability to get away from it all at the end of the day. I have any number of neighborhoods and bars to experience and Im not stuck going to the same four college bars. Theres plenty of restaurants and cafes to inhabit.Also follow the money in respect to the ranking. Id argue and plenty of others would argue more that anything outside top  needs a hefty scholarship to be viable. I know kids at my T that are paying full price and that amount of debt boggles my mind. Get full or close to full scholarships isnt rocket science. Study for the LSAT and aim high if its under   retake. And others will argue you need higher. Even at a lows I was getting full tuition offers from TT schools  waivers. I wouldnt do it any other way. If you think I dont have time to study for the LSAT you definitely dont have time to study for law school. Get a good GPA too thatll be important. ,LawSchool,clxj5bf,8,t5_2rb9g

2367541,0,t1_cm49ucd,Three main problems I have with the standard critique of Wickard  pretending that it was just a little bit of wheat grown for his family and  a complete absence of an alternative rule that actually makes sense given what we know about economics. Also  to the extent that its a commerce clause issue I think too many people get confused and start implicitly assuming a substantive due process analysis or a policy argument because it just seems unfair or bad policy.For the first thing its pretty simple. According to the opinion Wickard harvested an excess of  bushels of wheat over his allotment. At  lbs per bushel thats a surplus of  lbs or . tons of wheat. Of surplus. So already its not a problem with the mean old feds abusing their power to tell some poor family farmer what he can and cant do to feed his family. Its clearly a commercial production given the facts of the case.The second thing I think people who have a big problem with the aggregation doctrine or affectation doctrine just havent been exposed to these concepts that are regarded as fundamental in economics. Fungible goods feed into a market and the power to regulate a market which nobody doubts in the case of the interstate wheat market means the power to actually regulate it. Any other interpretation simply makes for an opportunity for arbitrage and saying that the federal government would be without power to regulate arbitrageurs within a market they regulate would be an absurd result making the commerce clause completely meaningless. Without the affectationaggregation doctrine whats stopping multinational corporations from simply incorporating a bunch of smaller subsidiaries and shielding all their activity from federal regulation by only exposing a tiny portion of their activity to the truly interstate trade?The idea that you have to bifurcate what can and cant be regulated by the federal government in even a marketplace that is primarily interstate would be an unworkable standard. Imagine if the SEC could only regulate securities that are traded by outofstate entities thereby carving out all trades between New York financial firms on New York exchanges. Ask yourself how Jim Crow wouldve ended without federal commerce clause power.If the commerce clause is believed to limit the state governments power through the negative or dormant commerce clause that same clause will have to implicitly grant quite a bit of power to the federal government. We invalidate state regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce because we recognize that purely instate regulations can still impermissibly affect interstate commerce. So for the same reasons in order for the federal government to exercise powers over interstate commerce it necessarily means that they have to have some power over even purely intrastate commerce.And as to my third point I usually turn around the question and ask can states tell a farmer what he can or cant grow to feed his family? If you have a problem with that prospect I suspect that youre either letting the policy argument cloud your judgment on the issue or youre trying to make some kind of substantive due process claim about the privacy of ones own home and affairs. Thats not what was at issue in that case and couldnt properly be considered by the Supreme Court.Gonzales v. Raich is a much more sympathetic fact pattern for those trying to limit the federal commerce clause power but even then I think its a losing argument. If I were to to represent a client on that exact fact pattern I think that Id pursue the substantive due process argument first where I would argue that a cancer patient using medication prescribed by her own doctor with a valid prescription within the privacy of her own home cant be touched by either the federal or state government.,LawSchool,cm4c50d,5,t5_2rb9g

Heres a good link I think that another thing to look at is large firms who do a large amount of IP seem to be slowing down some. Irell had its recent split. There was the ATL article about the Quinn slowdown. Some of these things might not be related e.g. Im sure that the Quinn thing is partly RMBS stuff winding down and Im sure that both firms are still doing quite well but its interesting to consider whether they are as large as they used to be.It just doesnt make sense to have these massive IP lawsuits when you can license stuff and avoid the whole shebang. I think that this is why many expect IP to decline in the future.A quote from the article above Look for litigation in  to continue this trend  I expect that the total cases filed in  will fall over  compared with .  The decline can be attributed to the growth in IPRs the Supreme Courts Alice decision and most significantly mandatorypresumptive fee shifting.I dont think that UMN or ND opening new schools says much.

Screeners are generally just one  or  minute interview with one to two lawyers often a partner and an associate. ucrickyb sounds like she has a callback in which case this is probably the final round.For callbacks agreed they tend to be informal. All the interviews tend to follow the same format  or so minutes with a single lawyer. Generally the lawyer will spend half the interview asking you questions and the other half will be yours to ask the lawyer questions about his practice and the firm generally.The questions about you will usually be things like tell me about yourself how do you like law school what was your least favorite class so far tell me about your work experience if you worked before law school and often interests if you put those on your resume and the interviewer is interested in one of them. Very low key.For the second half I would recommend against asking logistical questions that can be discovered by searching the firms website or chambers and associates. I found the best questions to get attorneys talking were what kind of work do you do on a day to day basis what types of cases have you been working on recently have you worked with practice group X if youre interested in X etc. and then ask followup questions.,LawSchool,co1ogge,4,t5_2rb9g

3003874,0,t3_2uk8kx,I would appeal the grade. Best case scenario you get a grade change while worst case scenario you wasted your time and may annoy the professor. I have appealed my grades about  times and every one of them resulted in a grade increase. The most recent was this semester from a . to a .. I went and talked with the teacher and reviewed every multiple choice question and essay response I had been docked for. I explained my reasoning of why the answer I chose was correct or the question was ambiguous. In regards to the multiple choice questions some of them I had made an error for which I didnt get credit some of them we still disagreed on which I didnt receive points for and one she realized had been poorly worded and my reasoning was correct for which I got credit. Just getting that one multiple choice raised my grade from a . a .. Then I went through her multiple choice answers and mine and compared them. After comparing them I felt my answers reflected hers and asked her to regrade them. It is important to note that yes it is subjective grading but the teacher is fallible and especially more prone to do so after grading a multitude of similar boring responses. I felt uncomfortable explaining why I felt my essays were poorly graded and so decided not to argue the points I had made. Rather I decided I would ask her to regrade the essays because this would allow her to focus specifically on my essays. She told me she reserved the right to also lower my grade upon regrade but because of my comparisons I felt comfortable taking the chance. She got back to me today saying that after the regrade I jumped up to a ..Obviously it depends on your answer choices and ability to reason with the teacher but worst case scenario is youre denied. As long as youre not a total douche when trying to talk with the professor the only negative impact will be they are annoyed having to regrade your essay. But ultimately to me that is a minor inconvenience. That inconvenience though is the reason I didnt appeal a grade I got one year. It was a group project where we turned in individual responses and I got a . while my friend got a .. I was really annoyed but didnt want to appeal the grade because of potentially annoying the professor. In hindsight I wish I had talked with the professor because that grade alone has dropped me significantly.If it helps our schools chain of appeal is the instructor then the Associate Dean then the Dean or a  person committee  member chosen by the Dean  member chosen by the professor and  member chosen by the student the member must be either a fulltime student or fulltime faculty.

If its a job you really want it would be a bummer to lose out on it because an old fogey in the hiring position thought you didnt wear the right color suit.  I completely take your point that in practice the color of your suit matters very little once you get the job.  Practically it doesnt matter much in an interview setting either...I fully concede that the scenario I describe above is uncommon.BUT while losing out on a job because of your black suit is not likely to happen it is a possible result.

Biomedical engineering is a highly niche field traditional engineering majors such as EE and ME often overlap in its function andor can take additional courses to have that as a concentration.  In effect you would need a higher degree of expertise than the BS level to be competitive.  Also if its so niche the companies that require a firms patent prosecution services will also be highly limited and patent prosecution is apparently shifting towards volume on low margins so that field in general may not be as broad as biotechnology as a whole on the PhD level or EECS. Your best bet is probably just to go into the PhD program first and see if you like academia.

It worked out well my younger brother was also going through the ROTC selection process. They evaluated my service records fitreps PRTs from the Academy and my academics and said that I was well qualified. Had an acceptance letter several actually in hand so Im sure that expedited everything. Perhaps my view of the immediacy of the commissioning process was skewed by USNA because OCS was the only requirement and it was and I believe still is a week course in Quantico. Upon completion of OCS youre handed a commission and butter bars. TBS comes AFTER completion of law school and following TBS Naval Justice School for your MOS. Heres the USMC page that lays out the timeline. I misspoke above when I said an immediate commission. What I meant to say was an immediate APPOINTMENT as in a spot at OCS. However I looked at it as a technicality after  years at Annapolis.As was communicated to me at the time OCS is completed during the summer before entering law school or during either summer before L year.

The Law Society of Upper Canada LSUC recently brought in a new program to create an alternative to the articling requirement.

L Typically Socraticstyle classes with substantial interaction between student and professors  LL Anywhere from zero student participation to regular calling on students either cold or advance notice is given. Rare to see intense Socraticstyle.  L Largely essaybased exams that are substantial timecrunches. Its not uncommon to see someall MC thrown in though its less common.  L Depends on the class. The larger courses covering barexam topics tend to stick to the essaybased model of L in my experience. MC questions were more common but commonly mixed with essay though I had my first all MC exam this semester. There are upperlevel writing courses where the grade is largelyentirely based on a  page paper. .  People largely regret law school because the vast majority of schools dont offer a substantial opportunity for the great employment outcomes Ls think they will attain. There is also substantial cost so if you come out without your desired job and with a ton of debt on top its a recipe for regret.  Personally I have been happy with my decision but I have been very fortunate. I will be leaving school with less than k in debt and am lined up for the kind of fulltime employment I was shooting for coming into law school. My outcome is in the minority though so I probably have a more positive perspective than many. I enjoy many aspects of law school classes social life etc. but its all relative. I think I would be happier in the real world but am making the most of where I have placed myself. Law school is a huge investment and a risky one. The level of risk youve taken and the eventual payout is going to determine most peoples attitude about law school. . Depends on the undergrad degree. I was a financeeconomics major and I havent found the subject matter to be any more intellectually difficult. I imagine it may be a bigger step up in difficulty for some majors over others. Law school takes time and discipline and most not all people cant get by on pure intellect though it obviously helps. Its more difficult solely because the exams cover an entire semesters material and you are graded on a curve. If you stick to your studies and put forth the effort the exams themselves shouldnt be head and shoulders more difficult than your undergrad. However this is easier said than done and one of the reasons people complain is because many people cram in the last  weeks before finals and yes that sucks. Extracurriculars are also a huge time drain and can make it more difficult to stay on top of everything. So content wise not more difficult. The time and commitment required is another level though. ,LawSchool,cr682f3,2,t5_2rb9g

In each program students help real clients. I think what makes this legal clinic different is the range of programs that help clients in many different situations.The civil litigation program helps area tenants who have disputes with their current or former landlords. Typical cases are about security deposits and evictions. Students will interview clients communicate and negotiate with opposing parties and represent clients in small claims court.The appellate review program takes on select criminal cases which are ripe for appeal. Students will draft appellate briefs and deliver oral argument before local appeals courts.The jail inmate assistance program sends students to local jails weekly to meet with inmates and answer their legal questions. Inmates can ask the students to research points of law get them a copy of their case docket or contact their attorney. The expungement program helps people with criminal convictions petition the court to get the conviction removed from public record. For cases not eligible for expungement our local court has a certificate of qualification for employment program which people can show to their potential employer as the courts approval when a criminal conviction would normally disqualify the person from being employed there. Students at the legal clinic help these people fill out the extensive paperwork for their petitions to the court. When the above two programs dont apply to a person students can help the person petition the governor for a pardon in the clemency program. This is the last ditch effort in removing a criminal conviction from a persons record.The new business program assists area entrepreneurs in starting their business entities and writing contracts for them.Each program is supervised at every stage by practicing attorneys who are experts in their fields. I consider my involvement in the legal clinic to be my favorite part of law school. Prior to graduation I interviewed countless inmates and clients delivered two oral arguments in appeals courts and represented a client in a trial in small claims court.

Only later after the athletes had arrived on campus did they realize the implications of the compact they had signed that they had entered an environment where official morality is unevenly applied where snitches and spies abound and where above all an interplay of race and religion affects every decision and allows the school at least publicly to take a righteous stand that only advances the missionary aims of the church that owns it.

I know people say major in something that will get you a job and minor in something you love. Fuck that. Youre going to pay too much money to hate what youre learning or not learning because youre not actually engaged with the material. If you go to class love what youre learning make meaningful relationships with your professors and peers I guarantee success. By doing so you might find that law school isnt for you your true calling is something else.Always try to get better at reading writing and speaking in public.

After lots of thought and considering paying what the partials wouldnt cover at the higherranked schools I decided to take the full ride at the T in my desired market and I definitely think I made the right choice. It all depends on your goals but if you have a desired market region and the opportunity to attend a reputable school that feeds that market on a full ride its definitely worth considering. Youll come out with a leg up because you dont have the added stress of massive loan payments breathing down your neck while trying to bar prep. At most youll be looking at some debt for cost of livingbooks but there are ways to cut down on what you spend to help with that. Regardless less debt makes the job search slightly less terrifying because staring down the barrel of K in debt with interest should scare the sht out of anybody. But Im also debt averse for what its worth. Side note dont forget that schools tend to give more aid depending on their privatepublic status. Larger private schools throw money around more than public universities like UT.

Youre opening yourself to patent prosecution but realize that patent prosecution will likely require a . minimum as well.  CS average GPAs tend to hover .. depending on school.  Patent litigation is probably not something that you should be considering as its kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now.

You cant give all your time to the jealous mistress that is the law but youll have to find a way to take a personal interest in what youre studying otherwise it will be harder on yourself to force study.

I took it very serious and lived by the above mentioned principles. I wound up ranking in the top  of my class. Youll do fine  just get serious and get your game face on.

And those who do normally have to start at ground zero At least in terms of learning.  Theres almost no crossover.  I did for a brief time look at public jobs e.g. with the federal government but those are also hard to come by and it didnt seem like it would be a good move.  What really tipped the scales in favor of going back to software engineering was the fact that I was looking at all of these alternative legal jobs solely on the basis of worklife balance and not really on the merits of the job itself.

I work for partners who can hardly put together a grammatical sentence.  So many of my colleagues and opponents seemingly dont know the first thing about structure.  Their briefs read like they just put a bunch of case quotations archaic legalese and overthetop douchisms in a blender.Your internship with the judge will be valuable.  Youll learn a lot and it will serve you well this summer.Over the summer your main job is to do halfway decent work while not being a total asshole or an unprofessional nitwit.  Seriously whether you get an offer will mainly hinge on things like professionalism and likeability.The only time Ive ever recommended that we nooffer a summer associate was when I had a kid completely bail on a client call without providing me any advance notice.  It wasnt that he was in any way essential to the call it was that I had gone out of my way to include him he had committed to join and then he completely noshowed.  His excuse?  Lunch ran long.  Even then the firm gave him an offer despite my negative review.As for likeability dont force yourself to be someone you arent comfortable being.  I see a lot of forced extroversion at summer associate events and it inevitably comes off as well forced.  If youre naturally more outgoing great.  If youre naturally less outgoing just work with that.  Im a natural introvert and I tend to do better in small settings than in large ones.  If thats who you are then take the time to get coffee with people oneonone or in small groups.And as for your work just do your best and try not to be sloppy.  People generally expect that summer associates work is not going to be amazing and thats OK.  With all due respect you dont know what the fuck youre doing yet.  And thats to be expected.  But if theres one thing that bothers me and probably many others in my position its when I get the sense that a summer associate did not put in effort.  You dont have to be Oliver Wendell Holmes but try to make sure your work is clean and polished.

This would have gotten my networking started early would have given me exposure to what attorney life is actually like and I would have some extra funds saved up hopefully.Best case scenario you have a potential employer lined up when you graduate worst case you decide law school is not the right path.In addition I would have used that year to actually figure out what law school requires for success and maybe figure out whether its really for me. SO MUCH rides on that first year and first semester and its hard to learn as you go so having a plan laid out and preparations in place to maximize your success from the getgo will help.And I DEFINITELY would have taken a trip or something in that year. Once law school kicks off youre almost putting your life on hold for three years. Its all mindnumbing time consuming work that will crush your soul and then you get out and you spend the summer bar studying and if you get a job youre now locked down and have to make sure youre keeping up with the demands. And you dont have a job you spend your time seeking one out and watching your bank account slowly diminish. Trips are out of the question unless your family is loaded.Get that big Europe vacation or South American road trip or whatever big journey you have dreamed up out of the way because if you dont you have a decent shot of regretting that.As others have said get that GPA up to maximize the chance for scholarships. Although honestly LSAT seems to matter more.Set not just good but PERFECT study habits in stone now because Law School will beat them into you in a learn to swim or drown kind of way but by then itll be too late. Whatever good habits you think you have now are not good enough.Try and decide what kind of law you want to practice and I mean consider EVERYTHING. Dont just be all I wanna be a public defender and help people! Figure out the classes thatll help the extracurriculars and clubs and the available internships. Its okay to change your mind once youre there but it helps to have an idea of where you really want to go.And perhaps the easiest thing try and get a handle on some of the concepts that youll see in your L year before getting there.

It sounds like youre stuck in a hard place where youre striking out with the legal positions you want and are seen as overqualified for the legal positions youd tolerate with the end result being that youre not practicing law at all.Heres the game plan. Send me your resume and cover letter. Ill look at both of them and see if I can offer any feedback. . I found some smallfirm openings in your area on my schools Symplicity Im at an East Coast school so there arent many listings from the Northwest but there are a few. Ill send those to you and you should apply with the most kickass version of your resume and cover letter.. Tomorrow start looking into what it would take to hang your own shingle and see if thats something you might want to pursue. As others have pointed out you dont necessarily need a dedicated office or the fancy accoutrements of a law firm to make this work. Id imagine that the big fixed costs would be malpractice insurance which you must have and a website plus youd have the startup costs of forming a business entity. You can get clients as a nb with a welldesigned website and strategic marketing. It sounds like you have some experienced lawyers in your life who you could turn to for advice when its needed. You wouldnt have to do this full time or as your sole source of income necessarily but its a good way to make sure youre not getting stale.. Tomorrow start looking for nonlegal jobs with longterm promise. Theres absolutely no reason not to. If law is destined not to work out for you youre going to have to find a career anyway. And if law is still in the cards for you I really do think having some professional experience on your resume will help you get there sooner.You dont have to throw in the towel with respect to practicing law until youve tried absolutely everything you can to find a job.Edit Thanks to the anonymous person who gave me Reddit gold!

When I retested in October academic distress was like only  which is still high but about  points lower.

5734028,0,t3_3to5jm,From the viewpoint of a CA bar passer who took about four total days off and started seeing someone while bar prep dont do it! Active learning is underrated and very important your GF might find it beneficial for you to help her with flashcards. For me I found that active learning with flashcards was necessary. I knew there was inertia for me to overcome in studying and relearning material When I started prepping I hadnt learned anything substantive in over a month. Your girlfriend is probably in a similar position. As a result I made flashcards and continued to work on tighter definitions and rule statements. I think just having to explain it to my roommate and girlfriend was beneficial. Help her stay on pace and also take care of her physical needs as well. Looking back the first  days was super important. I went to lectures everyday during this period. Afterwards when I started to get drained it WILL happen I listened to lectures at . or even x speed via BarBri. So maybe in the first month you cook clean and put aside all relationship goals. Furthermore its a marathon you might want to pay attention to how much shes eating and sleeping. Sleep is crucial. During final prep she needs to be able to put it all together. Her mind might be struggling to put everything together she might find it beneficial if she had large open areas just to chart ideas and see how they relate. During the final prep I needed to put it all together. I tried to boil every subject down to one or two pages of notes. I wrote on windows chalkboards and blackboards and used reams of paper. My apartment resembled scenes from A Beautiful Mind. She might find it beneficial if you remind her to prepare how all things fit together and went through it with her.  Finally emotions need to be managed. Frustration over lack of results and fear of failure WILL occur. My GF actually knew my patterns and tendencies and knew how to get me out of them. I flipped out twice during bar prep but everyone told me to keep going. I did and when I got to the bar exam I felt like it was MY TIME to shine. This part is easily the hardest. My advice is to QTIP quit taking things personally if your GF blows up like I blew up when studying Evidence and Constitutional Law. Also perhaps in the next few months you can study her tendencies when shes scared upset or stressed and make sure she doesnt fall into timewasting and performancesapping patterns. Best of luck PM if you want more advice or even to tell me Im wrong. ,LawSchool,cx7v1m9,11,t5_2rb9g
5739964,0,t3_3trei0,Yes many of the jobs hinge on your bar performance at least at an unspoken level. Also it is a two or three depending on the state day long test with around  hours of testing each day. You are required to have memorized and be able to apply an endless amount of rules from over  different law school subjects. You go through law school to prepare for it and then study fulltime for several months specifically for the bar and then all of that work hinges on your performance over  arbitrarily selected days of testing.The closest comparison I could give you would be taking an entire year not semester of law school final exams all at once backtoback and then getting one grade. Except that isnt even really accurate because on the bar you are also tested over subjects you took  years ago in law school or may never even have taken at all.,LawSchool,cx8lk2f,4,t5_2rb9g

5777730,0,t1_cx9a572,Accountability sign me up!I took Kaplan first time and failed. No big distractions but not grinding out  hour days. My general schedule was  hours a day MF with only occasional weekends. Even  hours a day of actual active studying started to burn me out towards the end so I didnt really try to push it and am not sure if pushing out more studying would have helped.Im probably not going to retake Kaplan. If it didnt work the first time I dont trust it the second time. I also did Kaplan first for MPRE failed then did Barbri for MPRE and passed. I also currently have a full time job. My boss took the news really well and the office is short staffed so they arent going to can me unless I walk out. Given that the bar review courses dont start until roughly Christmas time my preliminary plan was to buy the Barbri CMR and full outlines and spend  hours a day more on weekends reading and outlining by hand in my own words. Im a very kinesthetic learner who took notes by hand and then made outlines all through law school which is something I probably shouldnt have dropped for bar review but eh its done.My scores are all over the board as far as what Im missing though.

It would be useful to do a full practice exam relying on your outline at your current level of knowledge to see if youre struggling with time. If you find yourself needing to turn to your outline to answer every single question and eating up a lot of time typing from itflipping through it you might want to try to memorize the points your professor really focused on.Keep in mind that the people who complainbrag about studying  hours a day are probably screwing around complaining about it on Facebook most of the time. Its way more productive to actually study for  hours a day than to be wasting time while at the library studying. All through law school I studied from  or  everyday and did very well. Dont let others study habits dictate what you do because you can burn yourself out especially if part of you doesnt believe you need the extra prep.

5867338,0,t1_cxopau9,I understand completely. I mean I loved law school. I had always wanted to go and after taking  years off in between years of undergrad I went back to school and worked my ass off to get into the best law school I could. I got a full ride to undergrad but law school was a different story. My husband and I both worked me as a waitress and while we werent well off we made enough that I wasnt offered any financial aid at all. But I really wanted to be a lawyer and do work that benefitted the needy. I had interned at the public defender when I was in undergrad and saw myself doing that kind of work. But when I was faced with a substantial debt load and the realization that those public interest jobs were actually incredibly difficult to get little fundingfew jobs I decided to try and get a job at the best firm I could. And I did. I got an offer from a V New York firm. I thought it would be different than everyone said I wouldnt work those crazy hours because Im just not a gunner. But the summer associate position was a joke compared to really working there. I have been screamed at had things thrown at me been given permission to go to bed at  in the morning I am  years old and married and worked  hour days with a migraine. I have worked so much that my husband threatened to leave me. And from what I hear from friends working at other similar firms in other big cities its not much different elsewhere. Work life balance is a joke. Sure I make good money but do I have time to enjoy it? No. Vacations are frowned upon and often cancelled due to work at the last minute. Im so tired when I come home that even keeping up the apartment is difficult. Its sad because unlike my husband who is brilliant and just fell into being a lawyer and excels at it without trying I really wanted this. I worked for it for years. I want to be good at what I do. I care. But the industry is just not what I thought it would be. People who have worked at my firm for more than  years look  years older than they are. It just kills you to work like this. Maybe it will be different for you. Think long and hard about the path you take. Do research. Dont be taken in by promises of prestige or power or money. Find something you truly enjoy and find a way to make it work. You will be happier for it. ,LawSchool,cxoqm3o,9,t5_2rb9g

If you are in a precarious position for the bar like bottom of your class AND not in a top  school then do whatever tricks you can to get ahead.  But even in that instance I think youd be better served learning the style of writing the bar wants think CRAC format for every issue headers bolded words etc. and making sure you can issue spot effectively.

I dont know what I would have done in that situation.This is essentially the only part of employment where you can have an advantage rather than a disadvantage due to raceethnicity. A black attorney I knew did a SA gig at a big law firm and several of the partners pretty much only gave work to the white SAs and one of them even incorrectly assumed he was a paralegal multiple times even after he explained that he was a SA each time. I spoke to a diversity coordinator at a different big law firm and she said they instituted a blind review process for the SAs writing because the partners kept grading nonwhite SAs lower for internal reviews and the difference disappeared once they started the blind reviews.,LawSchool,cys5lx3,2,t5_2rb9g

After speaking with the judge that I worked for he said that he hates it when people dont send grades with the initial application because there are so many people to sift theough even if you look like a good candidate not including grades at all is a reason to disqualify you. Sending a writing sample via snail mail can be very expensive I sent out  apps. If a judge decides they want to interview you based on what you sent then they may or may not request a writing sample.Out of my  apps I received at least  or  not hiring responses  requests for interviews selected  interviews and accepted the offer from a federal judge.After talking to friends I realized  apps may be excessive but then again I landed a federal judicial internship with grades just above the median at a Tier  school in a major market.

6438735,0,t3_43jfnt,I googled you sorry had to have more info and read your very interesting bio one thing you might want to discuss is how a nontraditional student a non KJD might be able to capitalize on that prior experience even if it wasnt lawrelated.  I just recently transitioned from midlaw to a solo education law practice and in large part that decision was driven by my experiences in my prior career as a teacher.  Going into law school I would not have seen myself in this practice area  years out but my path was evolving that way so I decided to lean in.  Another thing to keep in mind though is that you will be speaking to a lot of students for whom their first legal job will be their first real job and they will need to learn to conform with their employers expectations and client expectations in large degree in order to get their foot in the door and gain credibility and experience.

We have negligence because we want people in society to exercise caution and not harm other. Boom thats your policy argument extra points. What I would do in these final weeks before finals...is practice! Hit the MC hard to remember black letter law and do practice essays to get your attack outline down. Another good way to determine what your professors position is is to do a practice essay and send it to him. Then schedule office hours to go over it with them.

7364562,0,t1_d2f9mmc,I think we lost about  students after our first semester.  of which dropped out a few weeks in after deciding law school wasnt what they wanted. I know that in second semester we have a handful of students on academic probation. As a fellow undergraduate honors student I second the notion that law school isnt about smart  good grades there is a system in place and you have to learn how to play it. The system is everything from learning how to write exams IRAAC formula writing what the professor wants not what you think they want knowing who you can trust for notes if you miss a class try not to learning the atmosphere of each class and what is expected of you this takes a few weeks and change with each class the atmosphere of the school which changes with each incoming class and if you get a new dean and even the best places to sit I sit right in the front bc I am hard of hearing but that also means I get called on al of the time. Then there is the joy of networking and learning that just because you have good grades doesnt mean you land a job or sometimes it does but it is also about who you know  you get to experience nepotism first hand but you also get to experience camaraderie depending again on the atmosphere of your school and yes a crap ton of writing. I can go on and on but keep in mind that ever law school is different as is every individuals law school experience. Finally and I add this as a caution be prepared to be wrong be prepared to be told that you are wrong and be prepared to be told that in front of your entire class. If you can handle that and admittedly it took me a while to handle that you might just be fine. ,LawSchool,d2fat88,2,t5_2rb9g

IF and thats a big IF you test positive you should talk it over with your doctor who can give you more accurate info than youre gonna get from a bunch of strangers on reddit PThat being said this isnt  and HIV is not a death sentence. You are living in a time and a country where you would have access to outstanding meds that can not only keep the HIV virus in check for DECADES so you never develop AIDS but also can dramatically reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others.

This is common practice at least at my firm  juniors write the briefs partners edit as needed.  If its a longer brief Ill submit an outline before I start drafting just to make sure I dont waste a lot of time on arguments that the senior lawyers may not want but on shorter briefs I just draft and submit for their review.  If its a very large case there will be many more layers of review more senior associates a few different partners etc..  In certain situations it also makes sense to split a brief up and let various juniors take the first cut at individual sections with a midlevel or senior editing and combining and then partners reviewing. ,LawSchool,d4zu3r5,1,t5_2rb9g

8486350,0,t1_d62bf3j,. Your school will have plenty of speakers come to talk about their area of practice. Frankly you dont even really need to pick until you start practice if you go to a full service law firm offering both litigation and transactional work. Really you may want to decide if you like litigation or transactional work better as those are the two broad categories. Youll get an idea without having to try hard but you can always go to the presenters to see what they do and see if it interests you. Beyond that some people choose a practice area because they knew going in thats what they wanted while others get to practice try out an assignment and choose a practice group youve never heard of.. Youll hear it over and over again on this sub but it really doesnt matter what you do L summer so long as you have a job you can talk about in your future interviews. Its true. You mentioned grades and thats really all youll want to focus on. If you know attorneys in the local area and want to take them out for coffee then networking helps so long as it doesnt take away from getting good grades. Dont stress about first summer until after st semester really unless your school specifically has stuff to apply to before then. . Dont waste any additional time trying to get professors to like you. They grade blind so it wont help you with grades. Just do what they ask in class e.g. Be prepared for a cold call or participate if they ask open questions. Dont be an ass obviously but do what I just mentioned. Go into office hours if you have further questions or prior to exam season to pick their brain.. Youll be in the same boat as everyone.

9397042,0,t3_5990b6,grimey is pretty spot on by saying that firm class size is basically the biggest limiting factor in Chicago biglaw. But ties to the area do matter  I have friends at much lower tier schools who had a compelling Chicago is the only city for me narrative and while it was hard to get the first interview due to low school rank once they were in the door it was a lot easier. So recognize that youre probably going to have to interview with more firms during OCI than someone from UChicago or even Yale or Harvard. Firms like when you stress your ties and commitment to the area  better chance of getting you if they make you an offer and better chance of keeping you around as long as someone stays around in biglaw.That said sealing Chicago status isnt everything. Firms may not immediately see your decision to go to Northwestern as a true commitment to the Chicago area and they wont know that when theyre screening you unless Northwestern prevents prescreening during OCI. So be prepared to sell that when you do go into interviews. Even Chicago firms which are a bit more protective and want Chicagofolk understand that people go elsewhere for a few years and want the school that is the best fit for them so they will totally respect the choice of a HarvardYaleStanfordUPennetc. person who is from the Chicago area and who wants to return.Also just wanted to put down two quick tidbits as you are finalizing your applicationthinking about this Northwestern places a heavy heavy premium on previous work experience. So while your LSAT and GPA arewill be solidly within their numbers if you want to go to Northwestern you need to have a way to manage that expectation. It doesnt mean much for your decision to apply to ED in terms of picking law schools since if you get in youve gotten in  but I wanted to flag it so that you are putting forth the strongest application possible and it sounds like youre a straight through. Grades and LSAT count but that work experience is a huge factor. It was discussed a lot during my admissions interview.

From your source that describes  of  graduates but what percent of tier  grads is it? Id actually be grateful if you scrounged the s for me as I cant be bothered.

The rest went into debt for a salary I started at out of undergrad. gtCant pass the bar Again based on what stats? Unless youre in CA most graduates are going to pass the bar regardless of school other than nonaccredited schools.In the case of DePaul youre right  passed the bar.gtCant afford their debt This is true regardless of school ranking.Not necessarily. Cornell is about k more expensive than DePaul at a nondiscounted rate  but half their class STARTED at over k Thats a lot of debt but its also a salary commensurate with the debt. And were not talking about a coinflip chance of getting a job  of their class got FT LT legal positions. Only  werent gainfully employed and Id venture that thats because they decided to travel start a family or do whatever the fuck.My point still stands in terms of cost and opportunity cost a low tier school is likely a bad choice.

9688978,0,t1_da75nki,I used barbri for my July exam with  program completion but ditched it for the February bar exam. I did not sign up for the free barbri reenrollment. I was shy of  points to pass in July but I completely redid my ENTIRE approach because it was clear I was studying incredibly inefficiently and commercial barprep programs were not going to help me.For my new study plan I did  MBE questions per day in Adaptibar going over every single question answered even correct ones. I started doing sets of  beginning the th week of study. I printed out all my incorrect questions with Adaptibars explanations attached and put them all in a binder. Outside of my attack outlines that binder ended up being one of my best study tools. For my essays I worked with a tutor a former bar grader with a great reputation and a high percentage of passing students during each test administration who had me doing at least  essays per subject. I started going through my answers line by line and comparing it with the model answers.  I realized missing one element could be fatal to an otherwise passing essay because that could have been where the bulk of the essays analysis should have taken place.  I learned to be very ruthless with my selfgraded essays.  I also did  PT a week under timed conditions. For most people this might be overkill but for me studying PTs felt worth it because an excellent PT could easily make up for  mediocre essays.I also bought a planner and used it to document everything I did at the end of each study day. It kept me honest with myself about what I was actually doing with my  hours of study. It also gave me more confidence as the exam week approached because I had a concrete list of what I did in preparation.A note on those thinking about using tutors you do not need one to pass. Most good tutors will tell you this. But when I was looking for one it was clear to me that there were a lot of bad tutors preying off the insecurities of repeat takers who treated their students as a paycheck and charged ridiculous tuition rates while teaching little to no critical skills. If you want to get one make sure you are hiring someone with a good reputation AND who is a former bar grader. These two traits are completely independent of each other but both are essential to a good tutor who is worth your money.Feel free to DM me if I can elaborate on anything else.

9951749,0,t1_db4ikyf,Pretty sure your explanation speaks to NIED not to IIED. Restatement d of Torts  is titled Negligent Infliction of Emotional Harm.  is RecklessIntentional Infliction of Emotional Harm.OPs question relates more to whether D has knowledge of Ps emotional hypersensitivity in an IIED suit. Family members are allowed to recover when they suffer emotional distress from contemporaneously witnessing Ds recklessoutrageous conduct towards the intended victim.In this case if D doesnt even have knowledge of Ps existence much less Ps hypersensitivity via relation to the person hes verbally abusing I dont believe the court will allow hypersensitivity to be factored in here. Here shes present and D probably has reason to know of her relation so shell probably be allowed to recover.The son can almost certainly recover for IIED due to the waiters verbal abuse amounting to outrageous conduct. Presence of intent seems pretty much a given here when hes verbally attacking a teenager. Really the only thing thats up in the air here is the extent to which hes received emotional harm.Since you spoke about NIED the mother wont be able to recover for NIED since there was no physical harm to her child despite her emotional distress from witnessing the emotional harm contemporaneously. An essential element of bystander recovery from NIED requires that a family member suffer serious bodily harm for P to recover. Your step  is moot here even if the mother werent allowed to recover her son will. Your attempt to subject this situation to reductio ad absurdum here is well absurd.In short Mother may possibly recover based on bystander IIED because shes sitting right next to her son this is evidence suggesting that P knowshas reason to know of her relation and by extension her hypersensitivity. Its enough to go before the jury whether they find that D had knowledge or that Mother indeed suffered extreme emotional harm are questions of fact although I foresee a likely result in Mothers favor here. Mother cant recover based on bystander NIED because her son didnt suffer any serious bodily harm. Son can mostly likely recover based on IIED as a direct victim due to waiters outrageous conduct through verbal abuse. Again however its a jury question of fact regarding whether he actually suffered emotional harm from waiters verbal abuse.,LawSchool,db4qlmu,1,t5_2rb9g

They may ask you about some of the judges previous rulings or any other current legal topics so be prepared to talk a little bout that.  Some judges may want to ask your opinion on specific issues and try creating some back and forth about a topic.

What makes you a lib would be believing that they made the right decision. The Constitution explicitly states that Congress creates law in this country not judicial activists despite what RGB may believe and that the President has the power to dictate immigration and foreign policy.Here we have a constitutional EO that is being temporarily suspended for purely political reasons by a political party that is losing so bad that they do not know what to do. The Democrats could give two shits about any American citizens at this point they just lie to the country and themselves in their quest to regain power. Luckily most of the population is on to this and that why the Democrats are losing so very badly and wont have power for a long time.Like I said Constitution clearly states that the President has the sole power over immigration. The Plaintiff who suffered no actually injury and has no real standing forum shopped to the disgraceful th Cir. where they knew they would get the desired result they set out to achieve. Any other Circuit would have struck down the temporary pause in the EO bc they understand the law and  US Code  f is clear as fucking day on what the law is.This disgraceful th Cir. did not cite the law instead they cited statements by the President and others that have nothing to do with the EO. If you read the EO and read  US Code  f any reasonable individual without bias so not the th Cir. or most libs it is evidently clear that the EO is lawful and it is obviously constitutional bc it does not affect anyone protected by the Constitution except for protecting those individuals from foreign enemies.,LawSchool,ddm38t0,1,t5_2rb9g

10861908,0,t3_5v7k4p,Do you want to work in litigation long term?  If not it may not be worth it.  One other point to consider is the opportunity cost of the clerkship.  If you do your d.ct clerkship you would start as a second year then leave as a third year for the appellate clerkship and return as a fourth year assuming its a one year term.  As a fourth year your billable rate is pretty high and you may not have any of the experiences that partners and clients will be looking for deposition experience working with experts directcross at trial etc.  That can leave you with a narrow margin for error and a limited window to take off as an associate.  Also consider that your peers such as those that didnt clerk may have proven themselves and developed relationships with the partners you want to work with while you were gone.  If you intend to leave for the government or academia it probably doesnt matter.  But if you want to make partner you should pay attention to the timeline. ,LawSchool,de0buvs,1,t5_2rb9g

11271419,0,t3_60uiwj,I had a similar torts final. It was  questions with a  character limit per question. It was very basic and straight forward.  and  arent torts per se. Is your professor going to ask you a question regarding those two issues in addition to NIED? When you think about a bar answer I like CReAC. You state your conclusion the legal rule explain the rule if necessary analyze by applying the facts to the rule and then conclude. Lets do an example for battery. Fact Patter A walks up to B and punches him in the face. A says Sorry about that and walks away. B sues A on a Battery claim.A will likely be found liable for battery because A contacted B without Bs consent. Battery is a common law intentional tort defined as the intentional nonconsensual harmful touching of another. Battery does not require damages mere contact is sufficient. In this case A walked up to B and punched B in the face. Though A yelled sorry about that no facts point to A accidentally contacting Bs face. A walked within proximity enough of B to bring his fist within contact of Bs face. A intentionally moved close enough to B to allow him to make contact with Bs face. Further there are no facts that state that B consented to A punching him in the face so the contact is unintentional. Further A actually made contact with Bs face with his fist which is harmful touching. By punching A in the face A intentionally made contact with B in a harmful manner without Bs consent. A will likely be found liable for battery. Thats really all you need. You should also describe any defenses that may be raised if the facts indicate them but dont infer facts that are not obvious. In my example I inferred that A punching B is harmful because punch someone in the face generally is harmful but I did not infer anything beyond what the facts state. I think what your profession means answer the call of the question and not merely regurgitate everything youve learned to try and snap a few points.,LawSchool,df9lkj3,2,t5_2rb9g

11360920,0,t1_dfjpogn,Im saying that set of schools has similar postgraduate outcomes as the ColumbiaNYU set. In general though I do think the argument would stand that ChiNU have similar longterm employment outcomes. I spent the past thirty minutes looking up data to back up my assertion. Heres what I found. For placement in BL . Columbia. Chicago. Northwesten. Cornell. NYUThis means that the four schools we are discussing are going to have similar BL opportunities and thus similar exit options. Lets go farther though. Schools by production of Fortune  General Counsels . Harvard. UVA . Michigan TIE. Texas TIE. Chicago TIE. Northwestern TIE. Columbia TIE. NYULets go even farther. Schools by production of Federal Judges  . Columbia  . NYU  . Northwestern  . Chicago The outcomes really arent that different in the longterm except Columbia beats the rest of the pack for federal judges. There are a lot of other outcomes but there isnt really any advantage in the longterm of choosing any of these schools over another unless youre in it for US News bragging rights. The only other real exception beyond Columbias high Federal judge stats is professorship placement I consider that a longterm employment result.Schools by professor production per capita    . Chicago . . Columbia . . NYU . . Northwestern .Also Michigan places  in Chicago but its in no way really competing with NUChicago. Michigans largest employment destination is New York  and Illinois  is th behind D.C. and California. Meanwhile Northwesterns  location was Illinois . For U of C Illinois was also the  employment destination . The schools are all basically identical unless youre in a tiny proportion of students who attend T schools who want to be professorsfederal judges. Even then by attending Chicago over NYU youve probably only increased your chance of becoming a professor by lt. By attending Columbia over Northwestern youve probably only increased your chance of becoming a federal judge by by lt. Its all relatively meaningless at that point. There are many other much bigger factors at play. Maybe Columbias federal judges are making it big in the East but Columbia grades in the West never get appointed. Maybe more Chicago students want to be professors so theyre willing to settle for lower ranking schools while NU students only want to be professors at top ranked schools. The list of confounding variables that could make these already small differences even more insignificant could probably go on for awhile. Cheers.,LawSchool,dfjqmgn,9,t5_2rb9g

11387791,0,t3_62hm0m,I dualmajored and obtained BAs in both Political Science and History. I knew I was going to major in Political Science when I enrolled in my first class freshman year because I thought it was the safest most practical road to law school and I wasnt wrong. Like you history has always been a passion of mine. I didnt decide to pursue a degree in the subject until my sophomore year. I could write a novel on why I think doing so was the best decision Ive ever made but Ill spare you and focus on your specific questions. History is very relevant to law. Learning about different time periods allows you to have a greater understanding and appreciation for the context in which earlier legal precedents were established. As nerdy as this may sound I very much believe that this serves as a catalyst for a lifetime of endless learning.A notso quick and somewhat generic illustration of what Im trying to say I have always enjoyed learning about the American Revolutionary period and the decades leading up to the eventual War of Independence. Our Constitution was ratified in  and became effective in early . Nearly  years earlier the Brits began allowing its officers in the American colonies to enforce laws through general writs of assistance. The holder of any such writ essentially had absolute authority to search a colonists home person office etc. without any particularized suspicion of the colonists wrongdoing and without regard to a colonists privacy. The colonists understandably thought this was shitty and they embodied their dissent in the th Amendment. Understanding why the th Amendment was passed and what it serves to protect allows me to think critically about modern laws and the reasoning behind them. In other words it helps better conceptualize the spirit of the law. Do police need a search warrant to draw someones blood to determine if theyve been drinking and driving? Do federal agents need a warrant before they can pass a drug dog around a car stopped on the highway for speeding? Understanding the history of the law and how it developed to the modern standard to me at least enables me to stay grounded in and focused on precedent which should theoretically be an apolitical position rather than trying to twist the law to conform to a Republican or Democratic position on such issues.  I didnt have much trouble balancing the work required to pick up the second bachelors but the answer will inevitably be it depends. One major factor is how much youre trying to take away from your studies. Do you want to write a thesis of your own? Do you simply want to take the required classes get sufficient grades and move on with your life?At my university we had to maintain a minimum of  creditssemester to remain fulltime students which was a requirement of my scholarships. So I knew I had to take a certain number of classes anyway so why not just take classes that counted toward a second degree? If your university has similar requirements it might make sense for you to pursue the History degree as well.  This answer also has it depends written all over it. Youll just need to prioritize what youre most interested in doinghow youd most like to spend your time. There will surely be times down the road when having a second bachelors will be beneficial and others when it doesnt matter in the least. Hope this helps. I tried to keep it short and sweet but I could legitimately talk about how my background in History has benefited me and particularly my legal studies for hours. So Im obviously biased but my unsolicited opinion is that you should go for it if youre really passionate about history. Itll help in more ways than you can imagine. Best of luck!,LawSchool,dfmschb,2,t5_2rb9g

I worked for TDS under an experienced Major and in the courtroom he ran circles around his inexperienced Trial Counsel opponent. It was very clear that the Major knew the rules of evidence well and the Captain did not. Frankly the Captain embarrassed himself in court by not mastering the MRE which are nearly identical to the FRE. I understand that your courtroom time varies by branch and that different branches have different assignments for junior JAGs. I can only speak to the Army because that is what I am familiar with. As a JA in your first term you will spend over a year as a Trial Counsel prosecuting cases in court. If you are going Army you are setting yourself up for failure by not mastering evidence. Sure you can learn it on your own outside of the classroom. And yes the JAG school does touch on the MRE and trial advocacy.

11672303,0,t3_66jzqe,Wellll that depends if Bs wife consents to him killing himself and she helps shed be charged with murder. But that has nothing to do with torts. She may be charged with a civil suit because she owed her husband a duty of care above the average person because of their spousal relationship. But if youre gonna cut out the consent part and youre gonna have Bs wife go after A she may be able to get wrongful death as a result of the accident and she could recover under that theory. But thats a stretch unless the fact pattern reveals that but for the accident B wouldnt have suffered psychological trauma that resulted in his death. ,LawSchool,dgj2ld0,3,t5_2rb9g

11744052,0,t3_67kp5e,Interpretation involves figuring out what the parties meant by the terms of their contract based on acceptable evidence. The parol evidence rule governs what we take to be acceptable evidence of the existence and meaning of a contract term. You can think of them as two hurdles on the way to winning a case about an alleged contract term which isnt explicitly present in your written contract. First you have to argue that you should be allowed to consider parol evidence of a prior agreement about that term. And second you have to argue that the evidence should be interpreted so as to make your client win the case.For example imagine we have a written contract which has a merger clause which says that the contract is the full final expression of the terms of our agreement. Now say that the contract says I will sell you  widgets in reasonable condition for widget. Come time for performance I only give you  widgets. You sue me. In court I argue that earlier we agreed that I would give  widgets only if you paid for the shipping costs in advance and you didnt so instead you get only . You argue that because that alleged term wasnt contained in the contract and the contract was the full final expression of the terms of our agreement that I shouldnt be allowed to rely on our past discussion as evidence of a term. The argument you just made is an application of the parol evidence rule.Here the parol evidence rule should clearly be applied because the parol evidence in question our alleged prior discussion would introduce a wholly new arguably material term in our contract. Jurisdictions differ on how strictly they will apply the parol evidence rule.So we know Ive failed to perform because Ive only shipped you  widgets. But suppose you also argue that the  you received werent in a reasonable condition and so you should get damages for the defective product. Here we have an issue of interpreting what reasonable condition means. And we might again face the parol evidence rule depending on what sources we look at to define what we meant by reasonable condition. For example what if the contract stipulated that reasonable condition meant X Y and Z? In that case the court probably wouldnt allow parol evidence like a prior conversation or negotiation which aims to prove that reasonable condition actually means A B and C.But what if the contract is completely silent on what is meant by reasonable condition? In this case the court might allow parol evidence of prior negotiation where we came to an understanding that reasonable condition meant A B and C even though we didnt end up including this in the contract. More likely though theyll just defer to the industry standard for a widgets condition without worrying about what we meant. But you get the idea.The point of the parol evidence rule is to incentivize parties to be completely clear with what theyre agreeing about to reduce ambiguity in contract interpretation thus making the courts job easier to reduce detrimental reliance by making terms of agreement clearer and to increase the predictability of what would happen in event of a breach and subsequent court proceedings.See also UCC ,LawSchool,dgr7v1m,11,t5_2rb9g

11752465,0,t1_dgs2h3j,I commute  minutes each way... It sucks.  Part of law school is a social aspect and living far away makes that more difficult.  I feel like Ive missed out on building relationships with other students that could be beneficial in the future.  The flip side is that I am not someone going out and partying every weekend which maybe helped me study I dont know.However academically it hasnt impacted me negatively.  It sucks waking up an hour earlier than you would otherwise have to to make it to class but if you think you are a person who wont decide to sleep through class or something its fine.   am classes will suck but after your first year you will have control of your class schedule so that is less of an issue.If you have specific questions happy to answer them.
