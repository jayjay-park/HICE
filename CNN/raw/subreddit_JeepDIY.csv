5584919,0,t1_cwpcym8,Thanks.  Going to start reworking it.  Id like to add drawers of some kind and lower the upper deck.  Too much of a PITA with the cooler inside the box.  Secure yes.  Functional not so much.,JeepDIY,cwpd084,1,t5_39s9h

I know what you mean the price for a hard top just seems so steep. I think a hard top is a great investment though great for winter and great if you need the extra security every now and then I was always worried about leaving things in my Jeep with the softtop on.I got a factory hardtop for my  Sport dr about a year ago for a steal on Craigslist . I hadnt searched for a hard top in a while and apparently this one had been online for weeks and they kept lowering the price. Why? They dropped it on its corner and a little bit of the fiberglass came off. It was so minor it was hilarious didnt compromise the structure or security of the Jeep and holds a tight seal water proof been through lots of rain and car washes. They even asked me if  was okay and while I probably could have got it for cheaper I wasnt going to take advantage of their already generous price.Only downside is I didnt get the wiring harness but I have never felt the need to use the rear defrost or wiper coming from a soft top it wasnt a concern anyway. I was about to buy one right off the bat but my buddy who has had a hard top for years says he has never used those features either. Glad I took his advice its  I think for the harness and the HVAC panel and it wouldnt be the most fun thing to install either.Id say if anything the most frustrating thing about scouring for a hard top was that  of the ones I came across were for Unlimited models.Anyhow good luck!,JeepDIY,dfnjxc6,1,t5_39s9h
