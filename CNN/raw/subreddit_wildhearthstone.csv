9839374,0,t1_dapslzj,Not really I dont think. I have two preps in my current list  Shadow Strikes SI really isnt good enough often enough nor is Thalnos but I dont think that counterfeit coin is a big enough bump to cut a card. It slows the deck down and doesnt do anything in its own right but its not as big a swing play as Prep can be.

10487543,0,t3_5q74sf,There are so many different reasons.For some people Wild is a place for casual fun offbeat decks. But for others it is the ultimate competition between the best possible decks in Hearthstone. For some like myself it is both at different times.In addition for me Wild is the format I play because there are some decks and cards I like to play that are only in Wild. I also like to play aggro shaman but I dont have time to climb both ladders so I play aggro shaman in Wild so I dont have to go back and play at rank  in Standard.Also crackle and ships cannon do give the decks slightly different feels shaman is more burnoriented and warrior is more explosive and combooriented.Also the meta is a little different in Wild. I like playing against a larger variety of opponents.,wildhearthstone,dcwvf3i,15,t5_3c9yt

11300541,0,t3_61a0oi,I am actually in the same boat as OP. Ive never hit legend and figured Id push a bit even though I dont have a lot of spare time. I was using Reno Priest all through Wild until I started getting into rank  or so. After hitting a wall at rank  I hit   days ago. Last night I was playing for about an hour and went  with different decks. Very frustrating so Im with you.

11317392,0,t3_61civo,I dont think so. However even if it is good at least its consistent like zoolock. But the deck seems to be too weak in the very early stages for me vs aggro and will get annihilated by board clears. Rapes druid I guess? Oh wait thats essentially zoos matchups.So It seems like well have two decks with very similar matchups being promoted this expansion. Will be interesting to see how warlock and hunter will be in primarily standard. In wild I still dont think zoo will be that good.,wildhearthstone,dfet3c4,2,t5_3c9yt
11354736,0,t3_613d22,Wow this deck is awesome thank you! I especially love when you are more aggressive than Pirate Warrior its sooo sweet!

11370075,0,t3_6299gu,The core cards you mentioned are certainly powerful. However I feel this strategy may be too slow. Also due to pirates pretty much every deck that can run cheap AoE is making sticking Recruits long enough for buffs difficult.,wildhearthstone,dfkryh8,2,t5_3c9yt

11480547,0,t3_63j7z4,You currently have more than half your deck as taunts. You definitely need a lot of taunts but Id consider cutting  to put in some good death rattles for Nzoth. I would at the very least cut the  mana drake for Ysera and Ornery Direhorn for Sylvanas this leaves a late game target for Curator and gives you a strong death rattle for Nzoth.

11554267,0,t3_64uxde,Yes. It got even better considering it has access to Primordial Drake now.In general the answer to the question Is this deck viable in Wild? is determined largely by how well the deck deals with pirates. Dragon Priest has lots of heals taunts and AoEs and thus deals with pirates well. Ergo it is viable in Wild.Also Drakonid Operative drives Reno decks nuts so it has that going for it as well.,wildhearthstone,dg5ohjm,1,t5_3c9yt

11568914,0,t1_dg6ztrx,How often does spores suck to play? These are all the options and you still get to pick  of  right?Seems like a decent percentage of the time it will be complete mana and card waste.  is good but for  mana? Stealth is almost always gonna be garbage because youd be doing it before you attack. Taunt could be useful in some situations. Although you typically want to taunt specific things to protect others.  HP I mean this is bad if you are running eggs that dont have taunt or already have soul of the forest on stuff. Poison is probably always a good pick. Divine shield probably better than  but again sucks for eggs. Untargetable seems good but then again most of your shit is dying to a board clear or trades anyways. windfury is probably pretty good most of the time especially if you got other buffers. and its GG if you got the roar however this is a turn  play unless you run inconsistent shit like innervate which slows your hoarde down. deathrattlle x s is probably the best pick but a lot of them will probably be counterfeited by limited board space. And finally  attack is just another copy of roar that cost  mana. remember your face doesnt get  damageTLDR most of this shit doesnt seem very good and if someone knows the percentages of times you get absolute uselessbad choices that would be good to know.So according to these odds and my analysis which is based on having  little minions on board You can get a semi OK pick more than  of the time a good pick like  of the time.However if  of them are almost always bad thats  chance of one or more bad one every time.,wildhearthstone,dg7cbk0,4,t5_3c9yt
11569463,0,t3_654h9s,I would say Wild gives the most to Warrior Priest and Druid. They get cards like Sludge Belcher and Dr. Boom.The next tier is Rogue Mage and Hunter. They get cards that work with their quest but have better options that are in standard.Lastly we have Shaman Paladin and Warlock. Other than Old Murk Eye for Shaman they dont get anything that works well with their quests.,wildhearthstone,dg7ek8h,5,t5_3c9yt
11580139,0,t1_dg7i3ns,In my experience its not good.  Its awesome after you solve the quest but requires you to do more durdling in your early turns.  At some point you have to play Gang Up on Patches and I cant pinpoint a time thats really to do that.  Turn  after playing Patches or cheating Patches into play?  Then wait to find another one?  Also stuffing your deck with things that harm your chances of finding pieces to solve the quest seems awful,wildhearthstone,dg8m5v6,1,t5_3c9yt

11668122,0,t1_dgi04k2,That was actually my original take on it in wild I felt Belcher would be incredibly strong. The truth is I took out nzoth and streamlined my deck to a much lower curve. I did this because vs aggro your win con is stabilizing and running them outta steam. Versus control you already have sulfuras and not many decks can deal with Ragnarosh for more than a few turns. When youre sure youre against aggro youre usually better mulling the quest in favor of stronger early defensive plays. Belcher is inferior in many ways to the other two taunt five drops available to warrior alley armorsmith and direhorn hatchling leaving not enough room for the belchers. I was convinced of this because every time I saw Belcher and one of the other  drops on the discover from stonehill defender I never selected belcher. TLDR started with a heavy nzoth list streamlined it and havent missed nzoth once there isnt a game he would have won me that DIE INSECT didnt already have in the bag and hes nearly a guaranteed dead card in any aggro match up,wildhearthstone,dgilib4,1,t5_3c9yt

11782741,0,t1_dgv7e6b,That you for the insight! I just came back this expansion so I never played MSOG Reno only the original Reno back before Molten Giants got nerfed.I tried out Elise earlier in the slot that I now use Loatheb due to facing so many priest. Lategame Elise is definitely quite valuable. However I found that she does not win you the game vs. Priest since the Priest can Shadow Visions gt Ungoro pack and tends to run more greedy cards such as Shifting Shade Crystalline Oracle while the Reno Lock has to run more antiaggro tech such as Tar Creeper Imp Gang Boss etc. When it came down to it Jaraxxus still decided if I won the Priest matchup or not so I removed Elise in favor of Loatheb which I found quite useful due to facing Freeze Mages Midrange Shamans with Bloodlust etc. It also provided the same body and vs. aggro at the very least prevented them from using UpgradeMortal Strike etc. I value the Priest matchup because I faced from what I remember  Jade Druids during my Legend climb. Priest was actually the most common control class I faced besides opposing Reno Locks. I can see where you said Reno Lock is favored against Reno Mage but I think it depends on the decklist. There was a high legend list running Rhonin to generate fireballs off Antoinidas which was quite genius in my opinion. However I actually won all my matchups vs. Reno Mage  on the ladder by doing exactly what you said I pressured them extremely hard and played less for value. Sadly Reno Mage has gotten better with Pyros and Reno Priest has gotten new value deathrattles such as Crystalline Oracle and cards like Shadow Vision while Reno Lock has gained little to nothing.Jaraxxus is actually still very useful in aggro matchups. Often I find that Reno Lock can eventually stabilize even without Reno Jackson just through pure AOE and antiaggro tech. However your life is often very low if you do manage to stabilize without Reno. Ive played Jaraxxus quite often vs. Egg Druid or Pirate Warriors and setting my life to  was actually extremely useful. Jaraxxus is more valuable than other cards such as Sylvanas Thaurissan in the Aggro matchup IMO despite costing more mana. Have you tried out the Faceless  Leeroy  PO version since you do not run Jaraxxus? Its extremely favored against Jaraxxus Reno Lock from my experience Ive been obliterated at  health by that combo every time. Im not a fan of Rag since I dislike leaving things to  RNG I love Elise RNG like you though but I plan on testing him sometime since I have a pretty golden one. ,wildhearthstone,dgvm1bt,1,t5_3c9yt
11804887,0,t3_68ed1h,I disagree with this. Pirate warrior is extremely beatable. Wild has no spotlight on it many decks are just untuned and greedy allowing tuned decks like pirate to overperform. There is a reason you see tuned standard lists be more successful in wild than in standard as far as win rates are concerned. Given more of a spotlight on wild leading to pirates being s glaringly strong as the ladder would suggest then I would agree with you. Another huge thing about ladder is that especially at the end of the season it HEAVILY rewards aggro just based on its structure. If i have a  wr with reno mage and you have a  wr with pirates you will go up more stars in a day than i will just because games are so much shorter. I dont think we should nerf decks that are popular choices because of the structure of competitive play. What i wish they would do is bring something like heroic tavern brawl as a permanent part of the game heavily rewarding win rates vs game speed would result in a drastically different meta,wildhearthstone,dgy4i4n,8,t5_3c9yt
