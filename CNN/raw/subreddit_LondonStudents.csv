You have to apply for a student Oyster card once youre enrolled in a university and they will mail it to you within a week.As you see it saves you  compared to the normal Oyster. If you live far from campus and you need to take public transport often the best is buying a weekly monthly or year pass depending on what you prefer year is slightly cheaper than month and month than day but the difference is less than a fiver in the end I personally do monthly tube pass for zones  and  which amounts to roughly  pounds per month. Price goes up the more zones you want. If you live somewhere well communicated with buses you can even buy the pass for only one zone or for zones  to whichever youre at and it will be significantly cheaper since buses dont take into account zones. The only problem then will be that you wont be able to take tubes outside of the zones you buy the pass for...For ex zones  monthly travel pass is . p cheaper than zones  monthly travel pass .. Zone  only is . monthly pass. Which saves you quite a bit.Of course tubes come more often than buses plus no traffic shenanigans etc. etc.Up to you! ,LondonStudents,cmj5aww,2,t5_2stxl
