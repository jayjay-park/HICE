3658193,0,t3_329wjs,Hi longtime HM and RF player here.Ive gone back and forth between the two series honestly and theres several reasons for it.I started RF when it first came out to NA after playing HM games for a couple years before. And let me say it was not a stepup. To compare these two games is to compare a bike to a car. Yes they are both means of transportation but they are not even alike other than the sense that they have wheels.RF and HM arent the same. They have the same underlying element of farming but RF is heavily based into the plot and not so much the farming. The farming aspect of RF for example is really fastpaced as most of the game itself focuses on fighting monsters.In SoS however your only option here really is farming and maintainingbuilding relationships with the people around you. Thats it. Thats what the game is about  its a life simulator not a fantasy simulator.In RF everything is designed so it goes by fast. Easy item pickup fast teleports across maps easytogain friend points and so on. This is because these are the minor elements of the game.What would be the point if in SoS it was super easy to befriend everyone see all of their cutscenes and have everything you could ever want in such a short time? It isnt fun that way. Much like life you have to work for what you want.In RF you work for what you want but in a different way. Youre set there on a predetermined route finding your past and saving the town. In SoS what you do is really up to you as there isnt much of a storyline.I have never have difficulty getting into HM again. If anything I felt like the farming part of RF was really disappointing  growing crops with such ease even early on was really boring.Saying I have trouble getting into HM games SoS after playing RF is like saying I have trouble getting into any turn based rpg after playing Pokemon. Basing experiences upon other games is not good. You will find yourself getting bored.tldr ... the two games shouldnt be compared really as one is an action based game with some few farming elements and the other is a life simulation game heavily based on farming elements.,storyofseasons,cq99cnb,8,t5_35m3k

The stamina thing really got to me at the beginning because I had to clear the land a bit before I could actually start planting or setting down the Seed Maker and all and it was frustrating. I find that if you upgrade your tools as soon as you can it helps with the stamina. And food can give you a bit of boost too once you have the Kitchen. I just hit Winter but have already unlocked the fourth vendor. I guess my playing style is a lot slower too so I still only have one cow and one sheep but thats enough for me at the moment. They both give me multiple products so its kind of like having more than one anyway haha! For me the first year is always focused on getting rankings up befriending everyone a little and saving money. Year  onwards is when I really pick up speed XDI usually also settle on a couple of crops or specialize I prefer to farm tea and wine. That way I can start with a small batch of low ranking seedlings and never have to buy new seeds and all Ill just make seeds from the earlier batch Hence the Seed Maker! And then I go diving for junk fish and reset until the vendors pay more for the things that I do have so I get more money. PTLDR though hang in there!

8141685,0,t3_4qr5ad,Losing the events doesnt hurt anything most times you get a reward friendship points rival points etc. even if you lose. So Id advice against skipping those. As for the horse once I got a good money stream going I started buying carrots from Otmar and using the fast travel a lot but I still rarely hop on its back. Thats just personal preference I guess. For the rival fields a good trick is to plant a couple of grass plots and harvest them every day. Then enter the competition on total number of items shipped once you have that option unlocked. Shipping the fodder will net nearly no profit but you can easily ship enough of it to win the event. If you are unsure how much to ship just ship it close to  and save go into the guild to see how you did and reload if unsuccessful. EDIT a number of people have reported that the game felt a bit slow to start but for most it picks up around autumn year  at which point youll be wishing there was more time in a day. ,storyofseasons,d4v9824,9,t5_35m3k

11552325,0,t3_64mm6c,I really dont like that site. Right off the bat we see a misleading image of Fantasy Life Online on the Switch even though its a mobile only game. They also take an extremely vague response from XSEED that mentioned nothing about SoS and create a clickbait title about it.,storyofseasons,dg5gjwk,2,t5_35m3k
11581475,0,t1_dg882r0,Maybe a villager in the event has to be at a certain friendship level? Im not sure what the event entails but some heart events require certain villagers to be at a higher friendship level. But if you already have max hearts with her Im assuming you have high friendship with the others as well...  Sorry Im no help lol,storyofseasons,dg8rme9,1,t5_35m3k

11783158,0,t3_684jo6,XSEED nailed the native Hawaiian dialogue sprinkle but I think Lulukoko suffers overall for being generically PolynesianSouth East AsianPacific Islands rather than being a town more directly influenced by a single country. I would have totally been into them giving us a whole town of NadiAmirSanjayOliviaHaulaniTigre town ala India rather than trying to force so many ideals into one area.Some of the additional sloppiness in the programming like the dialogue boxes messing up or Ludus crashing the Lulu Beverage Bash sure doesnt help either.,storyofseasons,dgvnqob,11,t5_35m3k
