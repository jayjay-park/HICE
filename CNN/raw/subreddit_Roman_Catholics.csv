7762969,0,t1_d3oetcl,Let me put it another way.  I think that there are two common and erronenous ways of thinking about Vatican II and other instances of Church teaching and change.  To avoid them one need to recognize thati. Church teaching never appears ex nihilo.  This is the danger of the socalled hermeneutic of rupture. ii. Church teaching need not remain and arguably never remains a static calcified repetition of past formulations.  This is the danger of the socalled hermeneutic of continuity. For my money I think the best way to talk about doctrine and change in the Church is the hermeneutic of reform.  Vatican II exists in continuity and discontinuity with various elements of the Churchs past but neither the continuous nor discontinuous elements should be understood in such a way that they collapse into either of the two errors mentioned above.  For example papal primacy was indeed reaffirmed at Vatican II but it wasnt simply Vatican I redux since it was articulated within a framework that was shaped by the notion of collegiality.  On the flipside Dignitatis Humanae stands in marked contrast to statements articulated just a century earlier in the Syllabus of Errors e.g. compare DH n.  with Syllabus n.  but the authors of DH consciously grounded it in earlier Church teaching in human dignity and the freedom of faith  it was new different and discontinuous but not doctrine ex nihilo. ,Roman_Catholics,d3ol7nv,1,t5_3ag72
