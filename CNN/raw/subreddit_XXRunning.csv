8811292,0,t3_50tr2w,The Apple earbuds stay in my ears as long as its not super windy and I use a belt for my phone. There are headphones that wrap around the ears which sounds like you need since your earbuds fall out. I used to have a cheap pair I got from Walmart that worked just fine for running. I also have a couple pairs of spandex shortspants that have a large pocket on the side so occasionally Ill put my phone in the pocket and run without a belt. Safety tip run with only one earbud in so you can hear your surroundings. I usually just tuck the other side into my sports bra strap to keep it from bouncing around.,XXRunning,d76zxad,1,t5_3ft56

Look some videos up on YouTube and buy a residence band monster walks squats ECT Also just pay really close attention to your form and slow down so you can focus on putting your legfoot forward instead of to the middle. ,XXRunning,d7b0he4,1,t5_3ft56

9058298,0,t1_d7zbcjs,Not OP but Ive used these and they work great. They do take getting used to at first..you might feel a little unstable but you adjust. Just make sure you are still running with caution especially in really slick ice because theyre not completely foolproof.,XXRunning,d80nujw,3,t5_3ft56
9072802,0,t3_54jm16,Im single. My friends are getting married and having kids and Im over here all on my lonesome. Went on a date with a guy to an exhibition. Rembrandt. My absolute favourite. So the guy tried to really patronisingly tell me that no one had heard of Rembrandt that he wasnt that famous. Not top  painters famous. I thought he was joking at first. But no. Hed never heard of the Night Watch and when I said the name he kept saying Game of Thrones? No dude Im talking about painting. Anyway he was really tired and I think he was hungover but he insists hes only had one hangover ever in his life which strikes me as completely and utterly ridiculous but why would he lie? and the painting thing its not a big deal. Not a deal breaker at all we talked about loads of other stuff and had a laugh. But I think he might be really boring? And I dont think Im attracted to him in the slightest? And I kinda dont want to see him again? On another note I ran km this weekend. Two long runs two days running because the weather is so beautiful and Im loving the audiobook Im listening to. So Ive got that going for me which is nice. ,XXRunning,d82ejhf,21,t5_3ft56

9561953,0,t3_5bsevz,Today was one of the best running days Ive had since jumping back in to running in July. My breathing was serene and my legs could have gone for another  miles today was only .miles in my training. Not my quickest time but overall I felt amazing.

I also run with at least one piece of reflectivebrightly colored article of clothing for roadcar safety.

10038915,0,t3_5jf5sr,If you liked the other shoes and had no problems with them then I would go back to those! I have a neutral gait or whatever so I have a good amount of options for shoes. I used to run in Mizuno Wave Riders but I ended up trying out brooks launch s for walking and for wearing to work. I loved them so much I started running in them. They have a lower drop than the Wave Riders and that took a little getting used to. Even still I notice that my calves and shins get sore if I do too much. Maybe that means they arent right for me but I havent been running enough to get a good feel yet. ,XXRunning,dbg3hzu,5,t5_3ft56

10464330,0,t3_5pvcay,Blisters are caused by friction so either your foot moving in your sock or your foot moving in your shoe. I find that if a shoe felt tight its usually the socks fault and if it felt loose its the shoe or how I tied it. If you can identify specific pressure points like with shoes that havent broken in moleskin or Vaseline will help cut down the friction. Wicking socks can help keep moisture down which keeps friction down too. ,XXRunning,dcu8l2x,5,t5_3ft56
10472706,0,t3_5pvcay,I used to get blisters often. I went up a full size in running sneakers and that solved it for me I was wearing sneakers that were a half size bigger than my usual size. ,XXRunning,dcv6tkh,1,t5_3ft56

11249947,0,t3_60jlyw,Your setup sounds almost exactly like mine for my first marathon last year so I can tell you its definitely possible! I finished in hrmin running the whole race at about an  minmi pace. While I hurt ALL OVER when I finished I had a good time running the race  I used a plan very similar to that Higdon plan.That said I would maybe think hard before committing to it. I found it pretty stressful to train for since I lacked confidence in my running abilities. While I enjoyed the race itself I got in my own head too much while training which was Not Fun.I think I would have had a better experience if I had spent more time working on the shorter distances. Im now working on my k and k PRs and have really been enjoying it. I ran a  k a few weeks ago DHope that helps! Good luck with your running goals whatever you decide!,XXRunning,df75ya6,3,t5_3ft56
