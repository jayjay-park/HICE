3512815,0,t1_cppa3up,Wanted to add even though this post  days old  if your foot is connecting with much force on a roundhouse kick its too shallow of a kick. The best roundhouse will connect with the upper half of your shin. Obviously that isnt always going to happen.,HereComesTheBoom,cpsop4d,1,t5_32jen

6379238,0,t3_430z59,That was beautiful. Football is a violent game by nature but thats why the players get paid millions. The new helmet to helmet hitting rules woukd probably deem that illegal but those rules that they are implementing are completely illegitimate and heres why A DEFENDER CANNOT CONTROL WHAT LEVEL THE BALL CARRIER WILL ADJUST TO WHEN HE BRACES FOR THE HIT andor THE DEFENDER CANNOT STOP HIMSELF IF HE IS PROPERLY POSITIONED TO MAKE THE PLAY IF THE BALLCARRIER OR RECIEVER IS ALREADY ON A COLLISION COURSE DEFENSELESS OR NOT YOU CANNOT CONTROL THAT. I get that people dont want to have brain damage but guess what ? These players are living like rockstars getting paid millions and that is he price of violence. GOD DAMNIT  sorry for swearing i just hate seeing the game i love get ruined by this bullshit. ,HereComesTheBoom,czer1f4,-1,t5_32jen
