104710,0,t1_ceq3bu4,Indeed I also loved Maxine as a character and as a stand in for me as the reader. Anyone who thinks his characters are so one dimensional... must be reading a different book than I am. I can maaaaaaaaaybe see that criticism with a few characters in Against the Day just because there are so many characters there that a few inevitably get lost in the shuffle but Ive always found that even Pynchons minor characters often have extensive backstoriesmotivations etc. As you said in your other comment we seem to be reading different books than the critics.,SRSBooks,ceqcpdh,1,t5_2tilk
