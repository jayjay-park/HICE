1417383,0,t3_2ad6co,Have you tried to reverse compliment the  prime end then do a blast search for each primer against the target organism? I have been part of a similar solution which was used to validate primers against false positives. Using something like I mentioned we were able to get the region in between the primers and check for its uniqueness. Also primerblast might fit this perfect ,molecularbiology,city4dz,3,t5_2s5s7

11133985,0,t3_5yyup3,I cant really comment on this because after undergrad I had a hard time finding a job in industry but I just wanted to give some advice. Get into a lab during your undergrad and learn how to code in python or R. My issue was that I didnt get any extra lab experience outside of required labs for classes because my schools molecular bio prof went on sabbatical after maternity leave and she finished a project right before she left so no one was running her lab. Micro was full and nothing else available felt relative so I didnt bother. Big mistake. I also had trouble finding a position without my CLSC which I couldnt get because my school didnt offer the right classes. ,molecularbiology,deu0yyi,5,t5_2s5s7
