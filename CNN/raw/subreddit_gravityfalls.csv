Its not as good as Gravity Falls but the whole show is eye candy. That background art is stunning as an artist Im jealous the background music is video gameesque and the character design is pretty cool too!

1613477,0,t3_2cs6kq,None of your points are actual reasons why McGucket couldnt be the author though. Youre just choosing to interpret things in a certain way and saying it disproves the theory. Im not saying youre not allowed to think that Im just saying those are very weak counterpoints. OLDMANMCGKNOWS well you really think they would spell out exactly who the author is if they were trying to hint at it? It makes sense that they would be ambiguous about it its not definite proof that McGucket is the author but it does emphasize that theres more to him than meets the eye. As for the leaked image you dont know its fake and you dont know its a red herring. Your guess is as good as anyone elses nothing is confirmed OR disconfirmed though Alexs reaction to it was suspicious. As for the last point you dont know that. Maybe there is a legitimate reason why looking for the author would be dangerous even if its McGucket. Nothing implied that the author himself is dangerous just that Dipper digging deeper into this conspiracy stuff to find out the truth could put him in a dangerous situation maybe because of Bill maybe because of the government maybe because of those shady Blindeye cultists that we saw in trailers trying to cover up the truth,gravityfalls,cjijng2,17,t5_2udb8

1633608,0,t3_2d0cd1,I dont think it should. Let it go out while its on top dont drag it out longer than it has to especially if the stories and plot get weaker and weaker which tends to happen in almost every show that goes past a certain point. Its not like The Simpsons where everything resets at the end of the episode if theres a set beginningmiddleend from the getgo then the show would be better off sticking to that than deviating and either dragging out the end or going past the end point like if Breaking Bad went on for like six more seasons before Felina Vince Gilligan probably couldve if he wanted to but he knew when to bow out conversely How I Met Your Mother dragged on and a bunch of people started saying it was taking too long.However if it were to go past the current story my probably super unpopular idea would be to have a timeskip. Theyve established its a show that changes so make it change in a big way. Two three years go by and the Mystery Shack has expanded now funds a camp what kid wouldnt love to go to a camp in a haunted town?. Have newer kids come in with Dipper Mabel Soos and Wendy as counselors. Maybe even mix it and have creatures be campers too. Go from there.,gravityfalls,cjl2xrc,0,t5_2udb8

Take the Big Gideon for example. Huge ass explosion that exploded the entire downtown area!!! HEHAHAHAHEHAHAHA. But I think were all missing something big here. this photo is littered all throughout the show. Which obviously suggests time travel is involved. Not to mention Mabels apparent man of her dreams is Stan. Perhaps she meets a younger Stan? Also Grunkle Stan and Old Man McGucket are the only two characters with the same  freckles on their noses. Coincidence? Maybe theyre related? Im  and have greatgreat uncles who are still alive so its totally possible considering Mabel and Dipper are only ,gravityfalls,cjm0y2d,2,t5_2udb8

Rebecca Sugar the person who made the show wrote songs for Adventure Time. The good ones three links And it shows one link The Steven Universe crew is pretty open they have a production blog and all of the shows amazing background music is on the composers Soundcloud Ronaldo the guy whos actually looking into the paranormal happenings in Beach City has a blog called Keep Beach City Weird.

2986697,0,t1_co7jmjx,I always felt like Korra was far less consistent with quality than a show like Gravity falls though that is just my opinion on the matter. This past season of GF has been excellent in almost every aspect of the show and I think its what has really pushed GF towards this victory. I mean Over the Garden Wall was interesting and certainly high quality but I do believe it was aimed at a more mature audience same with Adventure Time especially as it gets darker with each passing season and Korra got pretty mature as it progressed so I wouldnt be surprised if that had something to do with it.Also I think at least in the case of Adventure Time some of the more experimental aspects of some episodes might be more of a hit or a miss for some people. Like the Food Chain episode was one of my favorites but I see how it would weird out some people which is something that Gravity Falls does not do on as much of a grand scale as Adventure Time does. The weirdness is there but isnt concentrated into a  minute block rather sprinkled through the season in a way that helps provide a little surreal humour to the show.All in all I really just think GF has shown the most consistency in quality and tone compared to the other shows.,gravityfalls,co7kh0i,10,t5_2udb8
3005794,0,t1_co9csuy,True but Im referring to the Candy scene too...In the stills I noticed Tambry and Robbie at one of the other tables in the ball room.  I wonder if the other teens will be there...hint hint....,gravityfalls,co9jr5q,1,t5_2udb8

3049051,0,t3_2v1wkb,First of all yes  being their great uncle he has a sibling.Thats how being an uncle works.Ahem.Second there is no clue as to how many siblings he has or what gender  he might have a sister he might have a male twin and another brother etc etc. So yes the family name was most likely given down by a male sibling but there is no information about him or any others. You cant just assume Dippers father became an orphan especially since that would mean he lived with his father when he was doing his research in Gravity Falls OR that he didnt live with him anyhow. He couldve been raised by a pack of wolves for all we know. And thats assuming his father was the author anyhow.Third Dipper and Mabel would never tell their parents anything about what happens to them in GF. Dipper wouldnt risk it Mabel always does wacky things and isnt such a credible source and being  years old doesnt mean theyre bloody stupid  I doubt they just write stuff down without thinking about the consequences.Long story short  you have far too little information for this to be a credible theory. Even the idea of Dippers parents having been in Gravity Falls ONCE could carry huge implications. Stan was in Columbian jail and traveled selling vacuums while he was young  kind of gets in the way of raising a kid. Its not that you didnt think it through its just that there is not enough data to make such an assumption. Yeah their grandfather isnt mentioned  and to be honest neither are their parents. ,gravityfalls,coe16up,0,t5_2udb8

3930050,0,t1_cr48yz3,...youre going really far out of your way to pick apart my words just to try and prove the brother was around and cowrote the books. Theres been no evidence of the Grunk ever being in Gravity Falls prior to  years ago. There is plenty of evidence of him living in Gravity Falls AFTER  years ago. It was highly plausible him and his brother didnt live near each other for many years they lived very different adult lives. This has been shown multiple times throughout the episodes and in the shows canon. At this point its more likely that Fiddleford had more influence in the content of the journals than Stan did he actually knew about the journals and was helping with the Authors research. A brother however was never mentioned. Not only that but Fids himself states in the conspiracy corner how Stan is downright duplicitous and I swear I saw someone like him around here before. If they were both in town at the same time for an extended period of time say more than a year that would be an odd thing for Fids to say especially because he would have known both of the boys at the same time if they lived in the same Shack. You know where all the research and all the science was happening so Fids was probably there a lot to help the Author and his research. But I mean who knows maybe somehow Stan lived under the same roof for more than a year and didnt know what was going on. But also wrote the in journals at the same time. But didnt know the hiding places even though its written in one of the journals... wait what?Sorry you can believe what you want to believe I wont stop you but I do think the Stan we know as Grunkle came to Gravity Falls  years ago because he couldnt mind his own business. He had to see what happened to his brother. And he stuck around trying to find a way to save him. ,gravityfalls,cr49fa6,0,t5_2udb8

4037447,0,t1_crfcoj8,Hence how the post itself opens with a comment about the idea of it being the perfect cameo and OPs comment below mentioning this with additional proof that it could be a cameo role with the bit about being credited with the Gobblewonker.Your point is  valid and is the most likely scenario but I cant help but see it as a counter to to an argument nobodys making aside from the confirmed posters who may very well be doing it tongueincheek.I understand the value in saying so somewhere like here on reddit where people are generally a little too quick to bandwagon on some really unsupported and frankly ridiculous theories but this heres been posted only as an observation and I fear that the attitude of healthy skepticism that people adopt when reading through posts like OPs here is on the edge of being downright contrarian for the sake of it ending up doing more to discourage those who are still motivated to find new things than it will for finding places in which these things could fit. Thanks again for that hiatus Disney.Im not trying to make this any kind of personal just as a side note I think its the ideal cameo role and quite probably means less than even that thanks to the expanse of his work with Disney. Its just that seeing as thats my post OPs capped here I just wanted to share my view and ensure people arent jumping to any silly conclusions. Non essential backstory the Gravity Falls generals have been banned on co so the mods only really allow us to have threads occasionally to discuss lore and for that to happen it has to be clear to the mods that weve brought at least some new material to ensure the thread wont fall victim to the usual shitposting hence the tone of the capped posts here. I was quite excited to share with the gfg anons this new discovery seeing as it would allow us to talk mysteries without fear of bans for a little while.,gravityfalls,crghzv4,1,t5_2udb8

4060803,0,t3_3720f3,Hey man you are way better at formatting than I am and I joined this sub almost a year ago. Yeah pretty much the majority of the wheel has confirmed which characters are which symbol. However the three symbols that are most debated are the Ice Bag the Glasses and the Hand. The Hand seems to be a clear representation of the Author but there are some who think otherwise. There are also those who think that The Author is alsoonly the Glasses. The contenders for the Ice Bag are Wendy Blendin Blandin and a small minority on this one I believe The Shapeshifter. In my personal opinion I believe the Author is the Hand McGucket is the Glasses and Wendy is the Ice. I believe McGucket is the Glasses because A he is an important character and B because he wears glasses. Even though they arent the same as the ones on the wheel glasses are still an identifiable accessory of McGuckets in recent episodes much like Dippers hat or Mabels sweater. Most of my support as Wendy for Ice Bag is because she is a main character so I just feel like she has to be important. However you are free to speculate as you will.

4359122,0,t3_3axnec,Oh my gosh I love when new fans come here and are all excited about the show. Makes me happy  welcome aboard!The codes are figured out look at the links in others posts. Notice the codes at the end of episodes the codes hidden throughout the show and that at the end of the theme song there is some gibberish that sounds like whispers played backwards this tells you how to solve the code for example some early episodes say three letters backThe codes arent important to understanding the plot and the casual viewer can ignore them and will still get whats going on but serious viewers like all the tinfoilhat Ronaldos of the fanbase who come up with wild theories  basically everyone on this subreddit like to notice foreshadowing and hints at things example one code read THE HANDYMAN KNOWS MORE THAN YOU THINK which suggests a a lot about Soos.Watch the shorts. Here is a background story in case you havent heard Gravity Falls fans bitching about this yet we had a one year break between Season  and Season  and it was torture and all we had were these shorts released every few months. They arent much and dont advance the plot very much either but it was all we had so thats why most Gravity Falls fans have seen them. They are good and funny and you should watch them if only to get when people reference them bring them into fan theories or whatever.Did McGucket write the journals? I think its pretty clear that he didnt... But just to verify you have indeed seen all the Season  episodes out so far? Up to and including Not What He Seems? The author is stated in that episode soooo if you arent sure who it is maybe you skipped an episode or two?Yes  a large number of the fanbase misses WendyDipper and also hates that Wendy hasnt been very important to the plot in the late half a dozen episodes or so but many ship Pacifica Dipper after Northwest Mansion Mystery so bewarb. We use the illuminati confirmed joke often Ok reading over the questions Im a little concerned that you might have skipped the last episode and maybe others. Double check that youve seen all of them before browsing the sub ok?But we are happy to have new fans join the subreddit ,gravityfalls,csh08it,3,t5_2udb8

So you dont have to buy a cable subscription to watch it legally. Hell even if you dont want to buy every episode you could at least buy a few of them. Theyre only like  bucks each.

4539410,0,t1_ct2nk0i,Im hoping that the fact Dipper and Mabel came back and apologized after pursuing Gobblewonker weirdness is also future foreshadowing of a happy ending for both of them too.I think what really gets me though is that this whole time it is so easy to interpret Stan as being so selfish but not only did he pretty much dedicate his entire adult life to bringing his brother back not that abandoning his identity was hard in the first place but in a way I think he kind of rescued his brother from more than just the portal. It really bugged me in the episode that Pines senior was more upset that Stanley ruined Stanfords future college dreams... because it would have made him a ton of money and been our ticket out of here  essentially using Stanford for his smarts much like Stanley had been doing up until that point. Of course is it better to be used by your family as a source of income? Or better to be sucked into a portal for  years?sorry went down a tangent there,gravityfalls,ct2tlw2,27,t5_2udb8

In the final episode of Season  someone is gonna be holding on to her hair and shes gonna have to cut it to escape revealing a more independent and grown Mabel. Wait...So this might either be me really searching too hard or could be something crazy to look back on. The Ducktective show was obviously meant to be similar to Gravity Falls as a joke such as the twins the mysteries etc. In the show the recently revealed twin brother puts the other brother in the hospital and attempts to kill him. Do you think Ford is gonna attempt to kill Stanley? Maybe Bill Cipher possesses Stanford after they make a deal Possibly to get rid of the inter dimensional drift! and then Bill tries to kill Stan. Woah?Dipper then follows with Ford being recently close with him and ends up being brainwashed to join the evil side.Dipper is grabbing Mabel by the hair and they are fighting when Mabel cuts the hair off the hair that Dipper was holding on to.This is symbolism for Mabel cutting off the part of her Dipper had.

Stanley is the only person he has to turn to.gtHis entire future was destroyed by StanleyDespite going to a less than desirable school Ford did very well for himself. He himself described the grant he had received as enormous. After receiving his bachelors at Backupsmore he probably could have re applied to West Coast Tech as well as some other prestigious schools after being too overconfident last time. Instead he decided to stay at Backupsmore and get his PhD there. After that he began his career in researching anomalies during which he seems to be greatly enjoying himself. Stanleys only mistake was not telling Ford what had happened the night that he accidentally broke the machine. After ten years being successful and doing what he loved he still has not let go of what Stanley did to him.,gravityfalls,cuk3g5t,1,t5_2udb8

And I actually cosplay Finn so for me to cosplay a show and have two other shows that I hold over that that means I hold them both in high regard.  But in my heart of hearts Im a total weeaboo. So Steven Universe is like the spiritual successor to so many great animes and a love letter to Magical Girl Anime in general and I cant ignore how much I love that about it.

Of course this is false. A right angle triangle with two lengths of  has a hypotenuse of length square root of  a number that cannot be represented as a proportion of  integers. As well he also thought that he made a deal with a god. Who do we know that is godlike and enjoys making deals? Obviously its Bill in the context of the show.

The question of rampm being more or less offensive than sp is more relative to what upsets you both shows have different types of comedy and if existentialism bothers someone thats okay but they probably shouldnt watch rick and morty and if someone puts their political opinions in high regards they probably shouldnt watch south park whats goes for what person is way to much of a personal thing for me to be able to properly generalize. ,gravityfalls,cvchke9,1,t5_2udb8

Stanford spent  years on the other side of the portal and nothing was interesting enough to even mention? Gideon is still a factor. Time travel is a possibility  maybe they need to set some things straight so the future comes out right or stop something from happening to change the present to a better one. The mindscape could take up an episode or two  maybe they have to get Bill out of Gideons mind. I mean they could time travel for months and come back on the same day so thats not an issue.

Honestly if anyones going to dieFord seems like the most likely option. I know that hes a new character and Stanley spending  years trying to get him back only for him to be killed would be worthless and allbut if Ford were to bite the dust things would wrap up more nicely. Stanley could keep the shackthere wouldnt be the confusion of explaining to everyone fords existenceand they wouldnt have to trade identitys againand dipper and Mabel would have to stay together and go home at the end of the summer. After allAlex DID say the twins would be leaving gravity falls at the end of summer. But I still think its fishy that we havent seen stans eyes on the end cardsand all the burning stans are quite ominous.i dont really think anyone will diebut if someone does Ford seems most likely...I just hope Stanley doesnt die.,gravityfalls,cw5tb6j,1,t5_2udb8

5735398,0,t3_3torf3,Im more interested in the why. Hirsch implied in an interview or two I cant find right now that part of his choice for speeding up the series was the fact that viewers already guessed the big twist that Stans twin brother was the Author.It could have also been that three seasons would have taken a major toll on him. He mentioned how difficult it was to make season one so maybe he decided to shorten the series to lighten the workload so to speak.Regardless it seems like having season two stated as the final season allowed Hirsch to be bold and request a lot of gory stuff. So maybe the darker tone like the Bloody Animal Scene in Northwest Manor Mystery and adult jokes like the fairy cop scene in The Last Mabelcorn might have not been pitchedapproved otherwise.,gravityfalls,cx816d1,1,t5_2udb8

5760886,0,t3_3u1wnu,I trust Hirsch and crew enough to have made it so the series ends on a note higher than even Not What He Seems achieved. GF is Hirschs baby and although he had to end it sooner than he originally planned Im sure he and the rest of the team made damn well sure that the finale will be one of the best  if not the best  episode in the series. That string of nights he spent staying up all night in the studio and tweeted about it on Twitter a few months ago? That was probably him putting the final touches on the finale. The guy and the team worked their asses off for GF and judging by the consistent quality it has achieved over these past few years it shows.However we also cant get our hopes impossibly high or else well have a Mass Effect on our hands. There probably was a lot of material they had to cut out in order to bring the length down to two seasons in which case there are some thingsquestions that will be left unansweredvagueunexplored things like Blind Ivans past where Ford waswhat he did those thirty years he was gone and the whole Royal Order of the Holy Mackerel thing that was brought up in Dipper and Mabels Guide. Some of these may be covered in the real Journal  they release next year though.I personally still feel that it wouldve been fine had they extended the series into a third season and kept Fords reveal til the end of season two but at the same time I understandappreciate that Hirsch is ending it where he feels best. And even if we dont necessarily like what may happennot happen we also need to understand that  like I said before  the team slaved over this series and especially over this finale. It will be good even if the story doesnt go the way some of us might want it to.,gravityfalls,cxb6wls,3,t5_2udb8

5911614,0,t3_3w9w0v,Ive got a similar thought on the Pines twins reactions to others and their level of caring towards everyone else.As weve seen recently Stan is the person who will literally do anything for his family... even if it means assuming his brothers identity and life leading tourists around his home for  years and causing the possibility of an apocalypse he will do it just to see his brother again. He will leap onto a pterodactyl and punch it in the face just to make his niece happy. And he will leave his important research down in the basement just to save Dipper and Mabel from zombies. But as for everybody else damn the consequences. He wanted to throw the pig under the bus just to save his own skin. He scams money out of tourists just to keep himself afloat. He will do anything for the people he cares about and nothing for those he doesnt.On the other end of the spectrum is Ford. Ford would do whats best for everyone even at a cost to himself or his family. Ford wanted Dipper to stop the apocalypse even if it meant getting himself taken away to some intergalactic prison. Ford gave Dipper the journals even though it meant putting himself at Bills mercy. Ford wanted to continue his research that admittedly would help all mankind even though it meant splitting up Dipper and Mabel.Next I get to Dipper. Like Stan Dipper sees everyone as a friend or an enemy. If he labels you a friend he will do anything for you and will love you forever. If he labels you an enemy he wont give you the time of day and will do anything in his power to take you down a peg. To Dipper Mabel is a friend. I dont need to tell you how many times he sacrificed for her. Stan Soos Wendy and Ford are also friends. Dipper couldnt let Ford go with the prison droid even if it meant not saving the universe. Dipper doesnt easily let his enemies become friends but as weve seen with Pacifica it can happen. On the other hand if a friend betrays him he will add them to his enemies list faster than you can say Grunkle Stan... I trust you.And finally we get to Mabel. Mabel loves people and she loves all people regardless of who they are. Again I point to Pacifica. She was officially Mabels rival but for much of season  and A it felt like Dipper hated her more than Mabel did. Dipper considers the enemy of his friend to be his enemy. Mabel considers her enemies to be people she needs to make friends with. Mabel does not hold grudges. If she sees that you need help she will help you no matter who you are.,gravityfalls,cxujmyv,21,t5_2udb8

6001523,0,t3_3xnyce,Oh boy. This is going to take a while. This episode kept me occupied for hours on end just combing through for all the references callbacks and hints it had to offer. This one was jampacked even more so than most GF episodes. I guess they had to do that because obviously we would be devouring everything we got insanely quickly because we had already discovered everything we could about the first season by that point.Ill start with the portal scene the continuation that had been looked forward to for a YEAR. Oh did it deliver. I think Alex had realized by this point how clever his audience was so he started playing mind games with us to see if he could outsmart us. This is why Stans language in this scene was so vague and nondescript  if it was any more specific we would have all believed the portal was searching for Stans brother theory.Now I did have to go back afterwards and watch Dreamscaperers through The Golf War nonstop just to get a feel for the flow of the episodes. That portal scene especially I just had to get back up to speed. The continuity of these episodes had to be really well done or else fans would forget what was going on. Luckily it WAS. The events of the season  finale may have been old news to us but they were still fresh in the characters minds.Now lets switch gears and talk about Powers and Trigger. As straight men they are not funny on their own. I didnt even find them that funny when playing off of Stan. I think the biggest reason they are liked is because they relate to the plot. Well in case this is the first review of mine youve read I do not judge an episode based on its relevance to the plot but its strength in storytelling. On an unrelated topic Ive never liked the government or arbitrary rules that make no sense. Only now do I realize why the government agents thought the portal was a doomsday device.Now the party. I think this was a great way to reintroduce us to all our favorite characters while at the same time keeping with the continuity of the show. Season A in general went indepth with a lot of the townsfolk and this was a great way to start it off. Plus it allowed the writers to throw in so many references to previous episodes that I actually had to pause every few seconds just to catch them all. Now that I think about it the party is a mirror of the show itself it started out as mostly fun and games but then it quickly turned dark and threatening. At the end only together was the Pines family able to defeat the supernatural creatures planning their doom.Speaking of the creatures zombies was just one of the many excellent callbacks this time to the first episode. Honestly I cant figure out why one of those creatures would be mistaken for a teenager but whatever. kp khj hqlhv! mc pph zlc e bdxrlp bkh ksijlhd lke wr Rip qqwz xdm ixdi xwa. dxsjo wkpwa lxgpw eu olvi w ohqtyo! Although Zombie Soos could almost be mistaken for normal Soos if he didnt have an insatiable desire to eat Dipper and Mabels brains. Speaking of Zombie Soos he was perfectly done! I was laughing so hard that somebody looked at me funny I was watching this online after the fact. I usually dont laugh at all at TV shows. Mainly because the jokes on most TV shows arent funny.Tking Over Midnight. Easily one of the two funniest songs in Gravity Falls history the other being The Stan Wrong Song. Its the only thing in this episode that I laughed harder at than Zombie Soos. I must have given the video at least  views. I dont think I need to elaborate further.And that ending. It was painfully obvious that Dipper and Stan both had more secrets to hideseek out. Not that we didnt know that already and I think thats what made it work. I think we all foresaw the trust issues that would plague the Pines family once the secrets of Stans portal were out. We were meant to foresee this. And we were meant to believe that Dipper would harbor ill feelings for Grunkle Stan even after he had explained himself. This was another of Alexs mind games. I think he won that round.The last thing I want to talk about is the invisible ink twist. I was kind of wondering how they would give us more mysteries as Dipper had already looked through the whole journal like a million times. I think we already knew this before Mabel said it. Gravity Falls has been good at making its audience feel like Dipper and Mabel throughout the whole summer. This time we had watched through the whole first season like a million times. We thought there was nothing left to discover. But boy were we wrong when Alex gave us a whole new set of clues to unravel.Overall this was among my favorite episodes of Gravity Falls. Remember the secret message is decodable in the same way as the episodes cryptogram. Thanks for reading.Episode  Word Summary Da Mystery Shack is back baby!

Ford actually helped him through that and I think constant help by Ford could help him finally to overcome that problem. And he wouldnt isolate himself he still has found friends in Gravity Falls something he hadnt back in Piedmont. And especially theres someone he can connect on a level he couldnt even with his sister I also think that this is also very good for Ford but skip over that.I get the points your making and they are very valid points and its not a bad moral for the story but I think the writers failed to represent that in a good way.,gravityfalls,cy9q2iw,1,t5_2udb8

6110721,0,t3_3z95vj,First of all I really appreciate this post and I think its important to have a calm reasoned discussion about Mabel. I would like to explain why for me personally the explanation you provided does not quite satisfy me.Its not that I dont understand why Mabel is acting the way she is. I totally do shes literally never been separated from Dipper and it obviously upsets her very much. In fact I think its natural for her character to react this way. What I do disagree with is the way her behavior is portrayed in the show. We are supposed to see Mabel as being in the right here and I dont think she should be.You say Mabel doesnt tell Dipper he has to give up the apprenticeship and sure she doesnt say it but her actions leave no other choice. Shes in terrible danger and endangering the rest of the world as long as she remains in the bubble. The only way Dipper can get her out is by promising hell stay with her.Her actions are emotionally manipulative to Dipper though I know she would never intend for that to happen. Its a kind of twisted codependency that leads Dipper to constantly put himself down and leaves Mabel emotionally stunted. I know at the end of the episode she tells Dipper its okay if he stays with Ford but its obviously not. What answer could he possibly give in that situation but no? Imagine what would have happened.Dipper and Mabels relationship has been incredibly imbalanced since the beginning of the show and hasnt really evolved which is I think what makes many people angry. They feel like Dippers been shafted and that the show is sending the wrong message.tldr I understand why Mabel acts the way she does and its not so much that Im mad at her as I am at the writers for putting her in the right.I have been waiting so long to say this but never knew the right words. Hopefully this makes some kind of sense.,gravityfalls,cyk85zk,15,t5_2udb8

6131020,0,t1_cyl7zp7,woah woah wait Stan was the one who pushed him through in the first place. I dont think Ford is obligated to be thankful at all. Stan simply solved an issue that he created in the first place. Id have done the same if I were Ford and packed a few extra pounds behind that punch for good measure. Id argue that Stan should be the one people shit on because despite the major fuck up he caused he never said sorry and hasnt expressed any remorse nor has he changed his attitude. For fucks sake he screws up the DDampD game in such a Mabelesque way! Ford is the better man here for showing such restraint and not kicking Stan out of the house.Why should he appreciate Stan though? He screwed up Fords opp to attend his dream school and then after he works his way back into a position to continue with his dreams Stan shows up again to screw it all up one more time. I dont see at all how people can sympathize with Stan at all I feel like its likely that most people in the fandom who do do so because theyre the Stans in their familysocial groups. Bunch of fuck ups sympathizing with a fellow fuck up. I sound pissed here because I am but at the fans not you lolI have no doubt that Ford understands that Stan cares for him its not that hard to see. Being logical doesnt mean youre a robot it just means youre better at controlling your emotions when making decisions. The ones who dont trust him because they see him as unfeeling are idiots for dichotomizing emotions and logic the two arent mutually exclusive.Regarding Dippy Fresh....I dont think it matters who created him its the fact that Mabel preferred him to the real Dipper. Even if Team Bill was right Mabel still went along with her own selfish desires instead of being considerate of Dipper. Thats whats fucked up. The trance theory would vindicate her somewhat but if she were in a trance the writers would have made it clearer otherwise theres no other implication and if there was it was weak and Id consider it bad writing.I think it would be better if Dipper accepted because FordStans situation would act as a foil for DipperMabels Dipper would be able to do what Ford didnt get to because Stan ruined it. Instead it looks like the exact same thing is about to happen. ...if Ford died I would wrap my poop into a crpe and send it to the studio.,gravityfalls,cymj7bv,1,t5_2udb8

For example I know of more than a few people who enjoy Homestuck and even do fanartficetc. but find the Homestuck fandom unpleasant and as such selfidentify as not being part of the Homestuck fandom.

That we cant empathize with others that arent like us.

Stans story was so heartbreaking yet oddly inspiring. Getting that burn really hurt me too. I already saw the eye patch and glasses when he was advertising the Shack. Im so thankful for this episode because we got to know more about the origins of Stan the journals and the Mystery Shack.

All these little notes there were just talking about his character. We saw in the first episode how he scribbled in the Journal to return a library book that just speaks so much about his character. Who writes sentences like that? The Author of the Journals does. For having such a high family focus in this show Ford seriously feels often left out there. And especially because he himself is just personally for such a short amount of time he should even more get a goodbye and some heartfelt goodbye as two minor sidecharacters we already saw so often and didnt contribute that much.And the resolution of Part  just felt like postponing the problems to a later date.,gravityfalls,d059com,-10,t5_2udb8

Those are examples of cartoon characters always having their character development thrown out the window because they are sitcoms. I agree people like ATLA AT SU RS and other kid rated shows because they keep a story going while keeping what they have experienced. Not saying Pokemon doesnt do that at all but every season they bring Ashe back to square one people ridicule the show. I think thats one downfall of a kid targeted cartoon.

Unfortunately this isnt a place for that kinda talk and it can be seen as something as an attention grabber. Do I feel like it could have been handled better? Yes maybe hazzat messaged them or something explaining this?I myself thought about suicide when I broke up with my ex. Id say it but never do it and then Id get over it and I finally did and have a great life. Unfortunately theres nothing we as people can do if he doesnt read it and Im not sure reddit can report this kinda incident to the proper place.I feel this is a noble topic but you have to see both sides to see the tough decision.,gravityfalls,d0k64am,11,t5_2udb8

6866912,0,t1_d0uaxon,Its interesting the duck stories were all separated into their own canons in a way. One writer could create a new element that directly contradicted something stated in Barks stories of the same characters. Rosa was famous for always staying true to Barks even when introducing his own stories and explanations. But generally duck canon was very divided like you said. The Italians are especially good at going overboard. P But Im glad they were able to work without crushing limitations.The original Duck Tales series had its own canon but had a few episodes based on Barks stories. Tralla La Back to the Klondike and Land Beneath the Ground were all turned into episodes for instance with Fenton or Launchpad filling in for Donald.

While they were funny they destroyed a lot of the momentum that Part  build up and more importantly wasted a lot of time that could have been used better.Then everyone suddenly got stupid no one pointing out the obvious which would have resolved the plot in a single minute. Mabel felt more like an obstacle they had to overcome instead of a character. They wasted probably the last chance for Mabel to get any character development and in the end Dipper gives up what he wants and Mabel gets exactly what she wants with it feeling extremly forced by the narrative just to satisfy Mabel.And she replaced her brother with a soulless abomination which also was a jab against all of his qualities the moment he didnt agree with her.

When there was like  min left of driving I went on my photos app and browsed through the GF comics I had saved. My brother noticed this and asked what I was reading. Eventually the conversation turned into me going into excessive detail about my favorite filler episodes of the show. I insisted that he started watching it. Once we arrived at the hotel he caved and asked me where to find the pilot. I told him to look on Dailymotion. The next day he was already on episode .

Hes even been shown editing lightning coming from his hands on his home computer.I suspect youre not mistaking the two allusions. I think youre just noticing them without context.

Alternatively it could refer to fall from grace that Stanley had with his family all those years ago after Fords failed science project.

For example a scene I wrote last month would be like Dipper Mabel and Pacifica agree to have a small party before leaving to college. Mabel has to tell them she isnt going and she stays working in a art store. Dipper overreacts at first but then gives her his support If I got stuck writing those rules it would be a writers block but I have nothing written yet so yeah I understand. ,gravityfalls,d43djos,2,t5_2udb8

10902725,0,t3_5v92nr,I think cos Disney knew Gravity Falls was going to be a short run series they just gave up on it. They didnt give it a proper schedule and treated it as expendable. Heck what wouldve been our third season was condensed into the Weirdmageddon finale   episodes reduced to   if you include Dipper and Mabel vs the Future. The proper way to treat it wouldve been more like Over the Garden Wall make an event of it embrace its selfcontained nature and hype it on their own platforms and elsewhere.,gravityfalls,de4jeco,1,t5_2udb8

11764315,0,t1_dgti4i9,Its not that he wont disregard the rules its that he cant. He has no power and he is bound by the conditions of any deal he makes. As Ford said in Weirdmageddon  You know the rules Bill. If Bill really could disregard the rules he would and Gravity Falls and the world would still be living in Weirdmageddon.And like uTheEleventhWheatley said Bill did in fact fulfill his end of the deal. He just didnt give up the hint Dipper was looking for.EDIT If you think about it Bill has always fulfilled or attempted to fulfill his end of the deal... because it actually helps him in his goal of starting or expanding Weirdmageddon. He promised Gideon that he would get the code to Stans safe which he tried to do until the deal was called off. That would have given Gideon the Shack and Bill would have then helped him open the portal within the Shack and start Weirdmageddon.After destroying the laptop which gave Dipper the hint of McGucket Labs Bill tried to destroy Dippers journal the only way he could have known about Fords warnings. Therefore it would have allowed Stan to open the portal causing Weirdmageddon.Bills deal with Ford was that he would help him build the portal which in turn would allow him to start Weirdmageddon.Bill told Mabel that summer in Gravity Falls could last as long as she wanted it to. If not for Dipper and Mabel working together the Stans would not have thought to do the same and end Weirdmageddon.And Bills deal with Stan was that he would let Ford and the kids go which he technically did after Weirdmageddon was over. But the deal would have expanded Weirdmageddon had it gone all the way through.,gravityfalls,dgtijgj,6,t5_2udb8
