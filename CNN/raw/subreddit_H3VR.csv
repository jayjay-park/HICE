7737254,0,t1_d3jw2qn,Although this is true any gun past a certain distance wouldnt need the same LOD since the minute details would be lost past a certain distance. but since Im not all that familiar with unity I dont know how robust the automatic LOD generation is. Would still require no small amount of work to get it performing OK but it could probably be done.,H3VR,d3lo45o,1,t5_3ees2
7749580,0,t1_d3n0lpi,Id like falling as well but antons said hes tried and it is kind of nauseating. I would love to see an option for it though.,H3VR,d3n2j1f,1,t5_3ees2
7803574,0,t1_d3t6f00,Thats great to know. Thanks so much. What about holding multiple guns at once? Once I put a gun near my hip it wont let me pick up any others. Is that a limitation of the game? Also what is the GUNnasium locomotion? Is there a video of that one? I played it once but only could teleport around using the same old method. Edit Just found the video. ,H3VR,d3t6l7e,1,t5_3ees2

8586136,0,t3_4xc6wl,Id have to agree with the majority of people here and say that authentic would be the best option. So far most things in the game have been about accurate representation and as someone not super educated about guns its cool to see them as they would really be.If its easy enough to do then both would be fantastic. Im sure even the people hellbent on realism could enjoy the action movie style suppressors for a rampage now and then. Or for reducing the noisedetection by robits like others have said.,H3VR,d6eus6c,3,t5_3ees2

9419448,0,t3_59nqxc,Well I can only respond with my own anecdotal experience...Yes it takes a hell of a lot to kill the Clunks and Slicers. I think thats really okay. I cant tell you how many times Ive been pinned under cover getting shot at from  sides and getting a serious case of the shakes trying to change a mag while fighting Clunk and his buddies. I also cant tell you how satisfying it is to pop out from a piece of cover sight in on a Clunk closing down on you and fucking unload.If you want to get a Clunk down with less effort change your ammo to AP Incendiary it positively wrecks him and has been mentioned by Anton as the easy way to scale the difficulty of encounters. If you want to feel like a badass get  guns with rd magazines fill them up with API ammo and dual wield. Attach a laser pointer if you dont want to waste bullets. Using this method I can completely melt a Clunk in seconds.On the other hand if you want an incredible challenge load up a Sako boltaction sniper rifle with standard FMJ ammo and go Clunkhunting. I guarantee you will have to move and work to keep a distance from your targets.If you wanna take your H game to the next level use a floating table as a shield Yes it works like that and grab an axe and go all sword and board.The challenge or lack thereof is there and while right now you cant directly change Clunks health there are other ways to deal with that...inconvenience.Cheers mate and best of luck in the Arena!,H3VR,d99zamu,8,t5_3ees2

9906243,0,t3_5hb1tk,Im sure these are the messages that motivate the devs to stay late enough to push another update.

Id also like to thank the dev team on behalf of this sub as well for such a fun game and updating and communicating with us so well.,H3VR,dayt1xm,4,t5_3ees2

10544948,0,t3_5qzwdq,The version on steam is that mode. What shows up in the weekly updates is the bleeding edge of what has been implemented. When we get closer to leaving Early Access we will have to look at our process to see if a experimentalstable branch structure might be necessary.  But for right now EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES FOR EVERYBODY!!! ,H3VR,dd3dyh5,14,t5_3ees2
10648540,0,t3_5s1q5z,Meat Grinder the new teleport function is broken in the boiler room. Or maybe its functioning now as it was intended? I find it very very easy  now to teleport to the beams underneath down near the lava. Going underneath the floor beneath the level essentially. The only solid pieces now are the metal plates which means you have to be very precise to not teleport under the floor. ,H3VR,ddebccn,1,t5_3ees2
