8721620,0,t1_d6vk468,gt do you High Pass everything that isnt your bass and kick? Yes I have a highpass filter with cutoff at around Hz for everything thats not bass and kick although I notice now that there are some leads that I dont highpass.gt Do you tune your kick drums? When you say tune kick drums you mean EQ? Yes I do but Im a bit fumbling in the dark there not really knowing what Im doing. I boost at Hz around A IIRC and then cut dB with a wide Q at Hz. Listening to your feedback sounds to me like I should cut at a lower frequency and perhaps a bit deeper.Im currently travelling and dont have my iLok sigh or my monitor speakers with me so Ill only be able to work on this next week. However if youre OK with it Ill try to incorporate your feedback next week and then ask you to listen to the updated track. I appreciate the feedback.,EDM_Producers,d6vudbo,2,t5_2utyb

10458969,0,t1_dctmhhb,Agreed I wish splice had play counts to see if it was actually listened to since they say theyll go through every submission. Or something specifically for submissions to competitions to confirm that its been reviewed or something. Especially since people who pay for the splice premium get early access to stems so they can submit earlier and get votes sooner ,EDM_Producers,dctmof4,1,t5_2utyb
10528617,0,t3_5qr8dq,You have a long way to go my friend. Im not trying to be rude because we are all going for the smae thing a career in music but its my suggestion that you keep making tracks and working on youre skills of using your software before uploading these tracks to soundcloud dont tarnish your name with underdeveloped tracks you can definitly make music but it needs work.,EDM_Producers,dd1j7mh,1,t5_2utyb
