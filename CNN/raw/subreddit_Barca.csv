111044,0,t1_cer1lkr,Any decent DM can cover for Pique when he roams forward. What makes Sergio special is his ability to be in the right place at the right time constantly and everywhere. But with a more defensive minded player alongside him Busi is allowed more freedom with his positioning amp we can make use of his excellent game reading amp passing ability upfront.Concerning S. Roberto I think he could become an excellent utility player for us. I doubt hell become a starting  material but he could be the kind of player that could offer our team something different in terms of style more straightforward or who could come in for injured playerslate in the game when we need some fresh legs to kill off the game.

133340,0,t1_cetlzrp,Montoya hasnt delivered perfect performances but I still see great potential in him. Clearly we do not agree about Montoya and thats fair enough.Your right but I believe that the chance came more or less from a mistake in the Levante defense. I love when Barca plays through the middle and it is clearly the most effective but sometimes it is not possible to play that way and in order to create space in the middle the ball has to be played wide. Also i would like to see Barca buy a forward like Ibra to add more alternatives to the classic style.I agree on Bartra. However Masche played well today in my opinion.,Barca,cetm84l,1,t5_2s561

207862,0,t1_cf245xa,Yes Tata buy Peter Crouch! And Lacina Traore! And Lebron James! sI hate this line of reasoning. Tata inherited a team that has gradually become a parody of itself that has gotten smaller and more specialized. Thats not his fault. But he should just go out midseason and buy a new player? Where would he go? The team is full in all positions as it is a  new purchase would require someone to leave. So tell me which of our players would you think its a good idea to sell midseason?Height is a factor but focusing on it is shortsighted and ignores the fact that the setpiece defending and marking has been awful recently. The players and coach both share the blame for that and believe it or not there are ways to improve a team beyond simply buying players.,Barca,cf24abm,3,t5_2s561

If they dont want to show up and were not talking about  but tens of thousands then perhaps just PERHAPS they have a good reason.

And Iniesta always plays his best against RMD.Messi Neymar Pedro in attack Alexis supersubAnd I put Messi out right to begin with Neymar as the center forward so that we can get Neymar involved early with his runs. Messi can then play inverted winger and can shoot at goal dribble past the RMD defense or most importantly give off one of his killer through balls. In any case Alves would support Messi and Neymar equally well on the right. And Messi and Neymar can always interchange positions too.I started Pedro instead of Sanchez because Pedro is more lethal diagonally and on the run whereas Sanchez is hesitant with his movement. And Pedro also tracks back like a dog especially against RMD. He has that extra emotional gear that you typically dont see from Sanchez.,Barca,cg5eehe,3,t5_2s561

684285,0,t1_cgi1xeb,Im sure it has something to do with those ten players that is involved according to media. Worst case scenario is to transfer back at least seven of them to the old club or a new club which I fear could be problematic.

I think tata has to evolve in the crossing game hes trying to implement to barca.  He also needs to emphasize control in midfield like of the pep days while not being too slow in build up of play.  playing out from the back line with the keeper and defense is a must.  IMO he also needs a natural striker in the squad.i would like to see more youth players in matches where our lead is excessive.

Its impossibly to say how a player will do at a different team but Cuadrado has been incredibly consistent all season every match day day in and day out.I wont argue any longer.

1106972,0,t1_chu3csa,gt By that logic Manchester United wouldnt have had such an abysmal transfer situation last season.But this example would seem to do anything but support your point.  Manchester United had an abysmal transfer situation because their new football executive is deeply incompetent and pursued silly targets in a haphazard fashion.  Some would say the Barcelona situation is strongly parallel but not in the way you seem to want it to be.gt And when a lot of targets are being sought by teams like real or psg then youre at an almost immediate disadvantage and regardless of prestige you arent likely to get them.For whom are we competing with Real Madrid?  The only player I can think of is the one we spent an incredible sum of money to get Neymar.  We did get him and we paid enormously to do it.  Its impossible to overstate the impact of that transfer on peoples current opinions of the board.  Its not that Neymar was a bad target  its that weve been sold this whole narrative about Barcelona being unable or unwilling to compete financially with the likes of Real and PSG and then we go and spend  million on a position third or fourth on our list of requirements.  If we had that kind of money to burn why dont we have Javi Martinez?  Why arent we willing to splurge for Benatia?In the current market Barcelona will have to pay quite a bit of money for a top CB.  Thats the reality.  Anyone would have to pay quite a bit of money for a top CB.  Why shouldnt it be Barcelona?  Why should we think its realistic to evade the realities of the market for all these years?  Its time to pay whatever it takes to get the right caliber of player.  The money is there as is the need.  It wouldnt cost nearly as much as Neymar and they dont seem to have blinked at his price tag.My point wasnt that Barcelona being a big club solves all problems  it was that we have as many advantages in the transfer market as anyone and shouldnt be consistently outperformed.,Barca,chu4c1f,2,t5_2s561
1122991,0,t1_chvr0qm,Cesc isnt old but hes not young enough to be casual about his place in the team.  Pretty much any team in the Premier League would make him their unquestioned star midfielder while Cesc has been very involved in both of the last two seasons hes rarely been a part of the undisputed best XI even when in absolute peak form.  Messis injuries have I think distorted the picture somewhat and made Cesc appear more integral than he is hes obviously not a longterm contender for the center forward position and if a striker is purchased this will be even more obvious.  If Barcelona dont shift permanently to a more direct style his form will continue to be up and down and hell continue to be subject to criticism.  In the Premier League hell be back to a very direct role with considerable positional freedom and will honestly have no problem asserting himself as one of the ten best players in the league.Im not sure all of the above is on his mind but I dont think its implausible either.  If I were Fabregas I wouldnt be set on leaving but Id be seriously considering my options.

He did that with Zlatan and texted Pep that if Im not needed Ill leave and look for another club. He also had some issues with Villa.

1586121,0,t3_2cft9w,First half notes Ter Stegen looks ready to be a Barcelona keeper. By ten minutes in he was already venturing fifteen yards forward of his box to receive passes. At  he came under heavy pressure on the goal line and still managed to play a perfect ball long to Pedro. Not a bad job on the penalty either. Piques shove in the box was really disappointing. He was also dispossessed at  which might have led to a goal if Busquets hadnt made a great tackle. Piques diagonals to Alba who hasnt been marked much on the wing have been effective. Jurys out on Mathieu. A little nervous in possession sometimes strong sometimes shaky in defense. Good clearance early on after Alba failed to close down on the wing. Alba returned the favor with a great clearance in front of goal at  after Mathieu completely overran his man. Busquets is Busquets. Iniesta is Iniesta although he drifted in and out as the focal point of the midfield. Sergi Robertos shortcomings as a center mid left Iniesta mostly playing in a leftside triangle with Alba and Pedro. Sergi Roberto always seems to invest too much effort to too little effect. There was a moment at  when he saw an opening in the center of Nices defense and ran all the way to the penalty spot. When he got nothing he ran all the way back to his midfield position promptly lost the ball with a bad pass recovered it then made another bad pass that Alba couldnt control. Sums up his game. Alba has had a pretty good game switching effectively between the various phases of the game. His long pass that Pedro couldnt quite bring down in front of goal was pretty good. So was his tricky free kick. Montoya was poor. A lot of sloppy passing under pressure and a lackadaisical job closing down on the ball that led to the penalty. The team lost nothing when Patric came on. Adama had some scintillating runs that tended to be derailed by heavy touches. He continues to show a lot of promise though. That run past about six defenders that drew a yellow at  was fantastic. Hes also put some good energy into the high press. Rafinha doesnt look quite comfortable as a false nine but its a role he could grow into. His dribbling and vision are great and having a strong tackler up top makes a difference. When Pedro had a breakaway counter at  though it was pretty clear that Rafinha didnt know where to position himself. Not bad for a new position though. Pedro was a real leader in this half. Great dribbles great passes great defense. Created chances with smart runs. Comfortable and confident in a way that you could see helped calm the younger players down. He helped lead that front three in an energetic early press that kept Nice from retaining the ball for more than six seconds until the seventh minute. After that the energy broke but it was a promising start.,Barca,cjf3p5l,6,t5_2s561
1586614,0,t3_2cga7e,Immediate impressionsI liked what I saw of Mathieu Rafinha and Munir. Adama and Deulo had nice runs. Sergi Samper had some standout plays as well. Bartra should really have passed the ball on the last attack.Ref was inconsistent and never really got control of the match. No MOTM for me really.

1628253,0,t1_cjkebwf,Past  years have been difficult for him with nagging injuries that made him lose his place in the starting lineup. The partnership of PerKoscielny was solid so he never earned his place back in.Hes a better footballer than both though and we all know how Arsenal is kind of infamous for their injury worries. Im hoping he can get past it with us. Hes still a very good defender very good with the ball at his feet as youd expect from an Ajax graduate scores headers doesnt shy away from challenges some might say too reckless. Bit like Mascherano in that regard. Also likes to venture forward but with enough tactical discipline from Lucho that would be minimised. For Belgium hes our starter CB together with Kompany and was always solid throughout our qualifying campaign even when he wasnt playing much with Arsenal.,Barca,cjkempx,9,t5_2s561

1641124,0,t1_cjlvqxu,While I would disagree and say Masch was far and away our best defender last season I agree that the fact that people have moved on from maybe Pique shouldnt start every match to lets get rid of Pique is totally nuts. I hope everyone manages to get some faith back in him this coming season. ,Barca,cjm115o,1,t5_2s561
1643288,0,t1_cjm26jy,Not disagreeing with possible lack of motivation but its more than that. Pique has had to change his playing style a lot in a very short time and almost by suprise.When he came back to Barca and started the matches alongside Puyol he was known as Puyols partner. Puyol led the line. Pique made some positioning mistakes but it wasnt just that. He was the active defender. He went in to make tackles close down win headers while Puyol covered. This is what made Puyol such a god damn class above so many defenders around. He could sense what was going to happen he knew what Pique would do and he made the right decisions time after time.When Puyol started getting injured constantly Pique was thrown next to Masch. Now the problem here was and is that Masch also loved to leave the line and go for tackles and close downs. So this forced Pique to transform into Puyol. Something he clearly wasnt comfortable at the start. He has improved a lot since but even in last season you could see Barcas central defense just open up because both CBs went up to make a tackle. Easiest way to see the difference in Piques gamestyle is to watch who made offside traps past years. Before it was Puyol now its Pique. That is not an easy transformation for a CB.,Barca,cjmau2t,2,t5_2s561

2212780,0,t1_cll2ya4,Bartra is not good enough to deserve a start in big matches over Piqu but is getting plenty of minutes in smaller games.This is the exact attitude that will kill Barca off in big games particularly CL. And how will he prove himself over anyone if he doesnt get a chance to start in big games  and he was coming off injury in the CDR final so that is not an indicator You are okay with seeing Pique make error after error in every big game but not okay with giving persistent chances to a youngster that makes no sense whatsoever...And  coaches in a row have not passed on Montoya he was given enough playing time under Martino and Vilanova before him  of course Alves was st choice but he has declined since so Montoya deserves more playing time simple as that Also about this speculation about being awful in training well.. Pedro keeps getting time on the pitch and keeps performing woefully even though he is supposedly great in training so why not try Montoya in matches even if he is below par in training ? Cant it have an opposite effect and inspire him to perform at his best so that he gets into the good books of the coach...yes Rafinha has been injured but its not like he has been injured for  months straight he has been available for matches but just hasnt been given enough chances for me...,Barca,cll3iy3,4,t5_2s561

2620520,0,t3_2pw9kq,Dont think the first half was as awful as people are making it out to be yeah there were a lot of misplaced passes and a lack of pace but some of that had to do with Cordoba very clearly deciding not to counter at all for odd minutes the exceptions being in the opening and closing minutes of that half. I was hoping wed capitalize more on having come out firing hard with Pedros goal but oh well. Rakitic was a big highlight of this half.That strategy worked wonderfully in the second half the second goal was what it took to open them up and the intensity continued. Dont think Messi was as bad today as hes being made out to be even by his standards but Alba and Pedro were MOTM for sure. Montoya was good not great but he definitely showed how much defensive cover is lacking when Dani plays on the right. I said it in another thread but he really needs to play much less offensively to take pressure off Rakitic and co. this worked in one match against Ajax I believe. Let Alba be the primary fullback hes clearly the best we have at it.,Barca,cn0n1si,2,t5_2s561

3103210,0,t1_cojmhp0,gtCesc was a typical vanity purchase with no plan whatsoever as to how exactly integrate and use him. So yes it was selfish. You got him because you could thats the whole pointNo he was bought to be used as depth in central midfield. It was not anticipated that Xavi would maintain his form for so long and he was originally meant to slowly tale his place as a starter. Not every player bought has to be an automatic starter especially not at Barcelona.gtMeanwhile his departure literally destroyed the whole structure at Arsenal. Were kinda still recovering. Is Barcelona supposed to care about that? Arsenal is responsible for their own transfer business Barcelona for theirs. Once again you reveal that youre upset at things which happened that your own club had full control over and yet youre taking it out on Barcelona.gtInconsistent doesnt mean poor or useless and for all the effort you put into signing him you got rid incredibly easily. He was poor. Every single season he turned to absolute shit at the halfway point. It doesnt matter how hard it was to get him the club felt he should be sold and that is that. I dont see how any of this could be taken on a negative way youre either stupid or grasping at straws.gtThe funny thing is that when he was actually wanted back at Arsenal the year before you refused to sell.And when he was offered back to Arsenal this summer they refused to take him. This means literally nothing and I dont see how its relevant. This summer was the time that Barcelona felt he should be soldgtI dont like it when clubs toy with the feelings of players I love or used to love.FC Barcelona is not responsible for your feelings. Nobody was being toyed with. Cesc had a contract with Arsenal and the club accepted a deal to let him leave. This is the same fucking thing that happens with every transfer. Again youre just upset because you felt a sentimental attachment to him Barcelona did nothing wrong.gtWhat Man United and Fergie did with RVP was equally cuntish and even though I couldnt care less about him as a player anymore and I hope the worst possible things happen to him on the pitch I recently started to feel sorry for him as a person. Nobody is gonna give a shit when he retires. No legend status at either club. No place to come back where hes genuinely loved. Nothing. His Arsenal legacy and reputation ruined his Man United legacy and reputation not near enough. And he gave it all away because some old egotistical prick promised him mountains.Youre hilariously biased and deluded. Robin van Persie is a great player and shall be looked upon as such by Dutch fans and all Premier League fans save Arsenal fans. He left to a bigger better club and won the Premier League. It was a good move. To wish the worst possible things happen to him on the pitch all because of this move is absolutely fucked up and you should be ashamed of yourself. And dont be sorry for him his life is and always will be infinitely better than yours or mine.gtRecently Cesc went to see an NBA game in London and got resoundingly booed by the entire venue. Thats what hes up against now.And this is somehow Barcelonas fault? He chose to move away from a club and then he also accepted an offer for one of their biggest rivals. That is entirely his fault.You have absolutely no rational grounds for any of this youre just another of many shamelessly biased idiots who holds grudges against a club for making their best effort.

In recent history shows when barca wants someone they try for him several times. Thiago Silva and Marquinhos obviously are failed cases.Last summer they tried to sign Koke. I think they will try for him this summer as well.Edit As its almost certain Xavi will leave in summer a world class midfielder will be necessary. My personal choice is Koke as well. But my preference is sign none. Let try with Rafinha amp promote Samper amp bring back Denis. Busquets shows that he can do better in advance role. With Iniesta Rakitic Busquets and Mascherano as experienced player amp Rafinha Denis and Samper as young player might turn to be good. If not then try to sign someone in January or June .,Barca,cptkp19,22,t5_2s561

Guillem Balague writes that if Messi was rested or subbed off he would come to training with an attitude or not come at all and sometimes he wouldnt talk to his manager for days. Yes Messi definitely needs rest but I feel like Lucho is walking on eggshells especially with what happened earlier in the year. Hes doing a fantastic job but he still has a lot of critics out there who would want him out if he doesnt bring any silverware home. I think the last thing he and the team board some fans need right now is a strained relationship with Messi. ,Barca,cqkfxhg,15,t5_2s561

BartraPique needs to be the starting CB pair.I think we should keep Montoya until January. Then let him do whatever he wises.I personally rate Sandro higher than Munir. Sandro should be promoted to provide forward depth alongside Pedrito and Munir should be loaned to a midtable side preferably in the EPL to bulk up or if possible Bundesliga.Roberto is a nice substitute to have on the bench. Yeah hes probably never going to be a legend in midfield but thats okay. Not every player we have needs to be a superstar. Like you said rotation option.Samper should be promoted.

Yes a lot has changed since he last turned out in Blaugrana but he would still have formed a relationship with the likes of Pique Alves Iniesta Pedro and Messi.

4377310,0,t1_csj1qip,Rakiti was great early on yeah but in a totally different system where the midfielders job was strictly to pass the ball between the back line and the wing and to give the fullbacks defensive cover. Simple stuff. Once Surez came on and Messi moved to the wing the team went through a couple months of growing pains before they figured out how to make things run smoothly. Rakiti had it the worst since his job involved accounting for Alves and Messi the two most dynamic players in terms of positioning. In the end he aced it.

This was even with Iniesta on the pitch.  It was more like he had forgotten he was supposed to be playing LB and was sliding into the CB territory.  The giant swath of space on LB even when he was backing defending was noticeable too often.  Eventually a goal came out of that.

4825425,0,t1_cu2rx5f,I respectfully disagree.  The differences are stark.  Wingers have specific roles namely to provide width to spread defenses overlap the wing with speed and provide crosses.  Wide attackers or wide forwards have a much broader role and are not limited to just that.  Neymar is the very definition of a wide forward not a winger.For contrast of what makes a winger vs a wide forward think of Cristiano Ronaldo in Manchester United vs Cristiano Ronaldo in Real Madrid.  Two very different roles.,Barca,cu2s8lk,4,t5_2s561
4825711,0,t1_cu2s8lk,Your response makes it sound like soccer isnt a fluid game where attackers make decisions based on game situationswhat the defense is giving themtheir skillsetetc.  Neymar goes centrally when Alba overlaps Neymar goes out wide when the defenders are crowding the middle.  Its not American Football where there are set plays and if youre a winger you always go down the line but if youre a wide forward you always cut in.  I do agree that Neymar plays differently than a Nani traditional wide player imo but I think thats more down to skillset and being dynamicskilled enough to cut in as much as he goes down the line.  Id say Deulofeu and Adama are examples of players without the skillset phsyical or mental of successfully cutting in and making good decisions so they ALWAYS go down the line  like a Nani  I dont think its a positioning thing. I really dont see much of a difference between the terms.  This also might be the very definition of arguing semantics,Barca,cu2tjd8,4,t5_2s561

5411408,0,t3_3p5es9,whatever i thought the game was fun to watch we came back from a goal down kept pace with league leaders it was wide open with lots of chances for either team to score. This was an enjoyable game for neutrals. I find myself enjoying these games more than the  percent possession snooze fests that are an indicator of what people believe to be a dominant barca where we dink around the  yard line and then try and play a half dozen one twos into the box for  minutes. Teams park the bus people complain that we cant break a  man back line teams play ahead with a high line and wide open football and our defense is shit and we lost control and we should have lost the game fire the coach we are getting relegated. love the team but the fans drive me nuts. Mostly because deep down I dont think people understand or respect that the guys are the other side of the ball are also paid professionals and that sometimes they can play well and outplay one of our guys as was the case with Alba getting scorched multiple times today. Its not that Alba is bad but believe it or not Rayo has quality players. Anyways as usual coming out of the match i have more complaints about the fans than the team. Thought it was really nice of the crowd to immediately get behind the team after the first Rayo goal rather than the whistling and hand wringing that was happening here in the sub.,Barca,cw3d7wi,7,t5_2s561

5689616,0,t1_cx2cd1v,It was reported that Cesc was the one who leaked Guardiolas lineup to the press after he was dropped Tello played in Peps last clsico that we lost and that one of Peps requirements to continue as coach was to sell Fabregas because he was livid about the mole in the changing room he had a similar reaction to a leak in Bayern. Tata Martino also said as he was leaving the club that Cesc was a bad apple. A guy who agreed to move to Chelsea under Mourinho thereby totally alienating most of the Arsenal fanbase who used to be at his feet a guy who ditched the club he supposedly loved to go to Aresenal in the first place. He strikes me as mercenary self centered the type of guy who is in love with himself being at a club not the club itself. After not winning much with Bara and being lightly shoved out the door after a trophyless season I dont see him sitting at home thinking Im so happy my Bara won a triplete last season after they sold me.

5693884,0,t3_3t2xry,Going to take a stab at this since I am studying for my accounting designation and just took a quick look at the  financials. Obviously a lot could have changed since these were released but I can highlight a few things.Also this financial report didnt have a cash flow statement which will be more helpful with the analysis.I can highlight a few points. Our short term debt increased from m to m. Short term debt are debt that has to be paid within the year although prior years financials state that some are renewed after the year. A lot are attributed to the investments in acquiring players last season Suarez Mathieu Vermaelen Vidal. This is a huge issue since the Statutes has a maximum net debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization EBITDA ratio of . and we are currently at ..  This ratio is basically looking at FCBs ability to decrease the debt it owes. The higher the worse. In order to decrease this Bara have forecasted that in  will need to spend less on player acquisition and make sure EBITDA is higher. This also gives us a negative working capital. Which means if we had to pay off all the debt today we will have negative cash left.  In summary we have too much debt and the board wants to decrease it for .Also take this lightly but  there were no cash flow statements so I couldnt analyze  I didnt look at any other football team financials maybe the high debt thing is completely normal.

5766646,0,t3_3u4tmo,I mentioned this in the postmatch thread but Ill hash it out here too. Under pressure he took his time to wait for the right option and play it. It seems like he has a great sense of when to drive the play forward and when to keep it simple. There were some strong passes out left and composed combinations through the midfield. He hurried and hassled defenders. My suspicion is he wants to show Lucho that he can get stuck in and be a nuisance even against the stronger teams. If thats the case good.  He turns like Xavi. Inside of the foot outside of the foot swivels. I love it.  initially he looked a little lost positionally. It seemed like he didnt know whether to press or cover the space when Roma had extended spells of possession  part of that is the players around him and part is him getting a feel for the game. Not particularly concerning. Sometimes it feels like he takes unnecessary extra touches. That might be nitpicking but he could be firmer in his decisions. Thatll come with time and isnt a worry. I remember Busquets early matches and he was almost oddson guaranteed to do something stupid at least once a match but he figured it out. Like everybody else here I hope we see him more. His ceiling as a midfielder specifically is higher than Robertos and wed be loathe to lose him.EDIT  I fixed some errors. ,Barca,cxbwltu,32,t5_2s561

7172649,0,t3_4dqxop,Is Messis opinion taken into consideration when selecting transfer targets for Barcelona?As it happens in every organization Barcelona has its procedures. First of all any potential signing is sanctioned by the head coachs staff who evaluate such players and assess not only their sporting capabilities but also their personal qualities and check on his playing conditions being suitable for the teams style. Therefore its not about considering Messis or any other players thoughts on who we should sign  its about the understanding that the newcomer must come to be supportive to them. And about how likely the team will be to welcome him upon arrival.In a club like Barcelona how can you possibly get ready for the day after the worlds best footballer leaves?I cant see that happening. Because theres always going to be one player deemed the worlds best. And Barcelona is always supposed to have the worlds best playing for the club. So we will never quit having the worlds best with us.In that case how do you think will be the day after Messis retirement?Messi will be and actually is the best player in the history of football and we are already positive that among the greatest players hell be the only one to have started and finished his career at the same side. Messi is an Argentine and might make a decision about his postretirement life but hes well aware of the extent of appreciation Catalonia holds for him.Are you not afraid that given his outspoken sympathies for Newells he might end up his career on the side he played for as a child?Thats a freedom range everyone is entitled to. No one should be tied up to an obligation. Whenever he has expressed such way thats fair enough but Im sure he will stay at Barcelona until the last day he plays.Will Barcelona be able to remain the same after Messi?Messidependence is over. Barcelona has been able to leave that behind which Napoli could never do regarding Diego Armando Maradona for instance. When Maradona walked away Napoli suffered a great deal. As a board of directors we are compelled to keep our team unhurt whenever Messi leaves. Some time ago rumor was about the end of a cycle but Luis Enrique broke new ground to reinvent the team and made Bara a more straightforward side towards attack. They said Neymar would never fit into Barcelonas game and he does. They said Luis Surez would not make it because Barcelona relies on a false  and nevertheless he does. A state of integration has been achieved.You mentioned certain comfort zone Messi lies within in Catalonia but there is a feeling that a part of Spain is in rage against Messi and Barcelona. Is that so?There is a cultural issue about the fact that Barcelona is in Catalonia. Thats a matter of culture irrespective of the club. Bara is a realm for integration with a willingness to unite and there might be voices trying to link our cultural sphere to a number of political stances.Is it related to that Visca Bara Visca Catalunya thing?Just like Argentina we endured a dictatorship under General Franco. Back then there was a favoured side winning European Cups and that was Real Madrid. Making us suffer a lot. That was a complex situation for us and we wondered why Di Stefano was not playing for us when he even had already put on our jersey. Back in the day when people were not allowed to call out Visca Catalunya theyd shout Visca Bara and that held a different meaning. Nowadays anyone who wants to call out for independence is allowed to freely do so.What are your feelings when you read some criticism to Messi here?The way I see it you must understand that he is the best player in the world but he cant be charged with the whole blame because football is a team sport. It makes me feel sometimes like Messi is expected to show up with a hero cape solving out every problem. But he also needs to share the responsibilities among his teammates. Sometimes criticism comes from far away out of misinformation.Expectations might be for him not to wear a heros cape but MaradonasNot a good thing to compare. Back in Maradonas days football was a different thing allowing a player like Maradona to ease a whole teams issues. Today theres a lot higher pressure football has changed a great deal.Is there any chance to get together Messi and Sergio Agero?I dont interfere in sporting issues. Thats just not my business and my opinion is but a supporters one.Are you in search of a new Messi?Im convinced the new Messis the new geniuses now  or  years old are not to be sought after theyll come to us. Barcelona holds now such a position that players themselves their managers or football people in general come up with interesting proposals to us.There seems to be change in signing trends. Nowadays you sign Rakitic rather than going for a mega star jersey seller like BeckhamThe thing is we have a team here not a conglomeration of super stars which would come to be not compatible with our values. Egos within the dressing room are an issue to be controlled. There are players in supporting roles able to adapt themselves to several positions like Rakitic or Sergi Roberto. Unlike Villa who couldnt get used to it.As a fan what do you find more enjoyable? A goal by a succession of passing or a masterstroke by Messi? Collective art or individual art?I dont know about that Im happy with most Barcelona goals. We get goals in a number of ways solo efforts team plays. Not long ago they reinvented the indirect penalty kick. Such strokes of genius get known all around the world. Those are the ones that lift us to our actual status. No one is to take offense here. That one was not meant to mock anyone. Thats the way they play and they devote themselves to entertaining. We have to get used to football in general being an increasingly beautiful thing.Reference,Barca,d1tgo0l,8,t5_2s561

7244992,0,t1_d21own2,I think its real. Imagine training and playing on average a full  minute professional football match every  days. After a while your body just starts to give and muscle fatigue happens. Barca has played the most games in Europe this season iirc and its showing especially since we have a relatively small squad.Regardless I think Luis Enrique could have done a better job this season with that.,Barca,d21pc6u,1,t5_2s561
7245209,0,t3_4enkg4,One thing I notice about myself is how much more I care about the European games and the UCL than the Spanish games. And this season we have only faced Roma Leverkusen and Arsenal. I know this is an unpopular opinion with many but Id like a Euro super league  or at least more games in UCL and fewer games in La Liga and La Copa. Its such a let down to not play against any of the best non Spanish teams bar Arsenal in a whole season. No Bayern PSG or Juve. The current set up sucks in my opinion. Another thing is there should be fewer games. Whats the point of having so many games that the best teams are exhausted for the biggest games of the season? Midweek games and especially WC qualifiers hit us hard. I have no problem with waiting a week for a game football should be about playing a game at a high level not games were you have to have the next game in the back of your head the whole time. ,Barca,d21q88y,1,t5_2s561

7274646,0,t3_4ews46,Xavi was unique you cant find someone like him.

7290125,0,t3_4f8s8j,Both.Over the last few weeks the team has looked very similar to Tatas Barca after he stopped playing more directcounterattacking football.  The quick build up down the field as soon as the team wins possession seems for the most part gone.  Another aspect of the team that has been nonexistent lately is shots from outside the box usually again as a result of quick counter attacks after winning possession.  Iniestas golasso against Madrid or Rakitics CL goals ring a bell?  Recently the teams that have been successful against Barca have been able to sit back and absorb pressure while the team enjoys possesion in the attacking third that doesnt actually lead anywhere. Psychologically I dont know if its fatigue or maybe complacency as none of the bench players truly seem capable of winning a starting spot but its clear that the team is sluggish.  The most obvious examples of that being the poor passing weak defending and atrocious finishing.   Hopefully Lucho can right the ship.,Barca,d26u6jm,12,t5_2s561

Having him come off the bench would be awesome and he could try to replace our mids too.Sending him to Villareal after that shitty treatment by Emery seems to have been one of the master strokes of management here at Barca.

The reason that MaschPique works so well as a pair in defense is that Pique is the offensive CB and Masch stays home and breaks up tons of plays. The only reason to take him out of the defensive line right now is if were going to be playing games where we want a more physical hard tackling CDM and maybe want to focus on counter attacking. Hes been fantastic as a CB. If we buy somebody they should have to earn his spot not just have it given to them.,Barca,d3bi98r,8,t5_2s561

7718536,0,t3_4l1hog,Relax this is what the rumour mill always sounds like after the last game.I can see Alves leaving I think he knows the fans appreciate him but the club has wronged him in his opinion. Mascherano would be a surprise hard to see us accepting a bid for him and he seems to have a great relationship with Lucho.I cannot see us letting Vidal go especially if Dani is on the way out.

7727881,0,t3_4l1omt,Its kind of surprising that in most of the threads on this subreddit wherein a replacement RB for Alves has been discussed Fabinhos name hasnt come up even once. At least not to my knowledge. I have always liked Monaco FC a bit and have sporadically seen since I dont follow the french league as much as I would like to Fabinho progress quite a bit as a footballer. To me he would fit Alvess role with almost criminal ease. Also since hes young hes got huge potential to grow and gel with this Team and will over time get completely used to the way we play and will fit our style of play like a glove. ProsMay not exactly be a speed gun but is  and has extremely long strides much like Cafu. Is extremely strong physically on the ball which can make him quite explosive at times.With his height hes no liability in the air. Hes a great defender. Can also play as DM as he did against Arsenal in the Champions League in the  seasonThe most important for me his intelligence and ability to read the game is phenomenal and as a result has an immaculate sense of positioning.ConsOnly one that comes to my mind is his final ball disappoints many a time.He has also made one solitary appearance for Real Madrid as well. What a prospect that would be if he were to come to us and shine to his potential. Like Lucho himself Etoo etc.Hes great to watch as well ,Barca,d3kltad,2,t5_2s561

Might it not have been better to give Messi a few days rest in Spain before his court date?  source gtInjuries are just apart of the game no matter how much they suckYes they are but a football managers job on top of many other things is to protect his players Martino certainly failed to protect Messi on this occasion. ,Barca,d3n8szz,8,t5_2s561

To be fair he only had  months and may be better next season. But if we buy a cm then would it be a rotation player or a big name? Supposedly we only have m and I think cb and rb should be priority. Also a fwd so when being very stacking can drop messi into midfield xavi role and have for example suarez neymar and gameiro ahead of him. So have an attacking lineup of neymar suarez gameiro then messi and raki or iniesta in mid. Or even play three at the back and play messi at tip of midfield diamond.,Barca,d3wzh1g,1,t5_2s561

7996049,0,t1_d4ep2fg,He is old amp thats why I want him signing  a Larsson type signing. Plenty of youth strikers are coming. I guess Munir still have a good future whether its in barca or elsewhere.

Later two perhaps attacking midfielder but their future lies as forward.If young strikers like Dybala Vietto Gabriel etc are signed they will simply be wasted due to lack of playing time amp will be soldloaned in two years where in Nolito the risk is low. He will want to take bench role without making any fuzz understands barca system has good relationship with Enrique  overall he is ideal signing at current moment.

As far as masche is concerned last season he was absolute class. Pique is the most consistent CB as of now and I love him for that. But Masche i think has shown us what he is capable of. Also strategically a strong player. Also I dont think he is really past his prime.

9772439,0,t3_5f4t5e,Im reading a lot of comments saying that Gomes is overpriced but I want to point out a his age and b his potential think Alexis. We likely overpaid for him too but we got  nice years with him and made a nice little profit. The goal is for the player to settle in and become a long time fixture and based off of season to date I can see a strong case for that happening. But should he follow Alexis path never truly settle in but still contribute for a few years and grow as a player I think we make a profit on his sale.So to anyone saying we overpaid I think thats just an out of date view of the current transfer market. The last few windows young players have a huge potential premium so any promising young attacker will be in this range. I think we paid appropriately for what we got if he settles in to a startingkey role then its a success because players like that are invaluable and if he never truly settles and moves on to ArsenalChelsea in  years for a profit thats also a success.

Not sure if that was due to us improving or because RMA didnt pressure us high but still. I still dont understand what Lucho sees in Andre Gomes. The guy has a few good moments here and there but overall he seems to have no urgency in defense or in offense. Hes jogging around like its your average sunday game. PLus midfield is so sluggish with him Busi and totally out of form Rakitic.It is truly heartbreaking how many chances we need to score a goal. The moment Neymar sent that ball over the crossbar I knew that was a  point miss.I also didnt care much for the Arda sub. He simply isnt  a midfielder and he cannot defend. Rafinha with his energy would have been a far better sub but he wasnt even called for the game. Not going to dwell on this game anyway.  point difference and were only just in december.

I thought Denis looked great and that he plays well with Messi although I also feel its easier for the midfield to look good when Iniesta is out there and performing. I hope Rakitic gets  motivated he hasnt been in great form so hopefully this will get him inspired and finding a way to play more effectively with Roberto down the right.  What a show between Messi Neymar and Iniesta we probably have  of the top  dribblers in the world.  The Siarez goal was ridiculous but as much as I wanted to see Messi score the nd I was happy Suarez got a goal loke that.  We need his predatory instincts acute and ready to kill and that sort of finishing has been missing from him for parts if the season.

10214718,0,t3_5m9m90,I can answer for everyone here omg he is the best he will replace Iniesta the future of our midfield....I have personally not been impressed and find Gomes to be the much more useful player for size and defensive purposes and Rafinha to be the much more skilled dribbler and attacking player. Denis has shown the ability to control the midfield which is huge  and very much something that is needed long term. He can develop to be great but so far I have found him timid and always playing the easy ball  which is understandable for a new young midfielder in this system. I think the better time to ask this question will be next spring  when we have a more fulsome and non speculative view. ,Barca,dc1w9o4,18,t5_2s561
10216474,0,t1_dc1w9o4,I have to say that I disagree with your claim Gomes is the more useful player. That being said Denis Suarez will not replace Iniesta because he does not play like Iniesta. Although he is an effective dribbler his technique is different and tbh is quite unique due to his long legs but it works. One of his strongest assets is that he provides exactly what rakitic cannot a calm yet incisive presence on the ball. Additionally he combines well with messi. Lastly Xavi has come out and said that not only does he fully back dennis but he is also in contact with him which should be a promising sign. I think both players were strong investments but i think Suarez can really be a long term barca midfielder   ,Barca,dc23fek,12,t5_2s561

Its also crazy how he can score a goal while Roberto cannot just shows how good he is in the offense and the way that he always smiles while barely getting any play time just shows that he is a positive human being overall.,Barca,dcf7726,15,t5_2s561

10415474,0,t3_5p62zl,He was very talented but an issue in terms of coachability and selfish play style. The genesis is that in La Masia he was always the best of his class and was given a contract by Nike early when the rest of the kids were still making peanuts. As you can imagine being distinguished from your peers in such a measurable way can go to a young kids head and as a result there were always rumorsmentions of behavioral issues. When he played for the first team he would bring incredible pace and dribbling but often tried to do too much and in the end and would lose the ball when there was a pass to play. Ultimately it was my impression that in the back rooms of Camp Nou it was decided that despite his talent he was more trouble than he was worth and so he was let go.  ,Barca,dconube,16,t5_2s561

Most players donating end up public even when the players dont share it and most of the times to support a certain case as in cancer etc they end up on camera to show their support as possible requested by the group theyre donating to.The groups that they donate to often like to make it public too for their own benefit. I personally think Ronaldo has considerably more ego than Messi but this isnt a case of ego or wanting attention. Its just media.uLotusNoirYeah but thats media who decides to publish things more not Ronaldo or Messi. All they can do is either keep things secret or public.

10791647,0,t3_5ubwht,Who cares? Everyone want to see him playing Xavi role when we needed to buy some good mf we buy Gomes and then Messi moves to mf  its not as if hes doing great when he goes very deep.Last night When Madrid were down  they were taking many shots outside box of their goals came from outside box. Thats the way to play. Even half in form Ronaldo will be in Ballon dor race reaon is hes main man st Madrid and get every chance to score while here Messi is happy to play as feeder role.Messi has won just  Ballon dor in his peakafter while Ronaldo has won th is likely  after  thats just unacceptable. ,Barca,ddt2yve,1,t5_2s561

He was participating in all the regions of the field went wide whenever Messi stayed too central came back to defend pressed the defenders and GK with utmost ferocity. He put in a bloody good shift yesterday. Its not his fault that our dysfunctional midfield couldnt get the ball to him. He tried his hardest.I honestly dont know what do we do now. The coach is out of ideas and I saw the same disappointed and crushed Messi that we saw for Argentina. I saw a broken Pique who didnt even show a sliver of emotion when that penalty went in. I saw a subdued team one which seems to have been destroyed emotionally. I dont want these guys to win it all but I dont want them wallowing in misery. I want that happy team back when everyone was smiling radiant content. I dont want them to get destroyed mentally because of a few shaky performances. I really didnt like how the home crowd whistled at our players when they were holding the ball after conceding. That is not going to do anything positive to these players morale. I know it is frustrating but Camp Nou is our fortress and the cules always acted like they are the th man. The th man has to stand by the team.

Keita was an great player at multiple positions but he was never going to be a starter in midfield. I think Sergi Roberto is also a very solid player on multiple positions but I never thought he had enough potential to be a world class midfielder that we really need. Also at Juvenil A and Bara B Sergi Roberto was always just a solid midfielder I never thought he would become an amazing midfielder.gtAnd its not as if he has been given the chances he deserves and has not come good  I dont see why Sergi cant be given that chance.What do you mean he hasnt been given a chance? Sergi Roberto has played in midfield countless of times. Last season he played almost  matches and we still had Dani Alves. The two seasons before that he also played  matches and those were all in midfield.

Is there a place to go for Barca supporters in Madrid?And is there a rough idea of when tickets for the home game vs Juventus go on sale? How quickly would they sell out?

11547586,0,t3_64tjyx,I honestly dont think we were battered or embarrassed as much as you guys say. Ref made some poor calls that really should have ended in a penalty for us and a red card for them our players were the ones getting battered all game. On top of that Buffon made two GOD tier saves just unbelievable. Lastly Juve capitalized on only a couple chances. I think Dybala is amazing and that played a good part. We had a couple shots that just barely went wide or were barely saved whereas their fringe shots went in. We were without Busquets arguably our most important player after Messi. We were at a Juve stadium where they havent lost in like  games. We were at their fortress conceded some unlucky goals got unlucky in front of goal and had some bad calls against us. Seriously this could have been  or  easily. Suarez and Iniesta should have scored we should have had a penalty...I dont think that we will even come close to overcoming this one. Were out at this point and this season will be painful. But dont put everything on the players seriously  and this is coming from the guy who rage quit  seasons ago when we won the treble I was like fuck this Im out after being a fan for  years. I really dont think all of this is on the players. Weve had shitty really just shitty calls that have fucked us so hard you all dont really realize it. You think its just the easy way out or a conspiracy theory to blame refs but weve had goals a meter over the line denied penalties where players on the opposition played like goalies not given and just generally shitty luck. ,Barca,dg4x6hl,2,t5_2s561
