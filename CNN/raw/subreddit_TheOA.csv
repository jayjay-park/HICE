I understand people have very little knowledge about ancient human rituals involving dance and therefore these movements look weird to them and they think its stupid because all they can focus on are the physical movements themselves and not anything deeper about the scene. Its like when high school kids watch complex films and just say it was stupid after because they didnt get any of the meanings the films was conveying because they werent thinking at all about it.

10113912,0,t3_5kmq67,Im probably looking at it wrong but all I could think of when she requested they leave their front doors open was that these kids parents are very absent. One or more of the kids were shocked by her request because they knew how insane it was and more than likely expected a parent to catch on quickly and figure out what they were doingwhere they were going each night. I think the absent or lack of understanding parent theme was common throughout the show. Really BBA was the only one this didnt pertain to directly but she effectively filled the parental void within the group trying to help out Steve and running back into an active shooter situation My Boys!!!. The OAs adoptive dad got angry over her nightmarespremonitions and he never walks her into the FBI I dont believe he is FBI btw counselors office? Her adoptive mom wanted the blind girl for completely selfish reasons always needing her and wanted to keep her medicated...neither one of them up until the dad allows her to run to the school tries to understand her which is probably why she was so hesitant to tell them what happened when she was away and this was thrown right in our face during their dinner at the Olive Garden when her mom slaps her across the face as she describes her experience. Steves dad doesnt try to talk to him to understand his aggressive behavior and when Steve after his involvement with The OA wants to open up to his dad he is escorted away to boarding school and lets not forget he pays off the parents of the kid he punched in the throat. Jesses parents are deceased but his apparent legal guardian sister just lets him do whatever he wants and does drugs with him? Bucks parents dont understand what she is going through or maybe dont accept it and that she is taking testosterone to physically change. Frenchs mom is lost in her own world with French effectively playing the parental roll for his sibling and when he challenges his mom at the scholarshipawards dinner she plays the you dont know what Ive been through card and Ive always wanted whats best for you but you are strong and can do it on your own crap. It literally takes the parents days to discover that their front doors have been left open at night and that they have been gathering with a potentially mentally disturbed individual in an abandoned house and lets remember they used to all be gathering there prior to buysell drugs...who doesnt notice any of this? Steves parents then blame The OAs parents for letting their crazy daughter interact with the neighborhood kids deflecting their own lack of parenting onto another parent which is very common behavior by parents these days. You can even take it a step further and apply it to the school shooter. Im in no way saying that every parent will always be able to catchstop bad or emotional behavior but there are signs and I think this is why they chose the school shooter scenario as the event the movements end up being used to stop.The OA is at first trying to get back to her birth father of whom she associates with love. Then after capture and meeting Homer she is trying to get back to him...again love. The  kids and BBA are all longing for acceptance and love and they find it amongst each other creating their own little family Principal to French  or maybe to BBA? Why are you hanging out with those kids? You guys have nothing in common.

10135320,0,t1_dbr2tns,I could give examples of its connection to Missouri as well.        Real quickly both Missouri and Michigan have the towncities of Crestwood and St. Louis.  In ep theres some language to take a look at namely that the hospital in St. Louis Crestwood Mo is  minutes from St. Louis Mo BUT Crestwood MI is  hours from St. Louis MI.  Now I get that maybe the OA was picked up and taken to the nearest hospital so that makes sense...because detroit is literally  minutes from Crestwood MI and if she was found near there shed like have gone to that hospital.        Something to take a look at is the citdrop also in ep i believe called Jefferson City which is  hours from St. Louis and Crestwood Mo.  While not the exact name there is also a Jefferson Township in Michigan that is also  hours away from Crestwood Mi.        I guess my point is that as nutty as this show is with dimensions and all that jazz its really interesting that there are two locations that exist with so such striking similarities.

10232095,0,t3_5j10v4,Apologies if this has been mentioned already I didnt get through all the comments so this might have been brought up before.  I noticed that the FBI agent lied to Prairies parents when they asked him Im sure youve heard what happened today and he said No Im paraphrasing when clearly OA had just told him all about her disastrous day  I think he was lying to gain her trust as someone on her side rather than a psychologistcounselor in a power position this happened right before he suggested they do something together as a family. So if that is true then its not unreasonable to think that he was also lying to French when he says that OA never talked about her experience locked up with HAP only about French and the other kids and BBA again paraphrasingsummarizing. So if he did know about all the stuff OA went through whether to the same degree as she told the kidsBBA or not then perhaps he was planting the Amazon books because he thought she was delusional and wanted her to get the help he felt she needed but without betraying her himself. He also doesnt have power to prescribe drugs since hes only a counselorpsychologist not a psychiatrist. If this is the case it also doesnt mean that he had any knowledge of HAP as another person has mentioned might be the case. To me that seems quite a stretch but then again who knows.Also regarding OA being able to read when she cant find the password for the internet in episode  she rustles through the house through the cork board through different papers looking for it. I suppose theres a small chance she was looking for it written in braille but thats not very practical why would she think her parents would keep it written in braille if shes been gone for  years and also she wasnt so much feeling the papers as she rustled through she was looking. Plus shes taking those courses on creative writing and in order to enroll in courses like that Im pretty sure you need some basic reading skills at the very least Im assuming theyre community college courses or university continuing education courses. However I still think they were planted  have been rewatching from the beginning and she was focused on finding Homer right from the start before she would have had any time to order books or anything. We also see his video from  before she would have been able to receive any books she might have ordered. ,TheOA,dc3v5y7,1,t5_37af3

Wonder whathowif connection exists between their movements and  their ability to revive the dead...I would think though that the th movement they discovered could have a connection to sight based on the way they run fingers down their face and close their eyes. Then again perhaps its not one of the senses at all and just related to speech since they cover their mouths during the movement and also got it from someone who was revived and given the ability to speak and explain the movement.

How I believe Hap talked about that they used to think death ended when the breath stopped then the heart stopped etc. not sure of the exact quote But truly death is a process and we dont necessarily have a set point where we can say physical death has truly happened.

10402900,0,t3_5ol0xe,did anyone else go to the qampa last night? I did. I was kind of disappointed  not by Brit and Zal but by how the moderatorpodcast guy took up  of the qampa with his own questions which were all about film process which I guess makes sense since it was at the LA Film School  but they didnt say what the qampa would be about in the invite... so about  people got to ask questions and those questions were... about film process.There were people who actually drove up to the event from San Diego almost  hour drive plus it was raining last night and Orange County and other places... and there was one guy who flew in from Sri Lanka JUST FOR THIS. As a woman my first feeling on that is a feeling of creepiness especially since he seemed only interested in asking questions of Brit  of the  questions were given to him also he got to sit front and center but maybe he just really loved The OA. Anyway podcast guy really loved hearing himself speak. And also I suppose this is normal in Hollywood but he did his own form of fawning to Brit... he recounted this story about getting a letter from a publicist about a  year old girl who will be the youngest female director to ever debut at Sundance this year and he said he was thinking something along the lines of yeah but did she write direct act AND produce like Brit Marling did? Argh. Dude its not a competition actually Sundance is kinda but I think these kinds of comparisons are unhelpful for women in film. No need to put one woman down to elevate another one. Nothing new to reveal about plot except that I noticed that Brit and Zal in responding to almost the same question or maybe it was the same question had radically? different answers. Basically Brit thinks The OA is about how there are multiple truths not just one objective truth and Zal thinks The OA is a riddle and that they were clever little mathematicians putting this puzzle together for us. Oh and at the end the Sri Lanka guy was able to go up to and talk to Brit for about  seconds before her publicistmanager there were  of them had her leave the stage the stage was like  tall not a real stage so anyone could approach her but only the Sri Lanka guy got to talk to he. And he tried to give her a script or something which actorswritersproducers cant take from strangers because its intellectual property but I guess this guy didnt know that. She told him he would have to send it to her agent I think podcast guy maybe gave him her agents info. ,TheOA,dcn8hup,3,t5_37af3

10691496,0,t3_5su90v,Ok I think I got it. Prairie is in a mental hospital. They believe she has split personalities. Perhaps she was the only captive and all the others were just her own different personalities.There is scientific evidence that people with dissociative identity disorder can have multiple personalities and some of them can be blind and some can spontaneously see. I remember hearing about this a while back.Relevant I think a perfect use of this existing scientific evidence is to next make us believe that she has DID and thats how she regained her sight. It helps the story if there is actual scientific explanation for all of it... but then while all this really mindbending science is marinating and even Prairie doubts herself we find out its real all over again when Hap shows up.I think there is a very real chance that French the lacrosse player is an alternate dimensional version of Homer the football player as evidenced by that mirror scene. And the weird open doors thing is a way for them to travel back and forth between these different versions of themselves across dimensions. I think buck might be Rachel because buck seems to have a random vision from Rachels past with the car wreckage and the backpack in the middle of it. If this is the case its conceivable that all of the people in the abandoned house are hosts for dimensional travel and that one of them is actually Hap.If this is the case than maybe prairie is in a mental hospital and the kids realize that there is no possible way prairie could read those books because shes lived her whole American life blind and never developed the ability to sightread books. So they break her out of the hospital and she can at that point continue telling her story while the show keeps the element of doubt intact that she might still just be profoundly crazy. Its important they keep this alive.Theres also the chance that the white room prairie finds herself in is actually inside Homers NDE and thats how she is going to help him and the others escape. By communicating with them inside their NDEs from the outside. OMG maybe shes even the one who gives the sheriffs wife the fifth movement! Mindfuck Prairie said before that the way out for them is through the experiment. I think somehow she gets intertwined in that chase moment in order to escape. Which is why the audio tape in Haps lab shows men yelling that Homer is not his name because they can only see Prairie or maybe even French. Maybe French is breaking prairie out of a mental hospital while prairie is breaking homer out of his NDE all within some crazy multidimensional shitstorm. I need a drink.,TheOA,ddiqz0b,1,t5_37af3

If she never mentioned sound being a thing then it wouldnt be included. She might not have even known he was recording sound  I remember in the series there was just a camera set up but there would be no way of knowing if it picked up sound or not. Saying this I think this question would have crossed any logical persons mind at some point so Im assuming they done this on purpose and there will be a deeper reason. Ive noticed that hes almost obsessed with sound  the way he had his eyes closed whilst listening to Saturns ? sound before the police officer put a gun to his head and also by using the heart beat thing to tell if theyre lying. He uses this instead of the normal visual way of detecting lies. Maybe hes really sensitive to sound? Therefore the cries etc would bother him a lot? So maybe its to emphasize his obsession?

I have a  month old who decided to start walking this week so I can only OA when shes asleep. Haha ,TheOA,ddu2fgr,2,t5_37af3
10819608,0,t1_ddvxbn9,I mean no show is perfect so this could very well be a flaw. But honestly it just feels like OA wasnt sure what to expect but thought she couldnt go wrong with five strong guys. ,TheOA,ddvysno,1,t5_37af3
10822836,0,t1_ddvrh2n,Yea I think finding someone who is willing to help us and goes to that school would be extremely useful for that  .Also I think that for small things like the mascot being an eagle and school colours being blue and white it would be easy to choose a school among thousands.,TheOA,ddwasp6,1,t5_37af3
10832879,0,t3_5uotb9,This show is crazy. I dont know that I have been so profoundly overwhelmed by a television show before. Its really truly brilliant. ,TheOA,ddxc2tc,2,t5_37af3

10936309,0,t3_5w4d1x,Cant we just have one nice thing   LOL.  I admit to completely overanalyzing the series but its a nice distraction to the current events in this here United States that I am trying to ignore.  ,TheOA,de804re,6,t5_37af3
10941334,0,t1_de884c2,Definitely would like this.  Also Leon and his experiments. ,TheOA,de8is8w,1,t5_37af3

10964884,0,t3_5wep24,this ties into a theory I am working on right now! I am almost done with creating my post and should be up in an hour. I will look into this further as soon as I post and have time but I believe you are onto something! ,TheOA,deay89g,1,t5_37af3
11037347,0,t1_deimd4w,I have been to this exact filming location and it is indeed in Iceland along the southern roadway just passed the town of Vik.  It is an expanse of very cool mosscovered tundra though I never saw a red hut maybe that part CGI?,TheOA,dej2b9x,6,t5_37af3
11152984,0,t1_dew3yc7,Also it seems theres moments down in the mine and in the unfinished house where they have abnormally dilated pupils. Ill have to go back to confirm because I was tripping but I couldve sworn. Theres even a part when theyre out eating and Abel mentions a past boy in Praries life and how he called the toppings shrooms haha. ,TheOA,dew6g9y,4,t5_37af3
11170852,0,t3_5zagy9,After reading your comments I googled Lou theta and pages about Lou Gehrig and the Phi Delta Theta fraternity came up. Interesting because of the ALS connection! I still cant quite make heads or tails of it up but maybe says Lou theta... ,TheOA,dey7cxd,1,t5_37af3

11399388,0,t1_dfnx897,Yes I buy all that. But realistically I think theres also a production reason Hap moved Homer that way Scott was between Homer and OA when he needed to be resurrected and their dance routine looked better and was easier to film if they were on opposing ends of Scott.,TheOA,dfo3tto,1,t5_37af3
11469298,0,t1_dfvzgux,Oh gosh now I want to analyze The Discovery further Stranger Things...list goes on. The OA comes first!,TheOA,dfw1f42,3,t5_37af3

11504964,0,t1_dfw50bx,A lot of guys on the internet ask the other party to send nudes. Its a play on Haps NDEs. ,TheOA,dg036q1,1,t5_37af3
11536440,0,t3_64hdgg,Congrats on your first watching. I recommend watching again. You catch so many more things and it really is insightful.          Idk the comparison with ST. I have never watched ST and tbh I have no interest to. I tried to and lost interest  episodes in. The OA just captured my interest so much more.         I cant wait for the second season of The OA. I think it will set it apart from ST. At least Im hoping so. This show deserves SO much more recognition than it gets in my opinion. ,TheOA,dg3norl,1,t5_37af3
11554879,0,t1_dg37mkh,Completely agree. Some heavy themes that can get intense especially if youve dealt with suicide or bullying before.,TheOA,dg5qzks,1,t5_37af3
11577642,0,t1_dg8bv4v,Sorry I just binged the whole series and dont remember any Angie. There was Jaye who correct was just fucking Steve then there was Kathy with a K with a babys nose at the end. Was there someone else in there?,TheOA,dg8byka,1,t5_37af3
11751400,0,t3_67owv6,Am I like you?No! You are the original!,TheOA,dgs1u36,6,t5_37af3
