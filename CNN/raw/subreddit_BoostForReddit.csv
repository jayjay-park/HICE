7258869,0,t3_49e7sb,Not sure if this is reported hard to search on mobile.  I clicked a tumblr link was asked if I wanted to open the link in tumblr app or chrome.  I selected tumblr but then was not able to return.  Not sure if this is tumblr issue or boost handoff issue but I had to force quit boost and tumblr to get back to my feed since it would just take me back to tumblr over and over again.,BoostForReddit,d23a5wg,1,t5_3blbv

7314857,0,t3_4fk5y7,ampampampampampampgtBackForward buttons in internal browserWhat does this mean exactly?Thanks for fixing strikethrough text!  Also testing other formatting here. Ignore me.  . List . List . List  Bullet  Bullet  Bullet EditCouple of things... Numbered list still not rendering correctly for me. I suspect its because Im on KitKat.  Also  there needs to be a space after the bullet and numbered list markdown text when you press the corresponding button in the editorEdit When you use the fab to reply i think it should automatically collapse after you submit your reply. It remains expanded.  Edit Similar to above the fab remains expanded when you tap it then scroll comments down fab disappears then up again.  It should reappear as just the button not all the fab options.  Edit Perhaps edit  is supposed to be this way?,BoostForReddit,d29ned0,2,t5_3blbv
