268051,0,t1_cf8j6er,Yup Gigabyte dropped the ball pretty hard. There are tons of complaints about it on countless forums including theirs. Basically the way mine is one of the mm on the top is exhausting right about the VRM heat sink. Then with my radiator mounted to the rear port it creates a wind tunnel effect right over the VRM heat sink. I mean it powerful enough the you can feel the air rushing by. So you may want to try that.,battlestations,cf8jkxd,2,t5_2rdbn

270160,0,t1_cf8nvjc,Besides being a person who really wants reform in the whole system and would love to see certain laws taken off of the books marijuana Im looking at you there are some practical changes in the jailprison system that I think should be adopted by everyoneIn my position in the jail after a couple of years part of my job was to try to think ofenact changes in the jail that would promote good behavior among the inmates.It all comes down to positive reinforcement.  When you have a person or group of people whos behavior you want to change and you are looking at using a carrot or a stick the carrot always works better.  In my specific case we used things like hotcold carts for the dorm with the best behavior hot carts might have hotpockets or pizza or something cold carts would have ice cream drinks etc...  We also had a system that would allow us to play movies in certain dorms.  So if a dorm was good they might be able to have a specific movie play or we could allow the best behaved dorm to pick the Friday night movie.  Little stuff like that can make huge differences in such an environment.  But there are too many people that think that if you are an inmateprisoner that you should never be allowed to have any kind of enjoyment.  And that only causes boredom and stress to grow in an environment where you really dont want a bunch of bored stressedout people.Does that answer your question?,battlestations,cf8rge7,50,t5_2rdbn

That you and your friends are saving and creating an account for him so that he can get back on his feet is huge and it just might be the thing that keeps him going while hes in there or the thing that keeps him from going back to prison.  Recidivism rates are extremely high among inmates due to the fact that a lot of them dont know what to do with themselves when they get out or nobody gives them a chance to get back on their feet.

If you dont all they have to do is do a password recovery which puts them in privilege mode on a switch or a router and do a sh run and they can read your password outloud. If you did enter that command best they can do is erase your config and start all over.I will add though I see way too many people using Cisco or class as a password because it is all cisco and a lot of other people use in a lab environment. People do it as a force of habit when they study and when they get out into the real world they type in the commands and they dont realize they basically set their router password to AdminAdmin.Edit Just some advice from someone who is taking their CCNA in about  hours.,battlestations,ch532k4,3,t5_2rdbn

My desktop in this case is set as the server because it has the keyboard and mouse attached and my mac is set up as the client. Once configured and activated my cursor on the windows screen on the left will move on over to my macbook on the right just like when you have a dual monitor setup.

So Im not sure how they would sound in a bigger room farther away. The Daytons are good speakers especially given the price and for your use.Alright so heres how the chain will go.Plug one end of the RCA to RCA cable I linked into the RCA audio out on your TV. Plug the other end into the Amplifier I linked as well.Get the speaker wire theres some that comes with the Daytons but Ive heard its pretty flimsy so to speak strip the ends heres a good tutorial if you dont know how then connect each speaker to the Amplifier keeping in mind channels and polarity etc. There you have it! Turn on the amp before the TV starting with the Volume knob all the way down then slowly moving it to find the sweet spot without distortion  then enjoy. Your TV should automatically switch its output to the speakers. If not dig around in the settings. Placement is also important!

1586604,0,t1_cjf1lls,So far I really do enjoy the ultrawide setup vs dual screen monitors. Dual screen has its advantages but you tend to waste the second monitor for full screen content sometimes. That being said the  aspect ratio is not without issues. It seems lots of content and games are not designed to operate at that ratio and at best requires some tweaking to get the resolution proper. In some games like Dota  the UI doesnt scale properly and you have FOV issues that require mods to work around and still dont properly work. UI elements in a lot of games dont work so well either.That being said in game for most FPS games the  ratio is very immersive and I quite enjoy it.,battlestations,cjf5vox,1,t5_2rdbn

1907314,0,t1_ckj0cpl,I managed to the Corsair CAEU Vengeance  USB Wireless on a deal on Amazon thanks to rBuildapcsalesukTheyre excellent. They dont take long to charge the charge normally lasts me all day of listening to music or gaming. They are very comfortable the weight takes a couple days to get used to and now I dont notice at all. The memory foam cushions are extremely comfortable and they dont keep much heat in either.The sound quality is great for games and more than reasonable for music unless youre a huge Audiophile. They will also charge while youre plugged into the usb unlike some wireless headphones Ive had before so thats a bonus. The range is weaker than I wouldve liked but I can still use them in the next room if im closer to the receiver. Allinall theyre one of the better headphones Ive used and Ive been through probably more than  in the last  years in fact they are better than most wired ones Ive had in the past. They also look awesome if I do say so myself. I feel the price of them is just about justifiable if youre in the market for some uppertier headphones!,battlestations,ckj0pij,1,t5_2rdbn

I try to be honest and tell them its a simple fix but they usually still end up getting rid of them.

2621140,0,t3_2puxln,have any of you ever thought about using a projector to get a huge screen and place it far away from you? i believe the reason the eye gets so tired from all day using the computer is because the screen is close to the eye. the human eye was made to look at objects from  feet away. thats the natural resting distance where the eye muscles do not tense at all. by the end of the day your eyes are blurry because the muscles are dead tired. i have not yet tried it but i will soon. with a big screen you can read letters on it even if far away. i also have bought myself a set of lenses that doctors use to find someones myopia. ive fiddled with it a lot and there is actually no way to get completely clear letters from  feet away. no matter what i do the letters on the computer screen are always a little blurry. meanwhile letters far away are very clear. even if i set my prescription off by a little bit or cylindrical angleastigmatism correction off by a bit its still clear. meanwhile on a computer screen even if im off by  degrees its blurry.i believe that not viewing objects up close for long periods of time while growing up will also prevent myopia. for thousands of years man did not need glasses and still today in undeveloped countries they dont. yet look at developed countries almost every one needs glasses. even in the west before the age of computers the prevalence of myopia is not high like it is today.for me right now i believe doing this will slow down the acceleration of my myopia and also keep me from having so much pain and blurriness. right now i am increasing my prescription by about . diopters a year. for normal people it takes  years.,battlestations,cn0pyok,2,t5_2rdbn

2695405,0,t1_cnae3z0,It is awesome.  I barely followed the game and saw by the abundance of Youtube videos that people must have been playing somehow.  Apparently there are different pledge packages that give you access to the first Module called Arena Combat which is basically deathmatch versus drones or other pilots online racing and free flying in a closed arena. This lists the packages but you can buy individual ships for a little cheaper.  If you look the cheapest one came with something called Arena Commander Pass.  Not all the packages come with that.  You need a ship  the pass in order to play Arena Commander.  This is where you can buy that pass  So basically find a ship you like and pay  and you can have access to arena commander.  Apparently you can sell back everything  of what you spend in order to get different ships.  Here is the kicker though if you buy a pledge package that has ship insurance and other bonuses when you sell that package back your not selling ONLY the ship but every other thing in the bundle.  It doesnt make too much of a difference now but the packages seem to change and you may lose some of the value if you constantly cash in what you have spent to try the different ships.  I could be terribly wrong.  Read up on rstarcitizen .  There is a massive amount of info on the game and its development timeline.,battlestations,cnaepmg,3,t5_2rdbn

3170182,0,t1_coqdp47,Ranking up in CS has to do with MVPs and topmid fragging. Sure you can rank up after  wins while doing terrible but the best and fastest way to rank is a lot of MVPs get kills and be a team player and winning. If you get most of the MVPs then you are probably a better player than those around you and will get ranked accordingly. The ranking system kind of sucks because Silver is terribly filled with smurfs and people who dont give a shit which makes it hard to rank up to novas and past. BUT if you are a good player and help your team you should be able to rank up.Edit So...does anyone want to explain why I am being downvoted?

Then theres the question of value  why light money on fire for a really trifling reason besides to be a dick and say you can waste money? That just rewards companies that produce useless things purely to make rich people feel better at the expense of the capital on enriching the lives of potentially a lot more. Oh and I hate giving money to companies that are terrible at UI making any product. I have to switch inputs constantly on my UMP and it pretty much ruins the experience of them for me now after  months of spending  seconds to switch when on my U it takes maybe  seconds with the menu.

4149027,0,t1_crsskve,This case is definitely one of the more silent windowed cases around. They put a lot of effort in the sound dampening material the side vents for the intake fans and even the panels to block off unused fan slots that have acoustic baffling on them. Its probably the best case for  if youre looking for silence cable optimization and airflow. Of course since ive just built a rig into its bigger brother the R i can attest that the R with no window is damn near dead silent. I cant tell its on sometimes. In short if you want silence this case is great  get the nonwindowed version for sure. Its an upgrade in silence compared to just about everything else around. ,battlestations,crt7cjv,2,t5_2rdbn

I added a mm fan while moving the included mm fan to the inside of the frame out front and x mm fans on the side.I dont really have any way of measuring the noise levels. But compared to a Zalman z and nzxt source  which have relatively enclosed cases the corsair t I would say is a bit louder. Recently built Zalman and nzxt based rigs for two buddiesThe openness of the case is a double edged sword when considering airflow and noise. I would have liked removable filters on the front and side panels but their built in. The PSU does have a removable filter on the lower portion that is colour matched very neat touch by corsair.Its a great case overall fits full size PSUs and GPUs.   would recommend.,battlestations,csqkkt2,3,t5_2rdbn

It also suffers from sleep issues  the latest Revision of this model fixes the sleep issues RevA.The UH x Rev also appears suffer from the sleep issue  Im currently doing preliminary testing Ive only had it a week so cannot say conclusively one way or another.One thing is painfully obvious to me the UxYYH model range is beautiful slim bezel IPS and one of the best monitors you can currently buy if you have multipleuse in mind.

4651996,0,t3_3eos45,The desk is a single piece of wood I sprayed with clear coat suspended with Lbrackets driven into the studs. Above the desk the monitor speakers DAC and amp are mounted to another plank. Above that is a third plank. I didnt take pictures of them because theyre still messy from this weekends final install. The desk has an angular cut on the left side so the closet door will open! This setup takes up about half the space as my last setup and the actual desk space is much larger now with the speakers and monitor being suspended. The amp is a smsl . The DAC is a USB  channel audiomidi interface from  years ago. I only have it installed for an easy headphone output and in case I want to record some music. The speakers are hand me downs from the family stereo with the grills removed and a coat of flat black paint. Not the best quality by anymeans but much much better than dell computer speakers. My cable management is not yet on fleek sadly.All three shelvesdesks  hardware is probably  but if you used particle board you could get the price down to .

4994866,0,t3_3jcnqe,The monitors are pair of  Apple Cinema Displays which come the lovely advantage of having only one cable going to each monitor. Theyre old but for my purposes certainly get the job done.The keyboard is a Leopold tenkeyless contraption with brown switches and by its side is a Wacom Bamboo Pen amp Touch graphics tablet. The cables for both of these are routed underneath the keyboard and through a hole in the desk. The brains of the operation is an Intel i NUC NUCiRYK with GB of Kingston RAM and a GB Crucial M. SSD running Arch Linux. Its practically silent which is a fantastic bonus. The monitors are mounted using a Silverstone ARMSC attached to an IKEA EXPEDIT desk and shelving unit which I believe is discontinued.

5174093,0,t1_cv9noq6,Bro. I. . Feel. Your. Pain.This is my first semester back in school after working for  years. The first thing I realized about grad programs mine at least is that everyone is here because they want to be. Not because their parents told them they had to go or because it was the next step or something. So its WAAAY more competitive than undergrad. Gotta stay focused as I sit here on reddit....Anyway. If you want any unsolicited advice one thing that I regret not doing as an undergrad was taking that internship seriously. Find a good one. Find the best one you can and chase it hard. Even if the company doesnt hire you thats a HUGE leap above the other job seekers with the same degree as you. Having mediocre grades from a middle of the road school and professional experience weighs way heavier than having good grades from a good university. ,battlestations,cv9o2kc,1,t5_2rdbn

5314752,0,t1_cvqyqa6,Stupidly long is extremely welcomed here. My day job is to work with computer hardware not necessarily real hardware  so this is very helpful to me. Ive got access to the local schools shop through some friends so all of the tools you mentioned are available. Ill buy the sandpaper you recommended once I find out the requirements of their ROS.I already ordered the waterbased polyurethane after your previous comment so thats done. Good to know its weakness. We will not have water in that room anyway but I will be certain there are no accidents on the table.Good call on  coats. We work with a lot of PC cases which are sometimes heavy and can accidentally bash into the sides of things during movement. I like your thinking for longevity. Its also something Id rather not have to redo given the somewhat substantial time requirement you mentioned for the project so best to do it right and strong the first time. Good points here.One question for you If I wanted the finished product to resemble the lowgloss surface of OPs desk what type of satin finish should I buy? I placed an order for these items but I can cancel them or just return them with absolutely no hassle so easily swapped for something superior or correct for the job if wrong Gerton table top Already own some IKEAbrand telescoping legs to allow for standingadjacent or seated video shoots. Just bought Minwax  Minwax Water Based Polyurethane  Pint Just bought General Finishes QTHS High Performance Water Based Topcoat  quart Satin is this correct? Just bought RustOleum H Varathane Oil Base Stain Quart EspressoThanks again! I sincerely appreciate your assistance. Ive been stuck on this project for more than a month now just by nature of being somewhat inexperienced with the process and I couldnt find anything prebuilt that fit our needs.

Unfortunately that keyboard recently broke i still have it under my bed waiting to see if i can fix it. But i acquired another mechanical within  weeks. As soon as you use one for a week using a rubberdome is simply ruined for you. If you look on amazon and arrange by price you can find some pretty cheap. But you would be better just putting some money away every week and get yourself a nice one. I promise you you wont regret it.,battlestations,cxaieqq,5,t5_2rdbn

Why are they not responsible for his actions?Because the guys who end up in prison are usually the result of mothers who carried to term children from men who didnt want to be fathers so theres no way for them to know what their fathers wouldve wanted for them.  In the cases where the father does want to be in the kids life theyre kept at a distance by family court system that is well known for pandering to women.The kids raised by single fathers tend to do relatively well.  If their mothers raise them then they bear responsibility for how their kids turn out.  The parents of those who do well in life are often credited as contributors to their kids success.  Why do you feel this need to shift the goalposts for those who fail at life?gtWomen really are responsible for all evil in the world because even if a man commits evil bitches should have prevented it.More strawman please.  More extrapolations to the absurd while youre at it.This isnt that hard.

6209508,0,t1_cyvg09y,I have the same quad amp triple monitor setups.Im commenting on the fact that people are spending  on ultrawide monitors that they only use for trading or their peripheral vision. You dont need hz p for anything you do on a surround monitor. You just end up driving your overall fps down and its not like your hz refresh rate and super high resolution is going to enhance your stock trading.I love my triple monitor setups and wouldnt do it any other way. And I get that people like to have all their monitors the same model for aesthetic purposes so I give people a pass on that as well.Like I said before I will most likely end up with an overkill setup like this as well. I want two ultrawide stacked on top of each other in the center and then two regular monitors in portrait configuration on each side. I only plan to run games on the one ultrawide though because I know that anything more than that is overkill and is just reducing my fps. The portrait configured monitors on the sides would be for web browsing and the ultrawide on the top would be for layering my OBS and Chats and for watching moviestv while I play. That kind of a setup actual makes logic to me and isnt just a waste of money for the sake of spending money.,battlestations,cyvgcvt,2,t5_2rdbn

Once seated at the front of the desk there is plenty of room to the sides where it doesnt feel cramped and has worked out quite nicely.  I am also able to tuck away my Pelican case filled with camera gear in the corner without getting in the way.Computer Built back in  iK Radeon HD  Corsair R CaseMonitors Asus VGQE  x Asus VSHPAudio Schiit Modi amp Magni Stack HyperX Cloud Gaming Sennheiser HD Rarely gets used KRK Rokit  MonitorsOther Zowie ECA Main SteelSeries Rival Backup Zowie GTFX Logitech G,battlestations,d02u5v4,5,t5_2rdbn

Having all your game peripherals Razer products shouldnt matter to people unless theyre telling you in a respectable way they dont recommend it. But some people go to the tenth degree and try to ridicule you in the process. If it works for you it shouldnt matter who makes it as long as it works. I have a gaming mouse that i got off from amazon for only  its an amazing mouse and Im getting better at playing on my new PC. I dont really know the maker of the mouse because i never heard of them but its a really good mouse. Your a Razer be a Razer fan.

7294152,0,t1_d277j2r,Yup its the Dell UW. Its pretty good if you want an ultrawide for productivity purposes. I live in Canada and this was by far the cheapest ultrawide i found. Got it for  on sale after tax and rebates. It comes factory color calibrated and the refresh can be overclocked to hz. havent done any gaming on it yet but im not a huge PC gamer so gsync and freesync are not concerns. It has minor backlight bleed which is pretty much expected from all curved ips ultrawides but aside from that id recommend it if you can get it for that price. ,battlestations,d27anqm,4,t5_2rdbn

I havent personally had the opportunity to try any of the other popular high end headphones Audeze lcd   Sennheiser hds Hifiman HEs so I cant give my take on a direct comparison. I previously had the Beyerdynamic dt s and when I got those my reaction was wow...there are x instrument in this song I hadnt heard before. With the LCDX its wow...there is layers of music and details....Im not listening to music on speakers or headphones...Im in the center of an orchestra and can hear details from each instrument Extremely clean and detailed. After reading about every review I could find online it is a warmer headphone than say the HD. One review described it as being in the th row vs the st at a concert hall. But from my perspective it is so much better than anything else I had heard Im just blown away. You couldnt have convinced me to purchase these full price if I hadnt heard them. After three weeks of listening to them and going through my music library being able to hear new intricacies being able to tell how detailed and skilled a musician is with his instrument... I would be more than willing to pay for these in full. Thats about the best praise I can give it.  ,battlestations,d3avg6q,3,t5_2rdbn

PC consoles record player instruments khz Mame PC etc.I fool around with the acoustic guitar you can see on the bottom right of the pic and I have an instrument mic for it. My electric guitar also plugs in to the mixer instead of using an amp and my buddy brings his bass around from time to time. Besides playback this mixer also serves as my audio interfacesound card on my main PC. I can record any of the above sources with low latency.Admittedly its overkill for an amateur like me.

You might be surprised to know that MANY infosec professionals DefConHOPEBlackhatetc. speakers and actual hackers prefer OS X as its pretty much the only OS that allows easy access to Office which most of us unfortunately need to use even if we wish we could use open source applications while still retaining pretty much all Nix usability and features.  This allows us to actually do work and write documentation in the most common formats which is perhaps the most important aspect of infosec.  If you dont document your work its useless.

I was actually eyeing the same exact monitor that you have Acer x UQWHD but wasnt able to make a decision. How is the monitor? Would you recommend it? The refresh rate is what makes me hesitant. I wanted to bump up to Hz but I understand this monitor is capped at Hz. Secondly I was looking same as you to mount the monitor I have right now above the new monitor I get whichever it ends up being. How does it feel? Is it comfortable to look at as opposed to the normal side by side setup?Finally what exactly did you use to mount your monitors? I was eyeing this guy Any tips?Thanks in advance!btw Id love to see you do a full blown build if this is only a budget station,battlestations,d7kecim,1,t5_2rdbn

9551068,0,t1_d9q8ywr,So it really is  Ohms? I still dont know why Audeze claims a different impedance than audiobot. I wont give you a lecture but I really recommend you taking a look at some high voltage Amps like the Lyr   generally considered the best pairing at least with the LCDs. Enough can be a misleading word in the amp business. My internal Sound Card can drive my LCDs loud enough but the sound is way to thin making it sound worse than my other pair of  cans. A high voltage amp like the Lyr will give Planar Magnetic headphones a big boost in sound quality and by big I dont simply mean the small audiophile big. Bass and Mids need more power to sound loud so a underpowered pait of LCDs will lack in those regions even if the Treble sounds just loud enough. Hope my tip can help. If youre looking for improving your sound in the most efficient way the amp I told you above will make wonders. Have a nice day behind your glorious desk.,battlestations,d9qd711,1,t5_2rdbn

It also improves the USB signal and removes the noise.The black box is the DAC. The signal comes from the audio interface and the DAC converts it to analogue. The DAC is connected to the headphone tube amplifier where the signal is amplified.The speakers are connected to the red equipment. This equipment is connected directly to the computer by USB. Unfortunately it does not have more digital inputs but I will replace him so I can connect him to the digital audio interface.,battlestations,dagca63,14,t5_2rdbn

I literally got that block of wood out of my back yard P Maybe Ill just paint it white so it matches well with the shelf above it... I had the speakers off the stand and theyre just too little to leave on the desk with just a piece of foam to try and put them at a nice angle. It felt like everything was just sitting on the desk in a row with nothing to fill in the space between the desk and the shelf. Ill try and get a full picture once I try some of those ideas of moving them around.

10754728,0,t1_ddozob4,Here is a protip from someone who has to do a lot of vhdl and verilog. Get a Topre board like the Realforce U or the Leopold FCC. When you are writing code your fingers will tend to fatigue very easily. Topre has the singular advantage over Cherry MX and its variants in that it supports your fingers completely on both the downstroke of the key and the bounce back upstroke. It makes a huge difference when coding.Yes it is expensive. But in my personal opinion doing a similar thing to what you are doing it was entirely worth the expenditure which isnt that much in the grand scheme of things. Eliminated my finger pain and finger fatigue that I was having with extended sessions on Cherry MX boards blues and browns in particular.,battlestations,ddp9ov1,3,t5_2rdbn

Your kid likes riding bikes but he isnt a professional. He saw someone mountain biking on tv and hasnt done it before would like to try but still isnt overly excited. Do you A Get them the standard kid bike for  the one which will be completely fine for anything and everything theyll ever use it forB Do you get the mountain bike kids version with shock mounts and some other good stuff for  orC Do you purchase the PRO bike with features that only professionals or more advanced enthusiasts would be able to use actually use and want to use .

The degree prepares you to evaluate solutions and shows you a couple neat tricks but it can be a trap to always look for genius optimizations.ARM is nice because I typically start at  MHz with debug information baked in. Turning on the optimization flag and upping clocks to  MHz makes me feel like a speed demon with x performance thanks to DSP instructions and raw clocks.,battlestations,dg6sy0o,2,t5_2rdbn

11638880,0,t1_dgf9khu,CUDA is basically a library used for GPUbased computation. Some computational tasks can be parallelized which means that the CPU allocates some processing for overhead and routing and the GPUs split the process into discrete parts because each individual part is more or less congruent. A good example is password cracking  you can use a divide and conquer approach whereby hash tests are accelerated across different GPU cores which is more efficient and faster than distributing them across a multithreaded CPU process. If you can model a process as an algorithm with repetitive childprocesses there is a good chance it can be parallelized. But not all processes benefit from this. I use these for cryptanalysis and quantitative financial modeling among other things.If you want an ELI basically CPUs do things by addition or subtraction. GPUs do things for tasks that support it by multiplication or division.A higher level example might be I need to find a book in the library. Instead of searching every bookshelf in every room I have a team split up the library into quadrants or octants and search them individually.,battlestations,dgfa3lf,31,t5_2rdbn
