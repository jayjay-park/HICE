8376342,0,t3_4uc8if,So very true. I had each of those struggles and still do. Though to be very very honest I did say men and women both face the same .. though women do face a lot of issues when doing things on thr own. Accessing bank having financial freedom and exercising that freedom are obviously quite big barriers. Traveling alone especially in India. Eating alone Wanted to eat  in a nonveg restaurant. BF was vegetarian never went. Post break up went and kept getting weird looks as to why a woman be eating alone in a fine dining spot.  Add watching movies alone. ,IndianFeminism,d5olc0m,2,t5_3fkgd

8733773,0,t1_d6xczu4,I shouldve said its not entirely a gender issue. If itd been a lady from the slums acting this way she wouldve been handled differently. If itd been outside doyouknowwhomydaddyis Delhi she wouldve been handled differently. If thered been any women staff in the police station shedve been handled differently. But your point is not entirely invalid. ,IndianFeminism,d6xd963,2,t5_3fkgd
9250293,0,t1_d8oj3ye,gtI can look for it over the weekend  If we are looking for rapes as reported by NGOs and womens organisations based on surveys they took i.e. cases that have not stood the test of law then all acquittals must be considered false accusations also cases that have not stood the test of law. How can all acquittals be considered as false accusations? And what are basing your comment on that surveys by NGOs of rape cases are ones that have not stood the test of law? gtBut then you go on to contradict yourself by saying...So as of today popular rhetoric towards rape victims is better. Its not a good situation simply because its slightly less worse than it was before. It is still awful. And I think it is slightly less worse for false accusers too. Now with the Rohtak sisters incident and even the Jasleen one the view has changed and following that logic it has become better. gtUnfortunately it sort of is. Public attention is limited funding is limited  and neither seems as all around as the unfairness you perceive to be.   The unfairness that I speak of is not some vapid perception of mine. It is the state of affairs. Im not basing it out on some anecdotal evidence of mine.  And you speak of funding and public attention going away from the actual fact that law is on the side of the victim in both these scenarios. Societal perception in a country like  ours is a joke. ,IndianFeminism,d8ojisi,1,t5_3fkgd
