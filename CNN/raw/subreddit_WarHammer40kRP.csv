10609886,0,t3_5rtswp,As the Marine descents he reflects on his past life. From the empowering origins as a soldier of the Lion to a traitor Marine of Luther and then tossed into the wrap as food for hunger Chaos souls. But it has all led to this. From this point forward there is no more ties to the past.Vicor his new name once dawned to hide his hertiage and great shame the new title has given him power  over himself over his past.  Vicor Loraxson former son of the Lion former leader of the Festivals of Death. A broken chaos tainted marine.No longer! With Tzeentchs blessing and a Chaos infused blade he knows he can murder anyone conquer any planet. Rising from the ashes of his failures Vicor reachs his ship at the bottom of the acropolis. A small single class Gunship Vicor has always found this gunboat amusing. The original design comes from the Imperial Inquisitior Gregor Eisenhorn long rot his soul. From the loading ramp emerges a deformed mutant. What was once a man is now a cruel parody of himself. Irony is favored by Tzeentch. The mutant once an Imperial Navy Admiral now serves me in all matters confidental. A lieutenant of sorts the mutant once known as Landser looks after my cabal of secrets. One could never find a more loyal servant if Chaos allowed such a thing as loyalty. No fear kept Vicors servants in line. Filth get my gun cutter ready. We are done on this reeking world.As Vicor boards his ship a quick survey of the docking bay  provides a small reason for the smile that slowly stretches across Vicors face.Like any good Inquisitor should Vicor had formed a small cabal of loyal servants. Although no Inquisitor Vicor knew a smart idea when he saw one.To the left is Midas  his personal Tech adapt and savant. Vicor can feel Midas looking at him but beneath his robes cowl  Vicor can see nothing  perhaps there was nothing there. Midas never spoke never answered. Beside Midas a brutish Marine once a World Eater now he was Vicors bodyguard and muscle. Once a servant of Khorne bested in a conflict long since forgotten he swore his service to Vicor after having his mouth sewn shout so he could not praise Khorne.The final member was also the least imposing. A short female. Any mortal would consider her beautiful. The tight black bodyglove hugs her figure as if it was a piece of skin. Her dual blades resting comfortably on her hips. She had a swagger to her step. Of his cabal she was the newest member and the deadlist. Once a death cult assassin Vicor foiled her assassination attempt on his life. Instead of killing her for her insolence he turned her. Still unsure of her faith he always has an eye on his deadly mistress. As Vicor walks to this seat the sense of pleasure at a successful mission flows from him to his cabal. The mood is a positive one onboard the gun cutter.Distracted by his own thoughts Vicor fails to notice his shadow sneak behind some storage barrels in the loading bay.,WarHammer40kRP,ddabud3,1,t5_3ei9t
