6987157,0,t3_4be4lx,I with you about hating to be spawn camped. Im an ok level thirtysomething but definitely just a casual player. Ive had that happen to me plenty of times and I hate it. That being said... I was on a team recently where my team was dominating the other team for a couple of matches. I literally hung back in the middle of the map but unfortunately it did no good. The other team was just dominated. One of them got through to me and I ended up splatting them pretty easily. Honestly...wasnt really much else I could do. I think maybe the spawn camping is more a result of bad matchmaking than anything else.,Saltoon,d18c2no,1,t5_390l9
