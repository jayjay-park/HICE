1592485,0,t3_2cijuu,I think thats a fair price given the new appliances and ample space. However the location sucks if you ever want to do anything in Manhattanbe closer to the trendier parts of Bushwick. I would maybe try and come in a little lower if you do decide to move forward but overall I think the realtors arent going to have too much trouble getting some one in there especially considering rents tend to be higher during the summer months when everyone is moving. So if they dont accept a lower offer.. its still a fair price.,Bushwick,cjfwiz0,1,t5_2s1hk

8985631,0,t3_53c5ob,Visually its not the most appealing area but its definitely an up and comer in the BushwickRidgewood area. Youll be fine around there but always be aware of your surroundings. That applies to all neighborhoods though. I dont know your taste but there are TONS of bars in that area. Your closest ones are around the MyrtleWyckoff area. Check them all out!,Bushwick,d7rxnz9,5,t5_2s1hk
8992669,0,t3_53c5ob,Gates here.  I work until  pm daily and never have not felt safe but I am also a man.  The area has improved significantly in the last few years.  Bars are opening along Broadway.  Vacant lots and derelict properties are being developed. Recently the city installed halogen street lights by the subway which really chase away the shadows. There are still bad areas still And definitely make sure you lock up at night but I would not sweat it.,Bushwick,d7ss30t,2,t5_2s1hk
