6706555,0,t3_47hblb,  with rice.But seriously it looks... alright. I think theres some issues but I might be wrong.KingIve never liked the SensorJumpShip combo in carrier groups. Sensors in carrier groups should be mobile to find and bait the enemy. JumpShips should be able to stay on a JP to allow transsystem carrier ops. These two roles are mutually exclusive.  Additionally the antimissile sensor is massive. You have mkm missile detection range but no AMM to engage missiles out that far.  Queen Good overall. I might drop some PD for some additional speed or hangar space. Carriers should stay out of missilesensor range. With fighters having .bkm range this should be possible. Additionally it needs a missile sensor of its own should it be deployed somewhere where its safety isnt guaranteed.Pawn Looks fine to me. Keep it with the Queens or even further back. Absolutely no reason this ship should be near explosions.  Knight You have two twin guass cannons with one fire control. I think it would be better to have one quad guass cannon with one fire control or two quad guass cannons downsized with two fire controls. For Guass Cannon PD you generally want a  ratio of fire controls to turrets. Guass turrets should also always be Quad. Downsizing Guass cannons doesnt have a penalty so a twin fullsize is equivalent to a quad halfsize except RNG is more stable on the quad halfsize.  Bishop This is probably my least favorite design. I can see the Bishop synergizing decently with the Knight to get close and deal some heavy damage but doing so leaves the King without enough PD. Also you dont have any good options for AntiFAC or antiFighter which is what this class should be doing well imo.  I would almost downsize the bishop to FAC size throw a downsized PD guass turret on it and deploy it in higher numbers. Keep the Knights with the King and the let Bishops slide in unnoticed after volleys to clean up disabled ships. With enough Bishops and the PD Gauss Turret theyll be able to PD for themselves especially with higher speed and smaller laser that can contribute to PD with the smaller size And higher speed theyll more easily be able to attack salvodisabled ships. Additionally the smaller laser combined with a faster Laser fire control would allow them to be utilized in an antifighterantifac role.Rook Looks fine but I didnt look too hard at the missiles it fires.,aurora,d0d0kk5,3,t5_2rw9f

I will usually lay in an extra fuel tank and engineering section or two at the beginning so I dont forget and then come back at the end of a checklist like above to add more. Carriers are another thing I tend to mess up because I forget to check that keep excess Q button and dont leave quarters for the fighter pilots.

7429225,0,t3_4h1cq9,You should post your beam ship design and if your sensors are on another ship that design as well. Most of them time its just a matter of sensor resolution mismatch.Gauss cannons are suppose to auto fire on anything they can see in final fire mode it sounds like you only have a thermal lock on the missiles but dont have a size  sensor to lock onto the missiles for your gauss cannons to fire.,aurora,d2mnlzn,1,t5_2rw9f

7492331,0,t1_d2s31oo,Alright challenge accepted. Ill post another comment when I finish designing something I think can do it. A few questions Is TN tech included in that K RP cap? Are module techs included in that cap? How many main ships missile boats do I get to do the job? How many support classes do I get to do the job? Finally how many support ships do I get to do the job?,aurora,d2tu5pt,1,t5_2rw9f

7805833,0,t1_d3tb3zm,since the stream of minerals can work bouth ways u can set up a cargo that will carry to a pickup point then a loop slave tg will jump in and move it to the main base in the other system then will get mass drived to other point beside the reserve level.etc.so u can have enuff minerals trickle thru the pipe till it reaches few systems in . complete auto mode. u can even mine sorium and move it forward then refine it at destination.like send k units of duranium that will reach Y and send forward k to W then send forward k etc,aurora,d3tfrft,1,t5_2rw9f

10032985,0,t3_5j99hw,First off its helpful to understand what the various bonuses do.Staff officers are related to a specific Task Force not to be confused with Task Groups. This has to do with the games way to softenforce a plausible naval hierarchy  ships are part of a task group who themselves are part of a task force. You can change which TF a TG is subordinate to in the Task Group Window where the other orders are given just at the top left corner of that screen.Now why would you even bother with all of that? Simply put task forces provide a means through which you can broadcast officer bonuses across your stuff just like sector commands do for civilian administrators.If I remember correctly the big boss of the task force gives a quarter of all his skills to every task group that is assigned to his task force provided his HQ is located in the same system as the task groups. If you just started the game your only Task Force is headquartered at your Homeworld and youd want flag bridges to serve as a mobile HQ for your mobile Task Forces which incidentally would make such a ship a literal flag ship of your fleets.The staff officers then finally come into play for various TFTG related calculations like how long your officers need to shout at their crew before your orders are being implemented in combat there is an order delay depending on the crews TF training and the communications skill of the communications officer of the TF or zero if TF HQ is in another system. A good staff can also give decent bonuses to TF training.Its worth to keep in mind that when it comes to stacking bonuses they stack multiplicatively  a  bonus from the captain of a ship with an admiral having another  bonus which once broadcasted becomes a  bonus makes for one times onepointfour times onepointonefive or      .  .  . or I hope this wasnt to much. I always seem to produce wallsotext.,aurora,dbfbp0k,5,t5_2rw9f
10119621,0,t3_5ktw0s,The only correlation that I can see is that in the design that can jump it happens to have a commercial engine and the design that cannot jump has a military engine. I would suggest trying to match commercial jump drives with commercial engines.On another note Im slightly confused by your designs and would initially believe them to be incapable of jumping themselves at all. The reason for this is that they are both classified as military ships and only military ships can utilize military jump drives and commercial ships likewise. Therefore when I saw that both of your military ships were using commercial jump drives I became a bit confused. Therefore if changing the engine doesnt work I would suggest building a military jump drive for your military ships with the tonnage of the jump ship matching the maximum jump capability of the drive to ensure maximum efficiency in jumping other ships.,aurora,dbqleag,1,t5_2rw9f
10178293,0,t3_5lomkd,Theres no way although you can usually tell the presence of even small colonies by the flow of freighters.  Its a bit easier to grasp if you enable territory colors on the galactic map and mark known or suspected AI systems with their colors.  Also a good way to keep track of spoiler races.Renaming system bodies with known datums like tracking station or suspected mining colony is also helpful.AFAIK the NPRs dont actually understand territory as such they wont keep out of yours and the interaction for their territory is diplomatic losses when youre scanned as being in the same system as their colonies. Thus if they colonize the same system as you without being Allied you can choose either speedy evacuation or war.  ,aurora,dbxrkp3,3,t5_2rw9f
10254999,0,t3_5muf5d,These tools are handy but you should think of a missile doctrine before you use them.   what is the job of the missile   on board of which kind of ship will it be used   which range do you need    The intended target of the missile influences warhead size as well as missile speed required to actually hit. Something that is good for destroying a k kms fast FAC might not be the best for destroying a heavily armored ship going k kms.   Will this missile be used in PDC as a planetary missile battery a missile cruiser or even a fast bomber? This will create size restrictions for instance.  Do you want to use max range sensors and fire at ships throughout an entire system or do want something smaller? Is a range advantage necessary or even wanted?      In my current game I chose size  missiles with a range of M km as my only antiship missiles. These can be used with maximum engine power without needing a too big fuel amount which would reduce missile efficiency in return.  As a consequence I cannot outrange most NPRs and non of the missile using spoiler races. On top of that they are more or less useless against a bombarding fleet because I would never be able to hit them.   But they are excellent to be used from crafts that are hard to detect and can close to the enemy ship without detection and fire.,aurora,dc6gksf,3,t5_2rw9f

10949993,0,t3_5wc2qh,Ive done pretty much the same for my civs and built massive terraforming and mining ships. For rp purposes I make them conscript class and think of them as penal colonies.

11116083,0,t1_ders8qa,I do not use hardening on my ships at all. I got some tech once in a while from conquered civilizations but I never managed to capture a ship with a high powered microwave on it. But to be honest I never captured all models so I cannot say for sure.  To be fair most NPR ships carry only one type of armament especially precursers and HPM makes for a bad main weapon due to the fact that they cannot kill ships... but in the end I would not prepare for them anyway. You do not want to use hardening because of economic reasons research points and resources and you wont bring early shields either. They simply suck and need some research before you even should start thinking about them.    But if you ever think of boarding enemy ships you should bring some HPM on your side. Nothing is better than capturing a ship thaz is completely intact minus some sensors.    Lastly keep at least the eccm. Invaders have pretty nasty ecm which will reduce the targeting range of missile fire controls or the accuracy of beam fire controls by   unless you have eccms which will negate some of the effect.,aurora,derzyqp,1,t5_2rw9f

11619301,0,t3_65t3b4,The main reason why you want to terraform . colonies is that youll get more workforce out of them. A perfectly habitable planet will only need to employ  of its population as agriculture a . colony will require quite a bit more. The extra population can be used to man financial centers and thus solve your money problem.As for mineral rich colonies I like to use automines on everything besides the few mines that Earth started with so habitability really isnt an issue for a mining colony.,aurora,dgd249x,5,t5_2rw9f
