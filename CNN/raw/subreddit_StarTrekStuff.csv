273609,0,t1_cf93k9a,Its a bit over stylized as a plush toy but its based on the very first Romulan starship ever seen in the episode Balance of Terror.  Most of the shots in the episode are of the underside but near the end we get a top view.  Heres a mini album with images from Trekcore.  The first screencap is from the original version the nd is the Remaster and the third is an underside from the original.,StarTrekStuff,cf94dky,1,t5_2x8ht
