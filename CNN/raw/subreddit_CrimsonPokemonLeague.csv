765931,0,t1_cgrc4nb,Yea I kinda had troubles without Suicune. Severe ones ... I just needed to pull off rest once. ONCE.Even with paralysis and Serene Grace Wind Cutter  rounds of utter helplessness determine that the luck gods hate me ... Anyway you know what? My rematch with you will be the fourth of my elite four battles. Yknow in order to redeem myself so the RNG gods are on my side next time!,CrimsonPokemonLeague,cgrcb8a,1,t5_3101t

828823,0,t1_cgyhkho,Well I guess it was a while since I read the rules so whatever.  Im going to come back later with my main team but I still feel that your disconnects the other day gave you quite an advantage.,CrimsonPokemonLeague,cgyhm1e,1,t5_3101t
834520,0,t1_cgz4c97,Good game!Yup. It typically gets at least a few K.O.s per match. I thought I was going to get swept by Gyarados there.  So what happens now? This is my first battle in this league do I get a badge or is there a record kept of the win somewhere?,CrimsonPokemonLeague,cgz4y86,1,t5_3101t
852545,0,t1_ch16loe,The problem is its already the end of the day here in the UK. If you can battle now my details are below otherwise it could be difficult to coordinate a battle with the time difference.FC  || IGN Ruari,CrimsonPokemonLeague,ch16tk6,1,t5_3101t
