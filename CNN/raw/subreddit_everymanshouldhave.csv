983035,0,t1_ch5d6kk,I have had both. I take both to work everyday drinking from the Contigo first and the Zoji second. The reviews are correct that the Contigo has many nooks and crannies in the lid and it is a pain to clean. My recommendation would be the Zoji for that reason alone also it really does keep things hot for  hours  the Contigo does not.,everymanshouldhave,chg124s,1,t5_2z17l

9053515,0,t1_d7zwmef,Thats exactly what it is. Basically an aluminum water bottle with vacuum insulation keeping stuff ice cold or piping hot for many many hours even up to a day or so. Yeti Hydroflask Kleen Kanteen and Evrgrn and probably many other companies all make versions. ,everymanshouldhave,d8036er,1,t5_2z17l
