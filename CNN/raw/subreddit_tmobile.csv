Of course they have DRM.Name one company that allows you to download your TV ShowsMovies without DRM. Ill wait.If he wanted to pirate his content DRM free and then take it with him then he should have.Ive never seen someone bitch this much about unlimited data...you could have downloaded DRM free copies on your unlimited plan on your device just as easily as you could at home with your broadband connection just as you could stream Netflix or Hulu Plus.I dont get the argument here. If he wanted to stream then he can stream. If he wanted to download then he could have downloaded. If he wasnt going to use unlimited then downgrade your plan. What an odd discussion.EDIT His Google Play comparison is still DRM. Its just timelimited. A few companies do this. Music went DRM free due to mass piracy a few years back and the content in general is worth less. However look at other streaming services like Pandora and iTunes Radio..do they allow you to download? Of course not.

874888,0,t1_ch3p3oa,First off the rate is kbps not kbps.  If you download a MB file e.g. through wget after tethering youd see its quite far from kbps and much closer to kbps.Second it doesnt apply on EDGE.  Its only applied on UMTS and LTE.  Because theyre supposed to throttle you to G and EDGE is already in the G bucket.  Just as ATampTs AIO has an Mbps throttle on LTE and Mbps on HSPA.Frankly I think a kbps limit is very dumb  they should throttle you to maybe .Mbps on HSPA and .Mbps on LTE so that you have an incentive to not use the lessefficient EDGE spectrum.  Otherwise instead of letting you use  of HSPA cell capacity or . of an LTE one theyre effectively forcing you to use  of their EDGE capacity instead.  Im not sure how representative are these percentage numbers are Im not a wireless engineer but you get my point.To be fair its also supposed to be kbps instead of kbps.  If you have extra time you might want to call them up and complain loudly that youre only getting kbps instead of kbps as per their own FAQ.gt If you have a plan that was available between November   and March   data speed is reduced to at most  kbps comparable to dialup when data usage exceeds the Data Speed Reduction Threshold for data features. Mobile Internet and dataonly plan customers that reach this threshold have their speed reduced to  kbps.gt If you have a plan that was available after March   data speed is reduced to at most  kbps when data usage exceeds the Data Speed Reduction Threshold for data features Mobile Internet and dataonly plans.Last I checked the  min GBG plan is still available after March   so it must be getting kbps not kbps.  I had this plan on my second line although my primary line with a  plan was also throttled at kbps personally I got sick of this kbps and stopped renewing the GBG plan switching to AIO Wireless where they only throttle the downstream and provide a truly Unlimited G upstream. ,tmobile,ch3q8tu,1,t5_2shyc

Here is one tower northwest of Clayton NM which looks like Plateau Wireless tower yellow marks must be towers At the same place on the TMobile coverage map you can a huge circle. According to Google Earth ruler its has  miles radius. There is no way its MHz. Its MHz boosted by placing it on a mountain.Im pretty sure all TMobile phones support HSPA on MHz. Can you show a phone that does not support that frequency? I just checked TMobiles MHz license in South Carolina They dont lease it out so they must be using it. Besides that MHz is widely used in the areas where TMobile roams on ATampT network. A phone without MHz would miss a lot of roaming coverage. ATampT has to roam in New Mexico because they only have MHz spectrum in the south and northwest of New Mexico. Covering the other ares with MHz spectrum wouldnt make financial sense.As for no roaming indicator I believe its possible to transparently roam on other networks.

No internet was hardly the worst of that trip but having some form of internet would be nice. Especially since the trip turned out to be a big lie.

1293779,0,t1_cif4ydg,But when the  year contract is up your bill on sprint doesnt go down. This is part of the reason and some others my family switched to tmobile. We were paying  a month for sprints unlimited everything plan and not even using MB of data a month nor were we making calls  so it was useless to us. We asked a rep when the  year contract is up if the bill would go down and the sprint rep straight out said no. We would still be paying  a month regardless. A day later we went to Tmobile and asked the same question. He said your bill will go down or you can bring your own device and just pay the monthly service fee. Our bill without a phone after it was all said and done for  lines with  gb of data and unlimited talktext would have been closer to  a month with taxes and such. Granted we are losing out on unlimited data but we dont use that much like i said maybe MB a month on average. Currently we pay  total a month because we got phones from tmobile. But that also includes a grandfathered Jump plan for both lines. We both got galaxy Ss which were  a month for each. We could have saved even more month had we gone with a nexus or what have you but we felt we deserved an upgrade from our old phones. Are we saving a ton of money over Sprint? Not really but our coverage is way better phone calls arent dropped and the customer service is miles beyond sprint. That was part of the reason we looked at switching. Since my wife works at a certain retailer when we first got on with sprint she got a  discount on her bill. When we upgraded our phones in january of  they forgot that discount. We called about it and they said they would have to extend the contract another year for us to get that  back. They then tried to sell us some framily crap and some other things. Wasnt buying it.

First of all you waited that long because  people one being an assistant i believe told you that the restock fee wasnt going to be waived for that reason and you refused to accept it until the manager came out again and told you the same thing....but gave in because he saw that you werent going to leave until you got your way.  He did ask you if you did any reasearch on the phone before you purchased and also asked if you were aware of the the restock fee when you purchased the phone....at first you said no then changed your story but never did he call you a child nor did he say that you were not the kind of people they trust simply didnt happen.  The restock fee is a coprporate policy not an individual store or individual manager policy that you were fully aware of when you purchased it and just because you are upset that they were holding you to it doesnt give you the right to make false claims.  If the original rep told you it had something it didnt then that was a mistake on their part but a simple google search about the specs of the phone would have given you that information.

1625095,0,t1_cjjygft,I want to answer the question  During the last conference call they said they expect EBITDA of  billion in  according to their analysis. Thats up significantly from . billion expected EBITDA in . Interest they pay I believe wont change significantly in . Capex will probably increase but not significantly. So they should make about  billion in free cash flow that can go towards paying off the debt or paying the shareholders. Their service ARPU is actually not falling but raising. Remember that before Q  ARPU was used to fund the subsidy now EIP billings are accounted under Equipment revenue. So naturally ARPU goes down. They have introduced ABPU average billings per user to compare the past with the current performance. A year ago ABPU was . now its ..I dont think A and V will start a price war. Vs CFO already said they wont scarify the company to compete. They want to be a premium carrier. A already lost revenue because of TMobile and it didnt stop TMobile. In the worst case if V and A do hurt Sprint andor TMobile they will merge in twothree years.

It is simply carrier aggregation more or less which Sprint is already doing with Spark. atampt demonstrated LTEA back in March by combining their MHz and MHz AWS LTE bands. They achieved Mbps. So you see...its more about backhaul and specturm available than technology itself.This was a MHzwide downlink. Meaning TMobile has already accomplished this with Wideband LTE.Basically we already have LTEA. Were just calling it something else because Murica. Spark XLTE Wideband etc.Release  is the standard minimum required for LTEA. Think of it like a couple years ago where we had preN wireless routers. Were capable of the speeds and technology NOW we just cant call it Wireless N or in this case LTE Advanced.Right now the only way to make LTEA more viable is spectrum spectrum spectrum which every carrier is basically constrained for except like Sprint....they ahve a crap load coming in due to the shut down of the legacy Nextel networks. As we shut down G I the near future and the MHz spectrum becomes available for auction next year well be able to start seeing closer to true LTEA speeds.,tmobile,cjl86x5,1,t5_2shyc

2090992,0,t3_2it6x7,HelloI just switched myself from Verizon and my girlfriend from ATT. We live in Colorado so a lot of empty land and a lot of mountains. Im really happy with our switch to be honest. It saves of both a good amount of money and we get faster speeds in populated areas. The trade off I made was not as good of coverage in the mountain towns which to be honest is fine with me. We spend  of our time in the cities and such so why am I paying a premium for that  and having Verizons ridiculous data restrictions and their other shady business practices.    I just dont want to do business with either of those companies anymore and I hope by us switching we are another drop in the tidal wave of change. We will also be taking two more ATT customers with us and adding them to our plan for month each and if we can maybe two more.

Ive worked in customer service for awhile and sometimes there are phone agents who are misinformed andor dont follow through. Super unfortunate for the customer.So first issue the tower in your area. Sounds like there was an issue. If you were the only one to call about that area nothing will happen. I called about a similar issue amp they took down some info like calls that failed recently amp said they sent it to the engineers. That being said multiple people have to call about an issue or problem before it will be actually looked into. That is true for any company if only one customer is complaining about XYZ we customer service are going to work with that customer with their equipment etc.Anyway next issue. iPhone launches are crazy. They have been since the beginning. I stood in line at ATampT for the very first one tons of people were turned away. Even Apple website amp app was having issues as per usual. You attempted multiple times to make an online order amp they failed then you called amp were unable to place an order over the phone as well? Did you call to complain or call to make an order?I placed my order for iPhone  on November st at a store. Something happened amp it got hung up. Had to cancel and reorder  hours later. Phone Twitter and instore employees were all helpful amp nice. Was it an annoyance? Sure. But shit happens. People amp computers are fallible. Most people who didnt preorder or get lucky are waiting up to  weeks for their iPhone on all carriers. Again not trying to attack you I dont know you. But that being said if you find that people in the service industry are frequently rude amp unhelpful examine how youre treating them. If someone comes at me with a laundry list of complaints amp is upset amp demanding they go into a certain bucket. Often times nothing will make these people happy. They say things like I demand compensation! If someone is patient amp understanding Im more likely to go above amp beyond to help solve their issue or make them more comfortable if it cant be solved. ,tmobile,cm2ajj7,9,t5_2shyc

2573985,0,t1_cmue20i,Like some people said New Jersey does have some of the worst service from TMobile. I live in south jersey and can give my account of the TMobile experience. By south jersey i am referring to anything west of Mays Landing to the Delaware Memorial Bridge and as far north as Sewell. First off when in south jersey expect lots of g. TMobile has made some improve in little towns. Some of them have LTE. Most of the speeds are good but not as crazy as some of the ones I have seen on here. Typical speeds are  Mbps down  Mbps up. Thats when you are outside. Inside is hit and miss you might get lte or you might get g. g in town isnt the best .mbps down .mbps up. The annoying part is that some of these towns are not fully covered by LTE have the town might have LTE and other might have g the speeds arent good might as well be g. Going in between towns is g you start getting LTE until you get about a quarter of a mile of town boundaries. I live in the biggest hole of g you can find in south jersey. the closet tower I live near a tower got upgraded to g  its the only gonly tower I have seen get an upgrade. I would said I live about half a mile from the tower but to get g I need to be upstairs and printing towards the towers direction. Even next to tower speeds are g except for the improvement in the ping. Every carrier has had problems having strong signals in new Jersey because of the geography. I know a guy who use to work for Verizon back when it was first installing g in the area. He said the area has lots of hills which causes lots of problems for wireless signals. This is true I live close to a certain township all the locals like to call wireless hell. All the carriers could barely get a signal in this area. Drop calls and g on Verizon and att  amazing right?. In the last year had to build a new tower to provide signal in the area. Knowing this Im a little worried that band  LTE will be as effective as TMobile thinks at least for this area in particular. If they ever want to improve coverage they are going to either have to rent or build more towers to get a better signal. There are lots of parts where you cant even get voice or unless you roam. The tmobile at the mall i go to the phones on display only get g. If you want a constant data connection you have to with att or Verizon heck even sprint as long as you dont mind the slower speed but you wont lose connection as much. Even for voice t mobile is the weaker of the  in the area. I really like t mobile and was on their  month plan for a couple months but switched to cricket because of the  credit. If t mobile can improve I would love to switch back. The general idea of TMobile here is that it sucks and I cant blame people for thinking that. Im on mobile so expect lots of errors.

2586973,0,t1_cmw5kgk,But the issue is for people like my sistermomdad. Sister is on a GS from ATampT. Mom is on a Note  from ATampT. Dad is on an iPhone S. Technically speaking they all work on TMobile. The Samsungs probably wont be updated to Lollipop. The iPhone is so old that this iOS  will be the last version and it doesnt support WiFi calling. I feel like a lot of the customers who came from other carriers are in that boat. They kept their old phones that they had unlocked because it would work with TMobile. gt Seems like a far better option would just be bringing wifi calling to phones like the Moto X.When you have hundreds of different phones supporting WiFi calling will be a challenge. Especially considering Windows Phone which needs to have it specially baked in like current Android and BlackBerry. I know the user base for both WP and BB are very low but WP is growing and BB isnt as dead as everyone thinks. ,tmobile,cmw972b,2,t5_2shyc

I hear that it may not get LTEg in areas where TMobile has not yet upgraded their towers but it worked fine for me in L.A. and the surrounding areas.I now mainly use the first generation Moto X on TMobile but occasionally switch the sim card to the iPhone  and use it.

The ATampT service worked fine in my apartments garage about  bars with g but TMobiles service does not work at all in there zero signal. I generally have a bit of trouble getting service inside certain buildings but its well worth the cost savings to me. But outdoors TMobile works fine except on the drive to Vegas.

3107445,0,t1_cojm42o,We can summon the creator uManBearCoon into this thread to solve  of everything. I already wrote to him my suggestions. Two biggest problems When a phone is partially compatible with TMobiles network the tool displays a checkmark. For example a LTE band  only will display a G checkmark when we know a phone without band  is crippled. LTE band  without band  also displays a checkmark which is even more misleading. The same problem with phones that lack band . By the end of the year a phone without band  will be considered limited. I believe G should be displayed as G LTE for all US carriers otherwise its confusing for regular US people. And G for TMobile US and ATampT should be either G HSPA or even G. This should not be the place to be religious about the naming. The majority of TMobile customers know G and G LTE they dont need to be confused when they want to quickly check compatibility.And a few more features that will make the tool  awesome Final interpretation of results. For example if G and G are not compatible there should be a warning that calls wont work. Ability to link to particular phone compatibility check results Ability to prefill some fields like carrier and country,tmobile,cok33d6,3,t5_2shyc

3163350,0,t1_coptnlv,gt Jump is better for most than the regular upgrade process because once you purchase a phone like the galaxy S at  you are obligated to pay off the entire amount even if you upgrade to a new phone without Jump you still have to pay off the S AND the new phone.This is misleading since the most reasonable comparison to trading in your phone for JUMP would be to selling the phone and paying off the EIP with that money rather than keeping  phones and paying  EIPs.gt With Jump however you only have to pay  of the phone and you trade it in to get a new one and we cover the remaining  on the old one. So if you use iPhone and have Jump you can always get the latest iPhone every single year and your monthly costs wont change as long as the full retail cost is the same.So youre paying yr and trading in your phone to get Tmo to wipe out the remaining EIP half or less the original cost of the phone. This doesnt work out in your favor on its own since the year old phone is worth a lot more than half the EIP less the  you paid for JUMP for a year.gt Basically the Jump plan is great for people that like to have the latest device but dont want to deal with other carriers that do service contactsIts not its a lousy deal for that.

The goal of the FCC is to figure out the starting prices and the initial clearing target to finish the auction in one stage. They can set the initial prices to as much as broadcasters say but that can cause the initial stage to fail and the auction will proceed to the next stage with a lower clearing target after wasting months of time.Note that in the article broadcasters suggest a  MHz clearing target whereas the FCC wanted to start with  MHz.

I called and told them there was a very bad storm at the beginning of October and that was when the service declined and it has never improved after that. They claim they sent someone to the tower I typically connect to from home but the problem has never really been fixed the signal jumps around from LTE to HSPA to UMTS and even to Edge. There is no consistency and sometime I will get a normal looking signal around MBPS UP and MBPS down but it will quickly drop back to under .MBPS up and down. Sometimes it will also have a drastically higher download like MBPS down and MBPS up. A lot of the time connections just fail.

The issue not happening at the same time or during testing. So I could have it work fine for a week only to suddenly not get calls or texts. Fix it and it could stay working for another week or two or quit in  minutes. I didnt want to wipe my phone and send it in for testing as it was just too variable. ,tmobile,cq4n0vk,1,t5_2shyc

Verizon has said they have commitments to keep some CDMA open till the mid s ATampT is shutting down G mid year  who knows about HSPA? and sprint is not even thinking about that yet. T Mobile is kind of in the middle. They are keeping g open to get all the nice MM contracts that ATT give away with shutting down G so you can expect some GG to stay until at the early s with t mobile.

3629830,0,t3_31wqeg,The first question is  where do you live? If you dont want to answer the reason I ask is this map describes where TMobile has Band  spectrum  TMobiles indoor coverage varies greatly from one place to another. Here in Minneapolis Mn its better than everyone else I say as a previous  year Verizon customer. In other places its anywhere from not as good to poor. Band  if they deploy it in your area noticeably increases your odds of being able to get reception inside and fills in many dead spots between towers.If you dont need Band  I think the LG G for  is definitely the best phone you can get right now for the price. Theyre still selling it new  its a nice phone.Theres a list of which phones support band  here   Unfortunately its new so no  easy answer. I keep waiting for LG to announcerelease their new midrange phones so theres an easy option to recommend on a budget. Right now the Samsung Galaxy Avant is the cheapest phone I know of that does Band .,tmobile,cq611bk,2,t5_2shyc

The more rural the more likely Verizon will be much better and TMobile will be worse but it just depends on the specific town.On my drive Id see one town having full LTE with decent speed test results in another town that looked decent size theyd only have Edge. Hopefully all that will be upgrade by the end of the year like they promised. Still towns not on major highways can be dead for TMobile and get Verizon coverage sure. Verizons not  perfect by any means either at the same time.Sorry if I come across a little strong its not company fanboyism its coverage fanboyism. Even if I did end up with no coverage somewhere for a while its far better than the years I spent not having coverage in my house thinking Verizon was the best so no one else could do better.

Well its much faster with TMobile in the city much slower where its still Edge. Verizon has their entire network being LTE so remotely or theyre faster.But I got a lot of mediocre service with Verizon in other places to. Those remote location will often have signal but not quite strong enough signal to actually make a call if youre in an sort of valley. Like my grandparents farm has woods and youd call someone and the call would cut in and out. TMobile has reception there  equally mediocre reception to be fair  but Verizon didnt live up to its supposed reputation. Thats not the only place even when travelling Id often find Verizon having trouble getting enough reception indoors to hold a call. All the time? No. But enough that Id notice it.Have TMobile been perfect? No outside of my metro area its a mixed bag. In one city it will be amazing in another its just as mediocre as Verizon is at home. A hotel I stayed at in Florida Verizon wouldnt work on the lower levels TMobile did. Went to the beach  both were iffy and having trouble with data.And Im not even getting into how disappointing Verizon has been in trailing both TMobile and Sprint in wifi calling and hd voice. Or of course their crappy overages...Im only saying the TMobile is clearly superior where I live.  In other places it varies greatly. But I wasnt nearly as impressed with Verizon as I was supposed to be and it had a lot of drawbacks to. Have you actually had Verizon?,tmobile,crercpo,0,t5_2shyc

4045975,0,t1_crh5nu1,Haha thats awesome. I live in W. Toledo so relatively close! It was by chance that I came across this as I was thinking of moving out to the Oregon area within the next  years and wanted to know the exact coverage type in that area. This must have just been turned on or they are testing because I was at Maumee Bay State Park this past weekend for my buddies wedding and I had little to no service in the hotel.Band  Mhz offers better building penetration than Band  mhz that we currently have which would have provided me with LTEService inside the hotel. Im sure there are other benefits but this one stands out to me the most. What phone do you currently have?

4429620,0,t1_csoxcep,From what I hear many areas that are still on EDGE are running upgraded equipment while they wait on backhaul to be delivered this is specifically an issue in the Centurylink footprint.Once backhaul is delivered LTE will launch very quickly since base station equipment is already upgraded. When Cedar City backhaul was upgraded HSPA speeds increased immediately and LTE followed very quickly after since base stations had already been upgraded.

Getting my phone swapped through Apple means I end up with a different serial number and IMEI than the phone TMobile thinks Im leasing and I was told that TMobile would not andor could not update the IMEI on my line with that of a replacement phone from Apple. So Id be SOL ifwhen I wanted to jump. What little info Ive found from people with Jump classic not JoD implies that people have successfully called TMobile to switch the IMEI on their line to that of a replacement phone they got straight from Apple and that this is more or less standard procedure. Im wondering if things work this way for JoD as well.  I really hope they do.  I get that Im leasing the phone so technically TMobile gets to decide how repairs and replacements are carried out but it seems so assbackwards as a part of their uncarrier campaign. I live right by an Apple retail store and if what that rep told me is true it makes me sad that I will have to jump through so many hoops and fork over cash ifwhen I have a warranty hardware issue when I could swing over to the mall and have a hipster take care of the problem in a few minutes at no monetary expense. No offense to hipsters or ARS employees intended. ,tmobile,ctm3jwe,1,t5_2shyc

4842624,0,t3_3h7ca4, calls are special calls they go on any network within range that your phone can reach. So if youre a TMobile customer in a deadzone  and the only carrier around is Verizon for instance  then the  call will hit up the Verizon towers to connect with emegency services.  The opposite is true too  if youre a Verizon customer without service the phone could connect to TMobile to complete the call.The FCC mandates that all cellular service companies must allow emergency  calls on their network regardless by whom theyre placed.  That is why you can buy a cheap prepaid phone and not place a SIM in it and still make emergency  calls from it.Now if youre in a deadzone with no cellular service at all  youre screwed unless you can find a landline or payphone to call  from. ,tmobile,cu4y7a1,8,t5_2shyc

Since this is preorder weekend youre more likely to be able to cancel it my previous comment about probably not being able to cancel your order was made with currently released phones in mind and not preorders. Id hate for you to waste your time going into a store just for them to turn you around and ask you to do the same thing.

5209600,0,t3_3mcg2b,I live in Phoenix Arizona. Some areas of the city are like the equivalent of being on the moon. Especially in just about every Walmart Frys food stores or any doctors office or government building. I was waiting at the DMV a couple months ago. I was there for nearly  hours with LTE being displayed but zero internet connection. Spent  hours just pretending that I was surfing the internet while people around me were watching Netflix on their phone on Verizon or Sprints network. Same thing happened when I was at the Dept. of Vital records. Had LTE but couldnt get internet. Kept toggling airplane mode and mobile data onoff for brief internet connections. What a joke. I feel bad because I got my wife to move from Verizon to a TMobile on my plan so she can have a better phone. Now she has to plan meal ideas either at home or in the parking lots of grocery stores. If she forgets and tries to find recipes online while shopping she gets the Wifi and mobile data are turned off or No internet connection available .

Ill be honest I looked into this a lot for a friend over the summer and the results were pretty inconclusive. But Ill summarize what I know You are correct you may not roam internationally forever. TMobile is a United States carried that provides service to those who primarily use their service within the United States.   Assuming you mean the  for  plan and he has the GB of data then suspending his line will not lower your bill. I dont know about cancelled for nonusage but Ive met customers with lines theyve had for six months and not known about and the line was still active. So Id imagine that if you are paying for it you can keep it however Im speculating about this part.    I dont know how to forward texts or even if its possible. You can get Unconditional Call Forwarding but Im not sure that will help. I dont know any way to bar all calls except while on WiFi but still allow SMS and G data all the time.    To speculate about how long he gets to roam if I remember correctly its  weeks or half the time your account has been active with TMobile whichever comes first. However I have met people personally who have gone  weeks while in Europe so I dont know how TMobile decides to shut you off.    ,tmobile,cw67688,3,t5_2shyc

I used to love WP but Microsoft just cant seem to get it right. They had the chance back when WP released but every time they make a serious go at getting their shit together they sit on their asses and let the competition eclipse them. Look at WP. too. They came out swinging and yet they sat around and let everyone else pass them up. Windows Phone is the new BlackBerry no one is going toshould take them seriously until Microsoft themselves gets it together. Why should anyone make a big push at carrying their wares when MS doesnt even know what theyre doing with the platform? The  was too little FAR too late. The last time TMobile made a significant push at offering WP devices no one bought them. And thats not because sales reps are wrong and not giving WP a chance. Its because WP is broken and probably cant be fixed at this point.

6142540,0,t1_cyntup5,Yes. The BRS half of the band was originally the Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service which was held by broadcasters and independent programmers to compete with cable TV. It was later renamed BRS Broadband Radio Service and sold off to people to use for fixed wireless broadband and eventually wound up in the hands of Clearwire.The EBS half of the band was originally the Instructional Television Fixed Service used for delivering educational TV in schools and other places of learning. This was later renamed the Educational Broadband Service and repurposed for wireless broadband for schools.The BRS and EBS bands were later reconfigured and then the FCC granted the ability for EBS licensees to lease it out for commercial purposes as long as it was also serving educational usage for a significant portion of the offered bandwidth I dont remember the exact percentage.Thats how Clearwire amassed a massive amount of spectrum which Sprint acquired.

6163700,0,t3_3zvlxl,I really dont understand the large debate for the issue at hand maybe short of the optin could have potentially been better as the choice. Instead of optout being the default choice. Anyone in IT or those who work in service delivery environments knows that when added to everyone complaints will be a lot less than if  people try it and try to spread the word if its good. Taken from an infrarstructure perspective you dont upgrade  people and see what the results are you test it internally then roll out it. Thats what they did.Your phone has a  inch screen how long are you really watching movies on there that youll notice a difference especially on an iphone. I get it perhaps on a high res UHD android device. Also a good note to take home the network has almost tripled in  years as far as capacity and users. While users grow past capacity measures need to be taken to improve however also include sweeteners like bingeon for example to give something to the customers while reducing load and giving the company time to improve. Think this those who use cable internet during peak times know what large load does to their paid for speed. Fact is its a FREE service that while optimizes or reduces say what word you choose you get the same video and can watch it till next year and it doesnt count against your data. People saying they want to switch carriers because of a comment from the CEO. Im sure we all cant stand Comcast or TWC yet they make millions every month from those that cant stand them. We as consumers do what we need to do to keep the choices we make high quality and as low cost as possible. While i agree on some points lets embrace reality. Its up to you dont like it turn it off..

If youre using a locked iPhone on TMobile and travel internationally  which could totally happen  you can and probably will since you have no choice still use the TMobile SIM to roam on other carriers... and if alpha.tmobile.com is required for international roaming then that locked iPhone will be dead in the water internationally if theyre stuck on fast.tmobile.com.So either someone at TMobile didnt fully think this through or you were given a BS answer.,tmobile,d0fkd6a,3,t5_2shyc

Now when I was little we had to connect to the Internet by using wires. But not you youre lucky that it can be done magically without them! Its INVISIBLE  make sparkle noises and hand gestures . This is because of a box called a whyyurless rowter a wireless router. And what lets it do its wireless magic is a mix of two very important things. special ingredients and special commands. The special ingredients for this magic are perfect but the commands still need to be worked on. Now there are two wizards working on perfecting the commands. A wizard named Tmobile and another wizard named Asus. We get our magic wireless router from the wizard Tmobile and he tells us we should never ever use magic spells from any other wizards but never really told us why. But the wizard Asus has FIXED the magic spell! It works prefectly but remember were not supposed to use his spell and wizard Tmobile has made zero progress but claims he is still working on it but he never upgrades his magic spells. So now were stuck little one. Do we listen to the distracted wizard tmobile or go with the hard working Wizard Asus? Seems obvious but if we pick the wizard Asus and anything goes wrong no one will help us. ,tmobile,d1ea5ce,10,t5_2shyc

7424341,0,t1_d2lthvf,Im not sure how much of a cost that rural coverage is.  You dont have to build out for capacity which is a huge expense in urbansuburban coverage and its really cheap to get cell site locations in rural areas.Montana is  square miles.  If a MHz cell site can cover  square miles thats  cell sites that can all be located on cheap land.  Im sure TMobile has more cell sites than that in cities with over a million people  and all on property thats way more expensive.  It definitely costs money and it would probably be more than  cell sites when you consider covering the cities where there are obstructions etc.  But it isnt a ridiculous number of cell sites.  Even if it took  cell sites thats probably a good bit less than  of TMobiles cell sites.Now the economics might not be as good for TMobile as cities.  A place like Montana might only have k people willing to switch away to a new company.  k would be . of TMobiles user base.  But you have to consider that TMobile would be spending a lot less on those cell sites than city cell sites where theyd be renting space for big bucks.  Might end up being a wash.Its not worth it without lowband spectrum.  There are still a lot of areas where TMobile doesnt have lowband spectrum but where they do have lowband spectrum I think TMobile intends to eventually compete on square miles.  I mean theyre building out nicely in the Dakotas where they have lowband.Youre right that Verizons coverage in a place like Montana isnt worth paying for if youre not going to visit Montana.  But I dont think thats the same as whether it would be worth it for TMobile to cover that area given lowband spectrum.doing a little searching I found sites saying that a  mile radius was reasonable for MHz which comes out to  sq miles covered and this graphic has been floating around for a while   ,tmobile,d2m3kua,3,t5_2shyc

Also  one of the things I hate about Samsung devices and a lot of other android devices to boot is that they dont let you toggle network modes  its either HSPALTE preferred or EDGE it seems with no option to select only HSPA.

If you had in the s outdoors then entered your concrete and rebar building and dropped dB things still work well. But if you are outside and getting in the s the signal is probably bounced around a bit. That is the SNR will be poorer than the situation where you had plain attenuation. In reality SNR is what rules the day. A few days ago someone published a graph of SNR versus data rate for various cellular modulation schemes.

8114007,0,t3_4qd9xe,I have a Huawei b. I pay  a month for Gbytes. But I can get away with this because I have an unlimited plan on my phone. Note I use the gantennashop as a TMobile reseller for my service. I get a Chicago phone number not that it matters much. You can text the Huawei. By dropping my landline and DSL the Huawei will pay for itself. I just got a Cricket sim from eBay. I have not put any money on it yet but will report if it works in the LTE gateway. Go to eBay and look for the gantennashop. Everything works but I get the feeling this is all a little new to them. Translation they forgot to send the simcard with the gateway. On the other hand they phoned me to ask how it is going. The Huawei was trivial to set up but Im reasonably tech savvy as they say. The b is set up via the browser much like any other Internet device these days. Im running linux so I cant vouch if a windows set up is as trivial.I bought a rather pricey external antenna for the gateway and plan to try it when camping. For urban use you shouldnt need an external antenna. I suggest setting up a Tesco account if you want a wide band yagi from Digital. It is worth the extra  over mystery products. The external antenna gets a  dB boost. Not a big deal in an urban area but significant in the fringe. ,tmobile,d4s369g,2,t5_2shyc

Instead of everyone being constantly affected by congestion only a few high users will experience this effect as intensely and for far less long. Once congestion is alleviated speeds return to normal.On the other hand if youve exceeded your data cap and all of your stash you will experience throttling. This is the intentional lowering of speeds to Kbps until the end of a billing cycle. This differs from lower prioritisation in that with throttling you will not return to normal speed until your data allotment has refreshed.TlDR  anyone can be affected with a lower prioritisation even tiered plans.

Drove down the  by Meadows mall on Friday the th and saw a crew working on the site in the parking lot.  Went back on Sunday and took pictures. This site is on the north side by one of the billboards next to the  freeway.  This is not a typical Vegas site.  Only  AIR per sector broadcasting LTE B and UMTS B.  No other antennas on any nearby poles.  They added a short B antenna underneath.  Looks like its going to stay with the AIR and not an AIR but they could still be changing them out.  There is no cherry picker there right now and they still have to come back and hook the B antenna up.Whats weird to me is that as recently as last week they are still going around and swapping AIRs onto sites and not adding B antennas to them.  Maybe they were already permitted before they had the B license and will go back later but it seems like a wast of money to roll to the site and make changes then roll back out again later.  But since the AIR is a super quick change out with no new cable runs maybe they have separate crews doing it from the B upgrades.  Ive seen them do it in less than  hours for a  sector site so a crew could be doing  per day easily.,tmobile,d5ey1rc,3,t5_2shyc

Your biggest challenge spots will be in the same places where you have trouble getting cellular signal so yes basements or the interior of some buildings might not have good coverage. The other thing to keep in mind is the limitations on how much data you can use. Youd be surprised how quickly streaming high definition video can chew through data. You can get anywhere from  GB to  GB of G LTE data per month it looks like. After that you may be throttled considerably deprioritized however this is typically only during periods of high network utilization or if you use a lot of data in the current month  GB. If you use bingeon however much of your video streaming wont count against your highspeed data limit and youll still get  video which honestly isnt bad if youre watching on a tablet or laptop. ,tmobile,d5fc5p4,2,t5_2shyc

8400274,0,t1_d5qhmc7,gt Montana probably has several regional carriers while Oregon might not.When I visited Montana my phone was connected to ATampT almost the entire time. The roaming agreement there seems to me to be you can roam on ATampT anywhere in the state.As for Eastern Oregon TMobile previously roamed on Unicel a regional provider. Unicel was purchased by Verizon in . TMobile continued to roam on their old towers until sometime around  I believe. After that roaming contract expired it was not renewed. At this point Verizon has probably shut down those GSM towers that they were keeping up to fulfill the roaming agreement and integrated them into their G and CDMA network. When I had TMobile they never roamed on ATampT in Eastern Oregon and of course they still dont. US Cellular roaming would mostly solve this.,tmobile,d5rkwvy,1,t5_2shyc

Russia has a huge online army that tries hard to manipulate the election process and outcomes in the U.S. because Putin an evil dictator wants to see the U.S. fail. Russia has no democracy no respect for minorities completely broken healthcare and education systems. You thing the U.S. is bad? Go to Russia! The levels of corruption are insane.

So I use the CellSpot.We dont have a home phone. We ditched that years ago. But I refuse to allow my carrier to use my WiFi to provide me with the service I am paying them for.I have compromised with the CellSpot because it provides a cellular signal even though it uses my home internet as backhaul. But if TMobile was so iffy that it could not provide even a solid G signal it does I get around  down on G Id find a different carrier.WiFi calling works for a lot of people  including yourself and it makes a lot of sense for those people.But for me again I am paying for cellular service.

GSM only for Intel GSMCDMA for Qualcomm. Qualcomm is the X only chip that supports  Mbps download. Intel is the XMM  Reason behind this likely stems from trying to have two vendors instead of one and by using the two chips they are the same in capability LTE wise they arent hurting feelings.

Like Im on JOD for the Iphone s where if you traded in a phone any phone they would give your  bill credits for the term of the EIP but if i paid it off early say right now I would be missing out on the rest of the  bill credit.. So would say if you dont get any bill credits toward your EIP then go for it. Just will make your bill cheaper but if your getting bill credits toward the device as part of a promo then let it run its course....,tmobile,d7i4i3i,1,t5_2shyc

9006922,0,t1_d7ufyko,Look dude Im really trying to be nice by telling you that TMobile will not accept in. When you do a trade in youre asked the condition of the device. One of those questions is about the display and its condition. If you hit that the display is cracked the value of the phone will adjust itself and you will have to pay more than what you wanted to pay for. If you hit that the display isnt cracked and lie you will still have to pay for the device for the price that they determine it to be. Basically the quote that they give you is just a quote until it is approved.Stop assuming youre okay and can trade it in with no issue because you will have issues and they wont take the device at the price that you expect them to take it at.If you really want to figure out if youre fine call support or talk to tforce and bring it up to them.,tmobile,d7uhoq4,2,t5_2shyc

9066539,0,t3_54ewpi,Yes. I got mine unlocked few days ago as well. The actual rule for permanent unlock is the device must be paid off and that device has been on tmo network for  days and your account is in good standing. I have a trip to Japan and Korea where I have local sims so i called tmo and asked for unlock code and was initially rejected based on the reason above. When I called in the rd time the tech was like there might be a workaround. He requested temporary unlock code and he said there is no temporary unlock with iphone. Only android phone with device unlock app can have temp unlock. hours later i got an email with an instruction. Waited  hours as the email instructed and voila it was unlocked when I put a foreign sim. This was  days after i got the phone which was . So if you need it unlocked asap and your device is paid off then give it a try. ,tmobile,d81ngkh,2,t5_2shyc

For example after so many months of not missing payments you will be able to get the no money down phones ect. You have to earn the good stuff. If you are not sure that you can maintain payments EVERY month then stick with a prepaid or family plan with your dad.

9459705,0,t1_d9exdbv,Network engineer here.  I agree that increasing the transmission bitrate for some clients on a shared media helps the others by getting those clients off the spectrum faster.However it seems to me that cable modem turbo bursts buckets would not qualify as helping in this way.  In that case they are still transmitting the same amount of data across the spectrum at the same bitrate thus  MB takes the same amount of average spectrumcapacity whether it is allowed to burst or kept stable at the normal plan bitrate.In other words if my data takes up ms  ms  ms or ms all at once it doesnt matter and is still the same amount of spectrum capacity used.  However if you can double my transmission speed so that I go .  .  . or .ms then you have decreased my spectrum use.Instead I would say the turbo bursts are more of a user experience improvement thing.  A connection with a burst will feel a lot faster yet it wont actually be using any more spectrum their average spectrum use is still limited to their regular bitrate,tmobile,d9f329j,5,t5_2shyc

Ive had success with people having this problem when we took the video at a lower resolution ratio and tried to send. The higher quality the video when taken the lower quality it will look when sent. It sounds backwards but as was mentioned in the other comment  MB doesnt give you a lot of room to work with. If you can keep the video short and resolution low it will very likely look much better when sent. The only viable alternative may be to either send via email and if that still doesnt get you where you need to be maybe use a file sharing service like drop box where your friends and familyyou can access the content freely that is uploaded whenever.

Many large enterprises and agencies like the DoD were granted huge amounts of addresses because of this. Later on public IP addresses ran out and some carriers like TMobile also ran out of private addresses to give devices on their network. They had to get some additional IPs from somewhere.  Because the DoD blocks are not announced or routed publicly theyre ideal for internal use and thus are used by many carriers including TMobile.  ,tmobile,dabpfph,4,t5_2shyc

Though the network bands are compatible with TMobiles network a SIM lock is going to be a showstopper. It will work if you can get it unlocked but I wouldnt chance that if I were you.A recommendation You might want to look at the LG Phoenix  its a very similar phone.

9826089,0,t1_dao66de,Um are you not understanding that TMobile in urban cities is currently facing CAPACITY constraints not COVERAGE constraints? It would be for the best to tune band  to provide capacity not coverage wherever needed. They still use Band  for coverage where capacity is not a problem but coverage is on the outskirts of town.TMobile can use any of their spectrum dynamically. Band  especially because it has the ability to travel further than any of their other holdings but ALSO to bolster capacity in cities that have not gotten B LTE yet have a small B cell grid and as such would be best tuned as needed on a site by site basis. B is not going to be used for coverage on every site its deployed on especially in settings where TMobile has a macro cell site on every block aka most of Summerlin Las Vegas and many other urban settings but is still facing major slowdowns. ,tmobile,daoczgi,1,t5_2shyc

10231952,0,t1_dc3pdoo,Where to begin? I started with an S at TMobile which at the time wasnt that bad. After about  months I ran into serious overheating and lagging issues to the point where my battery would drain  by taking  minutes to struggle with opening the camera app. I was fed up with that and jumped to the S thinking the waterproofing feature was quite nice and it was an upgrade to the S. Well the S had similar issues regarding to lagging and heating up very quickly with minimal use. On top of that it randomly rebooted throughout the day and since I use my phone for calls at work it was unreliable and might get me fired. After the S came out I jumped to that believing that Samsung would have finally fixed the issues I had been having. Oh boy well I had my first brand new S for  months before the battery wouldnt hold a charge past  so I called TMobile and they sent me a replacement in accordance with the jump insurance on my line. I am using that same replacement now and have gotten into heavily modding the ROM so that my phone doesnt drain completely dead overnight. Ive gotten to where it uses only  or less of the battery after sleeping for  hours which I believe to be pretty great. This is the th month I have owned the replacement model of the S and now the battery is really starting to go downhill. Overnight it is draining  to  even with the custom ROM with greenify amplify Xposed modules and powernap. I decided maybe something was messed up within the ROM or how I modded it. I completely wiped the device including the ROM and just went back to Samsung stock. After using the phone back to factory default it has been draining down from  to  when I wake up in the morning. For now I am just keeping my S plugged in overnight so I dont have to deal with a dead phone only a few hours into the day. Dont even get me started about how poor the battery is during use. I averaged about  hours of Screen on Time using chrome Twitter and zendesk and thats from a full days charge down to  which I believe to be very poor in regards to the iPhone s which my coworkers currently use. They can have a full day at the office and leave with about  after using their phone similar to mine and I always leave with a dead phone or end up charging it around lunch time to  just to make the drive back home. Its absolutely ridiculous and I have completely lost faith in Samsung and their phone line up. Honestly before all the ROM stuff and modding I almost never customized the device with themes or cool keyboards or moving wallpapers or anything like that. As of now I am hoping that Apple can provide me with a solid phone that just works. And Im hoping that TMobile has a promo deal for the  gb model so that I dont have to drop  or more for a downpayment on a phone. I feel like I have Jump on my account for little reason now if I cant jump from this shit phone to a better one after payingore than half of the device cost off. ,tmobile,dc3ukwx,1,t5_2shyc

10299890,0,t1_dcbgdxc,Analog signal used to go further than g digital which goes further than hspa which goes further than LTE but thats assuming all other variables being equal. With band  LTE on TMobile should go much further than band  g so I wouldnt call g more reliable and g cant even do data with more than a phone or two on a tower anymore its really only good for low quality calls and text not sure on capacity for calls Id assume the lower bandwidth for calls helps but would depend how much spectrum they have it deployed on and how bad the spectral efficiency of g is compared to LTE. Also g is needed for old OnStar and similar style services and ATT shut down their g which gives TMobile a market to offer their services as Sprint and Verizon dont have g GSM technology so TMobile will keep g for a while still but they can move it into guard bands in a small slice of spectrum with hspa or on its own to give LTE more room though admittedly many g to LTE towers dont even use a lot of spectrum for LTE as is and have slow speeds.,tmobile,dcbjqy4,3,t5_2shyc

Here is the important part no frontline TMobile employee Care or Retail will be able to confirm if your employer has a discount or what kind. You have to visit the Advantage plan website and apply yourself.Since it sounds like you already have a discount and its just not applying to your promotional plan do two things look at your most recent paper bill and make sure your employer name is still on the first page under your name.

Have been up to Lino to visit friends and solid service there.  Better coverage inside some Target stores than I had with VZW specifically in Richfield and Edina.  Theyve done really good work here in our market on coverage.Only complaints are in rural areas the tower spacing is just a little too far apart for some devices iPhone specifically though thats a pretty mainstream device so they should be able to address that with the right amount of money and the B rollout in the arrowhead is slower than I would prefer  but still holding out hope for this summers camping season.,tmobile,ddjsmz7,1,t5_2shyc

10724698,0,t1_ddlzo5j,gt Im assuming you get to return some of these phones else if would be cheaper to buy a  phone and be done with it. Later you mentioned Fi and that is a service that is very restrictive regarding what phone you use.Actually no that assumption is wrong. I still own most of them.  The K was  bucks I think. The J was a snafu on their part with the free phone so they took it back but even so it was  max at the time. The S is . The stylo I think was  bucks? So... ? And even with that... ALL of those phones together is less than a single flagship. They were decent devices at the individual time of purchase but all still lacked being a mid range at the time. I bought them due to them being the only option.gt Now that Cyanogen is a bust your chances of keeping a secure Android phone for four years are gone. LineageOS has almost literally swooped in and kept it going without much of a missed beat.You made a lot of weird assumptions. Very strange... either way I dont want to care around an  dollar phone and potentially break it... I dont want to pay for insurance. I want a mid range phone that wont make me cry if it cracks a screen but can handle everything I throw at it. I couldnt possibly care less about having a flagship. Look at the Nexus lines. They were mid range phones that lasted a LONG time. I honestly couldnt possibly care less about cutting edge security either. I want my phone to work for texting and phone calls. I dont do anything really warranting any major security on my phone. Sure they could potentially take controlbrick my device... but if you think that cant happen on an iPhone or a flagship that gets updates Regularly you are sadly mistaken.Eh its really a loosing battle here. I was just ranting more than anything... but I still think Tmobile is doing a horrible job at choosing a good lineupoptions for customers. What a glorious train wreck the company is.

10745697,0,t3_5tox0f,From a Verizon sales rep that posted on Android CentralUmpyI work for Verizon as a Sales rep and just finished my training on the new plan. There really isnt any hidden wording on this. Its Unlimited G LTE speeds. The prioritizing during the sample in Manhattan showed a throttled speed on average lasted for  minutes and brought the speed down to mb ps. Which is still fine.The following prices is for a family plan and DOES include a  line access fee per smart phone Single line plans are different. But is before taxes and device payments. Be aware that the price will vary if your line is on a  year contract Lines   Lines   Lines  If you port over to Verizon before taking advantage of any trade in credits or promotions and get  Galaxy Ss the device Payments are  for  months. Your base bill before taxes and promotions would be for the plan and access and  for device payments for . around  guesstimate including taxes. Thats roughly  per line for an Unlimited Data on VERIZON with a PREMIUM smartphone.The pricing and service is absolutely competitive.And if you dont want premium smart phones or just need entry level smart phones for kids or older members of your family hey we have the Samsung Jv for  monthly and the LG stylo  or the Iphone SE for much cheaper than the GS or Iphone or the Pixel.Video streams are not quality capped.

Theres also a disadvantage to streaming all p to the tiny phone screen you really do consume far more data than you would with p.  If you use video a lot you would hit the GB boundary far faster and be more likely subjected to throttling.  In case you missed it GB is the throttling point Verizon announced.  Its not guaranteed to be totally unlimited.I also get free international data and text messaging.  That for me is fairly valuable.  Thats an even bigger reason to go with TMobile.  My wife just returned from a business trip to Germany Italy and Poland.  Free data all the way.

They own during the build up then sell and leaseback once the store is operational. All of the carriers do this. This also makes colocation easier as TMobile Sprint Verizon and ATampT all use companies like American Tower.

10886799,0,t1_de2s338,No it absolutely wont.EDITING TO CLARIFY I think people have a notion that this is going to be deployed on macro towers. It wont be. This is bound to the same standards as regular WiFi with transmission power limitations of  Watt and ranges similar to regular WiFi routers. READ Not a real big range. This is for hyperlocal coverage. Think shopping malls stadiums train stations etc.Additionally this standard employs dynamic channel sizing so it can scale down to MHz and up to MHz again at will to prevent congestion on the band. And if that werent enough this standard also employs listenbeforetalk so it wont suddenly occupy a channel thats already engaged in a data session. And if that werent enough its primarily relegated to a part of the GHz band that doesnt have a lot of traffic on it to begin with due to a higher level of compliance.,tmobile,de2w9ac,10,t5_2shyc

11116352,0,t3_5ypxc3,My experience with the booster has been horrible it would interfere with my Ghz wifi networks heavily reducing the performance and range of the wifi network. The booster units would often disconnect from each other and would need to be unplugged and re plugged to get them to reconnect they would also constantly drop from  bars of LTE to  bar of HSPA. To top it off the range the booster provided was sub par and probably only sq feet. TMobile then recommended I try their new G LTE Cellspot and what an amazing difference I dont like that it needs to use my ISP for a data connection but it broadcasts strong LTE and HSPA and can use the signal about  houses away from me before it hops back to the macro tower which is noticibly weak and slow B LTE.TLDR Id recommend the G LTE Cellspot over the G LTE Booster any day.

If your phones battery is draining the issue is most likely something else. Band  wouldnt even help in your situation because your phone would recognize you have a pretty strong signal and not switch over to the lower frequency.

The speeds are generally pretty good with band  but I wish theyd give us some more beefed up stuff. The water towers are good for density to prevent congestion but leave much to be desired for coverage here.

11736023,0,t1_dgq9a9i,I see what youre saying and am glad you have a fantastic deal and trust me Im a big TMO fan but your reasons dont really make sense from a business or marketing standpoint.  They want to boost margins not shrink so while they let people stay on their existing plans theyd prefer them to switch for billing purposes and simplification.  Youre situation is such an outlier its not reasonable.  Why would would a new customer give a shit about a grandfathered plan data speeds that they cant get?  As for brand image they are the face of mobile change.  I believe the pain points now are going to be about convergence of tech and not the service and freebies were used to seeing but thats just a guess.What your asking for while itd be great for you just doesnt have broad appeal.  Its a nice idea it just doesnt help them in anyway youre clearly not going to switching and theyre already adding  of post paid lines industry wide.  ,tmobile,dgqb3dl,2,t5_2shyc
