Its merely a misfolded protein than can induce other molecules of the same protein to misfold in the same manner. The difference here from viruses is that the cell would be producing these proteins regardless however in a healthy cell these would not fold into the infectious form. A virus induces the cell to generate completely novel proteins and nucleic acids to create new copies of the virus. Maybe a semantic distinction but still significant.,Cooking,cef8inp,1,t5_2qh7f

136937,0,t3_1vmuzk,I might be able to bring a little of the metallurgical side in from my time as a welder.That loud noise you hear in the oven isnt the pan suddenly warping its the pan basically giving in to the warping. The metal is normally very stiff and resistant to warping however if you heat it slowly the metal will start to deform due to the heat and want to move. The rest of the pan hasnt heated enough to move easily so resistance starts building. Once the pressure exerted by the pans warping overcomes the stiffness of the metal it releases the stored kinetic energy and appears to warp instantly. The best way to avoid warping is to avoid rapidly heating or cooling a baking sheet. Some warping is natural but what locks that shape in is to rapidly cool the metal by say running it under water or pouring cold liquid ingredients into a hot pan. This is less a problem with aluminum than with steel but aluminum will still warp. If you just let a pan cool naturally on the top of a stove before washing it or better yet put it back in the oven after you turn the oven off removing the pan for washing once its cooled permanent warping should be minimal.Warp resistant pans are nothing special. The double rims basically act to hold the pan stiff so it doesnt move when it heats up. Theyre not strictly necessary if you take care of the pans and to be honest I dont really see a problem with a little warping.Ive never tried this but in theory if you were to heat up a baking pan in the oven at the ovens highest temperature and let it sit in there for a little while you could theoretically flatten it back out again by gradually reducing the heat after its been sitting for a while. You might have to add something heavy that would resist the heat to weigh down the pan equally in order for it to take its new shape. What I really want to know is how to remove the builtup grime that you find on that one shitty baking sheet everyone has. Thats the real mystery for me.,Cooking,ceu0zl0,6,t5_2qh7f

184679,0,t3_1w5wdw,There are many many reasons why sushi varies from so so to good to excellent.  The rice needs to be made and seasoned correctly. The rice needs to be handled correctly so that its not too packed not too loose this goes for both maki and nigiri.  The fish needs to be top notch so that it can stand alone.  I can go to several sushi bars around town order sashimi and get many different results.    The fish needs to be cut correctly stored correctly and handled correctly.  It should have mininmal contact with the chefs hands to preserve its natural texture and temperature. The same can be said of some of the vegetables when ordering maki.  They need to be sliced and handled in such a way that you get the most flavorful parts with the best texture.It needs to be presented correctly with the appropriate garnishes and sauces.  I can drive to no less than a dozen sushi bars in under fifteen minutes.  Of these only one of them is owned by a Japanese chef. The remaining are owned by others who have jumped into the sushi business and lack the appropriate respect for what they serve.  The sushi they serve is good enough but far from superb.

601359,0,t1_cg8kvob,Great Article! I love reading the serious eats guys too! The how to cook steak in a cooler was great and was how I started to sous vide.Im gonna rebut your post bc thats what you do on the internets!! but with a caveat OP was asking about the cast iron pan method and the above is my way of doing it.  Personally I prefer my steak broiled in a salamander. When I get my dream house cmon lotto! Im having one installed. Sous Vide is great too when Im in the mood to go all out.Myth  boils down to that it really doesnt matter if you bring steak to room temp. This is indeed true. That couple degrees really doesnt matter but the time that meat sits with the kosher salt on it does. Additionally I had a first semester culinary teacher who tended to throw things  so bring to room temp is so ingrained to me in recitation Id probably get hives and start ducking whenever I saw motion or something if I didnt post it. Myth  is about searing to seal in juices. Thats not right. You sear because it tastes good. If it sealed in juices nobody would ever get a dry steak. Oven to stove is ok too but I find it dirties more dishes and I HATE washing them.Myth  doesnt apply here Im a bone in type of person har har though based on the cuts of steak I prefer. Porterhouse anyone?Myth  is the only flip once. I advocate this because people like to hear things sizzle thats why I say dont play with it and LITHA so often. You press and futz in the name of turning you get shoe leather. Myth  we touched on in the beginning. Salt is good.a and b really dont apply but I do long handled tongs no matter the method forks are short and I feel more comfortable with the Longer Handles. I dont cut into steaks any more but when I was learning I did and it just makes for an ugly presentation.Myth  Good ol poke test. its ok but practice makes perfect. when you start use an instant read and then poke the steak.

I bought the ham I sliced for  cents per pound after christmas when it was on sale Im buying a couple more once easter is done. The trimmings and such are bagged for the dog.  The main bone and assorted bits went into a pot with chicken stock shortly after this pic was taken.  We added leeks and potatoes and celery and carrots and such and made an amazing soup.  The dog got the bone once it cooled.  We vacuum sealed half the slices and froze them.  The other half my wife and I will eat before it goes bad.  Were eating pretty much every part of it.Thats the practical part.  Logistically the slicer sits on a shelf. gt Does cured meat store long enough that its not an issue?My bacon doesnt last long enough for me to find out. Everybody wants some of it.  But it freezes very well when vacuum sealed.  So does pastrami.  And I have a duck breast Im going to make prosciutto out of.  I most certainly want that sliced paper thin.  And that keeps well too.

So grind up egg yolk oil anchovies dont be a weeny use like  anchovies black or kalamata olives and most of a head of garlic until it is a smooth paste. Mix with cooked couscous. Make it dense. Make a pile of dense as fuck couscous on every plate then top with your mushrooms. Done.Some advice on this one. You need the coldest an most violently dry white wine you can find.

1041243,0,t3_25zp26,If you just got the rice cooker its best to start simple and work your way up. Try making some plain rice.Youll want to put in roughly . times as much as water as rice. The ratio chances a little bit depending on the type of rice. Some use more water than others. Also youll want to put a little bit of salt in your water.It sounds like youve got a simple onoff rice cooker so just turn it on and let it do its magic. Even if you mess something up the rice cooker will give you pretty decent rice.The slightly more difficult part is the steaming. Thatll take a little bit of trial and error. You dont want to cut your veggies so thinly that they get oversteamed by the time the rice is done. You also dont want to cut them so thick that they dont cook through. The best way to learn the right size is honestly through practice. But bite sized chunks will probably be a safe size.You should add your steamer basket into the rice cooker right after you put the rice in. Youre not supposed to open the lid because the steam helps cook the rice and the veggies. When you open the lid the steam escapes. That being said lifting the lid isnt the end of the world. If you wanna check out your rice or veggies go ahead open it.Personally I would have added the spinach to the steamer basket along with the other veggies. But if Im steaming veggies in my rice cooker Im trying to keep it simple and lazy.Now as you noticed your food wasnt comple tasting. Thats because really good Indian food is based on a layering of multiple spices and flavors. Unfortunately your thymecurryturmeric didnt do that for you. But if you liked it keep doing it.If you wanna make yourself a whole meal just keep it simple. Find yourself an easy meat recipe Heres a simple Turmeric chicken recipe. Its got that Indian flair you wanted and pictures to help you along. and put some rice and veggies in the rice cooker Salt in the water. A little bit of salt and pepper on the veggies.

1127895,0,t1_chwhwx6,ampampamp Boyoz sfw gtgtBoyoz is a Turkish pastry associated with zmir Turkey which is practically the only city where it is prepared for commercial purposes and follows the original recipe. As such in the eyes of Smyrniots boyoz acquired the dimension of a symbol of their hometown or of their longing for it when away. The most widely preferred boyoz is plain without addition of meat or cheese or spinach stuffings and as cooked by a handful of master boyoz bakers in zmir.gtBoyoz paste is a mixture of flour sunflower oil and a small addition of tahin It is kneaded by hand and the ball of paste is left to repose for  hours. The paste is then flattened to the width of a dish and left to repose again. It is then kneaded and opened once more before being formed into a roll and left to repose as such for a further period of several hours. When the tissue of the paste is still soft but about to detach into pieces it is cut into small balls and put in rows of small pans and marinated in vegetable oil between half an hour and one hour. Their paste then takes an oval form and acquires the consistency of a millefeuille The small balls can then be put on a tray into a very hightemperature oven either in plain form or with fillings of cheese or spinach added inside.gtThe usual accompaniments for boyoz are dark tea and hardboiled eggs generously sprinkled with black pepper Boyoz is generally consumed outdoors purchased from street vendors.gtInteresting zmir | List of pastries | List of street foods | The Production Company Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwchwhx oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletechwhx.

1201461,0,t1_ci4cldp,I worked at a movie theater for several years while in college. Unless the flavacol was added to the kernels  and it most certainly could have been because I never checked the ingredient list  all we did was pop the kernels in  coconut oil. I sincerely doubt you need a special machine to pop the kernels. Basically the popper was just a large stainless steel pot with an oil dispenser and an agitator to keep the kernels in constant motion. You can easily replicate this on your stove by just continually shaking a standard stainless steel pot back and forth until it starts to pop. Personally until Im convinced otherwise my thoughts are that the secret to movie theater popcorn is just coconut oil and the buttery flavored popcorn topping that is basically just flavored hydrogenated oil. Honestly I make pretty damn good popcorn on the stove by just popping the kernels in a bunch of canola oil. ,Cooking,ci4s6nl,4,t5_2qh7f

However the idea behind the journal is to crystalize your ideas. People are not really aware of this but when we put our ideas down in writing they cement. So Id like you to write a journal and hopefully it helps you to actualize your goals. Plus its always nice to read over the journal later on to see how things have changed but really that has nothing to do with the journal. Its all about the actualization aspects. This is kinda like how writing down notes helps people remember things... writing things down activates parts of the brain beyond the scope of simply writing things.

Ditto for what other people are saying about the scale and weighing ingredients. Scales are also nice if you want to do portion control or similar things.. Bakers percentages work like thisso you have all the ingredients that eventually go into the recipe. The recipe is normalized to the flour this means that your flour weight is called . If you use half whole wheat flour and half allpurpose flour then you use  of each totaling . Then your hydration level is what it sounds like which is to say that its the ratio of liquid to flour in your recipe. If you have g flour and add in g water then you have a  hydration dough which is pretty typical and familiar for basic loaves. Yeast percentages vary depending on how long you want to wait but salt generally comes out to  the weight of the flour again if you use g flour youd use g salt. ,Cooking,cjnqi88,5,t5_2qh7f

Do a quick Google for various recipes but it generally involves defrosting the duck marinating using a mix of five spice etc and allowing the skin to dry enough so when you roast the duck the skin ends up getting deep fried by its own fat so the skin gets crispy while the meat stays juicy. I would imagine youd be able to adapt it to the rotisserie so long as you ensure sufficient convection happens to wick away excess moisture on the skin. Ive also read that some people blanch the duck first before preparing the skin so the roasting is really to get the skin crisp. Serve duck in slices within a mini crepe plus leek and cucumber strips and a dash of hoisin sauce.

So most of the work involved with this is prep work. For example it doesnt take twice as long to make a double batch of soup or really any longer lasagna is a slight exception. So on a day off spend an hour or two making large batches of something and freeze whatever you dont eat. I really like food savers for this but its certainly not necessary. For some stuff like lasagna you dont even need to cook it. Just assemble a few small pans and freeze them. Throw one in the oven straight out of the freezer for homemade lasagna.I especially like this with slow cooked foods like BBQ or pot roast and the like.

The toaster oven doesnt heat up the house like the oven.I also use it to make Pizza.  I get the casserole dish to about F on the stove then slide a   pizza in it with a short pizza peel.  Then I stick it in the Breville toaster oven on F broil for about  minutes then back to the stove for a min or two to adjust the browning on the bottom of the pizza.  Works darn good. Its inrange of pizza oven flavor but cant claim equal. They are delicious.Id like to know more things to do with my casserole dishbreville toaster oven.Soon Im going to do the nokneed bread recipe in it.  Since the casserole dish is lower than a dutch oven I will have to make loafs a little lower profile.  A standard dutch oven wont fit in the brevelle.  Ive already used the nokneed method to make a small loaf out of pizza dough.  It turned out crusty and delicious!  I hope I can make loaves big enough to make sandwiches.  If you have a enameled cast iron dutch oven the nokneed bread is something you definately want to try.OH LASTLY LOOK FOR THEM ON CRAIGSLIST.

1978936,0,t3_2hd0z7,I like to think about how I could use the random ingredient in another recipe. For example if something calls for oil substitute a little bit of the sesame oil to see how it tastes. You can do the same thing with unusually spices. I bought some caraway seeds for a bread recipe. I ended up using it in chili and thought it added an interesting note to the recipe. I have also put chili oil in mac and cheese. Granted you will sometimes end up making something that tastes weird but that is part of the joy.

2029437,0,t1_ckxn8pt,The best way to thaw frozen meat is to put in in the fridge for a day.  You can cook it immediately from frozen if you bring it to temp quicky like cooking a frozen steak in a frying pan but not in a slow cooker. You can defrost for example frozen chicken in sealed plastic by putting it in a mixing bowl and running not hot water in the mixing bowl for  min until its defrosted. Of course this is water wasteful and they probably dont recommend this anymore.The danger zone is between F and F.  This is the temp zone where bacteria grows. Food must be kept below F or above F or more for some foods.   Bacteria grows roughly doubling every  min.  It grows more rapidly at F then F or F but dont think of it that way. think of F to F as dangerous.Taking a steak out of the fridge and letting it rest on the counter for  min is WAY safer than putting a frozen roast in a crockpot and pushing on which will guarentee food poisoning.I cant type with my little fingers s of pages and pages.  Google around and read about danger zone and other key food safety concepts.  I recommend you also look up food poisoning and get familiar with the various kinds.  Clastaridium  sp is caused when take too long to let a big roast cool down too long in danger zone.  Campy is comes from chicken that doesnt reach temperature and kill the campy bug.  Half of all chicken in stores have campy.  Cooking it to F or so is utmost important.  Staph comes from salads and salsas when someone picks their zitty face and gets zit bacteria on veggies time.  You might also want to get familar with the onsets and durations and the symptoms of common food poisonings.I pull up this chart or one like it   times a year and take a few mins to brush up on the symptoms onset and duration. Its not likeyou are going to read it once and remember. it takes persistance but not much timeWhen people get sick its usually because of food poisoning and are unaware. They usualy call it a flu or other sickness they are aware of.  Those who are aware of food poisoning typically blame in on a food that didnt cause the problem. Example they get staph from a salsa they will say it must have been that burger.  ,Cooking,ckxsaaz,2,t5_2qh7f

2125087,0,t3_2j9hac,Desperation and limited supplies.When I was younger my father liked making for a kid complex dishes with lots of ingredients that I couldnt identify. His crowning achievement was purple chicken he cooked chicken in red wine instead of white. Me being a rather picky eater back then wouldnt eat most of it. The rule was eat what I make or you cook for yourself. So I started cooking pretty young. I got a lot of the basics down by just doing them screwing them up and trying again. Over the last tenish years times have not really been that great and Ive found myself with limited access to food or access to only poor quality food.This has forced me to adapt and cook with whatever I have on hand. Its made me very flexible in that I can walk into virtually any kitchen and cook a good meal even if I dont know whats in it beforehand. Not having necessary ingredients for recipes has made me virtually never use them which in turn has made me have to learn flavor profiles for spices and different ingredients and be able to combine and compare them in my head.Being forced to work with improper or low quality cookware is also extremely useful because it makes you squeeze the most out of what you have and develop a lot of skill working with some of the most basic tools. It does make things a bit more difficult but its definitely a learning experience.Ill be the first to admit my plating is atrocious. I simply do not care what the food looks like and that comes from being in a position where the sight of a plate with actual food on it was enough to make me want to eat it so Ive never really developed an eye for making something look good.,Cooking,cl9y18o,3,t5_2qh7f

Dont forget that the secret to good cooking is tasting your food as you are making it. Even if you follow a recipe exactly a lot of things can influence the taste of your food. When you are adding seasoning such as salt and pepper dont just dump in the amount the recipe calls for. Taste before adding add a little bit and taste again. If you dont put enough seasoning in you can always add more but if you put too much in youre screwed.And finally experiment. Take a recipe you like and mix it up a bit with additional ingredients. For example one thing I like doing with mashed potatoes is to boil a clove of fresh garlic with the potatoes depending on how strong the garlic taste you want take it out when you drain for a light hint or leave it in for more flavor.,Cooking,cm5wlkt,3,t5_2qh7f

2445329,0,t1_cmdo37y,Wow  thank you very much for the gold.       The cheese sauce  for me I would not do the completed cheese sauce tonite and then fridge it...simply because you want the cheese sauce to meld well into the pasta and be hot...and my thought is that if it is cold you would have to reheat and that may break and separate your cheeses from the emulsion and give you an oily mac and cheese. I have never tried fridging the completed cheese saucebut that is my initial thought. Remember the rule of thumb we dont want to cook cheese we want to melt it and stay melted.. This is why when you reheat mac and cheese it usually isnt as creamy good as it was when it was fresh made. Store bought frozen mac and cheese I believe contain extra emulsifying additives that limit this impact to reheating a frozen cheese sauce..       HOWEVERwhat you CAN do  is fridge the Bechamel  sauce without the cheese and then reheat slowly back to bubbly and then melt in your cheese. ORyou can make just the roux pasteand then fridge that. Then you heat up the milk and add in your roux paste and whisk. Either one may take a bit longer to reheat thoroughly and you may have to whisk it a bit to make sure it is thoroughly heated..but it should not be a problem. I believe Bechamel will last about  days in a fridgebut roux paste can be fridged and even frozen and will last months. I have not personally done either of these methods very many times made fridge roux more than bechamel to storebut I can tell you a couple tips  Here is how you do both to my knowledge...   If you choose to make the Bechamel Saucemake it fully minus the cheese  Pour it into bowl and cover it with plastic cling film and press the cling film down into it so that it touches the surface of the bechamelthis will prevent it forming a surface skin and getting sweatycondensation build up in the fridge.     If you decide to do the cold Roux only methodmake your roux butter and flour and take it to the white but not quite blonde stage...and then pour it out onto a flat sheet pan so it is in a semithin sheet about inch thick at most...also cover this with cling film touching and fridge it. It will solidify softly. When you go to use it  break it up in pieces like crackers which you then add this to a warming hot milkcareful not to scorch the milk! The roux melts in pretty well IMO.. Remember the rule of thumb for rouxhot roux  cold milk no lumps...and the reverse is also true hot milk  cold roux  no lumps. Lots of restaurants will make white roux and fridge it and then they can toss together as a thickener to make a sauce as thick and quick as they want it.  Some other basic bechamel making tips from the others I gave you already  when making your bechamel from a HOT roux  chilled milk is preferred so it blends well hot  cold  no lumpsand only add in a portion of chilled milk in at stages...and whiskstir til incorporated before adding more..add more and whisk..add more and whisk and stir til you have added in all your planned cups of milk.  Never add all your milk all at oncesmall stages. When you have added all your milk bring the bechamel to a simmering boil held for about minuteswhen it is at a boil it will be as thick as it will ever be. Bechamel usually doesnt thicken as it cools. If it is too thick for youadd more milk or Thin this with a little stock at this stage if you wish or need to. When you add your cheese it will thicken...so knowing this will help you gauge how much milk or stock you want to add knowing it will thicken some with the cheese additions. Also know  you do NOT need to add stockyou can keep it classic with just the roux and milk and it will be perfectly fineuse all milk to thin it is just fine. I just use stock to thin cause I like the extra flavorthat is just me. TASTE your bechameladjust your seasonings for salt after you have ALL your milk in and again after you have turned off the heat and you add the cheese to melt into the hot mix. IF you are using stock to this bechamel  adjust your salt AFTER you have added the stockstock is often salty so you do not want to oversalt the bechamel before you have added the stock.  So plan ahead so you know when to taste.    That should answer most questions  hope this helps ya and your mac and cheese is a big hit. Thanks again for the goldmuch appreciated.  EDIT Oh  if you are adding flavoring spices like Papprika. mustard powder or thyme etc  toss this in at the BUTTER MELTING stage..lots of spices bloom well in hot oil and you will get the most flavor out of this. Hold off on salt adjustment til you are at a boil and done with your liquids and if your cheese is salty then add sparingly and taste constantly.   ,Cooking,cmdy3ph,2,t5_2qh7f

Next choose a glaze. I like pommegranate molasses red wine vinegar and cloves but have a google and see what takes your fancy.  Then score the fat and if desired stud the ham with cloves. Next coat with glaze and slow roast. If precooked you just need to brown several layers of glaze  i.e. glaze  brown it up  reglaze  brown a bit more and you are done. Take maybe . hours at C.  If raw its a bit more complex as you need to ensure it is cooked so roast for longer on a lower setting depending on size  i.e.  hours at C  google for standard cooking times per weight of ham  glazing and reglazing throughout that time  Let it rest and cool to warm before cutting any. Will keep up to  days covered in fridge.  The beauty about cooking ham is you would have to seriously overcook it by some hours for it to cause any problems so aim to overcook it by a bit if you are unsure  it will still come out well. Just dont burn the glaze too badly bottom of pan and corners of the ham should be blackened but nowhere else.

2718897,0,t3_2r7b0n,Its a complete myth that olive oil turns toxic at high temps. And in fact many experts recommend using refined olive oil over soybean corn or canola oils for high temp frying. If you plan to enjoy the flavour of your extra virgin olive oil i wouldnt recommend using a high heat. Depending on the free fatty acid content the unrefined particles will burn. But a standard and usually much cheaper refined olive oil will not degrade much. In my personal opinion Id recommend using real butter tastewise. But that isnt one of the more healthy options.  And neither is coconut oil despite its hype. Both are high in saturated fats which increase cholesterol levels while olive oil does the opposite being high in unsaturated fats and decreasing cholesterol levels. At the end of the day its up to you. But olive oil refined is fine to fry with. ,Cooking,cnd4l0s,11,t5_2qh7f

Make it as you have been and put it through the roller fold it upon itself and run it through twice more. Do that for each level. It takes a minute or  longer if that but it tends to stop the tearing. Also when its cut I tend to leave it out for about  minutes so it has a chance to dry up the tiniest bit. Great recipes are easy when it comes to pasta dishes. A classic is just olive oil basil and cherry tomatoes. cook the tomatoes in a pan until theyve wilted a bit then squash each one with the back of a fork so some of the juices come out. Swill in a bit of white wine and toss the pasta in it. Its simple and will blow your mouth hole away. The plus side is you can take or add anything and its still a pasta dish.

2863550,0,t3_2suwdf,Ill preface this by saying I was  and an idiot. I started an oil fire by tossing a cup of oil on a super hot pan. I pulled it off the burner but the oil was scalding my hand so I couldnt hold it long enough to turn off the burner. At least having the presence of mind not to shove it in the sink I threw the pan on the laminate countertops scorching a giant hole in the middle of my parents kitchen. I started throwing lids into the inferno hoping to stop the fire but every lid was half the size of the stupid pan. At that point I decided arm hair be damned I was getting this pan out of my house before the place burned down. So I walked it into the driveway and left the smoldering pan out there for my parents to come home to. Im nearly  now and I still get shit for that burn mark in the counter. ,Cooking,cntl4yv,1,t5_2qh7f

That said anything you pickup on Amazon should do the job.The bells and whistles on some of the models like a digital timer are not essential imho.  Everything on Amazon comes with a removable ceramic sleeve which is the big thing you want.  On the rare occasion Ive needed to start my slow cooker when Im not home I use a heavyduty timer...the kind people use to turn their lights on and off so it looks like theyre home.Size is usually the hardest thing to work out.  A  Litre Slowcooker is massive and will take up a ton of room when youre not using it.  I regularly cook for five people with a .L slow cooker and aways end up with tons of leftovers.

2953195,0,t1_co3jjug,You could try using celery leaves in place of celery seed a lot of the time.  Similarly I feel like I could approximate coriander with citrus and a hint of allspice.Speaking of which allspice master race reporting in.  I kind of see it as a unique blend of cinnamon and clove so I chose it because its so incredibly versatile in both savory and sweet.  I wont worry too much about those other two so long as I have allspice.I really wanted to say mustard seed but its more of a base spice I use in a lot of things and it doesnt stand out much on its own.  Id rather have caraway myself.  But if we were to completely go spices and not include herbs I included dill and thyme Id definitely include mustard seed.So I had allspice caraway and cumin.  Add mustard seed with your rule adaptation.  I think Id have to go cardamom.  Like caraway and cumin its absolutely unique and cant be approximated by any means.  With things like anise and fennel you get a lot of the same flavor from the fresh root.  Or maybe juniper do berries count as a spice?  I think allspice is actually a berry so Id think so.Yeah juniper allspice and dill with a little dry mustard to balance it out... I cant lose that.,Cooking,co3sj4o,2,t5_2qh7f

With enough practice youll be able to make bread thats better than anything you can find at your local supermarket and itll be fresher than anything you can get at a bakery. Its definitely a hobby of love. It seems like you want to focus on simpler things for now though so read on! My advice for both cooking and baking know your equipment and use the right tool for the right job. Even with the best recipe your results will be poor if you dont use the right tool. Even worse using the wrong tool can be dangerous!The most important kitchen tool is a very sharp chefs knife. Using a dull knife is more dangerous. As somebody said previously youll need to work on your knife skills. Look up some Youtube videos and always be conscious of your noncutting hand. As another example what kind of pots and pans do you have? Cooking with nonstickstainless steelcast iron are all very different. For instance you need to preheat stainless steel for a few minutes to prevent things from sticking even if you use oil. At that you need to have lots of experience with stainless steel to prevent eggspancakes from sticking. On the other hand preheating an empty nonstick Teflon pan is quite dangerous and can emit toxic fumes. Cast iron is its own beast. We could all give you some pointers if you let us know what potspans you have.As far as making grilled cheesepancakesscrambled eggs Id say just go for it. Find a recipe you like with minimal ingredients for starters and try it out. It wont work out the first few times but post your results here ask questions and try it again. ,Cooking,co4rwp2,8,t5_2qh7f

The rest was pouring wine minding the timer and adorably sharing the spoon to taste the sauce as it reduced. Onepot pasta meals would work well for this too  just divvy up the prepchopping and share the stirringkeeping an eye on things part.Stuffed shells would also work  much lower skill level required than doing dumplings or even tamales and less fuss than lasagne. Prepare them together then as they bake one of you gets a head start on dishes and the other works on a simple green salad.My ex used to get excited about making curry with me usually he would let me do my thing and then hop in to do dishes after.

Boil your water and add the noodles. While that is going on make your sauceStart by making a rue melt Tbsp butter in pan add Tbsp flour to melted butter and let cook for a minute. Add about C milk let thicken. Add cheese your choice I prefer AmericanCheddar mix but you could do gouda cheddar just about anything. Mix so the cheese is incorporated. Add tsp of paprika  tsp salt Tbsp pepper. Add milk slowly to get a consistency that is just slightly THINNER than you want the sauce will thicken as it cools or if you place in the oven. Combine shells and cheese sauce. You dont have to bake but you can breadcrumbs on top under the broiler makes an excellent baked Mac n Cheese.

This isnt to say that you need to rigidly follow a recipe but youre way better off looking at what people have already done rather than reinventing the wheel for each meal. Learn the basics first then start going off in different directions.Now as to rice and beans you can throw it all in at once or you can cook things separately.Personally for tomatoes and rice I cook white rice first then mix with a sauce. I use a rice cooker but a good rule of thumb for stove top white rice is a  ratio of waterrice. When you cook the sauce and rice together you have to add a bunch more water or else it becomes a sticky mess and it can be hard to eyeball. For  cups of rice I do the following Boil  cups of water Pour the rice into the water Bring mixture back to boil while stirring to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom Place a lid on top and reduce heat to about    Let simmer for  minutes if steam is escaping from the lid turn the heat down Kill heat let sit for  minutes Rice is done.For the sauce I usually saute onion then add tomato saucediced tomatoes and seasoning until I get where I like it then I add the rice. I also usually add chicken broth or water and appropriate amount of bouillon.  Make the sauce stronger than you would actually like it because the rice will blunt the flavoring and make it bland. Once I get the sauce to my preferred taste and its heated up I add white rice to the sauce until I get a good coating. I would then add beans  can at a time probably  max for  cups of rice.,Cooking,cpk827y,1,t5_2qh7f

That means penguins cant taste fish even though thats pretty much all they eat.Also as far as I know there are no birds that can taste capsaicin. That means no matter how hot you make your food it will not bother a bird. Supposedly this ended up as a lucky evolutionary coincidence  birds dont chew their food and so seeds of chili plants pass through their digestive system and spread around. That means that for a chili plant it is an evolutionary advantage to be eaten by birds. At the same time animals like humans have teeth that grind the chili seeds into nothing. Being eaten by humans  and similar animals is a evolutionary disadvantage to the chili plant. Capsaicin solves this problem  makes it less likely that animals will eat the chili while at the same time having no effect on the likelyhood of being eaten by birds. Of course this backfired in the long run what with humans eating chili BECAUSE of the heat. ,Cooking,cpkwce4,10,t5_2qh7f

That said my guess would be that since glutamate is charged its water soluble most often external in the tertiary protein structure and therefore more readily detectable by a membrane bound receptor.

The biggest enemy of meat in freezing is air which creates freezer burn. Wrap your meal in plastic wrap pretty carefully maybe even two layers then contain it in a zip lock from which you have expelled all air by submerging the bag up to the zip line in water.  Label the meat and date it then set in a part of the freezer that has maximum air circulation for quick freezing and your brisket should be fine for  months.

In the philosophy of language and philosophy of science nonsense is distinguished from sense or meaningfulness and attempts have been made to come up with a coherent and consistent method of distinguishing sense from nonsense.

Ill give you a list of reasons.A pot on the stove has better temperature control and recovery time the time it takes for the oil to reheat to target temperatur after adding food than consumer market deep fryers.   A pot is much easier to clean.  A pot can use less oil for small batches or more oil for larger batches the choice is yours. Fryers have a fixed sized tank.   I can fry a huge batch in a pot at one time not so with the fryer. If I need a big batch I can use a big pot.  If I just need a little I can use a little pot.   I trust my thermometer reading more than I trust the thermometer or depending on the fryer a single red light on the fryer.   Recycling oil is a lot simpler with a pot.  Most fryers must be disassembled to remove the tank.  My pot gets much hotter than the fryer.  Consumer grade fryers are heated by electric coils that will only put out so much and no more as they have built in thermostats that shut off the current so they dont burnout our exceed the rating and potentially cause fires.In short the pot of oil and a thermometer is easier all the way around.,Cooking,cr4nvz6,49,t5_2qh7f

4150511,0,t1_crtcn3r,I dont own anything but stainess except for my wok.  The secret to cooking with stainess is to always preheat it properly before adding fats and food.  For stuff like meat youll want to heat the pan to a point where a spoonful of water will stay together as a blob and float on the surface. No fizzling not breaking up into droplets just a cohesive blob.  Once youre there wipe away the water and add your oil.  Let it heat for a moment until it shimmers wont take but a few seconds. Now you can add your meat veggies or potatoes and they wont stick.  As for the room temp eggs think of it this way. Youve  preheated the pan adding a cold egg will instantly lower the temperature of the pans surface under the egg just enough to be problematic.  As for science youll just have to experiment and see.  It doesnt get any more scientific than that.  Edit some sticking can be good depending on the recipe.  That stuff stuck to the bottom of a pan is called fond and is used to make pan sauces.  Remove the food but leave the heat on  add liquid both stock wine water and give it a nudge with a wooden spoon. The stuck bits will come up and incorporate flavor into your sauce.  ,Cooking,crtdez0,5,t5_2qh7f

The only reason to soak is to reduce cooking time but in my opinion it ruins the beans.Do you have a crockpot? Crockpots and beans are best friends. If you love beans and think youd make them a lot if you were able to get the flavor you want its well worth picking one up. In addition to doing a great job cooking beans its hassle free no tending a pot and no chance of scorching them.So what I do is rinse and sort my beans then throw them in the crockpot with various aromatics such as an onion sliced in half dried chiles chopped garlic and bay leaves. In the case of pintos or black beans I would also add cumin and oregano. For richness put in a pig knuckle or some olive oil both are tasty depends if youre in a meaty mood or not.Dont forget to put in salt! Then fill the crockpot up to about . inches from the top with water and leave it be for about  hours. You can peek and stir very occasionally if you want but keep this to a minimum as the device loses heat when opened.Once theyre done you can turn the crockpot to low and eat when youre ready. Youll know youre done when the broth or gravy as you call it is flavorful and opaque and the beans are soft and creamy.Let me know if you have any questions!,Cooking,cs0ox2l,18,t5_2qh7f

Also I too love eating my cookie dough raw XDOh yeah apparently those flaxchia seeds are supposed to contain fibre and healthy Omega  oil or something but thats just a bonus really.,Cooking,cs92dku,1,t5_2qh7f

Try cooking it in batches or using a large pan. Also dont be tempted to keep stirring. When you first throw it in the hot pan just let it sit for a minute or two to brown.

I have it and also have a couple of his DVDs forgot which book it came with.The videos are extremely helpful. For example you can learn some fairly complex stuff like deboning a chicken how to truss or galantine  so much easier from the videos.Oh and for classic French techniques you should also buy and keep Larousse Gastronomique. It is one of the best reference books you will find on classic French dishes and ingredients and techniques. I often cross reference recipes with Larousse just to find out what the authority has to say about the subject.I understand there are many modern books now that do a better job on tehcniques possibly. But these two are the classics. You cannot go wrong with them. And Jacques is extremely good at helping lay the basic foundation for correct techniques. That is because he obsesses about techniques and also is an extremely good and detail oriented teacher.For example here is his classic video on making a classic French omelette I have not found a single video or book that does this better  either in terms of technique or in terms of explaining it so nicely.Edit I think this is the DVD I was talking about.

It has carried me from beginner to actually decent baker with very little in the way of other instruction.If you would simply like a decent white loaf recipe to get through all this yeast then heres the Gold Medal classic sandwich loaf recipe converted to one loaf instead of two.

4466205,1,t3_3ca40x,My main problem with your query is that ranch dressing is not cooked but simply prepared with condiments or purchased prebottled. Might work this recipe and see if a little bit more of this or that makes it thicker.You could also try to cook your mayo from scratch though maybe thats a good place to start.Otherwise here are the most commonly accepted thickening agents in the kitchen all of these need heat to work so might be best to prep in advance and chill the results in the fridge.  Corn starch or an arrowroot slurry thickens everything. Just add either to water. A whitewash is the same concept except with flour and water. Heres my post on Bechamel which uses a roux. Instead of milk throw in the dressing. There are three stages to a roux light medium and dark coloring. The darker it is the more flavor it will have but lowered thickening power.  Beurre Manie is a  thickening agent that combines equal parts flour and softened butter. Knead it together and form little balls. Drop them into sauces for flavor and thickening power. Best at the end of a cooking process though. The butter adds shine and flavor as it melts. Liaison is a mixture of egg yolks and heavy cream that adds richness and smoothness with minimal thickening. It is important to ensure you prevent the egg yolks from coagulating when they are added to a hot liquid. The generally accepted ratio is  yolks to   fluid ounces of cream.Please let me know which path you walked.,Cooking,cstn4cd,-2,t5_2qh7f

Ive found that motorized devices break apart different spices at varying degrees so one spice may be broken into  pieces and another may be turned to dust so the spice thats broken apart more will overpower the other measured spices. Grinding spices by hand allows you to control this.I purchase whole spices from a local store where the source is of quality. Your Mexican or Indian markets may have direct connection to places of origin. You should ask them. Proper drying and storage of spices makes all the difference. Taste before you buy if you can. If you dont have a good local store Penzeys is the best option but theyre expensive.Herbs are not spices and I hope you know the difference. In terms of useful spices for your rack here goesPepper corn mix of black white yellow and green. Grind it fresh on your food before eating.Coriander. Toast it dry in a pan and grind it as an addition to meat prior to cooking.Cardamon. Tremendously aromatic and flavorful. This spice is amazing. You can use it for fish rice vegetables etc.Thyme.

I just alternate it then brush with melted butter lightly salt and pepper then grill. You can still pull it off the skewer at the end and have a colorful bowl of veggies or leave it on the skewers.

I did ban him off rmimicrecipes for following me around on every post I made on different subs. He would make comments like this and even send me PMs like this So yes I banned him off my subreddit because hes harassing me at this point.The fact is I care for my sub a lot and care for the quality of the sub. Before I imposed a new rule to forward requests we were being inundated with threads like theseand PMs like thisAs you can see a good majority of the subscribers were sick of  of the sub being requests. People were complaining that most of those requests could be easily found on google. This was not a change that I made myself but that the subscribers kept urging me to do. It was a grey area because a lot of people enjoyed the requests. On the other hand the quality of the subreddit was going down and people were complaining. This is when I made the sticky post saying that requests were going to be removed. We discussed the idea of having a weekly sticky thread or a new subreddit entirely. I mentioned that I knew this change might upset a few people but it was ultimately for the quality of the subreddit. We ended up choosing a weekly sticky. Since then this JosephND guy has been following me around everywhere I post and complaining. gtWell this mod made a post basically saying hes all powerful because k people subbed to himWhat I did mention is that we got k subscribers in a month meaning that the opportunity for the new subreddit to grow is there. I normally stay out of reddit drama but this guy has been following me around so I needed to air all of this out.

As I said before there are three keys to Thai curry success. Quality curry paste . Quality coconut milk . Balancing the saltysweet flavors with fish sauce and sugar.It looks like youre on track for  but probably not for  and .I recommend avoiding lite coconut milk at all costs  its had most of the cream removed which is where all the fat and all the coconut flavor is. Theres probably some thickeneremulsifier added to make it look white amp creamy but its really mostly water. Without the cream youre left with a lot of water and not much coconut flavor and rich texture.Likewise with the curry paste  the Simply Asia stuff is jarred which means its been cooked and that kills a lot of the flavor. The brands like Mae Ploy that come in plastic tubs are uncooked and far more fragrant and aromatic.This is such a simple recipe   of the flavor is in two ingredients the coconut milk and the curry paste and if theyre lacking in flavor the dish will be dull.I dont want to discourage you from trying new recipes  I say go for it but have realistic expectations and if it turns out a little bland dont give up but try again with better ingredients.Good luck and cheers for being adventurous in the kitchen!,Cooking,cv2ulpa,2,t5_2qh7f

In the  years my wife and I have lived in this house weve had  random issue with the cooktop where it wouldnt turn on. Called the service department and they recommended cycling the breaker that the stove was on that fixed it and weve never had another issue. Aside from finding the largest burner with all three rings on at  one very warm at least in the kitchen morning because we forgot to lock the controls and a cat stepped on them. No real damage was done.

Sure jalapeno is used very often but its the rat tail chilie that really gives you the kick.  Mexician food should be SPICY nothing is more disappointing then anemic mexician cooking to fit the tastes of anemic customers. Id start out with tacos choice of meat with diced white onion cilantro and hot sauce on corn tortillas. Not flour not fried. Simple corn tortillas served warm.Carnitas are the stuff of legends when theyre done right. You absolutely need to fry them up after cooking your pork shoulder down. Its not carnitas unless you do this its just pulled pork.A great thing to do is to get a bunch of dried chilies and experiment with them. Dont be afraid to taste the dried chilies straight up you need to calibrate your tastes to these ingredients especially if youre not very experienced with them.And beware socalled mexician resturaunts if youre not living in a state that borders mexico.

Remove the chicken to a plate then saute your veggies for a minute. Carrot onion peppers etc. Then add another dollop of curry paste to the pan and warm it up by mashing it around and working some of the oils and whatnot into it. When its warm and soft add either coconut milk I cannot imagine using cows milk at all TBH or chicken or veggie stock. Whisk the paste into the liquid as best you can add chicken and veggies back into the pan and simmer. You can add cans of water chestnuts tomatoes bean sprouts baby corn etc. If the mixture is too thin pull out at least half a cup of liquid whisk in some flour and yogurt or sour cream if its too spicy and then mix that mixture back into the pan. ,Cooking,cwsuxrr,3,t5_2qh7f

I guess the only thing thats changed is that Ive improved my level of technical skill and my knowledge of how to combine flavors so a meal tastes like a meal not just a bunch of random dishes on the plate. Alton Browns show Good Eats has lots of good ideas on building your cooking skill set. You can probably find it online somewhere. He does have a blog Kenji LopezAlts new book The Food Lab has a lot of great information on how and why things work in the kitchen and how to avoid disaster. A lot of his recipes are on Serious Eats website so you can get a sense of what his work is like. Even something as simple as a boiled egg gets taken seriously as a subject for experiments. Ive learned a lot from them both. My only other advice would be to find some recipes that you can prepare as written and enjoy. Repeating a success experience is a great way to build your skills.

I also have a couple of cheap pans that I replace regularly pot for pasta nonstick frying pan for scrambled eggs etc but I use my AllClad every single day and have never been happier.Tip I dont know if they sell them anymore but I got the AllClad with the frosted steel covering so that I didnt have to worry about keeping stainless super polished or clean. Theyre all seasoned heavily on the bottom but the sides still look great and I dont do anything special to take care of themETA  I guess its the MC line?  Looks like it from photos. I dont have an induction burner I have gas so I dont worry about that bit. I love it and much prefer it to the upkeep required to keep stainless looking nice.

With the lack of anything spicy raw onions would serve as the only somewhat spicy sharp ingredient available.The Vikings would invent an equivalent of bourbon or chicha as a cornbased alcoholic drink while introducing mead made from honey.In general maple syrup or honey might be used as a sweetener.

At my house well add a can of chickpeas early in the cooking process after frying the onion with the parsley so they absorb the other flavours of the dish. What about sweet potato latkes?  I havent tried this so you may want to test it before serving it. We usually use grated zucchini carrot and potatoes in our latkes.  You may need to try other veg to go with the sweet potato.  But you can use egg and chickpea flour as the binder.  Also if you get the skillet temperature right you can cook them in a way that is more like toasting than frying which I have found makes a much nicer lighter patty. ,Cooking,cy6lvnk,13,t5_2qh7f

6044822,0,t3_3yaipv,Im Cantonese and salt amp pepper meat is one of my favorite dishes of all time. Its so flavorful. The recipe is really simple for any of the variations Ill outline it here. Dust the squid pork or shrimp with flour.. Deep fry until cooked through and golden brown.. Dice chile peppers thai birds eye chiles or jalapeos work garlic and scallions and sweat them in a wok or skillet for a couple of minutes. On high heat add the deep fried meat and mix everything to incorporate. Season generously with salt amp pepper.. Garnish with cilantro and eat immediately.The flavor is from the heaping amounts of salt amp pepper you add as well as the peppers garlic and scallions. I havent gotten around to trying it but I also wanted to avoid deep frying in the future and I suspect it would still taste pretty good if you did something like just stir fry the shrimp before adding the garnish.

The biggest difference between  of restaurant food vs. home cooking all foods not just burgers is that people who cook at home tend to cook leaner meats and use FAR less salt and fat. Most people have no idea how much salt and fat is in restaurant food  how much food is finished with butter or buttery oils before being sent out how much food is salted before and during cooking and again right before being sent out. You can get a perfectly fine searmailiard reaction on a cast iron skillet on the average home stove as long as you let it get to temp first.  ,Cooking,cyf2lhl,82,t5_2qh7f

For example granite counters are porous if not properly sealed periodically and arent used in commercial kitchens for that reason. Some types of wooden cutting boards are porous and you shouldnt cut chicken or meat on them because you cant clean all the bacteria of them although my understanding is that rock maple boards are so dense that theyre considered nonporous.In that context of cooking stainless steel is NONporous and you dont have to worry about contamination bacteria seeping into the material.

The cheap stuff works fine but you might want a little romano as well as the cheap stuff tends not to be sharp enough for my taste. You can always go for the pregrated stuff in a can or tub but in that case youll want to use more salt and blend the cheese into the sauce along with the shrimp.

You can defrost frozen meats in that in a minute or two without it starting to cook.  I dont have a microwave so I always have to take stuff out and stick it in the fridge overnight to defrost.  Like I said previously get raw meat wrap it up in portions and freeze those so they dont freeze into a single block.  I usually get bonlessskinless chicken thighs pork chops and italian sausages.  Theyre all quick and easy to wrap and freeze and portioned well for a meal.  The chicken and pork are my main meats with the sausage mostly serving for the nights when I forget to take stuff out to thaw.  You can do chicken breasts this way also but I recommend trimming them down to single servings before freezing.  Steaks are great too but Im cheap and poor.  If you only have a frozen thing and no alternative what I do is stick it in a sandwich bag squeeze out as much air as possible and run it under the tap for  minutes rotating sometimes.

After cooking they are basted with sauce and finished on the grill.Two ways to cook these ribs like the restaurantPlace seasoned ribs on a rack inside a roasting pan. Put  cups of water and  tablespoons of liquid smoke in bottom of pan. Cover entire pan tightly heavy duty aluminum foil.  Once the long way and then again the short way pinch the edges super super tight to the edge of the pan. Every other recipe I have seen says to use Plastic Wrap but I find at  hours in the oven it always breaks downmelts and I personally never use it anymore because its gross.Place in  degree oven for  hours. Reduce oven heat to  degrees and let cook another    hours you really need the a minimum of the  hours anything less is crap. Whatever you do do not open the oven or sealed up ribs before  hours they will not be ready and youll only make the cooking time longer. Remove ribs from pan and let rest for at least an hour room temperature is ok but chilling them makes grilling them much easier. Cover both sides with sauce and grill on the BBQ before we had a BBQ I would not chill them and instead transferred them off the rack onto a sheet pan and broiled them to get that nice caramelization on the sauce.

6423137,0,t3_43l9g7,I use el cheapo vegetable oil thats a mix of various seed oils usually safflower soy and rapeseed oil for generic cooking oil purposes. it has a neutral flavor a high smoke point and its way less expensive than olive oil. this is my real workhorse cooking oil for all kinds of sautes stirfry panfry and almost anything else. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil only when the actual flavor of the oil will come through in the dish. Kinda pointless to cook with a more expensive oil if it all gets buried under a really flavorful curry sauce or tomato sauce or whatever anyway. So basically my use cases for olive oil are the following. use it in uncooked recipes sauces dressings condiments where the nice flavor of extra virgin olive oil comes through.. use it in cooked sauces where the flavor of the oil is itself an important component of the dish e.g. pasta aglio e olio. use it for cooking delicate things at lower heat. usually I would use butter for this but some things flavormatch with olive oil better than butter. my main use case for this is fresh fish but sometimes I have delicate vegetables like zucchini blossoms for example where olive oil is the best thing to cook it in. ,Cooking,czjot7q,1,t5_2qh7f

The other axis is back to front where I put my most frequently used seasonings towards the front and the more rarely used ones at the back.

Cover and bake at about  for a few hours until the meat is tender and pulls apart easily.  Remove meat add some more flour and make a delicious gravy from the drippings still in the panadd more water if needed but keep the gravy nice and thick.  Season it with salt and pepper and a bit of Kitchen Klatter.  It will be dark and rich and amazing.  Serve over the meat and mashed potatoes.  Variations  When you first put the meat in the Dutch Oven sprinkle a package of dry onion soup mix over it.  The gravy will be outstanding.

Someone bumped into me the roast beef I was adjusting slipped and my hand landed very very near the blade.We got a second dedicated glove after that.Later same restaurant food storage dish storage and walkin were in the basement and the kitchen was on first floor.  The non skid strips on the steps were worn down and very often slick from gunky shoes.  Someone had already taken a spill carrying a large container of not hot soup down to the walk in.

I meant to only cut around the pit but the knife kept going... straight into my thumb.  Fortunately it was a sharp knife and I wasnt putting a ton of pressure on it.  I can only imagine how mangled my hand would have been if I had used more pressure with a dull knife.And when I was young maybe ?

I hated the Campbells cream of tomato soup to the point of nausea for as long as I can remember but stumbled on a fix that is a family favorite here.  There are more elegant and complex soups but for grilled cheese this is a winner.  Take a can of condensed tomato soup a can of water and either   cups peeled and diced really good fresh tomatoes or a can of whole tomatoes squished into pieces.  If tomatoes are not in season the can will be better.  Season it with as much garlic sauteed in butter are your conscience allows add about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper to the butter garlic mix in the last little bit of cooking the garlic then stir that into the soup with dried oregano to get a balanced flavor.  Fresh oregano is marginally better so use it if you have it.   Once the soup is simmering add basil to taste.  Fresh basil is hugely better but hard to come by in soup weather.  The hot house grown stuff has a vague cat soil smell that is entirely undesirable.  If you froze basil in the summer use that.  If you use dried basil add a little fresh parsley or even bit of shredded fresh green like spinach or lettuce  T to perk up the freshness. Simmer a minute or two and prepare to dip your sandwich.  ,Cooking,d0a4qsc,1,t5_2qh7f

Celeriac and rutabaga its usually best to peel dice and roast.  Again I just toss them in olive oil salt and pepper and toss them in the oven.  All of these things come out really well at F.  Insert a knife into any of these things when you think they are close to done to determine how done they actually are.,Cooking,d16xtk9,12,t5_2qh7f

If the recipe calls specifically for baking soda or baking powder it means its probably best to use exactly that. You can try to substitute the one with the other but theres no really a guarantee that the recipe will work as well.,Cooking,d28jzp9,8,t5_2qh7f

7380588,0,t3_4gfjk5,dont expect perfection from your first sharpening session but if theyre as dull as you say they are you should definitely see some improvement. The trick is to drag the knife across the stone with the spine of the blade leading the motion so that you dont gouge your stones. Work at a consistent angle allowing the entire length of the blade to be ground against the stone I usually accomplish this by locking my elbows and wrists into a fixed angle and twisting with my torso. Continue to grind each side until you raise a discernible burr. On course stones you should be able to see the burr being raised as well as feel it with finer stones youll have to feel the edge of the blade to determine if you have raised the burr sufficiently along the length of the blade. The last couple of passes on each side you should switch to gently pushing the blade across the stone to help minimize the burr alternatively you could strop the blade when youre done on the stones and itll remove your burr. My ideal angle is around  degrees per side  degrees overall though some of my knives are ground finer than that still.,Cooking,d2h4ezn,2,t5_2qh7f

And I offer the same things repeatedly usually about  times before I declare failure. So I know that sometimes she just wont eat a thing.

The pieces should be bitesized up to maybe the size of the top knuckle on your middle finger.Throw the chicken into a tupperwarebowl pour regular soy until it covers the chicken then throw in four or five cloves of garlic halved and slightly pressedmashed. Mix it all up a bit and let that marinade in the fridge overnight.When youre ready to cook throw oil into the pan. If you have high heat and a wok great. If not just use whatever wide saute pan you have.Heat the oil up on high heat until its just about smoking then throw in the dried chilies. Let them cook in the oil stirring regularly until they get slightly blackened  not burnt dont burn them. Once thats done take the chilies out and reserve them.If using white onions add them. If using mushrooms add them as well. Cook the onions until the have just a little bite left but dont caramelize them or cook them to mush. Take them out when theyre done. Cook the mushrooms simultaneously until they release juices and then start soaking back up. Take them out once they have a good flavor. Reserve both.Add the chicken and the fresh sliced jalapenos. Cook until the chicken is done on the outside then add the dried chilies mushrooms onions. Add a couple dashes of dark soy sauce a couple dashes of light soy sauce and a couple extra whole cloves of garlic. Cook for another  until the chicken is done and eat.You can add virtually anything you want to this dish. Cabbage carrots sausage whatever but kung pao chicken essentially boils down to stir fried chicken peppers and onions. The key is the order things are cooked and marinading the chicken to help it stay tender and flavorful.EDIT Forgot to mention the difference between onions. In Chinese cooking and most Asian cooking you throw whiteyellow onions in early and let it cook and the onion flavor develop and get in with everything else. Green onion is used as a garnish to taste ONLY dont cook it or  or if you have to cook it quick towards the end. Use the entire green onion not just the white part. If you must cook it the white part is better to cook with in my experience.  of the time though its just thinly sliced and thrown on top during plating.,Cooking,d34e95d,2,t5_2qh7f

7715059,1,t3_4kzz34,I purchased the Chefs Choice Knife Sharpener  I know that the trendy way to sharpen knives right now is with a set of stones but I just cant be assed to do that. When my knife dulls I spend  minutes using the sharpener and honing the blade. Note that the rd notch says Serrated.Here are some general recommendations for picking a knife. I recommend just going to a store like Williams Sonoma Bed Bath and Beyond or Su La Table and just trying out knives. I know that many of them will have some vegetables around that you can practice on.I personally prefer a slightly heavier knife because I can rely on gravity to help push a knife down through whatever Im cooking. I like a wooden grip because the weight helps distribute the weight closer to the center of the knife the grip point rather than making it more front heavy which can be tough on the wrist. This means that I usually avoid plastic grips.I have a grand total of  knives.  of my cutting is performed by a relatively large . Santoku essentially a Japanese chefs knife. I have a cheap chefs knife that I use for cutting things that might damage the blade such as casseroles in a glass dish. Beyond that I have a Wuhstoff bread knife a paring knife for very small cuts and peeling and a utility knife when I need to cut smaller items or Im cutting a small amount of food.Im personally absolutely in love with the Japanese knives and would totally recommend a Santoku for a first knife but I also recommend you find the time to try holding it and determine if its for you. The straight vertical edge next to the handle can be cumbersome to first time users.Beyond a chefs knife I recommend holding off until you find yourself needing something else. It also means you can spend a little extra on your main knife rather than buying a set of cheap knives.Avoid carbon steel knives. They rust easily. Ceramic knives cannot be sharpened with the sharpener I linked above.,Cooking,d3j5e1r,2,t5_2qh7f

The meat was almost always venison since the cows they had were for dairy.  When I was a kid they grandmothers  were no longer farming but the practice of using venison in pastys was way more common than using beef.  I remember one holiday when my dad and uncles went hunting to make sure there was meat for pastys.  My grandma didnt give them am option as far as returning without a deer.  She was a tough beautiful woman!My pasty dough has always been hit or miss.  It seems like  simple thing but Im never quite happy with it.

8229064,0,t1_d5667hz,Have you tried using a grill block? At my restaurant we use some luke warm water I dont ever recommend using cold water or ice because it can cause your flat top to warp or even crack in half and go crazy with a grill block on it. Depending on how dirty it is  ours is usually black after  hours of service  you will have to use some elbow grease and spend a good  minutes doing it. If its really bad you can mix in some degreaser with the water. Once youve got it spotless rinse with water and the polish with lemon juice or vinegar I prefer lemon juice. Its much easier to clean when hot. And this doesnt matter as much for home since you probably only use it once and dont let it sit on for hours it should be scraped with a bench knife and wipe down between uses. If you leave stuff on it cooks on. If you arent anal about getting it perfectly clean you will experience carbon build up andor discolouration that a normal cleaning wont get off. There are high temp cleaners that can be used to do whats called a recovery. Im not sure what is out there though that you can get without being part of a restaurant.

8775867,0,t3_509xjb,The correct answers is already in the replies but I figured I would chime in.Generally the sauce not working out with fresh tomatoes comes down to how the person is doing the prep and potentially the tomatoes theyre using.Youll want to skin the tomatoes and remove the pulp.  The easy way to do this is to blanch the tomatoes for one minute.  Bring a big pot of water to a boil drop in the tomatoes for one minute and then drain.  A lot of people recommend cutting an X in the skin before you blanch the tomatoes but I find that to be unnecessary. You can put it in an ice bath if you want or just let it cool for a few minutes.  The skins should essentially slide off then use your fingers to break through the flesh of the tomato and scoop out the seedspulp.  You can also use a food mill to do this if you dont want to do it by hand.I know a lot of people that skip the blanching and just dice the tomatoes skin pulp and all but the skins get kind of stringy and the seeds can add some bitterness.I personally also prefer to use mostly a paste style of tomato with a few larger slicing tomatoes thrown in.  The slicing tomatoes I grow are generally really sweet and I like the additional flavor they add.One thing to keep in mind if youve made your arrabiata sauce from scratch before but used storebought canned tomatoes they generally add seasoning to the tomatoes they put in the can even if its not much more than salt and some sort of acid for preservation so youll want to adjust your recipe a bit to account for not using the canned tomatoes.,Cooking,d72ng1l,2,t5_2qh7f

For each cup liquid work two teaspoons of white wheat flour into a tablespoon of  butter beurre using your hands manie get it? Thoroughly mashing it together takes the place of cooking  as in a roux  to  remove the pasty  floury character. Add the mixture to the pan stir constantly bring to a boil.  Optionally toss in some chopped flat leaf parsley for a dash of bright freshness. ,Cooking,d8f5g61,3,t5_2qh7f

Remove chicken but dont strain or skim off the fat. Shred chicken into large chunks. Remove all bones skin fat tendons cartilage. Season the stock to taste. Sift two cups of self rising flour into a large bowl. Add a few grinds of good black pepper. Using a fork slowly mix in two cups of buttermilk. Maybe more or add a few spoons of stock to make a wet sticky dough. I needed about one and two thirds cups chef Brock used maybe two and a quarter. This is why I really suggest the video. Dont over work the dough! Heat the stock over medium high heat to get a nice boil. Use a spoon to scoop up large dollops of the dough and gently drop into the large boil points of the stock. Quickly rinse spoon in stock inbetween dropping in dumplings. Cover and simmer for ten to fifteen minutes. Use a spoon to carefully push aside the dumplings to lower in the chicken. Try not to disturb the dumplings as much as possible. They are very fragile! Ladle a dumpling or two into a bowl and dig towards the bottom to get at the chicken.

Almost my entire kitchen is thrifted or gifted and Its all high quality stuff that I loooooove dearly.Around here you cant swing a cat in a second hand store without knocking over a stack of sheet pans colanders and Pyrex. Same goes for basic utensils like spatulas and whisks. My feeling is that a wooden spoon is a wooden spoon be it from Williams Sonoma or the dollar store. I would try to make sure that the can opener you purchase is sturdy as hell. Get yourself a vegetable peeler too. They are very handy.I wouldnt buy a full stovetop set. Since you are just starting out I would recommend you take your time assembling your kitchen wares. That way you flesh out how you like to cook and can add pieces as you find the need for them. Just make sure whatever you buy has a thicksturdy bottom.  As for knivesthose more than anything else in a kitchen have to fit the owner. You have to handle a knife to know if its right for you. I would seek those out locally and I wouldnt put a ton of money into one starting out. Buy yourself a lodge cast iron! My Memaw gave me one when I first moved out on my own and it is my workhorse. I use it so much it lives on my stovetop. I love it. I tell people all the time if you dont love your cast iron skillet youre doing something wrong. Another good resource for quality cookware is a restaurant supply store. A real onenot the place in the shopping mall pretending to be one. If you can get access to one of these you will be in luck. The stuff is no frills but it is high performance.If I were you Id buy a cast iron skillet and then Id starting hunting for a good sauce pan maybe qt. Get yourself some Pyrex they sell smaller casserole dishes with lids that can double as leftover containers a colander couple wooden spoons a silicone spatula as well as a slotted spatula a whisk a good size mixing bowl a sturdy can opener and go from there. Also dont be surprised if people you know start giving you all sorts of kitchen doodads. In my experience when someone moves out for the first time all the folks around him take that opportunity to purge their own kitchens. Oh! And get yourself a digital food thermometer and learn your temps!!! That was one of the best purchases I ever made.Hope this helps! Happy cooking!,Cooking,dayfwfb,3,t5_2qh7f

Poor people who use whatever they have on hand. Truffle oil is relatively inexpensive especially compared to real truffles and when used well does make some pretty awesome food. And with extremely sparing use a bottle lasts a long time so long as you prevent it from going rancid. If people are exposed to it they will develop a taste for it.Saying that an entire ingredient or really class of ingredients is garbage when millions of people like it is ignorant to how cuisine does and will develop. Just beause one or two personalities dont like something right now doesnt mean that millions of others are wrong and in  years those  or  peoples opinion on the ingredient will mean exactly nothing compared to the people who still like and use the ingredient for dishes that theyve had since a small child.Basically being smug and saying something is garbage and has no place when millions of other people use it daily is acting foolish.

Id avoid buying a set because then you only have that type of potpan for all your cooking.  You might want a Dutch oven a nonstick frying pan a SS pan and so on.    The discount chains TJ Maxx and Maarshalls often have top end pots  pans at seriously discounted prices.  You can probably piece together what you need that way. Lodge Dutch ovens are relatively cheap as are their cast iron  pans.   Carbon steel pans are terrific.  Heres an  Vollrath for .  Ikeas nonstick pans are decent.  Ive been using one the heavy aluminum type they probably have el cheapo pans too that probably suck for several years alongside my SS AllClad pans.

10816706,0,t1_ddvmydm,. Sure if you cook it at a high direct heat it will be done faster than via air heat conduction. Perhaps if thats the point you were trying to make so could have said something like I can roast drumsticks in  minutes pan frying them should be much faster rather than bringing up the irrelevant whole chicken.B. Not if you cook it on low not what I think of when Im panfrying but its what the post you replied to suggested.. Thats a strong period. First of all its not obvious to me that the collagen in drumsticks is negligible and time definitely plays a role in breaking down connective tissue such as the cartilage in drumsticks. Do you have a source for that? I tried a quick google search but couldnt come up with anything relevant. Secondly even if final temperature were all that mattered how that heat is applied matters a lot. Sous vide steaming poaching roasting frying braising etc. all produce different results even when the core reaches the same temperature. Partly this is due to dry vs moist heat but partly due to differences in evenness of cooking. If it only mattered how hot the center got the best way to cook would be in a kiln since its the fastest way to get a lump of charcoal with a bit of perfectly cooked chicken at the center.. Did you really just tell me that you are right on a matter of preference and that the supporting evidence of your correctness is that many people agree with me and therefore my opinion is plebian and uninformed?

10867429,0,t3_5v83r4,Im super lax about my cast iron. Basically if there is no water or burnt on bits left in the pan after cooking I dont bother cleaning it. That is if there is just some grease left in the pan Ill let it sit until the next time I use it usually within a day. When I do clean it I give it a gentle scrub with a soapy sponge and wipe it down with a paper towel. Easy. As for easy pans to use I got this one on sale and I wish I bought more. In fact I will gladly buy a new one if this one wears out. It has a surprisingly heavy bottom which provides great even heating. The nonstick coating is one of the best Ive ever used and its durable. The nonstick also makes it super easy to clean. The main downside to nonstick is that they can be damaged by metal utensils and rough handling. If you want something easier to care for try stainless steel. Stainless steel will take just about any abuse you can throw at it. High heat metal utensils high acids long term moisture it can handle them all. Good stainless steel however can cost a little more than other pans.,Cooking,de0wcda,2,t5_2qh7f

The recipe is basically just a pan seared steak with a pan sauce that has a lot of pepper and cream.

You really have to watch your moisture content I live near delallos and their ricotta is extremely dense and dry which is essential for lasagna manicotti and ravioli.As others have said cheese kraft green can cheese NEVER melts into any pasta dish Delallos makes a superb quality pre shredded cheese that melts no problem. Kroger has changed their block cheese formula its tougher to melt now without separating the proteins. It used to be very easy and my go to for mac and cheese. Paper towels and toilet paper. My SO came from a house that used sams club toilet paper and paper towels. I buy bounty every time and whatever name brand TP they have at sams club. Whenever we used sams towels for a while I used twice as much because they dont hold up but bounty does. Another one is sparkling water there is NOTHING out there that compares to La Croix the generic kroger brand has sodium and tastes fake. Its a shame though because La Croix is expensive. Although I think its coming down in price. If you you can get bronze plate pasta instead of teflon extruded its a night and day difference. Barilla and the generic brand are essentially the same. De Cecco has a noticeable difference in dough formula which is worth the uptick in price sometimes especially with lasagna. Any time I go to the Italian grocery store I stock up on bronze extruded pasta because its on a completely different level than the stuff in the regular store different consistency and the bronze plate holds onto sauce so much better than teflon extruded.  ,Cooking,dgeup3v,3,t5_2qh7f

11652046,0,t1_dggqbox,Here in pumpkin country I dont know of any varieties that arent edible. Field and pie pumpkins are certainly harvested for food processing but its WHEN theyre harvested that matters. Usually a farm only saves a small corner for older larger fancy sorts the Halloween specials but the rest of the field is cut when theyre smaller and sent to processing earlier. Rather like the new younger squash courgettes versus the one giant monster you grew all summer that gets old and woody.
