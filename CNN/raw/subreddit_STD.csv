Do you know that somewhere between  and  percent of people are infected? Most of them never show symptoms and dont know they have it but they still spread it. What Im trying to say is that the girls you dont sleep with are highly likely to get infected from someone else anyway unless they will only have sex with another virgin for the rest of their lives. Also having sex automatically comes with the risk of getting infected exactly because of infections like HPV HSV or MCV because people can be infected not know and spread it even if they use condoms. Theres no such thing as safe sex just safer sex. Practice it safely when the time comes get regular STD screenings maintain your personal hygiene I also advise not to remove your pubic hair but thats up to you.

483832,0,t3_1zlgke,Oh no. This sounds awful. Im so sorry to hear you are going through this. Unfortunately a lot of STDs and STIs have a latency period. This applies to chlamydia to herpes to HIV etc. This is what makes it so incredibly hard for sexually active people to track down when they acquired the STD and who could have given it to them. It can take up to  months for initial symptoms to appear if they ever appear at all. Some people are carriers and are completely asymptomatic. Have you seen an OBGYN in addition to your PCP? I would recommend going to an expert source like a GYN for specific advice. For more information regarding STDs visit the Learning Center for uptodate info on all things sex related.

The highest accuracy of a blood test is twelve weaks after possible exposure but I guess a swab from the bump could be even more accurate. Is there any way for you to find out your partners STI status? I know statistics can be a bitch and I dont completely understand what the CDC means by direct contact with a sore but isnt there very little chance you would get it if you use protection? There are many things that can cause a red bump. Also I hate taking antibiotics even when a doctor prescribes them let alone if I might not need them at all.

You can absolutely have dormant herpes but that should not affect testing.gtCould he have given it to me from his experience with his other partner  months ago and I just end up developing symptoms now?Yes. gtCould he have had this virus for a long time and just never realized it and then passed it on to me while still testing negative?Yes and...unlikely. gthis doctor told him that this result means that he has never been exposed to the virus and that I must have got it from being unfaithful to him with another partner.This just feels like a BIG SHINY RED FLAG.

3782291,0,t1_cqnb7ig,False positives are always possible but it has nothing to do with having it done this early. The test doesnt care about how recently you think you may have contracted HIV. It is either reactive or not reactive and if the test is reactive they will do another more specific but more expensive and slower test to determine whether you are actually positive.False positives are rare so I wouldnt let it hold you back from getting the test as the false positive will be a possibility when you take the test later as well. The more often you take HIV tests the more likely you are to end up with one false positive but that is quickly remedied with more tests. While false positives are rare HIV is so rare in some populations that you are more likely to get a false positive than an actual positive. Dont let any of this hold you back though they will ultimately find out if you are positive or negative. Positive results arent considered accurate without more tests. will have up to date information and  discusses some medicines though I dont think it is that useful at this point. I think it is most important to just know that people with HIV are living healthy strong long lives these days. That is the norm not the exception.Lastly not to get your hopes up because any one sex act can lead to infection with HIV but the odds are low  Barely one in  acts for the highest risk sexual activity will cause someone to contract HIV if the other partner is known HIV positive. This does vary a bit depending on how recently the other person has been infected probably a higher viral load if very recent if the other person is taking medicine for it and so on. If you dont even know if the other person is positive and just going on a hunch the odds are much lower. I dont know enough about your situation but it is possible you are just getting yourself worked up for no good reason or focusing on this possibility of having HIV as a way to cope with a decision you regret or something that happened to you outside of your control.

4630502,0,t1_cte5hvr,Im sorry I cant be of much more help I cant really say either way and a picture dont always help unless obvious clusters of blisters are sees. Im afraid that you will have to wait for the results. If it indeed is HSV its likely to be mild and apparently in most cases is unlikely to ever show up again.Now for something you likely dont want to hear about testing but might be good to know. Swabs have a rather high false negative rate especially if you dont get it swabbed within  days of any blisters forming. Additionally the immune system needs time to build antibodies to be able to accurately be able to measure in a blood test.  months seems to be the recommended time to wait to get the best accuracy.Also herpes especially HSV is so common that once youre mid to late s in USA at least which actually have less HSV than most countries at least half of your peers have the virus but only  of those know it because the rest never got enough symptoms to realise they do.So even if you go and test in  months time you dont know if its an existing infection or a new one. You could test now and test later as if it is a new infection the test now probably will be negative and the test in  months will be positive.I hope you found this useful and not too scary.

6994620,0,t3_4bhhqf,While there is no cure for HSV oral herpes or HSV genital herpes there are many suppressive  treatments available. I recently found out I have genital herpes. After an initial outbreak of what I suspected and did some personal research to find out if it was herpes I went to the doctor and even he said it might be herpes. Gave me a suppressive medication to deal with it. Surprisingly my tests came back negative a week later but today I had another outbreak Initial one was about a month ago. Therefore I can conclude it was a false negative and I do actually have HSV. Im not sure who I got it from but I recently have been with a girl for the last  months and had no prior outbreaks before. Although the virus can lay dormant for weeks months years before an outbreak occurs so I have no idea who I got it from.Some pointersClose to  of people carry the HSV virus but may never show symptoms and if they do little at all. Some people have more outbreaks.Hovering around  of people carry the HSV virus likewise may or may not have symptoms.If you have it its cake. Get checked. Tell your significant other of the situation. Hopefully they will be understanding. My girlfriend was and we have only been together for  months. She told me not to worry and its not a big deal even if she gets it. Talk about awesome.The only downside to having HSV is the social stigma that society places on it. Its nothing to be ashamed of or worried about. It is no different than oral herpes other than the location of the outbreak and that you cant.... or should I say SHOULDNT engage in any vaginal oral or anal sex when an outbreak occurs. Bummer.

8599040,0,t3_4xlob8,. Your first question. If you have never had sex can you acquire an std. Yes even though some diseases are classified as stds they can be transmitted in other ways. For instance a pregnant woman having a herpes outbreak while giving birth can transmit it to her baby. Cold sores which are a form of herpes is common and can be transmitted through close contact. Herpes can also lie dormant in one partner and expressed in the next. HIV can be transmitted from mother to child in the womb. . You will not get an std from a sexual partner without stds. However they may have an std such as HPV or genital warts which is not always easy to spot. Chlamydia and Gonorrhea are hard to spot too.STDs are a fascinating subject.

Without too much unnecessary detail it wasnt full intercourse the entire time but oral hand play and vaginal for  hours. After the th day or so I noticed what I thought was a zit and popped it. Since then  more soresrash? spots have popped up. They are all similar red area with what looks like a holebug bit in the center They didnt bother me much but had sharp pain if I touch them. I attempted putting hydrocortisone and rubbing alcohol on them last night OUCH The original sore swole up from this but the  others are beginning to go away. However they are VERY itchy now that the alcohol dried them. Im naturally paranoid. . Herpes typically shows up within  weeks. Its been  since sex with the other girl. . Fiance has no symptoms. .

11393615,0,t3_62l583,Hello there! You asked how quickly you can do a test for STDs. Here you can see which STDs can be closed out after which period of time   Also your chest rash is answered.  As far as your symptoms go there are no clinical symptoms associated with HIV. This means that no consistent physical symptoms have been observed among people with HIV. With that being said some infected individuals do experience a strong flulike illness  weeks post exposure and this last for about  days. However some infected individuals experience no symptoms at all. The rash you are experiencing could be due to something completely unrelated to HIV. If you would experience any rash due to HIV it is likely to occur in the later stages of infection when you go from being HIV positive to being diagnosed with AIDS theres a distinction between the two.

11744210,0,t1_dgr8e7h,They said they dont think its a yeast infection and it may just be irritated skin from a heat rash. Im not entirely sure why either. Im getting frustrated because I feel like theres no cure and like Im constantly dismissed at the doctors office. I also have random bumps on my backside that appear to also be from heat rash but again Im not sure since the docs seem to think its nothing. ,STD,dgr8i8k,1,t5_2s4ni
