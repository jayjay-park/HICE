5331536,0,t3_3o01w6,I was actually just writing a journal entry about this. Ive been paying for but avoiding going back to Crossfit for about a month now. Couldnt figure out why I didnt want to go mentally. So I just wrote about the last time I was regularly going and why it was awesome and why I keep chasing it. Figured out that my brain keeps telling me that I should go to lose weight but the reason I keep trying to go back is that I loved feeling powerful in my own body. So today was my first day back and I think Im going to keep using that as a mantra. Today I go to the gym because I want to be powerful. ,xxfitnessmotivation,cvt5wdh,4,t5_39ztd
