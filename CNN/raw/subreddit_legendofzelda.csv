10544599,0,t1_dd1c9yx,thoroughly agree with all those points!I like that they started revisiting their more mature audience. LBW had a nice middle ground thoughIf you can find the money to do so Id really recommend MM D. Its an extremely enjoyable remake also Hyrule Warriors is one of my favourite games and for a noncanon Zelda game it has a great story!!,legendofzelda,dd3cj8o,2,t5_2rp53

11029063,0,t1_dei3ba9,The DS stylus controls arent fine tuned which is okay since it was their first stab at it. This was fixed by Spirit Tracks which I believe is a much better game.My main problem is the Temple of the Ocean King that required constant revisit. Hated that place.That said Linebeck crushes it in PH.,legendofzelda,dei4axh,6,t5_2rp53
