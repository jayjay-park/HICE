In your reddit user settings you can set it to just not show NSFW posts at all.  Our trigger warnings are set as NSFW behind the scenes so this will remove them from your page.You can also use Reddit Enhancement Suite to filter out posts with certain words.

1401262,0,t1_cirqua7,gtThe only problem is I believe most everyone here in OOC just accepts NS stories for what they are and arent likely to be worried for OPs safety. Comforting us is like nursing a healthy person with warm soup and tea while the real sufferers are standing out in the cold sneezing and catching pneumonia. If you really want to let people know youre alright youre best bet is to contact those people directly and the only way to do that is via PM.A lot of people concerned check the persons post history for updates so they would see if they posted in OOC. They then usually bitch about the author ruining it and lying but fuck em for that.

1835212,0,t3_2flaby,Greetings dear sir if this butler may he would like to answer dear sirs query with an oftrepeated quote from our resident rnosleepooc writers Bangbus isnt real. Now what would that have to do with rnosleep? To address dear sirs questions Is this subreddit some kind of creative place where people make up stories rules say only non fiction but is that a joke?Short answer Yes.Long answerThe rules say that Both nonfiction and realistic fiction are allowed. From our FAQ gt Q Are the stories here true?gt A Probably not  but while youre in rNoSleep everything is true. Outside of NoSleep a story may be fact or may be fiction. The important thing is that while youre here treat everything as though it is a true recount of events.Probably not means that some stories may be based on events in the writers lives mostly past events but more often than not they are simply the products of the wonderful imaginings of our writers.  Should I report this to the police?Short answer No. Long answer No. This might even get the writer in trouble. Think about it if someone were really in danger they probably would not post to rnosleep. If you really are curious though you may message the author.To conclude this butler would like to end with another quote from another user uTarak Its kinda like an RPG.

Do you think every letter Stephen King receives is a glowing review? No. When you put yourself out there there will always be people dangling their bare asses out over the railing waiting to shit on you. The lesson is objectivity. Learn to take the real criticisms in stride and build from them while understanding whats just someone being a douchebag and ignoring what they have to say.

7682168,0,t3_4kiv8p,You can and probably should read the writingspecific books that others have suggested but the best way to get better is to read and write. Just start doing it. Write some stories that you throw away. Post over at rshortscarystories. Post in nosleep. Dont worry about downvotes and you can even make a fake name to post under for a while so you dont tarnish your real username with bad stories. But definitely write them.Also read both good and bad horror. Dont stop reading a book because it blows. Finish it. Pick out what you didnt like. Tell yourself youll never make that mistake. Do the same with the good stuff too. Find the parts that really got you. It can be twists storytelling verbiage. Dont make yourself like flowery prose if you dont like it. Dont let other people tell you its unnecessary if you do like it. Replicate what you like from what youve read and then add your own style to it.When youre finally ready to post you will never convince everyone that what you wrote is good. Some will hate it. Most will think its fine. But dont forget youre writing for you and the handful of people who have exactly the same love of horror that you do.,NoSleepOOC,d3fez50,6,t5_2vy7p

7851274,0,t3_4munvf,. What timezonecountry are you in? Central standard time USA. . What times do you reasonably think youll be be available to mod nosleep and how much time can you dedicate to it?amam Im constantly in the IRC for nosleepooc and browsing nosleep. I would have no problem scheduling blocks for moderation. I am unemployed.. Do you mod any other subreddits or forums on the internet? If so which ones and for how long have you modded them?not in years they no longer exist.. Do you have any experience with coding CSS andor automoderator configuration?no. but im willing to learn.. Should mods let the upvotes decide?No . Do you read rnosleep regularly?Yes. A post is on the front page and violates a rule what do you do?remove it. . A user who is a respected and regular writer on the subreddit has become hostile with another user who does not have a comment history in nosleep. How do you respond?remove comments that break the suspension of disbelief. Remove comments that break the rules regarding etiquette. Let the offenders know why their comments were removed. If harassment continues ban the offending user.. What kinds of things make you irrationally angry?favoritism and hypocrisy. How do you feel about authors posting their social media links at the end of stories? I think its fine and unobtrusive as a hyperlink. I like the way usleepyhollow does it  it seems really elegant.. The narrator dies in the nosleep story and continues it from beyond the grave. Do you remove the post? Yes. What is torture porn and does it belong in nosleep?it doesnt belong on nosleep. Torture porn is the graphic depiction of torture to the detriment of other elements in a story. If torture is the only thing making a post scary its torture porn.. A user is mad about a story removal and personally attacks you in modmail. What do you do?remain polite and stay true to the decision.. What are the essential elements of a story?characters setting plot climax conclusion. Why do we have the Everything is true here even if its not rule and what does it mean?we have that rule because it helps to immerse the reader in the story and prevents a dozen comments asking for proof which burdens the author. It makes the discussion more about the story itself and less about is this real?. Is a story about Slenderman appropriate for nosleep? No. . A users submission is  words. NoSleeps minimal word count currently stands at . Do you remove the post? Yes.. What does believable within reason mean for rnosleeps purposes? if someone looks out their front door and the story is supposed to affect the world outside thats expecting an unreasonable amount of belief on the readers part. . A popular post gets to the front page. Its obviously fiction but it abides by all the rules. A new post is submitted by a different user that is very similar to the front page popular post but the user insists its a true story. What do you do? it honestly depends on the type of story the first post was and the ways in which they are similar. The second user saying their post is a true story is irrelevant. Closer attention would need to be paid to the details. If they are just piggybacking in original content or plagiarizing it could be easy to tell. . A popular and regular writer on nosleep has released a book and wants to promote it to his fans. What do you advise him to do?advertise it to Facebook fans or author subreddit. Post in the ooc in the appropriate threads and utilize the information in the sidebar If you are advertising something whether its yours or not you may post about it only once a week. You should participate in the community more often than you post your own promotional stuff and follow reddits sitewide spam guidelines.. Is nosleep real? No. What does realistic fiction mean?fiction that could be real and without specific details there would be no way to prove otherwise . Do you love horror? If so what is your favorite type?I do love horror. My favorite type psychological though Im poor at writing it myself.. How many times do you think a user should be allowed to have posts andor comments removed before they are banned from the subreddit? Would you give them a warning before banning them?I would allow an author to have all of their stories from nosleep removed before banning them. Comments are another story. I think that repeat offenders would get three chances with me with adequate warnings between each infraction. I would absolutely warn them twice at least before resorting to a ban. . A story is removed for being nonhorror by another moderator. The author sends a modmail asking why their story was removed which prompts you to read the story and discover that you do not agree with the removal reason. What do you do?consult with more experienced moderators and decide whats to be done as a team. I am more inclined to ask the author to tweak their story and post to rnosleepworkshops for ideas on how to make it undeniably horror.. What are some challenges you think nosleep faces as a default sub with gt million subscribers and hundreds of posts each day?backlog unmoderated posts angry submitters whose stories were removed comments that defy suspension of disbelief removing good stories that break the rules people who think that nosleep is real and call the authorities . Why do you feel youd be a good fit for nosleep? I am passionate about this community and I do my best to remain objective on a day to day basis. I want to give back because without nosleep Id be a shell of the person I have grown into these past  months. Nosleep has helped me tremendously and I think its only fair that I put myself forward. I owe rnosleep. I think I could do a decent job at it and I have the time to commit to it. Not only that but I feel like I could be useful in the IRC as well.,NoSleepOOC,d3yjxbr,1,t5_2vy7p

8366092,0,t3_4tpcws,I lived in very very rural Montana for about  years with my ex wife.   I have a few real life stories that mimic Horrorish criteria I think.One the hutterite people they have a documentary even from the town I was in that was on NatGeo.  The people in the doc are actors as all the Hoots looked identical due to the single branch family tree Inbreeding very heavily.  They would send women into bars after they had already had a few kids to sleep with random men in town the one condition though was the husband had to watch.  It was spooky not that I ever participated.  Its not that they all looked alike either they looked odd narrow faces thin eyes bulging brow lines.  They were nice but it they were always kinda spooky.Then there were always falling satellites or UFOs.  It was small town minimal light pollution and I lived about  miles out of town.  Many times youd see falling stars or satellites.  Sometimes though these falling lights would hit a point then dart into the complete opposite direction.   One time I was sitting on my front porch with my ex wife letting our dog run the yard and straight east we seen a blue light then what looked like a beam of light from underneath it.  Now could this have been a UFO? Sure but there was also an Air Force base  miles north of the town I was in and they were always in and out transporting who knows what.  So it could have been a helicopter doing search and rescue training or some other kind of training but it sat there for about  minutes before the beam of light faded and the main source of light shot straight up and vanished.  Also the night before my grandmother died when I was about  I was playing on my Gameboy Color under the sheets.  The batter died and when I pulled the blanket down and looked a solid black figure stood directly next to me.  It was hard to explain more like a solid silhouette than a figure with an seeping oil look.  I didnt get spooked but I had a light on my room so it wasnt dark and my eyes werent playing tricks on me.  I hadnt fallen asleep at that point and Ive never suffered from sleep paralysis.  Ten years later I was talking to my mom about random things and she tells me after my grandmother died I took a hammer from my dads garage and slept with it for years at night cradling it like a baby.  I do not remember sleeping with a hammer ever.,NoSleepOOC,d5nb9wi,3,t5_2vy7p

8480501,0,t3_4vumoz,I fucking love me some monsters. Theres nothing more fun than picturing a horrifying atypical mutated creature that shouldnt exist but does hiding in the dark coming to slaughter you. D Personally I dont want a monster to smile at me or have an ominous laugh. The less human traits it has the better. Im not particularly into vampires. I want my monsters to have a mind like a diamond and fingernails that shine like justice talons and horrifying rows of razor sharp teeth random animal or alien characteristics and weird limbs that dont make any sense. Im unfortunately drawing a complete blank on monsters I love in media but I sort of have a monster anecdote  Several years ago I was staying the night at a friends house. We were smoking weed on her roof looking down at the street when we saw this...thing...crawling around between all the parked cars. I say crawling but it was alarmingly quick. The best description I can give of it is that it looked like a mountain lion head with an emaciated human male torso and arms. And then it simply ended. No hind legs or lower half that we saw. It kept darting around underneath cars before sprinting across the road away from us. We both saw the exact same thing. I would easily chalk it up to us being high as hell and seeing things but when we told her parents her mom swore shed seen it before too. Maybe she was lying but she seemed sincere. I still have no explanation for that one other than maybe it was a fucked up amputee wearing a mask?  Honestly between that and my irrational fear someone will be hiding and slit my Achilles tendon I hate getting into my car at night since Im always convinced somethings under it. .. ,NoSleepOOC,d61lttq,5,t5_2vy7p

9193134,0,t1_d8h8fs6,Well obvious troll is obvious let me explain. As of right now Florida is a swing state in the  election. If there is a swift response by the Obama administration and or moderate to light damage See Hurricane Sandy the President will be praised and the state will more than likely go Clinton. If the damage is severe and or the federal response is lacking Katrina BP oil spill the state will blame the president and go for Trump.The second major factor is that Florida is often referred to as Americas retirement home. Many Americans have grandparents that live down there so if there is a shit response its going to be personal for many more people all across the country. Not only that but you also have alot of landmarks down there. A picture of a dead body floating by Disney World could be used as a political exclamation point. Keeping the retirement home thing in mind you also have to consider what a category  or  will do to Floridas infrastructure. If cell phone towers are damaged theres a good chance many Americans will lose contact with their relatives and turn to the newsthe internet for information. If there is an October Surprise A piece of information about a candidate released just before an election it will be seen by every American who has their eyes glued to the newsFacebookReddit increasing its effectiveness with every dropped call. To put it simply this storm has the power to sway the upcoming election and considering this one is between a staunch isolationist who wants to renegotiate Americas trade deals and a Globalist who wants to bring the country deeper into the international fold yes people outside the US should very much care about what happens with this storm. ,NoSleepOOC,d8hapwe,9,t5_2vy7p

10348164,0,t3_5o6pqi,ampnbsp should usually be followed by a semicolon and you should not be supposed to be able to see it. nbsp It stands for nonbreaking space. In other words a special white space character that forces the two words or characters at either side of it to remain together on the same line if the words appear at the end of a line of text.So imagine you have text restricted to a  square. You write  am but am falls on the next line because it doesnt fit.  and am really shouldnt be separated like this. The solution is to add a nonbreaking space between  and am.  and am will now both spill over to the next line remaining together to make  am.People also use them on NoSleep to force larger spaces between paragraphs. You have a paragraph add the nonbreaking space insert another paragraph and then theres a line between two paragraphs to make it look more spaced out.,NoSleepOOC,dch0vpa,5,t5_2vy7p

Plus theres ranch for dipping.We were both in the very short line to get stuff signed by Max Brooks. I told him he was one of my favorite authors and thought World War Z was the work I was pushing myself toward. Its so amazingly worldspanning. The multiple vignettes make each story stay fresh and give a real feeling of immersion. Plus the mix of satire and real scifihorror is wonderful.Anyway he asked what I had written and I said Ah just some stuff on the internet. Nosleep stuff. I totally expected him not to know.Then I had his baby.Edit Actually imagine a less crunchy onion ring with a milder flavor and less heartburn if you eat too many.

11237800,0,t3_608oq8,I love weird cult stories like ones that are revolved around really weird religious things. Those and ones involving space or time travel or those kinda things as theyre things in which anything could happen! ,NoSleepOOC,df5sehx,3,t5_2vy7p

11249089,0,t1_df6sbbv,I wouldnt worry about that. Most of us are writers who try to preserve what we feel is important to the sub. One of those things is the casual feel many stories have,NoSleepOOC,df72g65,1,t5_2vy7p

11313148,0,t3_61gdud,This is a good post.I dont think Im a very good writer but I have to admit I am better than I was  years ago. What ended up getting me to develop personally was camp C. Specifically In order to gain motivation do anything other than writing. Gain experiences to write about. Go out and adventure try new things. Watch movies read books socialize work hike etc. Whatever it is. That triggers the motivation. When motivation comes then write. Thats when my discipline comes in which is for me just forcing myself. I pretend I have NOTHING else to do but write. Writing becomes God. Theres no timeline but I just worship this thing until its satisfied. And Compare the garbage that is my writing against my own expectations which come from step . Is it as good as what Ive seen? Did I do the thing Im writing about justice? If not work work work and write write write that thing until it is even if it means Im eventually on the floor weeping and doubting my entire existence and feeling like I can literally do no more and then do MORE. Do more until I feel like giving up then keep going. This method has perhaps made me crazy but without a doubt a final draft takes form in the end. All of that can be bypassed with alcohol. But then the outcome of the writing becomes more of a roll of the dice which more often than not is going to result in a waste of time. ,NoSleepOOC,dfebsvb,6,t5_2vy7p

11336465,0,t3_61a5gj,Maybe but it also promotes an irritating amount of homogeny and a descent into formula.To use your childhood game as an example if you took a hundred groups of kids and placed them all in the same situation most of them would think up the same game with the same rules bacause thats all thats left to them.There may be a small percentage of people that bust out and create some truly fantastic work within those confines but most of them would simply follow the route of least resistance.Library of Shadows has far fewer restrictions yet manages to maintain a decent level of quality.Dropping the requirements for first person and believability would go a long way to opening things up.It may mean a few more stories of lower quality get through but Id rather read an interesting disaster than a bland paintbythenumbersaffair with one of the same  endings that you always get.,NoSleepOOC,dfgyvph,2,t5_2vy7p

11492050,0,t1_dfwgy0k,Yeah like I said I dont mind comedic elements to stories. I read a story a while back I believe titled something along the lines of Dont Follow Them Home. They May Not Come Back and that story had plenty of times the writer made me laugh but because of the overall writing style. It was not a comedy horror story. ,NoSleepOOC,dfymfg1,10,t5_2vy7p

11807222,0,t3_68eqmd,It was a Japanese vampire movie called Lake of Dracula I watched it with my mom when I was . She thought I was old enough and wouldnt be scared since I already loved reading horror stories. But I was scared to death.What scared me the most were the women vampires wearing white robes. First you see them from behind then they turned towards you showing their pale faces and fangs. One scary scene is of the little girl going into the old house looking for her dog and seeing a woman at the pianoAnother scene that I still vividly remember is a woman in the hospital being pushed towards the morgue cuz they thought she was dead. She suddenly opened her eyes and grabbed the nurses hand.That movie really fucked me up. I had a hard time sleeping at night for a very long time. ,NoSleepOOC,dgye13p,2,t5_2vy7p
