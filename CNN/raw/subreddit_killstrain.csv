6674511,0,t1_d09nadc,Thanks! I played some matches and unlocked a character. I came pretty close to killing the mutant base but the match ended. It seems much easier to kill a human base rather than the mutant base. If you rush the human base use a mech you can kill the enemy base in  or  gos if you get lucky. After you pass all the turrets the only thing that can shoot you is the  base gun and it doesnt do nearly enough. Also what about a regenerating shield for the human base? Any new maps coming out for this beta?Just some thoughts! ,killstrain,d09paiw,2,t5_31fz1
