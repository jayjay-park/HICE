8128109,0,t3_4qj580,i see this ... and given recent events orlando shooting i honestly think this is just a case of some dude trying to take advantage of the current shock.. trying to ride what ever waves are left from the orlando shooting to gain something. its honestly pretty shallow if that is what he is doing... he kinda deserves to get into A LOT of trouble.. or at least be shamed for this badlyBack when i was in High School some dude tried something like this. he had been battling cancer for about a year now now before you raise your pitchforks hear my out.. i get it Cancer sucks its still a touchy subject for most people.. hell i even lost my uncle after his rd battle with cancer over a  year period... ANYWHO this kid beats AWESOME and the whole school loves him and shows support.. but i believe i was the one of very few who say this dude ride this sympathy wave for WAY too long. my high school is big when it comes to cancer awareness Pink shirts football team gets pink gear for games ALL THAT STUFF again not bad really awesome cause they raise A LOT of money from it so they honor him cool alright.. standing ovation and all that this kid was the talk of the town for about a week. but what really kinda set it off was how he again tried to ride off of it. they made him an assistant coach for the football team the school has like male pageants really its about students picking out which dude peaks in HS. during that pageant this fuckin guy pulled the cancer survival card ANY TIME HE COULD! and my god it was so annoying.. but ofcourse my peers ate it up and he ended up winning.. again not saying cancer survivors are bad people but that someone who tries to feed off of a touchy subject to feed their ego or to gain something.. is shallow AF hell i tore my Achilles Tendon my senior year was a starter for the basketball team and ran varsity track.. did i ask for a parade.. HELL NO cause im not shallow...moral of my story.. both of these dudes cancer survivor from HS and Calum McSwiggan just tryin to make some sort of gain from a touchy subject due to the times they are in,ETCshow,d4to8gf,3,t5_2ycy4
