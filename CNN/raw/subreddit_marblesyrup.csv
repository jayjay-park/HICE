7800803,0,t3_4m38p2,Nekopara has relatively high production values compared to say ReMaid but... The Sakura games?  Really?  Dont get me wrong I like Winged Cloud but there isnt much to the choices or the writing in those games nor are they particularly long with the exception of the upcoming Dungeon.  The art looks good though.  Nekopara is also linear both Crusoe and ReMaid have branching stories which I prefer unless Im reading something where the writing is as good as say World End Economica.To each his own but I felt the need to say something.,marblesyrup,d3svd9z,2,t5_3bvy2
