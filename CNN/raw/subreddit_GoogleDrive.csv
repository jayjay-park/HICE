4899058,0,t1_cuc1tf5,gt If you put a PDF in the Google Drive folder its still stored locally as well right?I assume this to mean the local Google Drive folder in your computer. In this case yes it will remain stored in your computer as long as its not deleted locally or remotely.,GoogleDrive,cuc2co2,1,t5_2tvn8
6137077,0,t3_3opvtw,Yea same problem even with the wifi toggle.  My device was low on storage and when I cleared some space up it started to actually upload.  Even though it made it to the drive Im now getting an unable to process.  I work in tech and can say that a lot of companies are pushing new code every  weeks which can cause things to unexpectedly break.  Wouldnt be surprised if thats whats up as Ive never experienced this issue before.  Will post if I find a solution,GoogleDrive,cyn7ywz,1,t5_2tvn8
7132594,0,t3_4b0hf0,The emails that you deleted from you inbox and spam folder are just sitting in your trash folder. I went through this process a few months ago myself. Once you permanently delete everything from the trash folder you should be fine.,GoogleDrive,d1owaf1,1,t5_2tvn8
9867247,0,t3_5gnus3,I bet netskope or bettercloud can help if you have budget for a paid service. I know that Gdrives permissions are hell and they are actively working on fixing. The scripts in this thread look interesting Id use at your own peril tho. ,GoogleDrive,datq42i,1,t5_2tvn8
10285135,0,t1_dc9vco3,What are you about? Im actually asking about HOW to do it?Theres more than  files in that trash I cant figure out which ones are relevant and which ones arent... Even if I take only  seconds per file to check if its relevant or not and I would need muuuuch more than that it would take me more than  weeks full time to go through all of them...Surely theres a better way....,GoogleDrive,dc9vklv,1,t5_2tvn8
11191600,0,t3_5zs1ni,I get this message too. I seems my account can not log in into drive. The name is strange because i can not find any information about it.,GoogleDrive,df0jz7e,1,t5_2tvn8
