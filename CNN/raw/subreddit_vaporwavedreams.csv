5156284,0,t1_cv7h2z7,Yeah I feel like the only reasons I should press on cassettes as told by rvaporwave. They look better. More people will buy it debatableThis is why I prefer pressing CDs. Its way less expensive. More people own CD players than tape players. Very few companies anymore press cassettes. I dont own tape decks and Im not going to spend  to get some. I have no idea how to dub in the first place. Chances are more people will buyIm not saying I will never press cassettes but atm its not financially attainable.,vaporwavedreams,cv7iw7v,1,t5_39uan
