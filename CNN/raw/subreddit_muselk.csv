4965673,0,t3_3iu6yc,Id like to think that this could be used as a place for people to post suggestions for things like loadouts for The BestWorst Loadouts in TF and Tryhard Tuesday suggestions for the next episode of Highstakes myths for Mythbusters and people to test them locations for Extreme Rancho Relaxo Weapons to decide Is It OP Just TF Things more species for Gaming Geographic even just for fun if its not a series information for Map Tips and Tricks loadout combinations for Insane Strategies such as the infinite regen soldier and the critical combos and also other games to see Is It Pay To Win.  I dont know that all of these series were planned to be continued but I think that this subreddit could be a great place to figure out which ones people would be interested in seeing return.  I also want to thank you for the time and effort that you put into your videos they always bring a smile to my face when I see a new video is out and make me want to play TF!PS I am also very excited for and look forward to seeing some more videos come out on your second channel such as the Fallout  playthrough you had mentioned in your latest stream.,muselk,cukgmo1,3,t5_31p3f
