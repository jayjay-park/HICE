Orange trees have thorns and are prone to Spider Wasp infestations Youre often paid by how much you pick which means youre throwing your hands into the trees as quickly and carelessly as you can.

5470407,0,t1_cwavu7y,Actually thats a whole fascinating history. I used to work at a museum of precision manufacturing. You dont need precise pieces to create precision. For example you can compare two surfaces  say granite surface plates  to find the high spots and flatten them out using honing or something of the like. But then you wind up with two complimentary surfaces not necessarily two flat ones. You may have two bow shaped pieces. But introduce a third piece and youre  golden by rotating between the set you will eventually wind up with  perfectly flat pieces. The history of early machining is full of ingenuity like that.,mechanical_gifs,cwaw9op,80,t5_2wg6i

5996615,0,t1_cy5n9ve,I wouldnt say offbalance is the correct term. In flight dynamics there is the concept of stability.  A positively stable plane think  will return to its original neutral flight position if an outside force acts on it.  A negatively stable plane most modern fighters will deviate from their path more and more even after the outside force quits acting.  This concept can be applied to steady level flight static stability or to an aircrafts flight over time dynamic stability.  Fighters having negative dynamic stability allows them to be more maneuverable because the computer isnt trying to return the plane to its stable flight path.,mechanical_gifs,cy5oqxo,4,t5_2wg6i

7675225,0,t1_d3emdwv,No a regular electric motor is a straightup improved design over the one in the gif.A solenoid engine such as this one is modelled after fuel piston designs most commonly found in cars or propeller planes which is where the circular form comes from the model in the gif is based off. However fuel piston engines have some pretty big downsides. Theres lots of moving parts increasing complexity and potential places where the engine can fail. The linear action of the pistons also causes vibrations which are generally not good for either the engine or the structure its mounted to.A solenoid engine inherits both of these major flaws while not giving anything in return over a regular electric motor. An electric motor has a vastly reduced amount of moving parts and provides its power vibrationfree.The reason solenoid engines arent used is basically because of the saying if it aint broke dont fix it!,mechanical_gifs,d3emlv1,17,t5_2wg6i

8032252,0,t1_d4iv6hs,Im strongly hesitant to go with what youre saying.I was thrown off from the getgo because it isnt a large caliber pistol.  Its a mm.  As pistols go its midrange at best.Plus there are blowback mms out there.  Some delayed blowback.  However its not uncommon and really theres more to timing a gun than just making a stiffer spring thats hard to cock.  Moving mass typically a  slightly heavier slide or delayed blowback which just gives some friction or resistance during initial blowback through various means like levers or rollers.I mean youre not wrong about the differences between short action and blowback but I think you downplay the commonality of blowback in mm and larger guns.  Short action is mostly constrained to derivitives of  Hi Power or Glock with a few minor exceptions like gasoperated guns like Desert Eagles and some HampKs.In fact blowback firearms are more often the easier to manufacture as they require fewer parts typically and are definitely more commonly made among cheap or less capable manufacturers.whether an impoverish country or a manufacturer aiming for a lower budget market  There is also no danger to pressurized gases escaping around the brass if you have a properly tuned design.  Even if there was still pressure in the barrel when the case was extracting it isnt like it presents a magnificent problem all else being equal.  Revolvers do just fine with escaping gas behind the barrel.  Its consistent and predictable.,mechanical_gifs,d4iwfzd,0,t5_2wg6i

9611281,0,t1_d9xrprz,Keep in mind d printing has been around a lot longer You are only considering a recent trend in adoption rates as the technology has evolved from early R and D to early adoption to mainstream usefulness. This was a full  year arc.Replacing computer components is not the same as retooling a factory. We are talking every square inch of that thing has to be custom designed and planned out. A widget machine is often custom built to align the widget just perfectly in a hundred stage process and it has to pass it to the next part of the automation with a high degree of speed and precision. That isnt  screws. I am a software engineer and I work in process automation  not physical  and its not just like run upgrade.exe and expect it all to work. There is design code QA deployment and an assload of steps in between. I have worked on code bases that were more than  years old because the cost of upgrading the existing  functioning money making systems was prohibitively expensive.A last note because Im getting bored is that these systems arent plug and play. They are not designed around a common system specification. A lot of the code is written to run on this specific device in this specific configuration and even in this specific room.

They have a little graphic even describing that it uses less space and transport more people but doesnt say how.I lived in an apartment building that was  floors and it had  regular elevator shaft and a service shaft. Thats not really a lot of space.Ive also worked in a building with  floors and that one had two sets of elevator shafts depending on whether you were going to high floors or low floors. Thats of course more space but shorter travel times.But they dont explain how their solution fixes any of this really. I dont buy that adding more elevators per shaft and then having everyone sit around and wait while one elevator offloads people will speed things up or make them more efficient. There will be fewer people waiting to get into an elevator but it seems like thatll just translate into waiting inside the elevator instead. Id rather wait in the lobby than in the sardine can.Elevator management and scheduling is actually a really interesting topic try it out in Sim Tower! so I hope theres more research into this sort of queuing system to answer the question of whether or not its any better.,mechanical_gifs,dc8sj23,1,t5_2wg6i

10839738,0,t3_5uxuej,Architect here we all dream of including stuff like this in our buildings. But most of us dont because close to  of times motorized systems like this have been tried on the facades of buildings the systems fail after a few years.  Maybe its only  or so but thats enough to be really annoying.  Some will fail closed and never open.  Some will fail open and never close and some will get stuck part way open.Theres not a law of physics demanding this its just that we have an expectation of how much maintenance a building should require and keeping systems like this . functional is several times more than any sane person puts in to maintaining a residential building.On something like a university astronomy observatory or a military installation where a dynamic facade is part of the special function of the structure you could get the resources allocated to maintain such a system.  But in a situation like this where its a normal apartment building the expectations of how much will be spent on maintenance means that the amount spent will be less than what it takes to keep this system running well over the next  or  years.And as others have pointed out here more granular control would be nice.  Theres an opportunity here to form a variable brise soleil  fins arranged so that when the sun is high in the summer less heat is brought into the building reducing air conditioning energy use then when the sun is lower in the sky in the winter more heat is allowed in reducing heating costs.  The arrangement of panels here might achieve a bit of this and the occupants may chose to close the panels more during the summer but overall its a missed opportunity to make this mechanical system contribute even more to efficiencysustainability and perform better for occupant comfort.,mechanical_gifs,ddy1j07,36,t5_2wg6i

11481406,0,t1_dfxemdp,Yeah there is its just not shown very well in this GIF by which I mean at all.

11501506,0,t1_dfzkbp5,Hey now thats just looking at things wrong.  Thats like saying an LS is shitty because another engine makes more power per liter of displacement.
