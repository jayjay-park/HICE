8296430,0,t1_d5e9t2q,Half sizes are definitely next! Choosing to start a business without any sort of loans or investors just meant I had to pick and choose what was the most important the very first time around  Check out the sizing guide for the fit though! Theyre going to tend to run a little small I figured Id rather that than big! so you may fall into a !You may like the Drew wedge! Theyve got that nice comforting strap and the height is actually really great. The platform is  tall so it adds the height without increasing the angle of your foot.
