5596118,0,t3_3lufuj,Any product by Silhouette is amazing. I have a Cameo and the new Mint. I will probably buy the new Curio also. They are a great company with awesome products and great customer service. The Cameo is so easy to use. I sold my Cricut for the Cameo best decision I ever made. ,scrapbooking,cwqr2ck,2,t5_2t46l
