The current hold up on smaller vehicles is the impression than customers arent interested Smart Car not terribly successful and little interest on the part of companies to encourage it because smaller cars have lower profit margins.Elio wont release an electric vehicle initially because that reduces their chances of penetrating the market.

2296035,0,t3_2lhmr8,From the link Curmo gave Thats the Corbin Sparrow and they made a bunch of them before closing shop in . They even made an electric version including a delivery versionThe of the Sparrow and had a dedicated following The same guy Mike Corbin also made some interesting concepts namely the Merlin the Merlin Roadster and the  cylinder RavenIt sounds like they are working on a new version of the electric Sparrow dubbed the Sparrow gtBattery battery management AC motor and motor control technology has caught up with the original Sparrow concept providing Corbin the opportunity to design a Sparrow that will offer improved performance. The goal?  mph top speed with a  mile range. The design looks pretty much like the first version Ther version  prototype is a retrofit of the model  of  total sparrow. It looked like the first versions were using lead acid batteries so it will be interesting to see a Lithium Ion version.Id be kind of interested in seeing them get up and going again but I think using a  phase AC motor is doing it hard mode compared to just using a brushless DC motor. There is a great blog post here by Teslas Principal Power Electronics Engineer Wally Rippel Of GM EV fame that talks about why Tesla uses a  phase AC motor that is a very interesting read. Essentially high power brushless motors operate at lower efficiency when not at full load due to the high fixed magnetic force so  phase AC fixes this with an adjustable B field by an adjustable field instead of magnets but at the cost of adding a decent amount of complexity to the design. For something as small as the Sparrow where less powerful magnets are used in the motor I think they might be making a mistake taking on the extra complexity of  phase AC when they could pretty much just use an off the shelf controller and brushless motor and reach pretty close to the same efficiency because brushless DC makes better efficiency  at peak load. To make my point here is a photo of a Formula E motor designed by McClaren for P. It makes  HP and  lbs of torque and weights only  lbs and here is the photo of the  HP  phase AC induction motor being used in the of the sparrow . Good for them that they hand made it in their own machine shop but I think its even larger than the  HP  phase motor in the Tesla.Instead of throwing in an off the shelf brushless DC motor and using the costtimeweight saved on batteries theyll be sitting on the sidelines with a good idea.Its a shame really.The page saysgtComing Or maybe they have it figured out ,eliomotors,clvi827,4,t5_2wlz4

3994653,0,t3_367zuz,I think the current  list is a promotional preorder discount and it will cost  upon release.  They need to launch it next Summer as they promised and make it easier  to obtain a license.  In my state youll need a motorcycle license and you have to take the test on an actual motorcycle.Not interested.  No capacity for groceries or other small items.  Minimal seating capacity.  No weather protection.  Too expensive.  Advertisement shows people weaving all over the road acting like assholes.  The Lithium Plus adds gives you twenty more miles of range at  per mile.  No thanks.  It also gets you to mph but nobody is taking that mess on the interstate.Id be happier with a trike that cost less and had a basket in the back for storage.

4773841,0,t1_ctvwxyc,I remember that in one of his talks Paul Elio said that things had not gone as smoothly as anticipated.  But he didnt give enough information to determine whether that was why the tests may not have gone off during the previously announced November  time period or whether the problems had prevented the February press debut or if they had occurred during the secretive testing that they claim began for the first time in March.Prior to the planned November testing it was said that engine tests would take six months and the engine would be run to destruction.  If testing actually began in March as claimed then the sixc months will be up in the middle of August.  Its hard to determine what run to destruction actually means.  The photographs of the engine showed sleeved cylinders rather than flame coating.  It would be easy to resleeve and drop the engine in P.  That engine also did not show the variable valve setup that is planned for production and we dont know if it was ever installed.If that test engine is worn out to the point that it cannot be used it will probably still be acceptable for the mostly static P.  We have heard nothing about new castings being made for P or any of the prototypes that will follow.  I presume thats because they want to incorporate everything learned from the test engine into a brand new block and head that will be cast upon completion.,eliomotors,ctwaa1c,1,t5_2wlz4

7574566,0,t1_d32q42m,Its more accessible to more people than any electric car out thereassuming it ever gets made. The most affordable electrics out there in the Elio price range are a used nissan leaf and the batteries in them are garbage and fail rapidly and only have a mile range at best. After that you pretty much need to have brand new  series BMW money to have an electric car. Electric cars are great but until battery tech matures to where kwh batteries costs K and can be recharged at any gas station in under  minutes its just not realistic for most people where a K new car that would take at most month in gas even at gallon would be.

By  after several evolutions of the prototype Vector Aeromotive was operating in Wilmington Calif. created with a public stock offering and proceeds from lawsuits against Goodyear Tire and Vantage cigarettes for trade infringement on the Vector name.gtBut there were still no production Vector Ws and antsy investors were accusing Wiegert of merely funding his own L.A. lifestyle. Tennis star Andre Agassi demanded the car he had ordered. When Vector finally delivered it Agassis car promptly caught fire. Wiegert nonetheless secured more funding from Megatech a company controlled by Indonesian President Suhartos son and the Wilmington plant eventually assembled a handful of Chevypowered Ws. A few were delivered to customers.gtIn  Megatech tried to take control of Vector Aeromotive. Wiegert changed the locks at the shop and hired armed guards.

11061050,0,t1_delpdp6,I confess to only watching three minutes of that video but I got the general idea of what I wanted to know.gtIve never ridden an eBike but I know how nice it would be riding on hills to have an extra . HP of oomph.That thing looks way heavy.  You wouldnt need .HP on a  bicycle because it would like weigh half as much.  You could also upgrade to lighter components over time which seems more difficult with an ebike.  That looks like BMX bike.  Its been a long time since I rode a bike regularly but I used to do about  miles a day.  I wonder how long that battery would hold out for me.  While theres pedal assist that has to add some drag to the system making it harder to pedal causing you to use it more often.  The fact that there are few bike paths around here removes one of the benefits mentioned in the video.I would have to ride one before I could form an honest opinion but I think a good light bike would minimize almost every benefit mentioned.  If you could get a quality ebike for around  I would be an attractive option and worth a comparison.  Im debating a Japanese scooter at the moment but dont know how much use Ill get out of it.  An Eliolike vehicle would certainly cost more but would be more practical for me.  It would have to be under k though.  I dont drive a lot any more and more high mpg used cars are appearing on the market.  Im holding off for an ICE vehicle that can get me at least mpg.,eliomotors,delr33q,1,t5_2wlz4
