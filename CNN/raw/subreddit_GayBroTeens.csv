197576,0,t1_cf0w45w,Cute and fascinating because I have an almost identical experience. My story also contains a boy named Ethan and takes place in the th grade as well. We also have the connection of Ethan having nice legs because my Ethan was a soccer player albeit as young as we were his body was banging. He was pretty white but he was in the sun whenever he could be so he had the most brilliant and quite literally golden tan to have ever graced my eyes. He wore athletic clothing which didnt leave much to the imagination as to what it looked like underneath. Woof that boy was fiiiiinne.... hell he still is. Freckles that blonde messy curly soccer player hair and the most adorable personality. So kind and sweet. I havent ever seen him not smiling and laughing. Needless to say I never left his side in fifth grade. Lunch recess you name it. Ohhh the memories. I havent talked to him since that year so I dont know if hes straight or gay but we grew apart so I couldnt try even if I wanted to. ,GayBroTeens,cf0y2nl,3,t5_2useu

1068680,0,t3_26cldt,Youll probably find a lot of the people who act fairly homophobic wont actually act like that around gay people. I spent a long time believing a good deal of my friends would react fairly negatively particularly because I used to like having sleepovers a lot its not hard to see why itd make someone uncomfortable if they assumed Id had some sort of motive beyond hanging out with friends.Ultimately when I got smashed and came out not a single one of them gave a shit. Youll probably find a lot of the people who appear to be against it will end up being indifferent to it in the end.,GayBroTeens,chprhsl,3,t5_2useu

2253518,0,t3_2kyaj9,This is analogous to a situation where the group is talking about their the best pizza in the area and you interject randomly with your favorite taco place.  Like the discussion is obviously about pizza and there was no apparent resolution to the conversation and you just go and change the subject.If you wanted to feel included in the conversation you should have made your comment applicable to the conversation.  We arent talking about guys yeah they werent..It was just a fact.  I doubt it had anything to do with you really.  ,GayBroTeens,clq99ef,3,t5_2useu

3862974,0,t3_34oc49,Im assuming hes an older brother. That can be tough. I dont have one. Im an older brother myself. Its likely youd find out that his threats are fairly hollow and arent really a danger. I think you should avoid coming out until youre sure youre safe. I think you should sorta feel your family out and see how theyd react to it. Chances are though your brother knows. Hes your brother. He probably knows parts of your life better than you do. You do have somewhat of a difficult situation to think through. ,GayBroTeens,cqwm3dd,2,t5_2useu
