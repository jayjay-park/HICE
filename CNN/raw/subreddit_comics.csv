80777,0,t1_cenjjor,Whilst Google does some specialised things well  primarily hangouts and photos  I find the bulk of the service to be unintuitive and clunky to use in practice. Visually it looks lovely but features like circles  that look great on paper  fail in practice. Interestingly hangouts and photos both came from services that existed before G did. On top of this it sucks hard on a bad connection. Having spent a long time on an unavoidably slow connection ltMbps G is one of the worst offenders I know when it comes to working well on a slow connection of sites of any type.The trouble I see is that G has been designed to be the best social media site based upon features. Facebook has had  years experience with running an actually populated extremely heavily used social website. The experience it has dealing with that volume of users is invaluable to it and they have had time to tune both the back and front ends to be very streamlined. ,comics,cenmiws,5,t5_2qh0s

Cultural denial that sex even exists. I have bad news for you people have a nasty habit of discovering the mechanics of sex regardless of how little emphasis you place on it. Hmm hole peg I wonder.... Or do we tell them yeah sex is a thing but ONLY the grownups who went through a ceremony should do it? Have you met teenagers? The rebellionfactor alone would make that approach fail. Maybe chastity belts? Segregate the women from the men?Youve got a lot of heres how it should be with absolutely no numbers to back it up. Point me to somewhere in the world that implements or has even tested this culturebased sexonlyinthecontextofmarriage philosophy and how its impacted their numbers. What youve got right now is nothing but a theory and all I see you doing is extrapolating it worked for me for everyone else.The plural of anecdote is not data.gt Culture is shaped principally by religion. This means the Church will have to become stronger more bold and have greater influence in how we think and behave.Kindly back this up as well. The numbers have shown historically that every time the church has become stronger more bold people die. In alarming numbers.Also Im not sure what the catholic churchs official position is on free will but the fact is by your own doctrine some people are going to choose sin. Period. Having some allpowerful entity that holds your hand and makes all the difficult choices for you kinda takes away the very notion of free will doncha think? And if thats the direction it needs to be taken then WHY on gods green earth were we made in the first place with genitals that give us dopamine bursts when properly stimulated?

They convince themselves that this is the better life but I believe that this life deferral leaves them incomplete or underdeveloped.That is a goddamn tragedy and this comic illustrates that very well.,comics,cimthge,-4,t5_2qh0s

1630335,1,t1_cjkn01i,First of all stating whether you upvote or downvote someone comes off as a very awkward thing to do. That karma bullshit does not matter but if it makes you happy then go right ahead. All I was doing there was trollingmocking you in the same vain you said you did to others. However I can understand if youre arguing with people who dont know how to have a reasonable debate one might tend to resort to that.  Just keep in mind that there are articles and peerreviewed research that share opposing ideas on everything. Just take a deeper philosophical step back and you realize that nothing can be proven. Fact can even be broken down to what the majority of society believes at the time. Even if you and i were in the same room it would look different to each of us based on personal subjective experience. This is why i make fun of gently educating. Because what youre saying is that the facts you believe are more right than the facts other people believe. Therein lies the importance of healthy debate between people with opposing views. If you can each learn why the other believes what he believes everyone grows from the experience. From your comments it seems youre open to that so upvote for that. These are just some things to consider if you hadnt already. ,comics,cjko33k,0,t5_2qh0s

Either you have to say Yes you can and thats not a sin or No you cant you have the freedom to wave knives around anywhere except when theyd end up sticking into someone.  Neither one really meshes with our standard ideas of sin or free will.Yes I suppose you could say Well what if knives didnt exist? but thats dodging the argument.

Well our poor raccoon doesnt even identify as a raccoon he thinks hes a squirrel a racist squirrel who thinks all raccoons are thieves and muggers.

1906545,0,t1_ckivsmv,I take your point but I dont think a yay future! attitude would address the problems you listed with the likely exception of Ebola where a technological solution does seem possible. However thats not the only solution to a problem. Weve seen that solving problems always gives rise to new ones. So often the question we should ask when we try to solve a problem is which new ones we want! To a technosolutionist every problem looks like a technological one and they envisage only one possible future. Thats not necessarily the best one  just the outcome of their particular bias. And it is a bias. There is no a priori reason to think that a particular technological advance is in some sense inevitable nor that it is going to have a net positive effect. The technosolutionist is like a hammer to them everything looks like a nail. Of course one could make similar arguments to the people striving for simpler times. To them every problem is a sign of the decline of our values or something like that.In short technological progress is only part of the story when it comes to building a better future and it could easily help build a worse one as well. So Im a yay future!type if that means recognising our problems and hoping we can address them in the future but Im not a yay future!type if that means thinking progress will automatically make our lives better.,comics,ckixdbc,8,t5_2qh0s

2128428,0,t1_clacn94,In a developed society with low crime what Id like to believe were all striving for in this country firearms provide littletononexistent social utility. Many areas of the country are already there.I love hunting. Why can I not own a gun for hunting? I eat the game I kill so therefore I am providing for myself. So your argument about it not providing a utility is flawed. It is also flawed because we are human. We are greedy violent lustful people who will go to great lengths to accomplish what we want. You want a cure for all of this gun violence? Increase the economy and get rid of gangs. Look at Detroit its basically a rd world country. maaaaasive gun violence every night because people are stealing to survive and committing acts of violence in the process.  Please refer to this link to see the utility that owning a firearm can give you in defending your livelihood and your possessions during riots.  As for your nd point yes cars provide all of those things. But again my point is that gun control isnt about logic its about fear. Its not comparing apples to oranges as you are making it out to be. And my final argument is that it is our nd amendment right to own guns. It is our right to have firearms technology equal to that of the military so that in such a case of totalitarianism we can ensure our freedoms much like when this country was founded after the revolutionary war.  Yes I know that it is highly unlikely that it will happen in the U.S. however look at Germany before WWII.

3188339,0,t3_2wm4zx,Well the two closest experiences Ive had would be sitting in a restaurant when bullets started popping from a few meters away.    In that situation I was on the ground and low crawling out of there only to look behind me and see my friends sitting frozen at the table.  Had to grab the idiots and tell them to crawl with me.    I guess when scary unexplained stuff happens in my house is another example.  Initially there is a couple of seconds of fearful freeze followed by me looking for the nearest weapon like object and doing a solid permiter check.    Of course...  One time I came home and found my entire second floor house lights off...  Was a tripped breaker right?    As Im fumbling with the breaker box I hear what sounds like something crawling really fast at me from inside my bedroom.    Next thing I know Im outside of my front door doing a did that really happen or am I imagining things  sanity check. ,comics,cosgz9m,4,t5_2qh0s

Some people just like holding signs and getting to yell and act angry in public. Others just like being drunk in the middle of the day and not be judged. There is always a core group of people who get really into yelling at the guaranteed antigroup. Almost every issue involves a pretty considerable group of stoners. Some rallies smell worse than others. The worst smelling rally Ive ever been to is a close tie between Pride in D.C. one year when it was particularly hot and it seemed like nobody was wearing deodorant or the ColbertStewart rally where nobody wore deodorant. ,comics,cp4nvgl,6,t5_2qh0s

3418751,0,t3_2zcgc1,Being from New Jersey a melting pot state that also has distinct cultural elements from literally every country  people are very proud of where their immigrant ancestors originated from.  You could even say the unique IrishAmerican culture is linked directly to Irish culture though there are some differences.  That is why it isnt annoying to say Im Irish even if your great grandparents came from Ireland on one side of your family.  Its the same thing with any racial  cultural identity here in the US.  People tend to be proud and expressive of it even if they are only loosely linked to it by outside opinion.  I personally identify as Italian mostly but also Scottish and Irish because of how I was brought up and also because of my ancestry.  I know my family tree and where they came from and both sides have passed traditions down that originate from those cultures.  I mean I live more American than anything obviously as most people here do but as far as family time  cultural elements around you we label them by their country of origin here in the US.  I dont know why people are surprised or annoyed by this all of a sudden because its how its been done from the beginning.  Its why the US is the coolest place but its also why we have racial divides here.  Its confusing actually.  Im going to go eat now. ,comics,cphyngg,1,t5_2qh0s

Except that they are not they are loved by their close ones and have their own subjective experience.

4228038,0,t1_cs25y55,Ive heard about the feedback your brain receives from your body. For example the physical act of smiling makes you feel happier than if you let your face relax. We usually think of the brain to facial expression process as a oneway communication but studies have shown that much of our neurology is actually a back and forth conversation. This is also the case when it comes to our visual perception. Just as there are neural pathways running from our eyes directly to our brains there are also pathways running from our brains back to our eyes. Its really fascinating how these things operate.So yes I agree with you that there is some merit to the advice of putting on happiness like its a piece of clothing. Its very counterintuitive and can be very hard to do when youre really down in it but if you can manage to do it I think there are positive results. Something Ive been trying to focus on in recent months is adjusting my default contemplative expression. What I mean is that when Im thinking about something especially when Im trying hard to figure something out I often furrow my brow and make an expression that looks like anger or frustration. This in turn seems to send a slow but steady signal to my brain and I notice it affecting my mood. Instead of letting my face make that expression Ive been making a conscious attempt to have a neutral or preferably positive facial expression when I am thinking hard about something. Ive noticed a positive impact on my mood.Neurology is infinitely fascinating!,comics,cs269a4,6,t5_2qh0s

4320957,0,t1_cscm3oa,If you care to study history you will find that Christianity has been a force to make western culture sensitive to racism misogyny racism and violence. While it had been a slow and steady race issues of abolition womens rights and pacifism have been championed by Christians and Christian movements from their inception.  And Christianity teaches that the essence of humanity is good.  Truly we do confess the corruption that has entered into man through sin sin that is realized in secular pluralistic Buddhist Greek Christian Asian inca Hindu  and all other cultures. Christianity is not the element that corrupts our culture or  any other culture it is the brokenness of man. This is the brokenness answered on the cross and concurred with the empty tomb of Christ.  It is our hope that Christ will raise us to life in the last day to live free from death and suffering. But we nevertheless serve our neighbors now brining the balm of love to our neighbor. If you care to look at human service and acts of charity around the world it is clear that the church is the salt of the earth. ,comics,cscp8uc,1,t5_2qh0s

Its less about clean sets and more about having some comedy that is fucking up to date. Its all old tropes. And it pushes audiences away. Youre absolutely right though HE DID win awards at other clubs. He wasnt invited to come he came for the openmic. So its hard for us to say no. Ill see what I can do.

4639803,0,t3_3egvp3,Its a wonderful sentiment but flawed I think. For those I know the problem is not regret. The problem is fear. People fear loss. They fear the loss of time and effort invested. They fear losing the frail selfassurance that yes they couldve been great if only they had tried. They fear putting the very marrow of their bones into their art showing it to friends loved ones the world at large and being told its shit. Or worse yet no one taking any notice at all. Theres nothing worse than being at the top of your form letting yourself shine and realizing that the world is too big too crowded too preoccupied to note so much as a glimmer from you. They fear their nascent dreams in which their selfworth comes to full fruition will be proven the lie we tell ourselves to get through each day. People dont not put in the effort because its too hard. They dont do it because many of them cant afford to lose their illusions of promise. ,comics,ctfexig,11,t5_2qh0s

No doubt OP has seen the comic you posted and the one I posted and countless others with a similar setuppunchline but that doesnt mean they stole the joke.

A playful look in a serious environment will make you seem like a fool.Im not that big a fan of some things Bush did but I honestly think he brought on much of the hate through not presenting himself appropriately in every situation.I think its fitting to consider Hitlers presentation.

7279582,0,t1_d25jmuk,I think its important to note that manga being a Japanese style and marketed at the Japanese population and predominantly done by Japanese studios reflects the culture of Japan more than the culture of any other place. In that regard Japan is still a very insular and xenophobic society in many ways and so it makes sense that manga would not include minority characters. A very good friend of mine who is of mixed heritage Black and Portuguese visited Japan a few months back and he said he never felt more like an outside than he did in Tokyo and Yokohama. Stares questions and people moving away from him walking down the street.The characters are mostly JapaneseChineseKorean because those are the markets that they are targeting  and in black and white comic format skin tone is usually straight up ignored unless there is a black character. Even for characters that have a darker skin tone this is ignored in the manga many times.Notable examples? Sado in Bleach is mixed Mexican and Japanese and has notably darker skin than other characters but in the manga version his skin is not filled in unless theres something dramatic happening.The main reason for this? Ink costs money and manga is printed on white paper and the artists time cost money and filling in skin tones used to take time prior to digital formats which have largely negated this issue.So because of cost and the country of origin youve got the traditional reasons for why manga didnt have minority characters very often and tradition like that is hard to break from. If the manga can create a compelling story with minority characters thats great but they should keep in mind that their target market isnt going to be as large as traditional mangas.Edit I should say revolving around minority characters rather than just having them be present. Im not interested in stories or authors that try to shoehorn in diversity for the sake of diversity rather than having a reason to have them there that makes sense contextually within the story.,comics,d25n1ma,24,t5_2qh0s

7287549,0,t1_d26gp84,OK my friend that was a little unnecessary for the nature of the discussion. Im well aware of the variety within Japanese artistic works. Would you prefer it if I had said the art style of Japanese comic books? Because thats a lot of words where manga will do.What words would you like me to use to describe the stylistic tropes across the vast majority of Japanese comic books?As a follow up question how would you identify to a layman the art style of Avatar the last air bender?

7290608,0,t1_d26oab8,I never said you were an idiot just using incorrect andor misleading terminology. Plus if youd said manga style that would have been fineish. But you said manga is an art style which no its not.

7307352,0,t1_d28cqgg,On the other hand theres so much conflicting information about preCochrane warp drive that its hard to get a consistent explanation.Some theorize that the Klingons stole it from the Hurq but then other sources state that the Klingons discovered warp drive in the th century and the Hurq invasion occurred in the th century i.e. the Klingons had interstellar travel for  years and still managed to get their butts kicked and their homeworld invaded by these bad mofos from the gamma quadrant. They drove them off eventually of course but not before they plundered the Sword of Kahless.And then theres the fact that nonhuman Federation races seem to agree that Cochrane is the inventor of warp drive as we know it that is an MAM reactor generating electroplasma that flows through verterium cortenide warp coils which generates a subspace field. This raises the question what were the Klingons Vulcans Andorians et al. using before Cochrane? Ron Moore theorized that Romulanstyle singularity reactors are much older but far more dangerous and lessefficient drive tech and that most nearby races switched over to MAM reactors after Cochrane invented them.But yeah big mess as far as Star Trek canon is concerned.,comics,d28so88,9,t5_2qh0s

7337913,0,t1_d2c8p0p,I got Marvel Unlimited about a month and half ago and read it frequently on my iPhone . Whether you read it on your tablet phone or through the website there are two modes to select a Smart Panel view and then a full page view with the ability to zoom in. Smart Panel or whatever it is actually called takes you from panel to panel but really kind of falls apart on larger panels  one page spread  two page spreads. I personally use the full page view but zoom in and then read it while holding my horizontally. Text is large enough to easily read and you can see approx.  to  the page by doing so. I highly recommend it. Edit If youre going to get MU the best advice I can give you is to not solely rely on their reading order if youre going to read certain events or about certain characters. I usually crossref their list with reading order on comicbookhearld or a similar site. Marvel Unlimited usually starts their reading order for the events Civil War House of M etc. right at the beginning of said event. If youre a big Avengers fan or Xmen fan you may know what is going on but odds are youll want to read a few issues that kind of set everything up for you. As for characters their Discover tool is pretty neat if you want to see some big highlights in the characters life but again youll be tossed around from issue to issue without knowing too much about what is going on. Plus youll probably read something that in the descriptions that would be a big spoiler such as Ever since X Y has been and youre like Wait what? They die!

7692510,0,t1_d3gkuyq,Some Jews and Egyptians may have worn them but theyre not really white and the statues depicting them seem to be a different style and I cant find anything saying that hairstyle was ever popular in Europe. Its a huge part of Rastafarian culture and its pretty obvious that thats what white people are copying with their dreadlocks. Denying that would be pretty disingenuous.But putting that aside Im not talking about that specific instance I think people who actually complain about hair are being ridiculous too especially when a lot of black teens and adults with them dont have any ties to the culture either. It doesnt mean that the comic is correct. Imagine if no one ever complained about dreadlocks but all other kinds of cultural appropriation complaints were still made. This comic would just be about something else entirely and he would still miss the point. It would still be just as bad.,comics,d3gl7s7,-9,t5_2qh0s

Whats happening in venezuela and what happened to cuba in the s and what happened to Russia should be enough evidence by now but socialists always say It just hasnt been done right yet!.MAYBE socialism could work. But it would only work if everyone followed the rules. But thats the thing most people dont follow the rules. Thats why we have capitalism.

Not to mention that watching shows on something as small as a phone a pain in the ass. Similarly the power behind a DS is always going to be more than any phone has.

8295777,1,t1_d5ehsr2,To try and clarify what he means by defining its kind of the fact that in society if you were to point out a white guy one kind of says see that guy over there?. This contrasts black people who societally get pointed out like see that black guy over there?. The addition of the word black adds a lot of internalized emotions often times negative ones like threat or dumb. With white dudes there is no modifier. Theyre just a guy. If you were to add white to it then negative associations happen too like awkward. But society doesnt think of it that way. Thus you are part of a category and are not societally defined by it like people of color are.I also would like to preemptively add a rebuttal to what about in a black neighborhood? They say white guy when referring to me!. Thats because its uncharacteristic of you being there. And youre right it is not the best thing but its much worse to have internalized emotions coming out of the race who Kind of own most things look at the race distribution of CEOs of major companies than to have them come out of a person who likely struggles to stay above the poverty line look at how many people of color are affected by major poverty that live in predominantly black neighborhoods.,comics,d5ej44l,1,t5_2qh0s

By now Rom knows its pretty much useless to stick around and try to explain. In fact it could lead to conflict with locals who he is sworn not to harm if he can avoid it. However Rom does have longterm plans to gain allies on Earth who can help him as weve seen in his own book. Hed like to have the U.S. military on his side but he knows he has to be selective because theyve been infiltrated. There is also a learning curve on each new planet he comes to as he learns its culture and ways.

After seeing the results I felt heavy and worn and still do this morning. It was more of a helpless feeling than anything else so I decided to write something to give me a moment of peace.  I wanted to make something that would say Its ok to take a moment of peace to hug a loved one even just for a second even if you know that things are not ok. I wasnt trying to say stop forever. Dont do anything and ignore the world forever. Dont take action and take this lying down. I just wanted people to take a small breather and look at the sky the trees or even just close their eyes for a second and mentally refresh before continuing whether that is in an hour a day a week or whatever is best them. Im just afraid people may commit suicide or do something physically hurtful to themselves or others over the results. After looking at it it did come off as an Ignorance is Bliss type of feel and I apologize for that. I dont think the message was conveyed correctly and I take responsibility for that. I do hope though that in whatever form it is that you can find the peace that you seek.,comics,d9sy5kh,119,t5_2qh0s

9737012,0,t1_dacnnl2,First of all thank you for being rational here.I think something important to point out is that rTheDonald is far from homogenous. While its made up of Trump supporters there is a lot of room for diversity within that group. Theres folks that have been Republican their whole lives theres disenfranchised Bernie supporters theres Libertarians underwhelmed with Aleppo man theres people of all genders races and ethnicities and yes there are trolls too.So yeah there are trolls from rTheDonald but there are trolls from everywhere on the internet. Thats a part of what makes the internet the internet. Go ahead and downvote the trolls. I wont stop you. In fact Id support you in going after them. Where I take issue is when you assume that someone is a troll when theyre from rTheDonald and when you downvote anyone that disagrees with you just because of that assumption.gtAn intrinsical part of a civil discussion is presenting your opinion and then fund them in facts and being able to concede points to your opponent that are irrefutable. However supporters from thed have consistently shown to be incapable of both they never present any proof when pushed and decline to accept any proof from their peers under vague assumptions such as MSM is corrupt or simply by not responding.I actually mostly agree here. I do think that backing up claims with facts and sources is necessary. I do think that avoiding a fallacy fallacy is also important just because someone makes a really bad argument doesnt necessarily make them wrong it just means their argument isnt very convincing. They could be wrong or they could just be a shitposter without the time or effort to articulate their views with the level of nuance it would take to convince you.As far as the nuclear bombs well I think he was wrong but in a way thats not very important. You were right Trump did say he would use nuclear force if necessary and that hed never want to rule it out. Now I cant speak for him directly but Id suspect its because committing to never using the bombs deprives us of the negotiating power that comes with them.As far as WW well Im afraid that Hillarys policy on putting a nofly zone over Syria on top of our current sanctions on Russia might back them into a corner where they wouldnt have a whole lot of options other than nuclear war. Sargon of Akkad talked about this in one of his recent videos. I highly recommend his stuff. Hes probably the most agreeable leftist Ive heard on the internet. Absolutely brilliant analysis.As far as MSM being corrupt well theres plenty of evidence for that on wikileaks too. I could link some of it if youre actually interested in reading but Im not gonna go to the effort if its just going to fall on deaf ears. Let me know if youre actually curious though.Ive found that if you want to write an actually persuasive argument you need to use sources that are reputable to your audience rather than you personally. Even if you dont agree with Breitbart if you can find something they said that supports your point you can be pretty sure itll be accepted by Trump supporters. Similarly if I were to use CNN as a source I know you would trust it even if I think theyre a crock of shit.gtBtw another part of a discussion is adding meaningful arguments which your post did not. I will call out bullshit like that.You know what isnt a meaningful argument? Downvoting dissent without leaving a comment. Im just calling that out. You can call it out for not being meaningful but that doesnt mean thats the case.gtI feel that a large part of the trump community had fallen prey to the same phenomenon that they so love to pin on the democrats they have turned their subplatformwhatever into one big echo chamber and refuse to listen to anything that doesnt fit their narrative.Unfortunately Im inclined to agree with you. There has been a lot of echochambering on both sides of the isle. I try to combat this for myself by challenging my thoughts and opinions with those from the other side such as your own. Often Im even wrong and I can accept that because that just means Im that much closer to the truth. I actually used to be more of a socialist before I understood some of the perverse incentives such a system can create.I think this is a symptom of our current political divide and Im interested to see how Trump deals with it. It looked to me like he did a good job with his victory speech and the  Minutes interview but well see if the trend continues.gtGuess what there are problems with a Trumppresidency. It will not be the shiny land of happiness some of you believe in.I actually know that. Im aware that there will be some problems with government with him as the lead but there will be problems with anyone at the lead. Contrary to what you may think I do have a handful of objections to his policies. I think his views on global warming and vaccinations are simply incorrect and I think his views on internet privacy and the role of the NSA are worrisome.That being said I think theres a lot of disinformation coming from the left that isnt true either. I really dont think hes a sexist racist homophobic xenophobic etc. deplorable. Hes not going to holocaust Mexicans and hes definitely not going to be starting WW. In all actuality I think his foreign policy might be his strongest platform along with his education plan that he rarely talked about.,comics,dadasb2,2,t5_2qh0s

And while Im far from an expert on Native American civilizations Im aware there were many tribes and not a unifying system of government as we currently have.What Im saying here broadly and somewhat crassly is that saying there goes the neighborhood when new people come into this country is shortsighted and ultimately ignorant of the fact that the USA is a nation of immigrants and their descendants except for Native Americans.When waves of Irish came in legally there was a backlash. There are Muslims entering this country now legally and theres a backlash. I think its important to look up at the branches of our own family trees before we decry that our country is going down the tubes because of the new folks moving in down the street. ,comics,dae949q,4,t5_2qh0s

I laughed pretty hard when Id gotten the joke and I wouldnt just say that because the creator was calling me out on what I said.  Im an artist too and I know what goes into creating something and that tracing has an undeserved connotation to it.  Still life drawings arent the hard part  most people dont become famous for being able to recreate a photo but in pencil  its impressive but it doesnt leave an impression.  Thats to say that who cares if you drew the photo from reference versus tracing the gist and actually spending that time being productive towards completing the piece It was just that rotoscoping describes the thousands of frames that a team of artists grind through at least to me.  Word definitions change over time though and I was just arguing over word choice.  ,comics,dan45k7,6,t5_2qh0s

Could it be that you are unable to understand a single english phrase? Try reading my response again I am sure you will find it this time around. gtBy the way that wasnt an ad hominem thats was an statement on how poor your understanding off basic language is. Hopefully you realize the difference.Buddy that is an ad hominem attack. An ad hominem attack does not necessarily have to be a false statement.

9967725,0,t1_db6sff5,The biggest complaint I see about this movie is that they didnt show Rey learning how to do things on screen.

It sets up Rey knowing how to fight with a melee weapon and why shed have learned that it shows why shes familiar with mechanics and Imperialesque computer and ship technology. It communicates ahead of time just how powerful the bow caster is. It constantly reminds you how horribly injured Kylo was during the fight.

Not necessarily romantic but more like interest. Vader did the same thing with Luke who of course was his son and Vader had an agenda to turn him but honestly considering who Vader is his attacks on Luke at Bespin start out pretty weak.

10187980,0,t3_5ls1sx,For people who have this problem or who are driven to conniptions by mixed signals or blurred lines some advice Flirtyfriendly is a spectrum for most people not a binary switch. Most people if they are feeling flirty start on the friendly side of the spectrum then see where it goes taking it gradually more flirty until they realize either Okay Im attracted to this person. Its not just flirting its crushinglovelust and Im ready to cross the line OR Okay that was fun but Im not really into this personI dont want this to go any furtherthings could get weird and I should call it a night. OR Okay this just got nopey. Nope nope nopey nope. The above process may take minutes hours weeks or months. There are some relationships that maintain a certain level of recreational flirtiness for years and years indefinitely especially if both parties genuinely enjoy each others company and genuinely find each other attractive but also genuinely dont want to take it further than friendship e.g. each is happily married to someone else. A great way to go from zero to NOPE on the flirty scale is to instantly put the pedal to the medal once you start picking up hints. This can be especially common with people who have limited social interaction and whose primary experience of human sexulaity comes from porn or romance moviesbooks. Both males females and everyone inbetween should understand that it is possible to be way too aggressiveovert EITHER sexually OR romantically. It is NOT the case that a guy who immediately starts spewing love poetry is charming and sweet nor is it the case that a girl who starts making raunchy talk is automatically hot and sexy. Flirting is a game of testing and learning about ourselves and each other. Its a way to have fun without actually committing to anything and a way to get a feel for compatibility and attraction. If it seems coy thats because it is. Youre not saying anything that you cant back out of yet at least. Thats what makes flirting different from hitting on or actually pursuing. Some tips for flirting This should go without saying but nothing pornographic at first not even if you say it without dirty words. If you are going to make doubleentendres they should be extremely subtle and oblique. Come back to my place and Ill give you something to suck on is not flirting its a pickup line unless it is very deftly worked into a conversation about the other person needing a lozenge or something. No romantic poet shit. Ahh how I love the stars and moon reflected on the water... Thats not flirting thats something else. There is nowhere for the other person to take it no opportunity for repartee. Its just they either fall into your arms or respond with yeah me too I guess. Find things to talk about that acknowledge the existence of gender without hammering on sex.  Humor is A. Your jokes dont have to be any good. If the other person is feeling flirty they will laugh. If they dont laugh you know its not flirtytime. If they do laugh especially if they laugh too much and too loud and especially if a girl uses laughing as an excuse to touch you thats a really good sign that the other person is feeling flirty too. That does not mean its a good time to say I love you nor to whip out your dick. It means its a good time to keep flirting. Good topics for earlystage flirting are Celebrities that you find sexyhot especially if they are unconventional picks and superespecially if they are relevant to some other topic of conversation. It brings sex and attraction into the conversation without hitting on or committing to anything it opens the door for playful jealousy and if your pick is not a typical sexsymbol or is more personalitydriven than appearancedriven it creates the opportunity for genuine conversation. Discussion about places to gothings to do especially that have an element of dangersexinessromance or that couples might find appealing Russian baths hookah bars old world cities junglesbeachesmountains fullbody massage mud baths ocean liner cruises sleeper cars in trains swing dancing cooking classes you get the idea. This is NOT necessarily the time to bring up getting a tattoo down there nor Amsterdam sex shows etc. The whole idea is to keep talking about stuff that is take backable so that the conversation can keep going. And hopefully get gradually more flirty. Because flirting is fun!Stage  flirtiness topics again this might be after  minutes or five months its the art of reading the conversation and of gradually testing each new level for signals to keep going or to take a step back  Jokes about the medical or nutritional value of breast milk for adults are a triedandtrue way of testing the dirtyjoke receptiveness of your crowd. Also jokes about alternate uses for condoms Straightman jokes that imply ignorance of the purpose of sex props or toys etc. Again your jokes dont have to be any good if you try one and it flops thats a signal to back off a little you went too far. If you try one and its a hit they are laughing because they are having so much fun flirting not because of your comedic genius.  Remember that incrementalism is the name of the game here. Flirting is about gradually testing boundaries not about going in for the kill. Its a game of inches. Two steps forward one step back not hailmary longbombs. If the conversation suddenly comes to a screeching halt you werent flirting. You were doing something else. The whole idea with flirting is that you are just nudging the boundary a little bit and the occasional back off signal is part of the game not the end of it. What if I am trying to flirt but the other person isnt taking the bait and seems to be just having a conversation with me? No problem! This is why we flirt! To try and break the ice without raising the stakes! First if they are still talking to you that means by definition that your flirt game hasnt failed you. In fact it often means that they are trying to flirt back but dont know how. So keep flirting if you want to! They are still talking to you so whatever you are doing they are enjoying it right?  What if you are on the opposite side of this and you get the sense that some guy or gal is trying to flirt with you by asking more about your catsgaming rigworkout routine or whatever but you are totally socially inept and dont know how to respond except to rattle off lists of facts about the topic? FIND A WAY TO MAKE A JOKE OF IT Its funny you should ask most of the ladies start out wanting to know about graphics card but once I get them back to my pad what really impresses them is the ping time on my router. Again your joke can be stupid. Its flirting. For the record Stage  flirtiness where you get outright raunchy andor romantic is a casebycase personbyperson thing. Boundaries are personal things and if you follow the above steps you should be able to test other peoples boundaries gradually to give them a chance to get used to yours and to get comfortable with the water temperature. Some people meet each other and within ten minutes are telling scat jokes. Other people it takes them weeks or months to admit being attracted to feet. Everyone is different. Flirting is how you find these things out about other people gradually and without spoiling friendships. Okay so now were flirting! Im doing it! This is really happening! Shes making eyes at me and touching my arm when she laughs at my stupid jokes and twirling her hair when we talk and everything!NOW WHAT DO I DO? Great question! First off you can just keep doing what youre doing ! Flirting is fun and you can have a great time flirting and flirty friendships are fun and confidencebuilding and reaffirming and they dont have to go anywhere to stay that way. You can both date other people and see where things go and maybe even try the FWB thing once in a while it works out.  If you have a flirty relationship with someone frankly it creates its own icebreakers.  You can try the headon approach I feel like we have been flirting for a while and there is a tension between us and I want to take it to the next level... Good thing is if they say no you havent killed the friendship assuming youve read the flirtiness correctly and there might even be a chance later.  You can keep on flirting! Sooner or later flirty friendships hit a point where one or both parties signals a boundary and the relationship stabilizes around a certain level or else nature takes its course and the sexual tension escalates until its no longer just flirty. What if Im flirting and flirting and flirting like forever and they  keep talking to me but it never goes anywhere? they are probably just not that into you. Both men and women gay and straight would rather finish work every Friday with an inbox full of what are you up to? than go home to a lonely house with a silent phone.  Thats horrible! how can they be so cruel and heartless? Its not cruel or heartless they still consider you a friend and are happy to have you on their contacts list theyre just not into you that way. Time to either make your move cut them off or resign yourself to the reality of being just friends potentially maybe FWB. Have fun flirting!,comics,dbyv40u,29,t5_2qh0s

I ring a person whos job it is and they show up and fix it. I pay the bill but the savings I get long term from not paying rent are well worth it.And if I want to move? Well seeing as I made sure to buy a house in an area highly sought after by renters I can just rent it out.. the going rate for rental properties here is around twice what my mortgage costs me. Even if I hired a real estate company to handle it all for me Id still make a small profit or at least break even.. and I still have an asset worth several hundred thousand dollars.

10555270,0,t1_dd4fy46,Well I think a lot of it is in the delivery. I dont think Ive ever seen a comic that just said haha I suck and I should kill myself with no kind of comedic context and thought it was funny. It has to be seen a balance between a light tone and a serious tone. If its too serious then it stops being a joke if its too light it doesnt really resonate with people but if its just right it can hit that its funny because its true middle ground. But no I dont think people like feeling depressed its just a way of connecting with other people who are depressed because if you cant laugh about it youll cry. It can be hard to understand this if you dont deal with depression yourself.I also think the other aspect that can make this kind of humor funny is the same reason we find bluntness funny. Its a bit of a social fauxpaux to be so frank about the ennui of existence so when we see someone in a comic joke about actually being dead inside its funny because its not something a normal person would really do.Id be interested to see if you could post an example of a comic that you think is too depressing maybe I could provide another perspective on it.,comics,dd4k4l4,2,t5_2qh0s

10665416,0,t1_ddfyot8,Replaced? With nothing or pure crap.gt However their plan is a nonstarter for many conservatives particularly in the House who believe anything less than full repeal would be breaking a fundamental campaign pledge.gt A key component is that it would repeal the individual mandate and replace it with a system that gives people tax credits if they choose to buy insurance.Now what are tax credits you ask? You pay whatever you insurance wont cover up front and pray to fucking God that tax day will cover your ass and kiss your shit goodbye if it is nearly a year until tax day. Of course thats IF you are paying for your own insurance. Not paying the exorbitant subscription fee for insurance? Too fucking bad nothing for you go die under a bridge.gt Other key players like Senate Health Labor and Pensions Committee chairman Lamar Alexander of Tennessee are taking ideas off the table. For instance Alexander opposes trying to tackle Medicare reforms in the Obamacare replacement effort.Rip it apart. Rip it apart. Rip it apart and give whats left to the fuckwad corporations to lobby against and easily repeal. Genius drain that swamp! Remember the GOP runs off of nothing but an antisocialist big government platform so any ounce of social funding that doesnt provide the absolute bare minimum is a threat to them because it interferes with the tax breaks they give corporations and upsets their constituents that they think theres no such thing as a free lunch and that includes using taxes to help fund the sick and needy because that is nowhere near the bare minimum for them.gt I personally am lucky enough to have a stable occupation that I earned through work. And Im pretty damn sure education and an American diploma or two helped out. Gee immigrants dont get that luxury.And heres a fun one for you.

There are other swings of course but we dont care about them.  Point is everyone generally enjoys the Pepe swing.      One group of kids that especially love the Pepe swing are those seriously messed up weird gross kids who dare each other to eat bugs and wipe boogers on everything.   Well call them the Altr Boys.   Other kids know the Altr Boys use the Pepe swing but its okay everyone shares its all part of using the playground.      Then one day a kid catches an Altr Boy smearing shit all over the swing and then jerking off into it.

10947092,0,t1_de7xrgc,You can teach yourself pretty easily these days just by googling what youre interested in learning about. However you dont know what youre interested in if you dont know anything about art. Therefore I have two book suggestions. A great primer is The Story of Art by Paul Gombrich. It covers all of art history to the time of its writing . Its a great resource huge numbers of illustrations and well written. Its a pretty easy read and assumes ignorance without ever being condescending. Sadly there is no ebook of it and its not the cheapest book in the world but try asking for it at your local library they can probably order it in. Most libraries will do that for free but some have a small charge. Otherwise try checking out A History of Art for Beginners and Students by Clara Clement. It is available in print its on the kindle store and you can also download it from Project Gutenberg for free here Now sadly the author died in  and the book was published during the nascence of Modernism so its stands a bit short of modern times but its excellent at showing you the history of the past and its cheap advantage is that it is out of copyright and thus free to access.I really recommend starting with a broad focus like this because then you can home in on the aspects and periods of art you find most interesting. Art books tend to be quite expensive because of the cost of printing the illustrations so starting broad also stops you from buying into a period of art history you later find is uninteresting. That being said if you really want to get into the nittygritty of th century art theory right away Id recommend Conceptual Revolutions in TwentiethCentury Art by David W. Galenson. It goes through the major movements of the th century but can at times be pretty heavy going so be forewarned. Also Go to your local art museum. Youd be surprised just how much is around you and many of them are free or surprisingly inexpensive. Not every city can have the Louvre or the Metropolitan Museum sure but most big cities have an interesting collection and enthusiastic staff who want to talk about them. It will quickly become selfperpetuating you will find art you like and want to talk about youll research the artist online youll find similar works and research them youll read about the movement youll go to a gallery dedicated to it and so on and so forth. Regardless of how much you know about art going to an art museum is an enjoyable experience. Either you will know nothing and be pleasantly surprised by each work or you will know something and be able to recognise common themes and ideas and link the works to other pieces of art you enjoy.And also this might be a bad idea on your first visit but can be fun later on I like to buy out of date guide books to art museums like books from the s or s and go around the museum using those as my reference. It makes it into a sort of treasure hunt to find things as often they have moved or been replaced or been put out on loan to another museum  or have been joined by new works that the guidebook doesnt know about. It helps me see the museum with fresh eyes rather than walking past with a glazed expression as can sometimes happen if Ive been there before.,comics,de945kk,1,t5_2qh0s

11516574,1,t1_dg1dqh2,If it wasnt hurting me then yes. If it was actively intruding on my home then no. Fish are minding their own business. If I want to eat so I catch a fish then I dont feel bad. If I catch a fish and throw it back likely killing it then yes I do feel bad.If I shoot a deer bring it back to my house butcher it and eat it theres no remorse at all. If I shoot a deer and let it bleed out in the forest for nothing except a bit of fun then I feel incredible remorse.Empathy is a pretty simple model I think.,comics,dg1elhj,5,t5_2qh0s

11543110,0,t1_dg4cm66,One mistake that people often make when trying to understand depression is that its a feeling of sadness. Dont get me wrong it can be. But for a lot of people its more of a feeling of detachment and emptiness not of overwhelming sadness. Depression for me is more of a whats the point? feeling rather than Im sad. I was never a cutter I would rather internalize my shit because it doesnt seem like it should be important to anybody else. They shouldnt have to deal with my problem. Its probably even less healthy than cutting for what thats worth. The last panel of this comic is what my wife does for me. My kids too. Fairly certain I wouldnt be around without them.,comics,dg4evu7,245,t5_2qh0s
11548081,0,t1_dg4gv45,Having a sort of ritual always helps me. When I feel the urge to cut I make a cup of tea. Ive done it so many times that its mechanical. The familiar actionsputting on the kettle pouring it into a mug dunking the teabag adding the sugarare a sort of safe respite for me. The warmth of the tea is soothing  and enough of a new sensation to break me out of that headspace at least temporarily. Doing this has kept me from cutting for over a year now even during some really horrible times. ,comics,dg4z7eb,5,t5_2qh0s
11550470,0,t1_dg58hr4,Please understand that what Im about to say is hypocritical of me since like many people I cant say that Ive sorted out every single on of my issues.But some great advice I was once given was that its both unreasonable and selfish to expect other people to accept us when weve got problems. Its akin to a salesman who knowingly provides faulty items if you cant love yourself why should others love you?So as some internet stranger who hardly knows you I might just pitch the question as to why you dont just try to move on from a relationship between damaged people work on yourself and eventually look for a relationship with real potential? Maybe youll look back to all this as wasted time but be glad that you got out?Im saying this as someone who wasted two years dating a very selfish person with bipolar while at the same time having incredibly unhealthy issues myself. I had  years after that of misery depression and dead end jobs. Like I said though Im a hypocrite since I didnt actually fix my issues I just ran away to a new setting. But Id say that I at least found some happiness in leaving it all.,comics,dg58yzy,2,t5_2qh0s
11551698,0,t3_64q62y,I didnt even clock this as a self harm thing until i read the comments. I thought it was a dropper that he used to change his color and not a weapon of some sort. So i read this as using a temporary thing to change your mood but it fades far too quickly. For me thats pretty much anything that keeps me distracted.

11573213,0,t1_dg7r766,As someone who has a masters degree in arts and and English literature its fairly easy to recognize the artists intentions. The use of colors pink for the male member of the family and blue for the female duality depicts the dissonance between in and outside perspectives of religion an element which is repeated by the choice of indoor and outdoor paint of the house.The house itself is used as a metaphor of reflection of ones own belief the fragility of faithfulness and disbelief or innocence and guilty pleasures. It would fill a book if I were to explain the whole canvas from small details like her washing her hands or the number of snowflakes   but you also can read it all in OPs lengthly comments where he writes about his work and childhood which puts this particular work in a different light.  ,comics,dg7tvpj,98,t5_2qh0s

11744825,0,t1_dgq22s3,You linked my comment but you glean a different meaning. I never said because they didnt get a STEM they fail or that these are bad people or idiots. I was referring to those that did not want to learn a concept properly or exactly as intended would often be found in easier majors where you dont have to master everything and fully understand foundational concepts.I for example am bad at english and writing concepts since reddit has a hard time understanding me its  my problem and my weak area. However I dont have trouble with engineering and problem solving. Manymoonsago was able to better explain what I meant. I was replying to the previous Freight train on it gets only as far as you make it explaining that many of those who wouldnt have made it anyway but are in university will balk at the work required to pass chemisty and biology math and will end up changing their dream of being a Doctor or engineer to something that actually interests them more while they are fully capable of completing these courses and may even be a better doctor than some person with more academic logic talent.People can be whatever they want but expecting the same results from a  year paper writing course that has no clear role in an economy vs. a  year medical or applied technology course plus internshipresidence isnt reasonable. If the BA has a demand once out then its not a waste of time. I just want people to not fuck themselves into debt for worthless paper.,comics,dgrb0ju,1,t5_2qh0s
