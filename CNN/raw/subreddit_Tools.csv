273137,0,t3_1tccn0,Having bought lots of old tools over the years I found what works best for me is to just polish them up with a wire wheel in the bench grinder and then coat with a light oil to prevent new rust.  Williams was a great brand and they are still in business today although made overseas now.  I bought a new set of Williams impact sockets as a backup set for work last year and they seem like they are still good tools despite the Taiwan label.   If you have a need for fractional tools older brands like Proto Williams and Challenger are top quality and can be bought very cheaply at flea markets and garage sales.,Tools,cf92ln8,1,t5_2r8ec

The power drill you show has a hand chuck meaning it can be tightened and loosened by hand with no need for a key older drill needed a chuck key to tighten and loosen drills into the chuck. The bit you show goes into the chuck the hexagonal male bit goes into the drill chuck like any drill bit would and simply gets tightened in there. Lots of sockets screwdriver bits etc. have these hexagonal shafts on them as it offers greater grip to the drill chuck.

2303351,0,t3_2laowr,I just replaced my Craftsman C lithium ion drill with a Milwaukee M. The only reason I replaced the craftsman was because of a fire. Ive dropped the c off a ft ladder and it still worked. Ill say it was a great drill especially for the price I paid. The more Ive read and learned especially since subscribing to rtools is that there are great alternatives to tools youve basically lived in a bubble with  is that you can take your budget and get the most for your buck with a lot of Internet searching as well as first hand reviews. Those combined have gotten me in the right direction for other tools. Dont be afraid to take advantage of store return policies and bring something back in those two weeks or so if it is not performing up to snuff.  That is some of the best advice I can give. That is of course for the short term and the long term quality will be your researched reviews and first hand recommendations. The reason I went with Milwaukee this time was because my cordless drilldriver is one of the tools I may actually reach for on a day to day basis and I want it to last and perform well when necessary. Ive so far loved it and would definitely recommend it. If you are using your drill like youve described and are looking for something a bit more affordable I would definitely recommend the craftsman. The  years Ive had it have had days of drilling in lag screws and decks screws as well as drilling through some sheet metal. The only thing that ever stopped it was the battery dying. These werent daily activities but when I needed to it handle it. ,Tools,clwesrn,1,t5_2r8ec

6069302,0,t1_cyeep6m,Ive been noticing the prices fly all over the place with the bit sets  been trying to gauge what a decent price is for a bit set. With regards to quality is there any way to identify good quality screwdriver bits? Thus far Ive only seen basically hardened steel and black oxide but theres nothing else to really identify quality. I figure just getting from a reputable brand? If its the same bits in a bit set vs buying individually though it makes more sense to buy a set. With regards to drill bits Ive been on the fence about whether a set of black oxide would be sufficient or if I should just opt for titanium coated now with the idea that I wont need to buy another set for a number of years. As you said Im looking to avoid mediocre quality and opt for better quality since Ill most likely need a good quality one at one point or another.Thats a really good idea about the screws though. I have a small precision screwdriver kit for electronics which will most likely suffice for anything specialty I need but once again its just the idea that if the single bits are the same quality as the bit sets may as well get a bit set? Maybe my logic if flawed there lol.Allen keys I do have a set of  their quality is hard to say though. Looks like a no name brand set. I think I may end up just buying a new set though with the spherical head as you recommended. I havent seen those before but it makes sense.For saws I dont have one yet.

If youre buying a full size V drill with hammer function it probably works but you can get by without it. None of them are going to hold a candle to a full rotary SDSPlusMax drill but for small anchors and tapcons an SDS is usually too big. I drilled  holes recently into a block wall using my ASCMQX and it made short work of it. Thats a big beefy drill though with no hammer function. If I had tried to do it with my compact Bosch V drill Id probably still be doing it. However buying a big full size cordless drill means you cant get it into tight spaces. You may not be able to get by just buying one tool for every situation. For working between studs a right angle drill is better than a compact drill because you still wont be able to get into every space. A light compact drill is better for working over head but wont have the guts to drive large spade bits or holesaws. Theres a reason a lot of people have multiple drills rather than trying to buy one tool that does everything. Ive got the ASCMQX a Bosch Compact V Drill Milwaukee M  Drill an old BampD Corded beast drill a Milwaukee M Right Angle drill and a Bosch Bulldog SDS Plus. Theyve all got their strengths and weaknesses. I think youd be best off just identifying what the critical functions you need right now are and getting the best drill for that. Then watch for deals  sales  garage sale and pawn shops for drills that expand your capability. If you go grab a full size M Fuel drill with hammer and go to use it and find that you cant make the angle work for your hole because of the length of the drill its gonna suck. Also dont go buy a Fein ASCMQX for doing a bunch of overhead work. Though you could skip arms day if you do.,Tools,cyfpvgs,1,t5_2r8ec

People that arent afraid to buy a few tools and parts in order to save themselves higher repair costs.  For example we have large plumbing electrical builders hardware and fasteners sections because these are the products we sell while our housewares and kitchen areas are smaller.  Anyway I feel that we come in right in the middle for tool brandqualityprice.  We arent selling Wiha or Knipex I wish they were more readily available to us without having to negotiate direct with the MFG but we do have known and trusted brands DeWalt Milwaukee Channelock etc that are priced right.  Its not just a matter of having the brands though its about having the right depth within a product line.  Stocking a Milwaukee recip saw is great but the amount of people coming in asking for Hackzalls and M tools says it all.  We need to stock relevant tools and right now it seems that the DeWalt MAX lines and Milwaukees M series are what people ask for.  Ive literally never had a customer say Id really love a Craftsman circular saw or Show me some house brand pliers.  This is why my gut was telling me to bring in those lines for power tools and then make a shift from the housebrand and Craftsman pliers over to Channel lock and Irwin.  I dont want to make this sound like our stores merch mix is crap its really not and this deals with the tool department only which is for the most part doing very well.  Its just these few product lines within the department that need a revamp power tools pliers saw bladesdrill bitsdrive bits.

You can get sockets deep enough but theyre not really useful for anything else Im sure the auto guys will disagree with me on this but I hate working on cars and youll not like searching for them.  Passthru sockets work but you may not have any room to turn the ratchet.My go to tool on these sorts of things is  channel locks.  You might have to be at a pretty steep angle to the plane of the nut to turn the wrench but if you can move it you win.Another really useful tool for these sorts of jobs is a basin wrench.  Cheap tool  thats mostly used for faucet work.  Its not the most convenient tool in the world but when you need it you really need it and everything will get magically easier.  If Channel Locks dont work you need a basin wrench.If you still have a chance to choose the new faucet some have a design where theres a washer and then a threaded ring with screw holes.  You shove the washer on then the threaded ring.  Run them up til they hit the cabinet.  They dont need to be tight at all.  Then you tighten the screws to seat the washer securely against the cabinet.This is the easiest design for install and removal and I wish all faucets would use this design.

8923642,0,t3_52hymi,Ive considered this too.  Some of the issues to think about Wood lathes are enough cheaper that you could own both for not that much more than owning just a metal lathe...although shop space is an issue. If you are interested in making bowls and such you probably want a big wood lathe.  If your metal lathe needs can be met with a smaller size it might be cheaper to buy a big wood lathe and a small metal lathe than a big wood lathe. Once you own an expensive precision metal lathe getting wood dust all over it doesnt make a lot of sense when you could buy a wood lathe the same size for a lot less money and thus protect your investment.  Wood sounds nice and soft compared to metal but the dust from a lathe can be really fine and so it is more problematic than metal chips.If you have clear requirements for size for wood and for metal you can then compare costs but the point of getting something like that is to be able to do a wide range of things.  So for me anyway its hard to know what makes the most sense.  Id be interested to hear whether anyone owns a metal lathe that they use for occasional wood turning.,Tools,d7khogk,2,t5_2r8ec

When after a few years I started asking about his pocket knife a nice vintagelooking thing he still owns he wasted no time and gave it to me for an inspection after a very brief lecture. We slashed some paper cut a lemon in half and then I asked how dangerous it is for me. He told me he could show me if I trusted him and of course I said yes because I did and still do and which  yo boy wouldnt want to do dangerous stuff with his dad. He proceeded to just pinch the tip of my thumb with the blade and man was that thing sharp! I remember waitinf for the pain but there was none that small was the cut but the ease with which the knofe drew bloodm gave me a very valuable lesson that I still keep in mind.

The problem on mine was that the silver metal ball that depresses and opens the air ways when the trigger is pulled was pushed down into the first coil of return spring. So it never closer and the trigger was inoperable. Drained the compressor and was a constant woosh. Took the tool apart and found the metal ball pushed into the spring. Noticed that the spring was very slightly conical. So I flipped it around with the smaller end at the silver ball and put it back together. Worked wonderfully.

Sure the power tool will speed up your production per hour but it doesnt really sound like thats your major concern right now.Personally I wouldnt buy Kobalt cordless tools. I know theyre making a hard play and maybe someday that will be proven out but right now it seems like theyre priced high enough that you could get in to Milwaukee for not much more and Ridgid for less.If you continue with semiserious mechanic work youll want a compressor and pneumatic tools eventually. Cordless tools are just an expensive stopgap. Id stick with hand tools until you get a compressor. If you really want to get a power tool get a corded impact wrench.
