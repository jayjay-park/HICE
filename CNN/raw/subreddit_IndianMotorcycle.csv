I am wondering if there is an adjustment I can do to the bike but I couldnt see any. With a healthy dose of icey hot on my thumb I can barely move it after riding intermittently throughout the day but all day. Like when you pop your knuckles it hurts like a motherfucker to bend my thumb.  ,IndianMotorcycle,d4uiiz2,1,t5_2wf1i

Other than that everything I have is factory accessories  windscreen passenger seat driver and passenger backrest saddlebags.  That exhaust does look like its gonna be loud.  ,IndianMotorcycle,d5z7mk5,1,t5_2wf1i
