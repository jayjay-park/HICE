The only team I liked was M because of their crazy dives and counterjungling and Darien yoloing made the games a lot of fun.ampnbspAnyway so I tune into LCS randomly sometime during Cs game. Dont really care who they are and shit but the game seems interesting Ashe Zyra botlane Meteos on Zac Balls on Rumble Hai on Khazix or Zed dont remember. And C was behind in gold by like k. And then a MASSIVE teamfight happens and C wrecks the enemy team completely around the purple side wraiths after baiting baron. ampnbspAfter that phenomenal teamfight one sentence from TSM Jatt back then made me a fan of C. Just one sentence. Even if Cloud are behind they play like they are ahead. That kind of solid mentality with the amazing teamfight coordination that I saw from them made me love them so much. And eventually I learn more about their personalities and attitudes and I end up loving them even more.ampnbspRegardless of roster swaps I hope C can retain their identity of being the amazing teamfight team that I have sort of come to expect from them.,Cloud9,cw7r1x4,2,t5_2udw5

No one on the team can really think for themselves besides Sean but him having to direct everyone on his team hurts his ability to read especially if he has to frag more. Just stupid plays all around the entire tournament not checking corners pushes with no nades stubborn T side plays etc. Something needs to change whether it be practice methods the coaching situation or the roster itself.

After he was fired Thorin produced maybe  negative videos about the CLG org. Monte then moved onto co owning renegades. The reason he became a co owner was the original owner was accused of poaching players by c and tsm. Both try at all angles to discredit both c and TSM. No shit C doesnt compare to Korean teams....no NA team ever has. Both are toxic both should always be ignored because honestly....they are haters.

8234404,0,t1_d55xnzx,Impact was level  so he had to have skilled either Q or W both of which can cancel TP if you look closely at Maokais mana bar right before the TP you can see he uses two abilities in quick succession probably to push the wave with E and Q that means he cant cancel the TP because Q is on cooldown.People here just blaming Meteos for no reason instead of Impact the only blame you could put on Meteos here is that he didnt communicate in simpler terms I guess and more directly but really that play happened all because Impact used Q on creeps when he knew Meteos was ganking top. Maybe his english is worse than I thought and he really needs to work on it.,Cloud9,d56utsg,0,t5_2udw5

For C to not be in regional quals two teams that did not make playoffs in the spring would have to make the round of four and CLG would have to not make playoffs.In your stated situation with NRG and TL making top  C would still have enough points to be in regional quals.  In that situation the teams in playoffs are exactly the same as the spring split.

Both were great coaches with great drafts this split and its up for discussion which one deserved it more but I dont think that its as big of a deal as people are making it. TSM played like a bunch of soloq players before Parth stepped in last split too. I dont understand why everyone thinks that voting for the useless award has been awful. They literally gathered opinions from a bunch of different teams and sources thats how awards work. Idk my comment is all over the place I just think theres alot to talk about.Parth is a good coach taking that away from him is disrespectful.

9254196,0,t3_56uosn,Few comments I thought I would make since Ive been doing analysis on SSG and C recently partly because of my love for C and partly because SSG was the most dominant team in the second week of worlds...and as an analyst and coach it helps to mimic and study the best teamsgt Against Viktor in mid lane for sure the best answer at the moment is LuxSyndra.  Syndra has a fantastic laning phase against Viktor amp Jensen plays her very well.  SSG has banned Syndra in every game they have picked Viktor so it should be an easy one to spot out Ban Viktor on Blue Side always ban it on Red side only if SSG bans Syndra.  gt The composition would become perfect if Sneaky caught Jhin and Meteos Skarner so c would fight pickoffs and farNot quite tracking the logic here...perhaps I missed something.  I would say that Jhin is a highly contested pick between Sneaky and Ruler but Skarner has really only been a pocket pick for Ambition.  I think a Lee Sin would be better for dealing with the Viktor given the early pressure and similar pick potential though Im not familiar with the interaction between Viktors R and Lee Sins R.  gt first pick would have to innovate again!Not necessarily Cloud  match up OK against SSG...if they play up to their potential.  I think you put the priority first pick on some kind of contested pick Syndra Ryze Kennen if SSG change their priority to KennengtRumble etc.  I dont think they need to innovate they just needed to pick smart and play their game.  gt The idea would be following the  and  pick the c ensure Shen and Nocturne What ??????? Yes these two together even more where to take the first tower is essential Hmm.  I mean I dont mind those picks together BUT!  I think putting Meteos on someone who cannot affect mid lane early is a bad idea.  So much of this match is going to be focused on the mid lane laning phase...Nocturne just cant keep up with someone like a Nidalee Elise Lee Sin etc. for the early pressure on mid.  Would be kind of risky.  gt Jensen would have to get a pick PLEASE SOL safe to pull quickly and help you if Ambition try to hinder it. Ryze  if youre thinking this way.  However as you said earlier in this Nocturne and Shen can influence where the turret take happens...so take it mid.  You need to pressure Crown out.  In a comp like this it would be better to put pressure on the mid lane amp have Jensen on someone who can dominate lane.Just some things I differ in opinion on.  I like your thoughts though.  The biggest thing is to keep positive and stay supportive.  If they can keep their mental game in check it will go a long way towards making it to semis.  ,Cloud9,d8p1b0x,1,t5_2udw5

Deft used to play solo queue until  or  am Heart used to play up to  hours. That is how you become good. You decidate your time into playing until you improve. And streaming limits your ability to improve because you have sub alerts you have donations popping up you want to entertain your stream you want to interact with your chat. So you play a lot worse. And if you are a pro player your goal is to win. It could be winning Worlds but thas pretty hard. But winning LCS isnt that hard winning the smaller IEMs isnt that hard.

10726274,0,t1_ddlmkl3,No way a top laner runs ignite in competitive though. Thats kinda just asking to lose. This isnt solo queue where you can just roll over top and snowball. Sure it could happen unlikely someone lets you do this incomptetive but in order to accomplish this you give up splitpushing when baron is up. Usually top laners split bot when baron is in play and tp in when the team needs them. With ignite top no one gets to farm bot when baron is up without losing baron or the fight around it resulting in the team receiving less gold than normal. I can go on and on but the point it ignite renekton top is a solo queue pick and should stay there.

10863280,0,t1_de04n1r,Hmm not sure about the private life but they call each other by their in game name more often on stream on twitter etc.And yeah they are awesome D Best friendship in LOL.,Cloud9,de0gycb,2,t5_2udw5
10919940,0,t1_de69wua,Well be keeping it alive for the foreseable future! In more news were looking to generate a website with the help of the TSM podcast and each share content on there. Still in the works I dont paid enough to fund everything. But thats the goal. Thanks for the feedback!,Cloud9,de6bcrb,1,t5_2udw5
10923665,0,t3_5vxnbs,Ever since that interview after summer finals i trust every thing he says,Cloud9,de6p7j1,3,t5_2udw5
11032406,0,t3_5xjdzv,Game  was exactly what they have been missing this season! They need to watch that game and remember what they did. Side note Froggen is such cheese thank god we didnt have to put up with the anivia stalling tactics...,Cloud9,deihxx5,2,t5_2udw5
11036246,0,t1_deiwexh,I mean c had a relatively solid series vs. fox who looked not so hot today and TSM looked super tight against CLG. Maybe after tomorrow we can speculate more but I think its hard to argue that TSM isnt clearly in better form currently.,Cloud9,deixtcj,1,t5_2udw5
11036662,0,t1_deiw29c,Froggen is not nearly as good as he used to be Jensen would have creamed on him if the v happened lmao ,Cloud9,deiziic,12,t5_2udw5
11055191,0,t3_5xubw3,I respect that youre doing this every week and Im not attempting to stop you but your analysis feels a bit too shallow for me. Youre generalizing a lot of points and focusing on individual mistakes. Its obvious Sneaky shouldnt have stood in that shockwave.It needs more context.,Cloud9,del35i3,7,t5_2udw5
11063284,0,t3_5xrot3,Im sorry to remove this but the post wasnt directly related to c so I had to do it.,Cloud9,dem075w,1,t5_2udw5
11172250,0,t1_deuwne3,Dardoch is a shotcaller and can snowball a game pretty hard.,Cloud9,deyd1ya,0,t5_2udw5
11221230,0,t3_60393g,Clown at their finest. this team is a joke honestly.,Cloud9,df3wut6,0,t5_2udw5
11234352,0,t1_df59kx5,C has actually performed at Worlds more consistently than any other NA team and implying they dont try is just stupid.Reapered gives them free time and Sneaky is a fucking hermit of course hes just gonna stream.  Also have you seen Bjergsens twitter?,Cloud9,df5ecqv,9,t5_2udw5
11247725,0,t1_df6510y,Very true. Hard to find someone who can keep them off tower with wave clear. I just think Ezreal though hes able to get through lane phase relatively unscathed is a rough pick into caitlulu for that reason. What Varus brought though now hes been nerfed was that wave clear,Cloud9,df6wvjf,1,t5_2udw5
11278608,0,t1_df8oyd6,Try being a Lakers fan and seeing this lol,Cloud9,dfaewn8,2,t5_2udw5
11305541,0,t1_dfdem9k,I would say better we looked a lot better in the team fights whereas last week even in team fights that we won we looked quite shit. I aint saying we are  again we are gonna win worlds but it looked better then last week only  game though ,Cloud9,dfdgsh7,1,t5_2udw5
11308500,0,t3_61dfmu,Hes having some rough times. Luckily the playoff patch has the Gnar buffs so hopefully he can whip out his classic Gnar domination soon. ,Cloud9,dfdsuxh,4,t5_2udw5
11361209,0,t1_dfjpjrt,I kind of agree. For the amount of time they spent in the LCS theyve never accomplished anything. Theyve been a meme for the longest time now.,Cloud9,dfjrste,7,t5_2udw5
11370883,0,t3_629th9,I think Akkaadian deserves it personally. I would have Contractz as second ,Cloud9,dfkv9l4,1,t5_2udw5

11508236,0,t1_dg0ap9c,yea Contractz being nd is reaching. Love the guy but he just aint there honestly,Cloud9,dg0gkjw,4,t5_2udw5
11638520,0,t3_661vz3,I think itll be even in top and mid. C should win bot imo and jungle is a toss up depending on how Contractz plays. I dont think itll be a  for either side but I think theyre close enough where itll just be whoever plays best that day,Cloud9,dgf8mm1,2,t5_2udw5
11653749,0,t1_dggjihx,While true I dont think any team drafts a Maokai expecting it to out perform Syndra. If Maokai gets snowballed its awesome and the games nearly over but you dont go in expecting that.,Cloud9,dggytiv,1,t5_2udw5
11682271,0,t3_66mzm1,Pretty sure MVP is going to be Hauntzer.  Scarra accidentally leaked it on PLT one week.,Cloud9,dgk7af9,5,t5_2udw5
