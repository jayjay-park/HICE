2794165,0,t1_cnktf0v,I agree with what youve said except that I dont hope Litecoin sticks around. So far I have only seen negative things come out of it Litecoiners spamming us and spreading FUD eg Scrypt is superior it will take over! typical altcoin narrative newcomers thinking there are too many coins and I dont know which one I should invest in and giving up or saying The  million limit is a lie anyone can create a new altcoin.,BetterBitcoin,cnlopkn,1,t5_31vhn

The protocol allows for something on the order of  hours of clock skew before the client start calling shenanigans.So whoever found block  needs to wind their clock spring a little tighter.,BetterBitcoin,cofmepy,1,t5_31vhn
