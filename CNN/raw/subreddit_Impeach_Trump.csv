I simply would say that if trump violates the law the indepent! state prosecutor would have the obligation to prosecute. I would expect that the Constitution would force Trump to resign if found guilty.Thanks for explaining!Edit My opinion on TrumpI have followed the US elections from the other side of the ocean. Trumps knows how to mobilize angry people. People wantneed change without taking the costs or consequences in consideration. His weapon is pupulism which is a matter of skills and not integrity or knowlegde. I mean he is so good at it it made him President of the U.S.! Other populists did this trick before. With success.Trump is a bully and I still dont get it that he is democratically chosen by the Americans. He is a very dangerous man who is causing a lot of damage already. I really hope an impeachement will be possible soon and he will not serve his time the full  years.The Trump effect will effect Europe as well. We have upcoming populism in several countries and Trumps succes gives these movements an extra boost.Russia now sees oppertunities to divide the NATO.  Thats one of the biggest fears of Europe. If that happens the far away war in the Middle East even for Europe will spread out to EasternEurope.    ,Impeach_Trump,dcdgmcw,1,t5_3hkeq

Putin is not our friend and any logical conservatives agree.

If you dont have an understanding of at least a survey of the worlds  important works of literature you would miss entirely  the connotation i am attempting to invoke.I suppose one could google it  but they  still wouldnt know the origin  of any of the thousands of other references I might make that used to be expected  to be understood by educated people   and you certainly wouldnt be likely to be enhancing your own communication of subtle concepts with such things if you reject literature. I encounter this type of cultural illiteracy daily  it is depressing to think thow much we have fallen.  Otherwise intelligent people have very little sense of history or curiosity about the paths western culture has traversed to get where we are at  largely because it has become acceptable to reject the liberal arts curriculum of Great Books  really most books even.   It used to expected of pretty much anybody who wished to be considered educated.  Now i often meet people who regard themselves as intelligent that are proud that they dont read these or for that matter  any books at all.For myself  i find it so dissapointing   to have a conversation about racism with someone who has not read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn The Invisible Man and the Autobiography of Malcom X.    Those three books made me think more about the black experience in America than anything else and gave me context to understand events happening around me that could otherwise relate to.  None of them is difficult  they address universal themes and have been recognised as being important to a nuanced understanding of a complex and painful road we have travelled to get where we are today.Powerful literature.  Yet I doubt that  out  people I interact with in normal life could recall more than one of them.  Because somewhere along the line reading became devalued.,Impeach_Trump,de0lkbh,0,t5_3hkeq

Made the doughnut hole smaller. IE People that couldnt afford insurance prior to the ACA were able to get insurance with subsidies if their State chose to support them. Removed preexisting conditions. IMO the biggest benefit You cant be denied insurance.  Children can stay on their parents plan until they are . Capped the amount companies can profit off policyholders. They must spend  of premium dollars on health costs.You really should read the Wiki for more information  Anytime anyone says something negative about ObamacareACA you need to check their medical history. If they have been to the doctor for anything major during their lifetime they should be completely supportive of the ACA.

On the face of it I could get on board but Im not happy with the way he is carrying out either of these objectives.   I am not anti immigration!  I am absolutely not anti Muslim!  I had many professors who were from the Middle East.  Most are amazing contributions to our society.  But we need to have tight restrictions and all immigrants need to be legal tax paying partners in society. I cant think of a single thing I can personally support in a Trump administration.  Would have much rather seen Hillary which is why I voted for her.  Oh yeah well that and fear Trump is crazy.,Impeach_Trump,dexe6mc,7,t5_3hkeq
11170482,0,t1_dey5fcw,You cant just ignore the amount of disabled people just because its inconvenient there are so many. Its still a problem that has to be solved. Telling them to pull up their bootstraps and work when they are literally unable to is a very ugly attitude to have towards other human beings who are the most vulnerable in society.  Why not just have universal basic income? That way everyone gets paid enough to live and survive disability or not and its significantly cheaper than any traditional welfare system. If you want to be fiscally conservative and save money while also solving the homeless problem and helping victims of disabilities and being a decent empathetic human being do that instead of keeping an expensive bureaucratic mess of a traditional welfare system that keeps on having its money being taken away.  Either way stop attacking victims of disability. Your attitude towards it from what youve said is entirely anecdotal. You cant base important political decisions in I know a few guys who are disabled but could still probably work.  Disability is a curse. Attacking people who suffer from them and calling them lazy if nobody gives them a job because of the disability or if they physically or mentally simply cannot work is another curse layered on top,Impeach_Trump,dey5uo0,1,t5_3hkeq

11181085,0,t1_deyle3l,I mean he is friends with the guy. Was accused of raping a  year old at one of epsteins parties. We know for a fact that he has taken epsteins private plane to his island which was then found out to be an underage sex trafficking ring. Trump himself has been quoted saying some pretty incriminating things about epstein knowing what we know now. Including how epstein likes to party with young girls. Wouldnt exactly call them unconnected. The main thing is there is more evidence for trump being part of an epstein pedophile ring than there is for Hillary Clinton running one out of a pizza shop. ,Impeach_Trump,dezd3d5,5,t5_3hkeq
