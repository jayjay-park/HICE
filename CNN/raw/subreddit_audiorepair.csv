1233264,0,t3_2864gt,Depending on how many electrolytics are in the circuit it sometimes makes sense to just replace them automatically while the device is apart anyway so there will be no doubt over whether the power supply of the circuit will be reliable. This would be even more important if the device is being used in a way where it would be extra bad if it failed say a musician who is going to take it on the road for a long tour. Compared to labor amp downtime electrolytics might be really cheap for piece of mind.But this approach doesnt work if someone brings in something they are using at home where it serves no critical function and says fix this as cheap as you can. How many  devices are cheaper to throw away amp replace than to service?,audiorepair,ci8cxzc,1,t5_2yn23
1523475,0,t3_2bablm,I can confirm that the output coupling caps have ruptured vents. Replace them before proceeding with additional tests. You should replace ALL of the electrolytics....no electro this old is going to be good for long not even the mighty Elna. Howling is oscillation and probably related to capacitor failure in the small signal circuits or the feedback path. If it goes open loop due to a loss of feedback the gain and the noise will go sky high. The more gain the more likely oscillation is to occur. The oscillation can have ultrasonic components that can damage tweeters and overheat the amplifiers output transistors. This may or may not be damped by the phase splitting transformers in this design.Electric shock....test for leakage between chassis and line. It should be floating. Replace ALL caps between line and chassis for continued life safety. Use X rated AC caps across line and neutral and Y types for line to groundchassis. ,audiorepair,cj78tfs,2,t5_2yn23

1987969,0,t1_cksc50i,Yes ive tried different devices in the same and other inputs and they work fine i tested the turn table in different inputs and the problem followed that is when i decided to open it up and check the contact points to where the cables were soldered,audiorepair,cksr1nu,1,t5_2yn23
2209862,0,t3_2kequ3,If I can add my two cents Ive heard dozens and dozens of mid to high end speakers both new and old and I continue to come back to the Walsh s. They have an awesome spatial quality about them that lend themselves well to acousic music especially.  Very enjoyable to listen to and have a good aesthetic to boot. ,audiorepair,clkq74k,1,t5_2yn23

3952242,0,t1_cr60ei0,Yeah usually its pretty straightforward to position the cone. I like to test it out before applying glue figure out roughly which direction it needs to be pushed to eliminate rub the spider somewhat centers the cone but not accurately enough and on speakers that have sat with no foam the weight of the cone makes it sit out of alignment and the spider holds that position. Lightly mark the direction the cone needs to be pushed then when the glue is ready I can quickly position the cone while using the tone generator and also pushing gently by hand. Make sure to doublecheck for rub once the foam is clamped down sometimes in clamping it gets pushed a bit.,audiorepair,cr6sfdj,1,t5_2yn23
4224871,0,t3_39afv1,I am not an expert on chemistry but accelerated corrosion as you describe is possibly due to the difference in metals forming a type of battery and reacting with each other.  I would recommend as a nonpermanent fix to replace with your noncopper wire that you have available but give it a good helping of Oxguard  This is a pretty standard and cheap compound used by electricians to prevent this sort of thing.Edit I didnt answer your romex question because I dont know enough about automotive electrical systems to make a recommendation one way or the other sorry.,audiorepair,cs1tahc,2,t5_2yn23
4694342,0,t3_3f83bw,That was the protection relay. It disconnects the speaker output under two conditions A capacitor charges when its turned on to provide a delay connecting the speakers so you dont hear loud pops or other scary stuff while the amp squares itself away in the first few seconds. During operation the DC level on the output is monitored. When it thinks DC is present it pulls charge from the aforementioned capacitor and if its a long enough DC transient or fault condition the relay opens to protect the speakers. DC would turn a perfectly good speaker into a heating coil and gleefully melt them if the amp say had a shorted output transistor and was dumping a full power rail into a speaker.The first step is to check the output for DC under normal operation. Disconnect the input and output and wire a voltmeter to the speaker outputs. With no signal input you should get no more than mV output. Odds are youll get less than mV. If its varying wildly make sure youve got the speaker selector set up right and no signals plugged in. Odds are youll pass this test otherwise your unit wouldnt have resumed normal operation.Next Id suspect that capacitor. Folks usually replace the big caps in an amp and ignore the little stuff which is just fine most times as the little stuff cant really cause the same level of damage. Hifiengine has the service manual. C is the most likely culprit but if youre going to be in there you may as well replace C and C. Sometimes its a leaky transistor instead of the caps but thats much less commonly an intermittent problem. The caps respond to temperature humidity and all sorts of other things and have the lowest MTBF so they tend to be behind occasional burps in the protection circuit.In short no worries. Its just a bit overcautious in its middle age.,audiorepair,ctm9gwq,2,t5_2yn23

5322263,0,t3_3nua90,gtBonus question big fan of the blue backlighting on older Sansui and Marantz units. Since were replacing anyway could I possibly put some blue lights in? That would really scratch an itch for me.The other two posters have done a great job addressing your other questions so Ill tackle this one.Many old stereos with blue or green lighting use light bulb covers or boots in order to change the color of the light. They look like this and provided you bought the right size should just slip onto the bulb. Your best bet for buying them is either an autoparts store or on eBay.,audiorepair,cvrzbyx,2,t5_2yn23
5380331,0,t3_3onoa5,Cold or rotten solder joint gets my vote. Redo solder joints around parts that dissipate heat first. I think capacitor issues would likely show up as Hz hum and harmonics.Oh and pics plz!,audiorepair,cvzebz7,2,t5_2yn23

10261584,0,t1_dc519b4,So left speaker works right speaker just makes noise.  This is across all inputs aux FM AM.  This is in stereo what about mono?  Have you swapped the speakers to ensure its a problem with the receiver?,audiorepair,dc77fyo,1,t5_2yn23
10373862,0,t3_5oi1zr,Did you measure the individual speakers ?You may have blown midhigh frequency speakers tweeters.If you push an amplifier to higher volume than he is designed for this will create distortion. This distortion is mostly in the higher frequencies. Normally most of the power needed is in the bass area the distortion shifts that to the middlehigh frequencies. The speakers are designed for normal usage with a beefy bass speaker and much weaker midhigh speakers. When pushing the volume you increase the power to the speaker if pushing too far you also get too much high frequency energy overloading the high frequency speakers in the process.,audiorepair,dcjxu7h,2,t5_2yn23
