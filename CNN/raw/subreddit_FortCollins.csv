Im not really sure what youre looking for but I guess I have a few thoughts off the top of my head.The drought is arguably caused by climate change. Most libertarians believe that environmental protection is important primarily because it affects other people. Therefore a good start would be doing what we can to remediate our current climate crisis.Libertarian philosophy would argue that the water that falls on your land should belong to you and you can do whatever you want with it. So those areas which are getting enough water can keep it areas with too much water can collect and sell it and areas with too little can buy it from those who are willing to sell.,FortCollins,cjklwuw,-2,t5_2rrmq

Ive had patients of mine in similar situations go into the emergency department to have our doctors write them an rx but this is an unsustainable way to do it as ER docs wont typically write an rx for a long term med for more than a week or ten days in my experience. Are you saying your insurance doesnt cover doctors in Colorado and youre not sure how to get your meds? You may be able to call your former doctor and ask for another callin or see someone outofnetwork here. This doesnt sound like your problem thoughas far as doctors billing directly you can likely just call around to the offices accepting new patients and ask if theyll take selfpay. Your insurance could still help pay though if they accept it even if its out of network.

2029365,0,t3_2hw2a9,Ill just let you know of my experience. I have attended UCCS but am now graduating from CSU. I absolutely hated UCCS! I disliked how it was a commuter school. It was difficult to meet and hang out with people because no one was hanging out on campus and the surrounding areas did not have a college vibe to them. I ended up hanging out with my usual friend group that werent attending college which was detrimental to my education because I wasnt hanging out with likeminded people with the same goals. At CSU once you get past the kids that are just here to party and have fun the rest have the same goals of getting and education. The surrounding areas i.e. shops bars restaurants all feel very young. Granted housing is more expensive in Fort Collins than in CS but I have much preferred the school campus and town. ,FortCollins,ckxryf3,1,t5_2rrmq

3094802,0,t3_2vlqg5,Ive seen the two pictured vehicles stopping motorists with policestyle lights recently in Fort Collins.The vehicles have no markings whatsoever to indicate they are part of a legitimate law enforcement organization but they pull people over and appear to set up speed traps in town. Who knows if they are legit.This is troubling for two main reasons. First the main benefit of speed traps is that cars slow down when they see an obvious LEO presence. That improves safety. Unmarked vehicles destroy this benefit because no one is motivated to go slower by an innocuous looking car.Second there have actually been cases in Colorado of criminals posing as police in unmarked vehicles pulling over citizens and harming or killing them.For what benefit? Probably money going to the citycounty that doesnt improve safety.I cant tell what agencies these two vehicles belong to and that seems like a Bad Thing. Its like secret police. If you know anything about these trucks please post. Also please contact the city council and county to stop the dangerous and unproductive use of unmarked cars for traffic stops.Ive attached a map of where Ive seen the pictured vehicles.

4926315,0,t1_cufgs3j,Having your name removed from the records really doesnt do much and they still hunt you down oh yes hunt. At least in my case. Pull up a seat and Ill share my story of religious epiphany! I grew up in SLC with very active LDS members on my dads side of the family whom essentially raised me. So I grew up going to church starting with Primary. I moved to Vegas my sophomore year of HS and was baptized. I was the exemplary mormon girl  hosting YW get togethers at my house chaperoned game nights with the YM in our ward never missed seminary the whole shebang. Then I met my boyfriend who was Lutheran and now my husband. My family told me that if we were going to date then he needed to come to church with us. Being the Mormon brat that I was I turned around and told him that without even thinking twice. Im not going to hang out with you if you smoke do drugs drink swear... all of which he did. He quit everything right then and there and came to church and seminary with me without even one complaint. After a bit my family told me if youre going to continue dating then he needs to take the missionary lessons now. And I told him to do just that. He didnt say no. On Easter Sunday I had to meet with the bishop about our relationship. He told me Choose the church or choose him. You cant have both because he knew my boyfriend wasnt going to convert even after coming to church and seminary with me. Right then and there I made my choice. And it wasnt the church. I realized at that point how incredibly evil it was to try to force someone to join a religion. He wasnt joining because he believed in Joseph Smith or any of the church teachings. He was doing all of this because he loved me and wanted to be with me. It made me sick to my stomach to realize what I was doing in the name of conversion. That evening I called up my boyfriend and told him that we had to meet at a park because it was Easter Sunday and my family was hosting an afterchurch dinner inviting a good number of ward members. We met in a park and I told him what happened and that I chose him because I knew how much he loved me from all of the sacrifices he made. After a bit of talking he walked me back to my car opened the door and got down on his knee and proposed. I know youre still in school I dont have a ring and we dont have any money... Of course I said yes. We kept it on the DL until I graduated HS. Meanwhile I was making halfassed efforts at continuing going to church seminary etc. After I graduated I told my family. They took my car and everything that I owned outside of what would fit in a suitcase and disowned me. I went to live with my fiance and his family as we saved up enough money for our own apartment. Shortly after moving in with him the visiting teachers came knocking on my door to drag me back. It got so bad that my now FatherinLaw told them that I converted to their church. The missionaries came after that still not giving up. We moved to Oregon and wouldnt you know it theyre knocking on my door in a new state trying to convince me to come back. My family sure as hell didnt forward my address to them because they disowned me and even moved to a different state without telling me. So hell if I know how the church had my new address. We moved to Denver a few years later  same thing. We moved to midtown in Fort Collins a few years after that  more knocks. We moved to the SE side of town where the missionaries cornered me in my garage while unloading the groceries with my babies in their car seats trying to convince me to come back. It didnt matter if I said no it didnt matter if I reminded them of my bishop giving me a choice it didnt matter that I had already submitted my letter to remove my name from the records it didnt matter that I resorted to hiding behind the kitchen wall trying to be silent every time they knocked on my door. It was never as bad as it was after we moved to the SE side. Although I suspect it was that bad because one of our neighbors whom I never talked to seemed to be a mission president because we had missionaries coming and going often.  I was keeping a public record of how many times they continued to come to the house harassing me to come back. A friend saw how god damn ridiculous this was getting and talked to someone in the ward for me. They havent bothered me since probably because he told them my intentions of filing harassment charges. But that was  years of tracking me down in five different houses. That was after getting disowned by family for leaving the church. That was a cult. And my husband and I have been married for  years ever since. BEST DECISION I EVER MADE. ,FortCollins,cufi1hy,7,t5_2rrmq

I keep somewhat up to date on local construction goingson since Im sort of in the industry and I didnt see anything about delays  theyd been working on  to the south and into Loveland over the past year or so. The CDOT page for the project says the intown phase between Harmony and Mulberry started on July  I dont think theyd note that the project was delayed on that page but their plan was to begin that phase during this summer. Just seems like poor planning given the amount of stuff that happens in the middle of town during the summer. Im far from a scheduling expert and Im sure they had some other good reasons for this phasing schedule that Im not aware of but from a laypersons perspective it might have made more sense to take care of  between Harmony and Mulberry in late spring and then go on to resurface  near Carpenter. But it doesnt really matter I suppose since this phase will probably last more than a year with winter in there so whatever.

6465257,0,t1_czkfeoi,Technically speaking youre not wrong but network hops have little to do with the bandwidth an ISP can offer much less OPs question.For example my ISP gives me a MBps connection. When I go to speedtest.net the results reflect this more often than not. Why? Because my ISPs portion of the network path is capable of delivering those speeds in addition to having a capable transit to their upstream peer Level  and on to speedtest.nets servers. The same goes for Steam downloads and Microsoft updates the full path from me to them is capable of delivering my content at MBps at a minimum more often than not. More realistically these transits are operating at GBps or GBps or higher because its the upstream pipe for other subscribers like myself.Now these upstream paths can become congested for a variety of reasons as you said you could get routed over a latent path there could be loss on the lines or the remote server itself may not have an equivalent uplink on its end in which case youre of course restricted to the lowest bottleneck in the path to that resource which is more what you were getting at I think. But generally speaking if an ISP is actually capable of delivering a certain speed to your premise and have a good upstream peer you should expect that in terms of bandwidth performance for many online resources.Also more and more large content providers are colocating in regional ISP POPs which means things like Netflix are often completely onnetwork which can help alleviate upstream congestion to commonlyaccessed resources.,FortCollins,czo1wgg,1,t5_2rrmq

10054779,0,t1_dbgs0ea,Oh Shit Youre full on correct and Im glad you pointed out my mistake. The apartment complex I worked at in Ft. Collins is heinously in violation of The Fair Credit and Reporting Act and Im totally going to report them to the state. Management and the leasing officers were always telling potential residents that they went back  years federal and  years in state. Any criminal convictions of any kind would deny an applicants lease unless they paid a non refundable triple deposit agreed to a  year lease AND had a cosigner that could past the background check whose monthly income was at a minimum  times the monthly rent.  The property was in Ft. Collins but the organisation has properties in nearly every state. Im almost assured now that they misinformed potential residents of these matters to keep the properties more exclusive. Seriously glad you caught that and my apologies for my misinformation I was just basing my statement off of what the last property I worked at in Colorado made us memorize and repeat verbatim repeatedly through out orientation and training. ,FortCollins,dbi5ul2,1,t5_2rrmq

There are some websites you can use to gather photos posted with a hashtag.Heres a guide too for basically outfitting and recruiting a couple of guests with some skills and better equipment  But as others have pointed out youre getting what you pay for here for sure.Also think about what you really want photos of. If you just want the ceremony you could inquire about photographers who will just come out for an hour or two.

I bike to work walk my dog frequently in the dark AM and PM and walk alone late at night heading back from shows and bars. I assume transients are dangerous. I dont engage with them and keep my distance. I act the same way I did when I lived in Denver. Never had a problem there either. One transient has spoken to me once in over a year making a comment about my dog. I kept walking. After living here for over a year going out and about frequently I have never witnessed a dangerous or aggressive interaction with a transient or anyone else. Am I pro transient? Absolutely not. Am I antialarmist? Yes. Should the city do something about the growing number of transients? Yes. Do I think the city should regulate how much time a person can spend on a public bench? Absolutely not. Is it OK for someone to sleep on the sidewalk in front of a store? Absolutely not. Is that sleeping person going to stop me from going into the store? Lol...No. The fact that we have a growing number of transients is not a problem unique to Fort Collins and nothing that cant be improved.We need more common sense and less ugly loud aggression and panicking.

I dont hold it against anyone who sees this video and responds with fuck the police because it has and continues to be warranted.  And if police wholeheartedly wanted to solve the problem they could start by holding other members accountable and by having body cameras to increase the level of accountability and trust.
