6834758,0,t3_48u8eu,Quitting should be your main your priority. Before and after your runs drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. Your running schedule should be adjusted to meet your level i.e. currently  as you continue to smoke. Id suggest in the first couple of weeks you go x a day alternating between long slow runshelp build up your red blood cell count and shorter interval runs strengthen your capillaries. Ultimately you are wasting your time and will see no results of you continue to smoke. ,FrenchForeignLegion,d0r0s2s,2,t5_2vl4a

8038714,0,t1_d4jlwr0,The Djibouti baseDBLE got moved back to mainland France a few months back.  The REI Guyane base still exists but if you go there you stay there no deployments period.  Otherwise you will likely get deployed at least once or maybe twice in your  years probably somewhere like Tahiti or Ivory Coast. Also trust me being stuck on base in the states is better.  France gets old real fast and when youre a second class citizennot even lol with no rights it kinda sucks. ,FrenchForeignLegion,d4jmkoo,3,t5_2vl4a

8421760,0,t1_d5u9c7l,Well I hear the pay has gone down and there are less contracts since the threat from Somalia has gone down due to a massive security push with Special Forces and various nations navy ships and an improving governmental and security situation in Somalia itself. But there is a lot of work in Africa as well. It does depend on  your home country and primary language. I mostly know native English speakers from Anglophone nations like UK Australia Ireland and the US but also some from Northern and Western Europe. There is also work doing security in rich Arab nations like the UAE or Oman or Saudi and even Iran and contractor work in Afghanistan...or there was not sure how it is now...seems the guys I knew who were doing it all moved on to other things recently. ,FrenchForeignLegion,d5u9gan,1,t5_2vl4a
8528584,0,t1_d67lv4o,Haha well if you really want to get into it ageing leaves you prone to every fucking part of your body breaking down...but it depends on if you stay fit and eat well and exercise without overdoing it or brutalizing yourself with extreme sports. Lots of young guys feel invincible and CAN do all kinds of amazing things and push it to the limits with really damaging stuff and are crippled by their s and s. If you just stay fit and eat well and have fun without tearing yourself to shit you will be fine. As for the nd part thats just cultural bullshit. It depends on you if you want your life and love to be dictated by cultural norms and expectations. It also depends on the culture...Western nations are not as obsessed with that stuff any more generally speaking. Of course  of people are slaves to cultural norms...just depends if you are a free thinker or not. The only limit is if you want kids...otherwise...who fucking cares. You live your life no one else can live it for you...parents demand you marry and then they dont have to live with the consequences of a bad marriage or the wrong choice or marrying for just for what society thinks rather than love. I see it ALL the time where I live...society pressure is so high and kids rush to marry and then end up fucking miserable in a loveless marriage saddled with kids. ,FrenchForeignLegion,d67mxdf,2,t5_2vl4a

Keep training hard if you speak French fluently make sure you can say the Legion Code of Honor perfectly maybe even pick up a few of the chants.  Mostly make sure they have no reason to send you home this time. If you have fitness French and motivation then you are ahead of the pack. Good luck.,FrenchForeignLegion,dfutelv,5,t5_2vl4a
