5446126,0,t1_cw55hjj,Yes and Brave New World and  hit similar notes. I just read those three back to back to back Id read  before. It was quite a romp!IMHO We is by far the best of the three both from a storytelling perspective and as a glimpse into another world. I had never heard of it a year ago and now its in my top alltime novels.,SciFiRealism,cw7smp7,2,t5_393qx

8797465,0,t3_50j6c9,Thereve been a number of DYI projects and posts like this about adding app to a mirror. I may be reading too much  but why would you want that. People spend at most what a minute or two a day in front of a mirror? Even if you are applying makeup why would you want to be distracted by yet another screen?,SciFiRealism,d75c2uj,3,t5_393qx

10659514,0,t1_ddfczia,I was curious too.  Apparently its a bunch of solar panels at the top with some wind turbines in the middle.  It also appears to have been designed to let light through as well.  Its artistic but its anachronism with the location makes it look like something the Advent or the Combine would install.,SciFiRealism,ddfg4hl,4,t5_393qx
