Signs that have some of these features in common rhyme to people who are fluent in a signed language. So depending on how the real song was translated Im sure that some rhymes could be preserved by changing words without losing meaning.

I think it started with the second time yes this was the first he stormed the stage at an award show to complain about the winner. But the hate seems to transcend that. I think he just comes off as awfully arrogant but whenever I hear him talk in some real environment he just seems to overcompensate for an extreme level of perfectionism that leaves him constantly scared of not meeting his own standards. So almost a form of insecurity? Its weird. ,Frisson,csm2spz,16,t5_2smzw
4476674,0,t1_csuvy09,It is helpful to think of this song as intensely Christian.  Stevens sets up the story of Gacy happy and smiling on the outside but an actual brutal murder in secret.  Stevens then says he is the same.  As a sinner from birth as all people are we tend to look at Gacy as other because of his acts. If you look at your life you will find that you are hiding things from the world just like he did.  For Christians in the eyes of God we are all guilty of sin so Stevens dramatizing this point using an extreme example. ,Frisson,csuydes,13,t5_2smzw

Internet fans voted him into the AllStar game largely as a joke. The league didnt want him to play because the AllStar game makes them a lot of money and they thought it was embarrassing. When Scott refused to voluntarily withdraw from the game they traded him from Arizona to Montreal and Montreal immediately sent him down to the minors.It was unclear at first if he would still be allowed to play and there was a large uproar from fans over the leagues mishandling of the situation. They have in the end agreed to let him play but not before completely screwing the guy. The game is this Sunday.

8975368,0,t1_d7qfkee,The reason your position is controversial and the reason youll always have a difficult time finding people to agree with you in real life is because we have cured if not severely reduced other peoples depression. Weve used medicine therapy whatever and made it better for a lot of people. So you dont get to be the guy or girl who says Its different for me. Im special. This is worse. It will never go away. Its the same philosophy for not letting people get surgery at  that never lets them have kids. Youre not gonna be the same person in    years.  You dont know if you can beat this thing yet and thats a fact. Unless youre gonna die naturally of old age tomorrow then you dont know if it never goes away. You havent tried everything. You might feel exhausted and like you cant try anymore but that isnt the same as tried everything.Also and Ive been depressed so I know how this makes it worse at times but what have you done? Sure we have developed all these tools to help treat this disease but everyones unique and requires unique things to make them happy. If you told me your dream something that would make you feel worthwhile and warm was to own a boat and go fishing all the time whats stoping you from starting to work on that today? Fear probably. But fear doesnt get to stop you from anything. It gets to be there sure but it doesnt get to push down the brakes for you.I know all of this can sound like tough it out jargon but its what most people say because its fucking true and it works. Just try it out you have not a damn thing to lose. Youll have set backs and feel like a failure but if you keep trying every day youll make it. If you ignore the bad thoughts but dont feel bad for having them youll slowly get stronger every single day. Its like losing weight.

It has comedy drama action fantasy romance etc. Everything is balanced and becomes appealing to most people. Thats what makes it so perfect.Theres not a best anime ever just as theres no best movie ever. I can say that The Godfather is the best ever but other pople might say  a space Odyssey someone else says the Lord Of The Ring trilogy etc. Thats why people uses One of the best ever but then there cant be a lot of titles in the One of the best ever category because it would lose all its value.Also I think that new SNK OPM re zero etc anime isnt taken in account when talking about the best series because  reasons  It hasnt pass the time test how will it age. Will people still be talkimg about it years after it first aired? Hard to know... This one is a personal opinion but I think its relevant. New anime uses a lot of fan service to attract pople into it. Even SNK is just one giant visual fan service.,Frisson,dbpkfxg,7,t5_2smzw

10667758,0,t1_ddg5bo9,Its interesting that some people according to this american life ep  the border patrol guy there says people go to the local town walk over hope border patrol finds them say the key words like they are fleeing religious persecution irony or violence and that gets them scheduled for a hearing which would normally result in flimsy excuse people being deported.Problem is they have a hearing scheduled for six YEARS later and disappear into the country. Its really weird to be honest because this seems like an obvious target for the trump goals lets expedite the legal process to deport illegals that dont follow the rules rather than target people that have been vetted by a lengthy visagreencard process already and are playing by our rules to get in the country. Immigration built the country fresh blood builds any new system people are less disenfranchised people already know fresh in their mind how horrible it is to live amongst violence and instability. Growing up life long in the US it is easy to take everything we have for granted and what is better to bring you back to earth than your neighbor that just told you how he used to have bombs falling in his back yard and this is so much better. If anything refugees are the people that have rejected violence and instability rather than getting swept up in it they are the people you want in your country. ,Frisson,ddgaqxe,14,t5_2smzw
10668541,0,t1_ddgddmh,Like I said in a comment below Im mostly talking ideology rather than policy right now but of course there are hurdles. Things can only be loosened so far but from an ethical standpoint I feel like its the least we could do.As far as pragmatism goes yes youre right that some things are going to take a long time andor be very expensive but a good place to start in my opinion would be by increasing the total number of people that we allow into the country from other nations. Additionally Im sure that there are ways to streamline the process that neither you or I are aware of.Basically I dont think youre wrong but I dont think weve reached the point where altering the existing policy is impossible.,Frisson,ddgdnpk,-1,t5_2smzw

The strengthening of  faith in ones own character will only continue to allow you to persevere against upcoming odd that will try you.I walked away from a lot of opportunity once. To this day I still dont know if it was the right choice but it was the choice I felt I needed to make. However every time I now come up to a moral decision I have faith in myself that Ill make the correct choice.  I grew up poor. Every dollar I ever got or earned felt as essential to my life as water. Walking away from a lot of money was damn near physically painful and I agonized over the decision for awhile.
