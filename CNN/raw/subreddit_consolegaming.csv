3214105,0,t3_2wrxkr,PC gamer here. I dont hate you.Consoles are a vital part of the gaming ecosystem. If consoles did not exist someone would take middleground PC hardware for its high powertocost ratio mass produce a standardized compact configuration of said components to ease troubleshooting and development and lower manufacturing costs streamline the OS for gaming to make it suitable for the mass market and periodically release a new iteration when the old one falls far enough behind the current middleground tech for most of the target market to be willing to trade up. Sound familiar? Consoles are really just mass market gaming PCs. The mass market part is really important. It allows the gaming industry to be as big as it is and while the system in place isnt anywhere near perfect see below both PC and console gaming are overall better for it.In defense of PC gamers though I will leave this here.Whatever system you choose game on brethren!,consolegaming,cov5629,1,t5_2s91f

11475148,0,t1_dfwon6n,Yeah but they retained their overall legacy design.  Youre right though its waaaaay more comfortable than its predecessors.  I had a PS and after long FF VII sessions my hands were cramping up.  Its like they made the controllers for  yearolds back then.,consolegaming,dfwpc6c,1,t5_2s91f
