Start the windows installation again.. During setup remove all the partitions on the C. Let windows create the partitions for you automatically.

Id install an OS on it and use the Surface RT to RDP to it.If it were done right the intel box would be essentially a stand alone headless computer with a big assed battery pack.  It could be as portable as the Surface RT.I could use the Surface RT to remote desktop to the intel box via WiFi or using a null Ethernet cable or something.Youd get the advantage of all the good stuff the RT can do web browsing long battery life ultra portable etc.  When you needed to you could essentially use it as the monitor and keyboard for the intel box  which could be setup to be whatever sort of powerhouse you wanted.The intel box would still be a viable stand alone computer you could plug into your network when home and could be portable enough to take with you on the road.I was on the verge of setting this up but the Surface Pro  was announced and I ended up going that route.,Surface,cfbpsn5,1,t5_2u5h1

1168429,0,t3_27h1yx,I stopped by a Microsoft store after work as well and got to test a Surface . Full disclosure I am not a surface owner I want one but have used my friends Surface  enough to recognize differences. Things I noticed Definitely much lighter. Even though its bigger it felt more like a notepad than the . Track pad is much improved. The hard plastic is a welcome addition and it depresses with a satisfying click when pressed. Two finger scrolling also works reliably and I was able to reverse scrolling direction and disable the track pad entirely from the settings. However some clicks didnt register and I had a bit of trouble making small movements with the cursor. The pen felt great I did not experience any of the jagged lines reported earlier and marks felt fluid. Parallax between tip and screen is definitely improved but still present. Marks arent real time but close however I expect in more demanding applications like Photoshop input lag will be similar if not worse than the Surface  due to higher resolution.  Pressure curve of the pen did feel stiff in One Note but the maximum width of the line wasnt very wide either so its hard for me to make a fair comparison. Kickstand feels very sturdy actually takes a rather deliberate force to move.  Keyboard felt very good the little bit of extra space makes it feel more like a laptop keyboard.I tested the i gb unit.

I would like Amazon to update it so it can handle more columns when in landscape mode because I want more of the real estate to be utilized. For portrait mode youll get a lot of real estate vertically which may or may not be useful for you.I do use the Surface  for portrait mode when reading a newspaper pdf that comes out everyday and that is immensely useful. Newspaper formats are made for portrait mode and the Surface  has plenty of real estate for that. I use the pen to highlight anything in the newspaper pdf as I read.You can circle stuff with Reader a PDF app that comes with windows. But I use Drawboard app in portrait mode to have more options in the types of penshighlighters I can use while it auto saves for me as I write.Overall the general reading experience is excellent because of the high DPI display. Its clearly much better reading on the device for me than my iPad  which is not retina and is a much smaller screen size so I cant fit as much of the book on the screen.Hope that helps.

I really like the Wacom digitizer but I heard there was a new pen revision and new firmware that improved the pen on the Venue . Also I think Ill just get the power cover instead of a battery rig cheaper but less charge. This should bring the price down to about  narrowing the gap to just . Also I dont think I can live with just gb RAM as I am a tab hoarder in Chrome and Im running out of memory a lot on this old Latitude with gb. The speed difference is important to me as I consider myself a power user dont we all? It really seems like the better option here. Also your niece is very lucky.

1641478,0,t1_cjl6uyg,Remember the computer isnt that much faster when utilizing  of your ram to .This is correct. Having more RAM would let you have more room to have things working in the active runtime of a computer think of it having a bigger kitchen to operate appliances for food processing cutting board bowls and kitchen ranges etc. Obviously with some housesapartments the kitchen is smaller but that doesnt mean it one cannot prepare food it is that one has to be more selective of what is out.Something to decide if one is running multiple tabs of browsing to using Office or other programs at the same time. Also with AutoCAD it utilizes some of the RAM for iGPU usage too. Photoshop the bigger usage of RAM would come from multiple working images and large sizes and layers much like preparing one of those Epic Meal Time meals versus a dinner for two meal large kitchen versus a small kitchen countertop  this being the RAM.It would become an issue however if one were to address RAM larger than what typical consumers would really need or even on some workstation needs we are talking beyond GB of RAM. Access times and controller designs on a CPU northbridges of past before would dictate the hit or misses in memory addressing alongside of the OS allocation of memory typically in abstraction and control. Loading from disk SSD or conventional also plays into memory access hence with Windows OS development Prefetcher ReadyBoost and SuperFetch were created think of this as rummaging through a Matrix endless array of kitchen cabinets by using a human singularity Neo walking through each cabinet to look for various tools needed to cook to then take out onto an endless line of countertop.,Surface,cjm2msh,1,t5_2u5h1

2148316,0,t1_clcithm,The Cherry Trail Atom will be in a different class than the Core M I think.Im on roaming data ATM so I cant do research on exact TDPs and prices so feel free to lookup and confirm what Im saying. Im fairly confident in most of it though.Core M is a  part. Atom has traditionally been a sub part. Closer to  if Im not mistaken. Core M will have hyperthreading support Atom wont. Big advantage multitasking right there.Im not sure of Atoms TDP but Core M comes in w .w and w firmware configurations. Theyre the same chip just configured to operate at different power outputs. Atom will be lower obviously but the lower TDP you get you get diminishing returns. Especially with a larger battery qs all the other components start becoming bigger power draws than the SoC. Hence battery life is less of a concern especially with  and larger devices. With  screens its basically pointless.Atom will obviously allow for thinner designs due to lower thermal constraints. It will probably be more powerefficient than competing ARM chips but not nearly as powerful as Core M. The target markets are different. Atom for fanless thin midrange designs. Core M for premium and potentially fanless designs which are still much thinner than the previous generation of Core products. Core M outputs half the power of the .w i in its max configuration while performing better than the w i in many circumstances. You may have seen a benchmark recently on here where the Core M was considerably slower than the i after some research into the model of Core M that was in the benchmarked device it was the .w Core M if not the w I cant remember which of the two but I think it was the .w..Id definitely be interested in how Core MBroadwell U chips are implemented in SP. Well either see big performance jump in the w denser parts or greatly reduced heat and power consumption in Core M.Atom might be used in a lower end Surface modelI dont see why you would want ARM chips when Intels new chips are better in almost every way.,Surface,clcwelw,1,t5_2u5h1

If you connect the surface pro  to that battery the power connector will light up briefly but will soon turn off and not accept a charge  even if the Surface is powered off.  My guess is that the Surface does some kind of check and will only accept a full amperage power supply.  Many laptops e.g. Dell will accept lower wattage power supplies and simply charge the battery more slowly  seems to not be the case with the Surface .  Its disappointing because that nd Gen Anker is a nice battery  but clearly designed more for charging iPads and other USB V devices.  ,Surface,cln4p9h,1,t5_2u5h1

I dont see Adobe porting CC to iOS unless its a cutdown version. You will not see Wacom pen tech come to Apple either. As a major stakeholder in Wacom Samsung wont allow it. Wacom itself wouldnt allow it as it would cannibalize its Cintiq line and other products. They already shut the door on Microsoft with the SP.  This leaves Apple with having to go with another pen supplier or develop their own. If its not Wacom that already precludes a significant population of creative users who are notoriously stubborn about using Wacom. Personally Id be quite interested to see Apple bring out a tablet device with pen support. I think it would bring some great competition to the market.

I am a huge fan but Ive talked to any people who said I tried a Windows Phone but it was too hard to use. As weird as that sounds.The biggest issue is that Metro adopts several paradigms that are simply foreign to people with experience with other mobile platforms. The chromeless and undiscoverable edge UI the back stack Charms etc. Have you ever read some of the negative comments in the Windows app store? Its comical and tragic how many  people rant that this stupid app cant even print!. And then there is the cognitive load imposed by the whole bifurcated user experience that comes with Windows  which s literally like using two operating systems in one computer with completely different conventions. The biggest single positive change in Windows  is to merge these two environments into one. The has huge benefits even if it subverts somewhat the pure tablet experience.

3608166,0,t3_31os22,OMG can people please stop asking the same freaking questions over and over again? Just learn to use Google. Or do a search here!Will it handle gaming? is literally asked daily. The answer is itll run games but a very low settings. It has integrated graphics.Plus nobody actually has the new Surface  so nobody can really tell you outside of guessing based on specifications.For the type cover there again a google or reddit search would tell you everything you need to know in less time than it took you to write this post. Since I dont want to only be a dick here is the answer the type cover is okay but it depends how picky you are with keyboards. If you are a Machead who has only ever used a macbook pro you might hate it and think it makes your fingers literally bleed while typing.How many USB port? Seriously? You couldnt just read the description on Amazon Ebay or the official website? There is  USB . port on the tablet itself thats it. And yes its separate from the charger cause MS while trying to rip people off like Apple with overpriced accessories at least still has some common sense. You dont have to choose between charging your device and using a USB mouse. So you can indeed connect the keyboard and mouse but you either need both to use the same USB dongle or use a USB hub.Battery life greatly varies as for every single electronic device out there. Id say a good estimate is  hours of use so screen on. Charging it is quick but not super quick like modern smartphones Think  hours. The charger is relatively small but bigger than the one for a Macbook I believe. Like cm x cm x cm.Yes it does but without a subscription. Since you seem to be a university student you should get good deals or Office free anyway. Just Google it.It runs freaking Windows which has thousand of softwares out there. So yes youll be able to find a good calendar and alarm. They might not be modern app but desktop ones like using Google calendar in the web browser.

Replace those cartridges that cant be blown anymore with your Surface. Run emulators up to the playstation ! War of the Monsters is perfect Screen too small? Buy the adaptable minidisplay port to hdmi cable and never fuss with anything again! The Surface will hook up to anything immediately without control panel settings or svideo requirements! Move the emulator to a bigger screen hook up a ps controller and bam! Gaming console. PS controller requires small Google search for drivers Another plus is being able to show off your stuff on any TV anywhere! Drawing? Check the Surface Pen works great!

4079280,0,t3_37au3k,Have to say I always thought it was a silly thing to fix a loop to the keyboard with glue were pushing a pen into that at some point the glue will come unstuck under stress plus it can make a mess on the keyboard or the keyboard area you put loop on can discolour if the pen loop is on there for so long.Personally Ive never put the pen loop on the keyboard and have a folio case that I usually carry the Surface Pro  around in and that has a proper loop on it but I do miss the ability to not put the pen somewhere if I go naked with the Surface Pro  out of the case.I really hope Microsoft would go back to putting the stylus away in a silo inside the Surface had this on previous HP laptops with a stylus and never had a problem with it worked extremely well and you never lose the stylus.In short though to fix your problem if you really need a loop then you could put a few dabs of super glue down but probably the better option would be to buy a new one from the Microsoft Store.,Surface,crl9hro,2,t5_2u5h1

Check out the Surface wikiThen list down some of the things you dont like. In my case it would be the rear camera lack of autofocus and somewhat heavy weight. These arent dealbreakers so I know the SP wouldnt be very appealing especially if the SP is so refined.The SP received a ton of firmware updates to the point that it is very stable and Windows  could be icing on the cake. SP will go through the usual supply constraints and early adopter issues making it a reasonable buy in October or perhaps Christmas.As far as facts go I think it is safe to say that the SP will have a faster CPU and GPU. Will probably inherit the megapixel rear camera with autofocus from the Surface  and have an improved frontcamera to support Windows Hello. The screen size will likely be the same if Microsofts commitment to future accessory compatibility is any indicationTLDR Only get the SP unless there is a dealbreaking flaw that the SP might address.,Surface,crzcx9y,2,t5_2u5h1

4213680,0,t1_cs0ixbq,The OS does not enter into it. This is a strict hardware comparison  what it takes to sustain a LTE signal. We are looking strictly at power draws of the LTE modem and the capacity in Wh of the battery in a tabletlaptop Wh in the case of the SP compared to the capacity in Wh of the batteries in phones typically less than Wh for phablets. Windows . is perfectly capable of minimizing data usage when it detects that the wifi hotspot youve connected to is tethered to a mobile data connection you have to tell it this information. FWIW there are other Windows . tablets here with LTE connection as well from Lenovo and the impact on battery life is as I said minimal. This is not a new thing either seeing how Ive had an old Thinkpad with a Wacom digitizer and an LTE connection with humongous battery life.Edit Im not even sure what your reference to duel sim or a global thing is intended to indicate  such a device totally does not need dual sim capabilities.

If most of your use cases involve a browser or if you get mileage out of the pen input the SP is a great tablet.

4251671,0,t3_39nloz,Sorry to hear about your experience but as you may find on all forums of various products Microsoft or not you will have people who have had problems and hopefully it can get sorted out.Was your SP and Type Cover purchased directly from amazon or from a rd party seller? Was it bought as used or did it arrived as used? It would seem odd that even the Type Cover didnt work with the Surface but knowing whether it was from a rd party seller may help a little bit. I have seen once before on these forums that there was an eBay seller that tried to sell Russian Type Covers under the guise of a US Type Cover and by covering up the keys with paint. Im not saying thats necessarily whats happening with you but rd party sellers can be risky depending on where.Are you in need of a device immediately or can you wait until more news of the SP is announced? If you need a device immediately or soon what is your budget proposed usage and preference on a new or usedrefurbished device?There have been deals lately on eBay for refurbished SP units through the Microsoft store and sometimes on the Microsoft store too.

4427282,0,t3_3br7va,I think to start with you should really ask yourself if you want to spend the money on either option. Even a Surface  is a bit overkill if youre just going to use it to browse the web and watch movies. Youd want to go the Surface route if by entertainment you want to play Windows games and want to run a more capable version of Office. If movies and mobile games are more your speed stick with the iPad.That out of the way what Surface to get is an interesting question. The Surface  has a very nice high pixel density display and lasts forever on the battery. In terms of power the xseries Atoms are about as powerful as a Core  Duo and the GPU can easily handle older games. If youre looking for more portability go for the Surface . The Surface Pros would be more appropriate as a full laptop replacement. I recently picked up an SP as a full time laptop replacement. When at my desk its also connected to a second display so it ends up being a replacement for my desktop in some ways. If you just wanted to watch movies an SP would be a bad choice.

Im imagining the device wouldnt arrive as described maybe used or something defective and itd be a nightmare to try and ship the thing back and get a refund. If Im looking at the same listing as you it doesnt even say what condition the Surface is in.If youre looking to get the device for cheap consider looking at some craigslist listings or take advantage of promotions or student discounts.

When i was looking at buy my surface i went into store and had a look at both the normal and pro and used them both for about  minutes and i preferred the pro with it having the bigger screen so when hand writing notes there is more screen space. Also the pro has a higher resolution screen. But if you dont mind the smaller screen and a less powerful processor then the surface  is good.  when i carry mine around as a tablet i have the stand open to get a better grip on the device although the surface is a bit heavy than an ipad or a samsung tab you are getting far more performance.  the surface pro  will be able to do everything your macbook can do the only downside is when it gets hot it will throttle so i have this fan  which you can just plug in and aim it at the surface.,Surface,cujk990,1,t5_2u5h1

No matter how closely I follow the noterest strokes they recommend it just refuses to compute them. It sounds like most users have a better time of it than I do so its definitely worth you checking out.But I gave up on it and instead have found a way to use OneNote for sketching out compositions or making notes as hereThe way I do it is simply that I saved a picture of an isolated staff which I then insert into OneNote. Once its in the page I then Copy the picture and Paste it wherever I want new staves. The length of the staff can be changed simply by dragging the horizontal handles on the image. This of course wont allow you to convert the notes to proper printed notation or MIDI but as I now use OneNote for pretty much all my creative projects I like being able to write down musical ideas within it.,Surface,cutanwo,2,t5_2u5h1

The weirdest part is they demoed of all things Microsoft Office saying they are focused on the enterprise...using Office made by a company that has totally owned the enterprise for over  years.As someone in an earlier comment said I really think Apple screwed up on this one big time and I think they know it.We will see. edit missed words ,Surface,cux1cuc,2,t5_2u5h1

5093127,0,t1_cuz9925,gb Surface  is  without the keyboard I think you mean Surface Pro  with keyboard is near .Either way the Surface  is still more expensive but has pen input but you have to buy the pen and an easier way to convert from tablet to laptop easily just fold back the cover.With the Miix  you wouldnt have pen input and would have to undock the tablet from the keyboard  stand when you want to use it as a tablet. Thats fine for at home but seems like it would be awkward when on the move. It also has worse cameras if you care about that. Looks like battery is rated for less time than the Surface  as well.Surface Pro  is in a completely different league from both the Surface  and Miix  with a bigger higher resolution screen and better CPU. So of course its going to be more expensive.So it comes down to what you need it for. If you just need a tablet that can sometimes be used as a laptop as well and not have to run resource intensive apps then the Miix  should be fine.If you need all that and also pen input go with the Surface .If you want a full laptop replacement and  higher specs Surface Pro .,Surface,cuzwvg5,1,t5_2u5h1

I am brand agnostic very much a results driven buyer and the sp simply produced better results for my usecase.I use the stylus solely for note taking and have done so on many devices which is why i can say with confidence that the results and experience from the SP are simply better than the SP with regard to this particular use.

It was great but there was no touch input and flipping and docking the screen means youll lose the keyboard making very common things like scrolling difficult. Laptops back then were also much heavier so its not feasible to haul that thing around unless you need to. All in all they were expensive and not meant for average consumers and specialist interest is simply not enough of a market to keep it alive which is why it died for a long time until the tablet revolution made it possible to risk making tablet hybrids again.I can see the Surface Book replacing the Surface Pro  for people who primarily wants a laptop but also want to retain all the other Surface features. The Type Cover  might be even sturdier than ever but the Book keyboard is rock solid. Also people keep forgetting that you can reverse dock the screen like an old school tablet PC and get the longerthanSP total battery life as well.I also think the incremental upgrade process is already happening with the SP  you can get significant improvements on the SP just from buying a new cover and pen and they have experimented with alternate accessories in the past with the power cover so its not entirely out of the question that something like a SB keyboard dock thats sold separately can happen  they can do it its just a matter of when or if.,Surface,cvwwlcv,1,t5_2u5h1

I think i spent half my time on TabletPCReview forums when I was researching and setting up my Le it was one of the hardest things to do I bought it of eBay about  years ago for  without a pen Got an axiotron like i said for  I bought an gb Runcore SSD  so had to install that and put Windows  on it which was a nightmare because there was no disk drive and couldnt do it via an SDUSB install. Bought an external disk drive and a wired keyboard problem is the device could only support so much power via USB so I had to switch a lot Id also put Ubuntu on previously but it wasnt very penfriendly. If Idve had a mainspowered USB adapter it wouldve been easier.  Despite my love for the LE it did suffer from age but the SSD and pen made it usable. I practically did the last  years of University artwork on it.My friend has a Cintiq Companion its quite a large bulky device and apparently the glass has a matte grip finish so it doesnt draw particularly smoothly compared to a proper glass screen. Plus they are way too expensive. The Surface Pro  seemed like a good balance of power and usability plus it was compact and could be used as a tablet on its own. I dont think its perfect but most devices like this arent either.I envy anyone that can afford the Surface Book  Pro .Ive never really seen that Lenovo Helix is it good? How come you need a screen protector  felt nibs doesnt the screen have sufficient protection? Though I probably shouldnt recommend you buy a Surface Pro   just because Id feel bad if you didnt like it. I have got a review of it on here ,Surface,cw220pt,1,t5_2u5h1
5401870,0,t1_cvz55pu,Same feeling for me.  I went to play with a unit at the local MS store and though there is some bounce its no deal breaker.  Additionally I think the typical use case would not be to use the stylus when in laptop mode but your finger for quick navigation pinchzoom etc. and for that the wobble is not too distracting.  I tried using the unit on my lap  the sales staff are very accommodating  and it felt just a tad more wobbly than a typical laptop although Im comparing my experiences with Thinkpad which have crazy sturdy hinges.,Surface,cw25d0k,1,t5_2u5h1

5415637,0,t1_cw3r4bh,OH hahaha. You should clarify. I thought you were saying they stripped the USB port on the device from the core m surface. Not having the charging port for the SP core m and a W charger IS unfortunate but at the same time core m will draw much less power. We wouldnt criticize Microsoft for using a smaller power supply on the Surface  vs Pro  and core m has a similar power budget to Atom. Its likely a W for the same reason the Pro  is W and not W  it doesnt need more. It might still charge slightly slower but the difference wont be near . ,Surface,cw3wn33,2,t5_2u5h1

5464586,0,t3_3pwrks,I was originally intrigued by the Surface Pro  simply because of the cool factor.  Its a really fun device and I enjoyed playing with it in the Microsoft store.  Hearing the rumors that MS would release a larger Surface Pro I was  certain that I would purchase the new model to use as my new personal laptop.Microsoft made my life much more difficult by announcing the Surface Book! I did get swept away a bit in the hype and its a bit disappointing to realize that both the Surface Pro  and Surface Book are probably equivalent or slower for multithreaded tasks due to dual vs quad core than my early   rMBP that Im typing on now. Its processor iQM was released exactly  years before the U. Of course the new Intel chip uses less power for equivalent performance so it is pretty amazing.But honestly these benchmarks really dont matter at all for what Im going to use the laptop for. Im not going to be playing AAA games. I will be doing a little bit of coding at home but nothing nearly as complex or demanding as my business software. I have to remember that Im buying it because its an awesome  in  device. Now if only I can decide between the SB and the SP... thats the frustrating bit.

I will probably get an S when it comes out  of the time I use my SP as a tablet and its a little too big for that.  Wm with continuum on a XL is also a very compelling argument I await some real world testing and reviews before I commit albeit I might wait for a refresh with an  SOC before I move away from android.

On the Mac you can use the whole touchpad as a button whereas on the Type Cover and most other Windows touchpads there are two physical buttons on the bottom of the touchpad.

Or just get this and the cable mentioned earlier.This should give you about k mAhm which is about  times the battery capacity for the Surface Pro  buildin battery. After battery conversion lost you should get around    more battery.High budget option  I tested this myself with a SP Get one of these which is a full AC outlet. However even if it is  mah the problem with it is that it has to do significant convertion .v gt v gt v  so you are losing a lot of battery power.

5902804,0,t3_3w4sij,I think you have things a bit backwards.When it comes to bug fixes and software support MS is going to be far ahead of the curve in comparison to Dell. This is a flagship device for MS and they also write the OS. Dell on the other hand doesnt develop a whole lot of software themselves and Id count a lot less on them being able to fix things going forward.On the other hand when it comes to support I think Dell is actually more competent and has quicker turn around in comparison to MS. The only caveat there is if you have an MS store nearby and you get MS Complete. Dell has a huge network of vendors who they contract out repairs and replacements to. Ive had a couple of warranty repairs on one of my ultrabooks in the past and turn around was pretty good. With MS you are going to have to ship your device back and get a refurb at some point. Plus their online chat staff were actually much worse than Dell which I found hard to believe until I had to contact MS for some support with my SP.With regards to the machines they are both great and I played with the XPS at the MS store and liked it. But that being said they are quite different from each other. A touchscreen laptop is not very useful if it cant at the very least fold back like the Lenovo Yoga laptops. My Dell ultrabook is touch screen and I hardly ever use the touch screen. OTOH with the SP I use touch ALL the time and it makes things easier faster and more fluid. I love being able to use it as a tablet at the drop of a hat.If you dont care for the tablet form factor and just want a portable laptop then the XPS is a great machine. But the SP provides a lot more versatility over the XPS. Pluses for XPS  Better battery life larger screen slightly better lapabilityBig negatives for XPS  Webcam location really sucks and results in very weird video angles Cant replace tablet touch is wasted on it due to no tent modefoldback design.,Surface,cxte3rd,1,t5_2u5h1

5938138,0,t3_3wovgy,To me its a lot more than . In past I have paid HUNDREDs of dollars to Dell for Pro Support and then another several hundred for Accidental Coverage.  Combined together I paid almost as much as a new computer.  With that I get the following call to them in an endless corridor of menus when you do get a person they tell you that if I pay NOW something I can get my answer right away or they can transfer me to regular support.  Now forget about all the time I wasted waiting for them to give me that pitch  forget that they already know I PAID for Pro Support whatever that means  I now still have to WAIT for another support person and tell them the issue ALL over again!  I had an accidental damage issue end of Jan   I sent them the old PC  it takes them over three weeks they can have as much as  WORKING DAYS according to them to say they will replace it.  There were multiple issues over the next several months and finally got a replacement in May .  FOUR months and countless hours of FIGHTING did it take for me get the service I PAID for.  And all along it was as if they were doing me a favor.  With MS Complete  I make an appt grab a Coke tell them the issue  I am usually out of there within  min  minutes max.  Again there will be people here that will tell you their issues with MS as well.  However in my experience at this moment MS has the best service in the Wintel ecosystem.  Is  is too much  NO.  When you compare what Dell and Lenovo steal from you  up front as a charge then with your time and frustration later when you actually need the service you PAID for  MS is very cheap  and a no brainier.  ,Surface,cxy0qqg,2,t5_2u5h1

My SP gets used as an office laptop and for playing iRacing.I have iU GB GB SP.I run mV core mV cache mV graphics sec preboost and can run the full DMark suite backtoback twice without errors so I assume stable. Taking another mV off any of those numbers causes glitches during benchmarking. I have not tried smaller increments than mV.Taking this one step further I increased the boost powers from W amp W to W amp W for another benchmark increase. Increasing power further is counter productive and benchmarks start to tail off again. And all this with little to no throttling and less fan noise than stock.For the tweaking stage I only used the Cloud Gate . test in DMark and ran duplicates.With default settings I get  amp .With    s I get  amp .With    s W W I get  amp .For stability testing I ran the whole DMark suite back to back twice and played iRacing for hours with no hiccups.With default settings iRacing maintains x fps without pixel shaders but the fps runs fps with pixel shaders on. yes fps not fps to mitigate tearing with vsync off.With tweaked settings iRacing usually maintains fps with pixel shaders on. To avoid those inbetween moments I dropped to x and the fan only comes on gently. It cannot do that at standard voltages.Reviewing the XTU charts at default voltages the CPU runs at .GHz with  utilization in benchmarks and iRacing.

6157783,0,t1_cyn49wv,Agree  with whitesleeve.  Ive used both Synergy amp Mouse Without Borders as well and Multiplicity was what I settled on.   Multiplicity is very well supported and connectivity is very consistent  albeit it is NOT free  which depending on your use case may be a deal breaker. Usually only requires opening up network visibility amp a reboot.  Provides AES encrypted connections in the paid version amp works as both desktop extension as well as KVM into remote machines.  Its Windows only but I only use Windows for this context... and reliability is what I was looking for an Multiplicitys been pretty rock solid relative to other solutions.Not to be negative here but I ran in to farrrrr too many issues with Synergy  which worked on Windows  amp . but failed on every Windows  machine I used and yes I made sure I was on the latest bits.  Regardless of its low cost  amp while it works across Linux amp Macs which may be useful for some not in my scenario it also requires the separate installation of Apple Bonjour for the ZeroConf protocol which they are dependent on.   Ive found this to also have very mixed reliability across Windows  . and .  In one case it flat out half installed and I was never able to fully recover the machine from that state.  I paid for the full product to support the developer but needless to say after tangling with it for a week or so and combing through the user guide  and forums I gave up.I was a long time user of Mouse Without Borders  which is what I was using previously.  It is very similar to Multiplicity without Multiplicitys encryption of KVM features and it has the benefit of being completely FREE no matter how many systems you chain as desktop extensions however theres no support for that product nor is it being maintained.  I got tired of adding new systems and finding it too difficult to get them recognized.  Its an older product and while it was updated to support Windows s hot corners and slide out panes the inability to contact a support person or have really any decent forum for discussion was too much to overcome for me.  And I dedicated a LOT of time amp effort to that product since Windows Vista and beyond.I have not used Spacedesk but I am intrigued or at least amused.  Besides Windows. it appears to have additional clients for iPads amp smartphones.

Sometimes when waking from sleep the entire keyboard and trackpad is nonresponsive. I have to remove the clipboard portion and reseat it then the keyboard is usable again.. When waking from sleep the desktop seems to have shrunken down to a lower resolution. All my previously opened chrome windows or application windows are now scrunched into the corner and I have to resize them EVERY SINGLE TIME.. I think this one is more common as Ive seen some posts about it. I have no idea when its in sleep or what behaviors will wake it. It seems like closing the lid puts it to sleep but if you plug in the charger sometimes it will wake up.

6264530,0,t1_cz14hwu,Im using the free version I downloaded from their website. It really helps when you use the tablet without the keyboard to click on small things that are hard to touch accurately. Mostly for context menus and small check boxes radio buttons etc. It feels very intuitive I have it set to use the entire screen as the touchpad so sliding my finger around anywhere on the screeen moves the cursor just like a mouse would.Another awesome program is TouchMe Gesture Studio. Ive been using the free trial but I will definitely pay whatever it costs when the trial expires. It vastly improves the usability of the device and I couldnt imagine using the Surface without it.,Surface,cz1pgw4,1,t5_2u5h1

6285366,0,t3_41jpaz,Chiropractor here you have the right idea with sitting up right as much as you can. However placing the Surface at lap height and looking down is what is causing the neck pain. The posture you have described is what is being called Text Neck  As you flex your neck forward you increase the pressure on the components of you spine the more you flex the greater the pressure. Now I know you may prefer to sit while drawing? Note I have no artistic ability so Im guessing here Sitting may be most comfortable but standing will also be beneficial as it helps maintain the strength and endurance of the spinal muscles with correct posture Also note sitting properly can maintain these muscles as well again with proper posture. A little anatomy for you As you look downward you are actively flexing your superficial neck flexors the most obvious being the sternocleidomastoid or SCM.  This also causes the muscles at the base of your skull to shorten which can lead to headaches.  Using the Top Gun or Pilot Posture this will help to lengthen the suboccipital mucles muscles at base of skull and strengthen the deep neck flexors. If you made it this far I hope you have learned something. My suggestion would be aside from posture would be to look into something that will bring the surface up closer to eye level to prevent stress on your neck. This may help  Next would be to do chin tuck exercises to maintain strength in those deep neck flexors this exercise will help. Forgive me as formatting and hyper linking is not in my skill set. I hope this help you!Edit Spelling,Surface,cz42q07,1,t5_2u5h1

6553827,0,t1_czx7l7m,Wait sorry I think I overlooked something in your post where youre saying that if you fully closed qbitorrent after the VPN failure happened and then closed your VPN connection then restarted the VPN connection and then qbitorrent would utilise your Ethernet connection.I can fully understand how this could happen as qbitorrent would just be accepting the packets on an application level so if it received a handshake over the Ethernet adapter it would continue to send the data back and forth over the Ethernet adapter rather than the VPN connection which upon connection takes on the default gateway role. Does this sound like whats happening?If it is its still not a bug as there is no such feature in qbittorent where you specify with interface adapter to use it is merely accepting the packets and since it came in on the Ethernet adapter instead of the VPN it makes perfect sense that it would talk over that adapter rather than the VPN because thats where the initial connection came from.Another edge case would be where if the VPN failed qbitorrent started sending out handshake requests on the Ethernet and even after you reestablished the VPN connection responses from the original handshakes sent out initially would come back in on the Ethernet adapter LAN rather than the VPN and thus could also cause the situation youve described.,Surface,czx7wcv,1,t5_2u5h1

Its not meant to support the Surface at all only to stop the kickstand from breaking away because of a silly accident. Pushing it back into the third position puts the locking mechanism back in place.

6777437,0,t3_48jamj,I have been using a Surface Book iGBGBdGPU for about a month and a half and I love it. I am studying Mechanical Engineering and I am in my Junior year and I have been taking handwritten notes on it almost every day. My uses usually include OneNote Microsoft Word and Excel Chrome SolidWorks or MATLAB. Prior to my Surface Book I was using a Surface Pro  as my primary laptopnotetaking device. When I bought my Surface Pro  There are a few things that make me love my Surface Book so much more than my Surface Pro . Screen Real EstateThe Surface Book gives you so much more screen real estate than the Surface Pro . It really stands out when I am notetaking. I often have two windows open with OneNote on one side and Chrome on the other. On the Surface Pro  that made notetaking feel cramped but on the surface book it feels comfortable. I find it useful to have chrome open with several tabs as I often have slides that are posted online and a pdf of the textbook and usually a tab with a Wikipedia page for something I needed to know more about in order to understand what is going on. The surface book really shines here. Clipboard ModeThe clipboard mode on my Surface Book is excellent.  By detaching the screen I get a larger and LIGHTER version of the Surface Pro. I have a class where we are in a lab setting and I am performing experiments and recording and analyzing results. I carry the detached Surface in Clipboard Mode around with me and am able to write everything in onenote or excel or wherever else I may want it. I can also take pictures of experimental equipment model numbers samples etc. and have them later to add in my report or reference back to to find equipment datasheets from the model numbers. Having all of the data pictures notes model numbers etc. on one device with a backup of course! makes the report writing process so much easier.Camera AutofocusThe Surface Book and Surface Pro  has an autofocus camera while the Surface Pro  does not. I never used the camera on my Surface Pro  because the lack of autofocus made it useless. With autofocus the camera is a huge tool. I use it to take legible pictures of documents and turn them into editable PDFs. I can take legible pictures of model numbers to reference later. With the SP they were always too blurry to read. Id be happy to answer any other questions you might have!,Surface,d0ki8fq,3,t5_2u5h1

6830698,0,t1_d0prku3,Hello! I completely dislike OSes by Apple but I have to admit that iOS and OSX are far more stable than Windows and devices with Windows on them. That doesnt change my opinion though Surface Pro  for me is a much better device than any other on the market its form factor is what I want and need with the power of full windows all day every day. The problem? Its a love hate relationship. If you dont mind tinkering with a device then Windows. But if you just want a device to work in general not saying you wont get bugs because OSX and iOS also has bugs like every piece of software but generally speaking theyre stable for daily use  then Apple OSes are for you. I dont have a SB but rather a SP. I wouldnt change it for any other device on the market solely because its very stable for me and its a power house in a tablet form factor  I use the pen ALL the time for taking notes drawing annotating. My partner and I both use OneNote and were planning our wedding its so easy to draw things on the screen! Also portability. I cant speak for the SB but the Sp is very light... I cant even feel it in my bag. I take it everywhere I go another reason I got the insurance haha. Really though  if the Surface isnt something you need and you dont want to worry about updates and patches and fixes then Apple is the way to go and this is coming from someone who would never own another Apple product after the lackluster MacBook I had and multiple iPhones. ,Surface,d0qk6c7,1,t5_2u5h1

I have this exact same problem with my iGb Surface Book Win Pro and a gardenvariety Dell  monitor whose preferred settings are x Hz. I have found no solutions using Wins onboard Settings utilities. Ive not tried any rdparty utilities. The only additional clue I can offer is that the problem does not affect all programs. Some are appropriately and consistently scaled on both the Surface and the Dell displays while others are EITHERA Microscopic on the Surface and properly sized the Dell orB Properly sized on the Surface and way oversized on the DellWhether the situation is A or B depends on whether the Dell monitor cable is plugged into the Surfaces mini Display Port at bootup. If yes then you get A If no and you plug in the cable after bootup you get B.So my SOP these days is B.Even more mystifying is that among the programs that scale inconsistently from monitor to monitor some are from within the Microsoft family. For example Win Mail scales properly from the Surface to the Dell. But a simple openfile dialog box is inconsistent Its properly sized on the Surface and the size of a drivein movie screen on the Dell.

7379457,0,t1_d2gyxrh,Oh well just FYI Macs have different power states.  They dont stay in the same state of sleep the whole time unless you have them set to.  The initial sleep really just puts the dispalyy to sleep.  There is also computer sleep safe sleep and power nap which is sort of similar to connected standby.  But lowpower states come into play eventually.  I think safe sleep is the closest to hibernation.  Im not certain though.So if you want to compare to the two you cant leave the SP in connected standby all the time.  Youll have to let it do what its supposed to do and go into hibernate.  By default it does that after hrs I think.Im not sure what you mean about hibernation not being good for battery life.  Youll get the most batter life by using hibernation earlier.  Maybe you mean battery life as in over the time of owning the machine?

It makes the Surface Pro  look like a toy the screen is much bigger obviously and sharper. The aspect ratio is just right now you can actually read web pages without having to keep scrolling. I should add the SP is actually lighter and thinner than the SP despite the screen size increase.Secondly it seems to run a lot cooler than the old SP I had a iGGb SP model and just general browsing would trigger the fans after a while the SP is pretty much silent but the fans arent as noisy when they do come on. Ive watched a few videos off YouTube Plex and Netflix app and the unit remains no more than slightly warm on the SP I found it got annoyingly hot and pretty much always used my iPad Air  for any media consumption.The Windows Hello thing is pretty smart just look at the SP and it unlocks no need for a PIN.Other than an issue with very slow wireless which was fixed with a registry change Ive not had any issues so far Ive also let it sleep a dozen or more times and not had a sleep of death yet but its only been  hours...If you do get one I hope it all works out for you! ,Surface,d2wqi3w,2,t5_2u5h1

Different operating systems use different shells and sometimes even offer multiple alternatives on windows cmd.exe and powershell.exe on unix bash zsh fish.... Bash comes preinstalled with a lot of popular unix os like ubuntu or OSX so it is pretty popular und widely adapted by users. Many people myself included actually prefer working with an unix style shell like bash especially while developing software or websites. Until now if we wanted to access something like bash on unix we had to use packages like Cygwin. A project which thrives to copy all unix programs to windows and deliver a kind of unix experience. Bash by Windows helps delivering the real deal by using an interpreter for unix style system commands which translates to windows interfaces.

Although I should probably say companies.I would much rather that all the teams work independently in terms of release schedule. So the Surface team make the devices and sell them when ready now that Windows is capable of running the device. Until a couple of years ago this would have been quite hard.The Edge team should put Edge in the store and update it aggressively. The same with other baked in apps.The Windows team should do the OS core to the best of their ability and release either to a schedule or when ready.I cant believe how little Ive seen a new browser in Edge improve thus far.

7989205,0,t3_4ond8v,. Assuming you will adjust your screen brightness and let the device sleephibernate between sessions the battery life is typical of most devices in the same class. Mac fanboys will act like there is a huge difference and this just isnt true.. Regarding bugs Windows  is fine but people come to Reddit to complain. This is a vocal minority and not the experience of the majority of users. If you get a device that has problems take it back to the store  same as you would with a badly behaved MacBook.. For note taking the ability to switch easily between writing drawing and typing is the clincher for me. An oldfashioned nontouch laptop is like a dinosaur for modern note taking.. The pen is great and yes it is easy to lose. Best answer I have is learn to keep it in your pocket or bag and not magnetized to the side of the Surface.. It is a laptop when used on a solid surface and it is a tablet when in your lap. It is not practical to use the keyboard amp kickstand on your lap.

Its only important for the wow factor something you forget the same day you bring it home. But you still have to deal with the handicapped battery life that gives you battery anxiety from the moment you turn it on. Its a shiny object effect mostly created back when Apple made that speech about their new isomething focusing on how thin it was. Look its thin. Thinner than something not quite as thin. It was already pretty thin but now its more thinner because...thin.The SP isnt lighter than the SP though. Not by anything worth talking about.

Video is a bit stuttery but I still prefer video over onenotes playback mainly because I can watchlisten at . or x and skip forward and back easier.

How to enable High performance mode when you change the setting restart your computer then go to power options and high performance mode will be visible  after youve selected high performance mode go back into regedit  again and change the value back to default  and then restart your computer once moreNote when you update regedit it will allow you to select high performance under power plan but will also disable the sleep function. That is why its important to change the values back to normal in regedit so you can keep high performance mode and still have the sleep option. with that said if you select balanced and close the power options window  high performance will be hidden again.  ,Surface,d7zsqz8,2,t5_2u5h1

I rarely use it on my lap but the few times I did it worked very well cant confirm any instability with the keyboard. Plus if you unplug the keyboard you still have the same battery time and wont run out of juice in hs  The GPU is to weak for any proper games anyway so put the extra bucks in a better CPU and  gigs of ram as that will help a lot more with VMs and multiple instances of IDEs open than a GPU.

The feel of the rubber nib of the sp pen I great though. There are a lot of people who like the top eraser much better I guess because it feels more like a real pen. Its also popular with people who fiddle with their pen because those people will move the eraser button around and loose track of where it is.

Responsiveness really depends on your hardware configuration and program optimization IE if you work with massive brushes in photoshop youll need more powerfull hardwareThe difference for me between Wacom tablets and Surface products is the pen correction  I know Im going to get flak for this but Wacom Over corrects your strokes so much so it homogenizes the work done on it. The surface or rather Ntrig pen technology doesnt have a curve for correcting your storkes to the extreme that wacom does. Personally I hate using cintiqs due to their paralax  and terrible color reproduction as well as that horrible stroke curve.

9541234,0,t3_5bjtom,Whatever your use case is  if the device is working for you its fine. Theres nothing wrong with having something thats more powerful than you need at the moment.That being said there are a number of features of the Surface that people coming from another device may not realize and therefore wont be able to utilize. For example I came from a long background of Apple devices and had no idea how much Id use the touchscreen on a tablet PC. I have gone completely paperless for notetaking and assignments and Im not really sure how I survived without it before ... haha.Also the fact you can use the Surface as a tablet or a typical laptop is one of its best features IMO. Laptops are too big and clunky for some of my uses and tablets like an iPad are not powerful enough for others.

9711382,0,t3_5e6osh,This may seem a bit out there but I would actually recommend a base or lowend SP config. The main reason is simple if you type a lot you will wear out the keyboard assembly quickly and it is extremely expensive and loses most of its own resale value within months. The SP on the other hand is a better all in one tabletultraportable and can be used with any keyboard of your choice which can then be replaced for  or whatever. I prefer this because I will basically ruin a keyboard after typing around  words or so. The Surface Book keyboard while great sucks compared to an average  desktop keyboard. Also I prefer the screen of the SP and I use my Surface Pro  about two feet above my keyboard because squinting down at tiny laptops messes up my neck so I wouldnt use a Surface Book anyway.

Moving the slider makes it either a low curve meaning the sensitivity goes up slowly as you press harder. And a high curve as soon as you press youve reached max sensitivity. And how it relates to cars is that a high curve you press the pedal and and your getting all the power the car has to give immediately.

I used to use an Acer laptop but used my iPad for casual browsing although I always hated the crippled iOS system.You can easily set up you SP to be every bit as touch friendly and functional for casual media consumption as the iPad is. Some tips. Get TouchMeStudio. It makes everything so much easier.. Set your start menu to go fullscreen.. Use Edge although I personally use Firefox because I like my customizations dammit.I have managed to replace every single one of the apps I used on the iPad with a Surface equivalent or better. When Im in tablet mode I can casually browse the web consume media and navigate my way around just as easily as if I were on an iPad.And of course the big plus is if you ever want to get some serious work done flip out the type cover and BAM! you have a fully functioning Windows  laptop right there no compromises no crippled software. The SP really represents the next logical step in evolution of the tablet that the iPad began. The iPad is essentially just a big iPhone theres nothing about it that really is designed for productivity its selling point was always the convenience of the hardware.Well the SP is every bit as convenient with one caveat The battery life of the iPad is vastly superior to that of the Surface but if you use the battery saver mode control your brightness levels and set it to hibernate after a reasonable time  minutes or so the Surface can easily last half a day or even a full day of normal for me usage.,Surface,daqh1ha,3,t5_2u5h1

I am seeing display assemblies for about  USD shipped from china so it may be a month or so before you get it but its not the easiest repair. Youll need a heat gun for removal and replacement adhesive for the new screen. While not necessary a big suction cup and something to wedge between the screen and the tablet body is also helpful. The glass is really thin and prone to cracking upon removal and the ribbon cables are very fragile and if youre not careful youll need to replace those too. So even after parts and tools youre still paying an extra . But I still think  is worth the peace of mind of not having to deal with glass shards in your fingers and scraping up glue. Plus you get the bonus of having some sort of guarantee on the work. If you accidentally rip the ribbon cable youre out the cost and time of getting a new one. If they rip the ribbon cable thats a cost of business and a  dollar or whatever they cost in bulk lesson for the employee. The only downside is that this will void your Microsoft warranty. edit Ive replaced a screen on a SP but SP and SP are the same except different parts and thinner screens. ,Surface,dbaypho,1,t5_2u5h1

When it arrived the screen was smashed. They would not give me any information such as the condition of the box it came in nor in which way it was smashed. They would only offer to send it back to me and then I could send it in as an outofwarranty replacement. Now I sent it with a courier in an oversized padded box marked as fragile so after much negotiation I managed to get MS to let the courier go to the location and confirm the condition of the box. They took full responsibility as the box had been squished and I sent in the damaged SP for a paid replacement  which the courier will then pay back once I get the invoice from MS. Long story short you need to speak with the courier. I would assume they told you which courier to use possibly even paid for a specific one? If it was just on your own choice of how to send it in I hope you shipped it responsibly i.e. marked as fragile padded adequately insured for the right amount and also noted what was inside so you can get the courier to take responsibility. In the end the fight is not with Microsoft. You shipped something that arrived damaged. The courier must have made a mistake if not you  from their side they have done nothing wrong.

I think the following are really great if your intending to draw directly on your Surface screen with your stylus. So this would be my list based on that and my experience.. Corel Painter not a very user friendly interface but you get use to it. The emulation of the different mediums is simply amazing  . Leonardo Ive used a LOT of different art apps and programs. And IMHO this program has THE best experience for a digital artist. Its amazing how the interface works with you rather than against you..it complements your stylus and designed with the tablet experience in mind. From what I remember this program was created by an artist for artists that use tablets. And it definitely shows. The mediums are really great not a huge selection though...except for the pencil. The pencil emulation is lame but I just spoke with the developer recently and he says a huge improvement is coming soon. Crossing fingers!  . Mischief great drawing experience but interface lacks. It does have an infinite canvas like Leonardo. It is known for its great pencil emulation  . Inkodo great app for quick sketches and then some. good quality mediums. Plumbago great for quick sketches good experience to draw in. also good quality mediums  . Artrage Im new to it but seems pretty good so far. But I find the pencil to be kinda crappy. How can all the other mediums seem great but the pencil is crappy?There are other appsprograms but they are lacking to me for many different reasons. I like clean and crisp drawingpainting effects. If I feel like it doesnt emulate the medium right or the interface is lacking unless its worth the trouble getting use to I wont use it.     Now...if your using a wacom tablet with your Surface or even just a mouse for other art creation then I recommend the following including the list above  . Inkscape great vector program. Gimp great photoshop clone. Blender for d effects. Krita awesome painting program. MyPaint great simple painting programHope these help!,Surface,ddlrkas,2,t5_2u5h1

10918861,0,t3_5vzldv,Thats exactly my same Surface Book too!Short answer Yes you can game on it and it DOES NOT do anything to everyday performance.Long answer Yes it plays games but do not expect to be playing any games at full graphics or any newer games. For example D gamespixel games e.g. Giga Wrecker or Stardew Valley run perfectly on the machine. More D modeled games e.g. WildStar Torchlight  run on the Surface Book well but must have graphics turned way down and resolution to about  to  to get the most FPS. That being said for light gaming this laptop runs fine. I can even do a few hours of gaming playing say Torchlight  for a few hours and the battery not take too much of a hit.There are  things though you should know. One when you play your Surface fans will kick in and sound like the laptop is trying to fly away from you. Two it will get hot. Im used to my desktop rig at home which controls temperature like a champ. I posted something else on this subreddit about the temperatures on the Surface Book. Mine gets around like C while I play but it hasnt killed my Surface Book or slowed down performance. Third if you have a lot of applications running in the background your gameplay will be throttled A LOT quite quickly. I recommend closing everything except whatever game you are playing.Here is a list of games I have tried on my Surface Book that it ran well on lowmedium graphics and resolution of around  not in any particular order Stardew Valley Torchlight  Path of Exile Dont Starve WildStarTLDR It will play games fine and so far for me doesnt affect reliability or everyday performance but you wont be playing games such as Overwatch on even low settings.Edit formatting is hard,Surface,de67c8u,5,t5_2u5h1

10990185,0,t3_5wxc6p,I think the point of x emulation isnt that its a main feature. Its intended to be a gap filler. MS wants you to go first to the Windows Store and download an official first party app that supports the function or the service. If that fails they want you to try a third party. If all else fails boom emulation. Think about the kinds of form factors that we are looking at for this. They are bound to be ultra mobile PCs and tablets. You would expect to run full Solidworks on something like that if it was running with an Atom. However in a pinch you might want to use a drawing viewer app that might be best available as an x program. Sorry if it seems obvious but I think a lot of comments about this topic the past couple of weeks have been about the utility of something like photoshop on an ARM tablet being emulated. Its not supposed to be useful in the sense of a replacement. Its supposed to be a gap filler. Thats my take on it anyway. ,Surface,dedpb3k,1,t5_2u5h1

Push down with your thumbs and up with your fingers to pop the button mechanism free.  Youre gently bending the keyboard into an upside U shapex with the center of the touch pad at the apex of the curve.   Sometimes the touch pad gets hung up under the edges of the groove it sits in and you need to flex it a little to give it enough room to pop back into place.

If not buy a SP.No matter how good the piece of tech is youre always going to feel frustrated if its rendered obsolete by a newer model in a few months. I faced a similar dilemma in the lead up to the SP release and Im really glad I waited because the pen magnet and the better type cover were features that would have really sucked to miss out on. Assuming youre like most students theres no point buying the SP because its value will fall a fair bit after the SP is released.

11346055,0,t1_dfh04pw,gt Take a rulerWell theres yer problem. Part of the ntrig tech relies on the screen spotting both the tip of the pen and the ring around it to locate the pen versus your finger or palm.  By adding a ruler youre blocking a large portion of what the screen can see.And yes the screen can see you.  Its how most multitouch screens work by projecting IR light out and sensing the reflection of nearby objects.Angular deflection makes it harder and harder to see the far side of the ring around the tip.  This makes the software glitch readings back and forth to guess if you moved the tip versus rotating it slightly. The interpolation of the occasional resulting errors in judgement smooths the end line but if the errors are too common a harder angle then you see more uneven resulting interpolated lines.  This is generally acceptable because people rarely use absolutely straight lines and art programs use stabilizer and smoothing algorithms to smooth input anyway.Wacom tech does not use the optical stack in any way.  It uses magnetic induction field sensing which in a cool way also inductively powers the pen.  This makes the pen costlier and heavier and also requires that the screen have an induction field generator evenly placed below the optical stack.  This in turn means that everything tends to be thicker and use more power.  Microsoft decided that licensing fees aside there were better alternatives that allowed a more Ultrabook form factor and performance.  They went with ntrig to save costs lower price lower weight and elongate battery life for a minimal loss in quality that most people wouldnt notice.  I call that a decent deal.  Plus if you have a lot of things making EM fields around your Surface like I do all the Bluetooth ever and you like those devices to have good signals without also degrading the accuracy of the pen not squiggles but berserker randomness then youd want to avoid induction field tech.  Quite a few of the Wacom tablet PCs have this issue and I upgraded to a SB from one specifically due to it.So TlDr the squiggles are not from what you think but importantly are inherant flaws in the tracking tech.  The flaw is minimized where possible.  Wacom tech is great for digitizer tablets but was never designed for screens or tablets and has some major issues of its own.  Microsoft made a choice and you have a choice to either use it or lose it all the same.,Surface,dfi1zx2,1,t5_2u5h1
