2186502,0,t1_clhpsmd,Just preorder the game from Amazon. They dont charge you anything until the game ships. I preordered  days ago and just received my code. You can then decide if you want to cancel said preorder or keep it til it releases in Feb. You wont get charged a penny.,EvolveUnderground,clhr9z1,1,t5_31xue

2254876,0,t3_2l0hm5,You might just be good I find the monster isnt overpowered at all. If you dont focus down the proper group members you can get wrecked pretty quickly even in stage  full armor. Just dont clump up when the monster engages on you and youll be ok. I find the  most important people in the monster team fights to keep alive are support and medic trapper is useful too and assault is kinda the lowest priority for me. The map also makes a big difference in my opinion since some have much better visibility then others.,EvolveUnderground,clqfarz,2,t5_31xue
2257730,0,t3_2l1we1,what you should do is max your lightening right away. this is litterally so much damage that you can take half a persons health with  blow. since the kraken has a huge damage spike at stage  try and kill at least  large monster at the start then if you are want to be close combat get the electric charge ability. but if you are wanting to be ranged get your banshee mines. while you are running from the hunters if you can see them try to hit them with a lightening strike because the medic will have to either waste herhis time healing them instead of tranking you or let the chance of herhis comrade dying. when you get caught inside of an arena battle go for  person at a time but aim for the medic. since the kraken is really strong with the lightening ability use that and the charge to take down the medic. then when herhis teamates try to revive herhim use your vortex to keep them off. when the arena falls rush away and try to get to stage . an other you can do is once the medic dies and you have  points in either your lightening strike or your charge you can v the rest of the team. just make sure that you are constantly moving other wise the harpoons tranks and mines will hurt you a lot.,EvolveUnderground,clqrytc,5,t5_31xue
2264473,0,t1_clqzxo7,Spread spread spread! Tranquil him harpoon him. He can only focus  person at a time negates a lot of aoe. confuse him. keep the focussed target shielded. Im not saying we are super good but we knew what to do. Against the kraken you have to be confident show him who rules the battle. No need for even the dome. Once he is once tranqhed and harpooned its a cake walk. that thing is so slow on the ground...Also..it helps to have a good medic. Im a medic player val mostly. Whenever i join a public game there is atleast a single person praising my tranqu shots. Like..srsly. Im on the tail of that thing and tranqu it where i can. Its so redicilously helpful...i love this type of gaming though. something fresh..it feels as if im home hunting that beast XD,EvolveUnderground,clrlx2l,2,t5_31xue

2271051,0,t1_clseqtm,Well no shit small increments.Its not supposed to defeat better players. Its supposed to be a small curve to balance out the asymmetricality.Rank...as in level in game?The obvious answer would be that those have nothing to do with skill and everything to do with persistence.,EvolveUnderground,clsf6h5,1,t5_31xue
