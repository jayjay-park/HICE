310866,0,t1_cfcxxif,I think that he jumps from his perspective to Jesus perspective. Like waht La Dispute did in Edward Benz. The reason I say that they jump is because it goes from I swear Ill try to nail you back up and in the beginning it says And I will die all aloneAnd when I arrive I wont know anyone and meaning Jesus Christ in my theory was the first one to arrive to heaven. So he would be all alone when he arrives. EDIT SOMETHING BIG I JUST REALIZED Well Jesus Christ Im alone againSo what did you do those three days you were dead?cause this problems gonna last more than the weekend Jesse is talking to Jesus asking him what happened to him during the three days he was dead. And if Im not mistaken didnt Jesus die and then resurrect at the end of the weekend aka sunday?

1393398,1,t1_ciqq31f,I was there and I stayed because I love all Brand New which includes Daisy. Its easy for people to say what you just said but there were people there who paid  to go because they were expecting YFW and Dj. Waiting to get in The Paramount was playing YFW. They were playing in Long Island where it seemed the appropriate choice would be YFW and Dj. In CA they played the albums in order. When you wait in line for  hours and then wait inside for  to  hours for them to play and you have all of these reasons to think they will play  albums you get your hopes up. Personally I wasnt heartbroken when I heard Sowing Season start I knew it meant I was going to be hearing some awesome rarities like Not the Sun Daisy Noro etc. but I was also bummed because I knew this was my best chance to hear songs I love off of YFW and Dj that I love for the first time and that I had just lost the chance. They dont play those songs that much anymore and people were excited to hear them. The band is entitled to play whatever they want to play but I think its pretentious to demand people stay and listen to an album they dont like. I love the album I loved listening to it and I had the time of my life. But people had legitimate complaints and just because you wouldve rather been there doesnt make those complaints any less legitimate. ,brandnew,ciqxz4s,2,t5_2rq6j

5173497,0,t3_3luutj,Guy seems like a dick but I really want more information on this. This article is poorly written and clearly biased covered in references to Brand New and TBS like some college freshman wanted to write a smear piece against the guy because the writer loves the band. Im sorry but the person that wrote this did a poor job.Instead of it remotely having to do with the band Id like to hear a less biased version of this guys story as to why he hiked the price up. The NY times article follows upgt Martin Shkreli the founder and chief executive of Turing said that the drug is so rarely used that the impact on the health system would be minuscule and that Turing would use the money it earns to develop better treatments for toxoplasmosis with fewer side effects.Definitely dont support this claim. Even if its rarely used the price hike of over  is supposed to justify this? Quite a high markup to use the rest on further research. This is clearly a problem throughout the entire industry.gt This isnt the greedy drug company trying to gouge patients it is us trying to stay in business Mr. Shkreli said. He said that many patients use the drug for far less than a year and that the price was now more in line with those of other drugs for rare diseases.gt This is still one of the smallest pharmaceutical products in the world he said. It really doesnt make sense to get any criticism for this.He does present an interesting point the medication is used far less than usual medications and is priced somewhat fairly or so he claims to other rare disease medications. But even so why raise the price that dramatically?Im not trying to justify his actions or beliefs but the Yahoo article is so bad and filled with bias and unnecessary Brand New references to bite the bait on it would be silly. Id love to have him write something defending and providing further information on all of this though. ,brandnew,cv9lhf7,23,t5_2rq6j

9139366,0,t1_d8agb99,Timing a major album release to coincide with the th anniversary of another big album is pretty dumb Im glad they didnt go that route. If I had to speculate wildly I would say they wanted to finish the album before this tour so they could release it afterwards. They would still play TDAG but they would start playing some new tracks from the new album. Pure speculation. Jesse does what Jesse wants. I dont think anyone not the fans and certainly  not the band wants to cheapen TDAG anniversary or the upcoming album. They both should have separate timeliness and seperate tours releasing the album this fall never made sense to me. It was either going to be summer or after the tour. Obviously now we know it wont be this year at all. ,brandnew,d8ahblx,3,t5_2rq6j

11594983,0,t3_65f82v,Just because you brought up the conspiracies... So far the Weatherman account seems the most promising he claims to have an inside source and has heard several songs and described the direction the band is going... Seems like a lot of work for a troll but I wont believe it till I hear it ,brandnew,dgaasx0,6,t5_2rq6j
11631562,0,t3_65zkd8,More experimental. I like to describe the album as angstyadult. Kind of like how YFW is their angstyteen years and Daisy is like your young adulthood fuck the man vibe.,brandnew,dgeg7o9,12,t5_2rq6j
11662145,0,t1_dghtc0w,Im with you. I feel like nobody actually listens to Bed or maybe its just something you dont really appreciate if you dont play but its some of the most impressive guitar work on any of the four albums. The way that both guitar parts become more intricate and complex on each repetition of a section and the way that builds throughout the song is really excellent. It takes SO much more talent to play something like that than it does most of the more popular Luca Bomb type stuff. Effects and equipment do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to Brand News guitar sound but Bed is all technique nuance and playing dynamics. To be able to play guitar lines that are that colorful and complex while playing with the level of restraint they do really deserves to be better appreciated and I wish more people could hear it.,brandnew,dghx3gd,20,t5_2rq6j
