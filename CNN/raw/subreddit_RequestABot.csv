Googling a large amount of text will only return that very comment.. What sources would work? I mean if op copied and pasted every word then it would be easy to back trace. But most of the time they out into their own words and that could mess up which sources contain the original explanation. ,RequestABot,cf4k5t9,1,t5_2yfrq

1191357,0,t1_ci3mgqv,Thats awesome!Good point about the Special User text... I suppose every Special User would have their own text. Not sure what the best setup would be for thisI would have gone with a list of users and a list of texts with a setup along the lines of if title contains SpecialUsersi then add SpecialUserTextsi to the comment but theres probably a better way you know of. As for formatting itd probably be something like this for the final commentgt Extra informationgt user standard link A standard link B special linkgt user standard link A standard link BTheres one other thing that I didnt want to put in the original request but I might as well run it by you to get your opinion  Would there be some easy way with Python presumably to check if the users account is still active or if its shadowbanneddeleted? What Ive done with AppleScript yes really AppleScript P is use curl to get the contents of  and see if that equals error  but Im sure theres a better way to do this.  This would allow the bot to indicate if a users account is still active or notwhich would be nice but not by any means necessary please so dont bother with that if itd take too much of your time.One other random detail Would like to be able to include the following in comments above the top of the list between Extra information and user      amp    amp    ampNot mind you as codeformatted text but as plaintext. Im doing the code formatting since otherwise it wouldnt appear here. Just including that here since Im not sure what escape characters Id need to use and you probably know it instinctively by now .

4364940,0,t1_cshnkxq,The dates in my examples are just part of the title of the Reddit thread where the poster has taken them from YouTube and entered them. The titles I gave above in my examples had the date in them because the person who submitted them included them but Im not expecting the bot to make any changes to the titles specifically  title followed by tag and then the YouTube link and the link to the comments. Where the post is a text post you could leave out link and go straight to the comments link.Edit just so were clear where I talk about the previous week I mean the dates the posts were made to the sib relative to when the bot posts Monday to Sunday week that precedes the boy running. Nothing to do with the dates in the titles. Theyre just for informational purposes for the subs users. ,RequestABot,cshnwfm,1,t5_2yfrq

There is a way to have content above and beneath the list of the users points. You could change it like soChange the updatewiki function to look like thisAnd add these two variables to the top sectionJust make sure whenever you want a line break to put a n at the end of the line or it wont break because markdown is stupid in my opinion.The gitlab repo has also been updated with these changes if you want to look at that as well.,RequestABot,csjlvip,1,t5_2yfrq

5554372,0,t3_3r5kkx,I cant be bothered writing it but here are some thoughts for someone with more motivation.Checking if they have deleted it can be kind of a pain. Since your subreddit is small that helps. Heres one idea on how you could implement it.Maintain a list of every submission in a database or text file. Have it have UTCcreatedsubid.Script starts.. Go through the list and do currenttime  x remove anything older than  days.. Gather as many submissions as possible limitNone I think the max is . If the amount submissions in  days exceeds  the bot will no longer function correctly.. For every subid in the history list compare it to the submissions. If there isnt a match that means it has been deleted or removed or there is more than  sub in  days. Add that to a tempidlist.. After gathering all deleted submissions write and send a modmail batch modmail so if there were  deleted there is only one message still.. For each missing submission remove the entry UTCcreatedsubid from the history list so it doesnt continuously send modmails.cronjob or loop that.If the subreddit experiences more than  submissions in  days there is three alternatives.. Check subids from a history list one by one to see if they have been deleted ltlt horribly slow.. First cross off any from the newest  then check the rest one by one to see if they have been deleted ltlt also slow.. Not quite a bot that checks for deletions but maintain a list similar to above but have it track UTCcreatedusernamesubid. Maybe have a grace period of lets say one hour. That gives a chance for someone to delete it in case they fuck up the URL or title and it wont go on the history list. Then same as before when the script runs remove any older than  days current  UTCcreated then similar to the old bot check for duplicate user names in the list.,RequestABot,cwlkjps,1,t5_2yfrq

If you download the .py file again you shouldnt have this problem.

6391051,0,t1_czg2opg,Yeah the POST body is the input text encoded into base plus the suffix cDhnMMZjNzOGx though Im not sure what that means.I decided to prepopulate an sqlite database with code and response as the columns and the response column is updated when I try that number. This seems kind of overboard but it makes it super easy to start and stop the script whenever I want and its very easy to know which numbers havent been tried yet.To prepopulate the database you can use something like this    import sqlite    sql  sqlite.connectcodes.db    cur  sql.cursor    cur.executeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS codescode TEXT response TEXT    cur.executeCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS codeindex on codescode    cur.executeCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS responseindex on codesresponse    code      while code gt         c  strcode.rjust         cur.executeINSERT INTO codes VALUES? ? c None        code      sql.commitAnd then heres the script Hopefully Im doing this right theres no way to to know until it actually happens.

10460472,0,t1_dcsuk2u,Aww okay. I misunderstood. I thought you wanted the reddit post to be archived. But you want the URL in a comment or a post to be archived. This is doable you just need a bot to sit in a subreddit and every x minutes scan the submissions and comments on the submissions for URLs. If it finds one it sends it to archive.is and returns the link via a comment.There might be a better way than the logic I have posted but just a starting idea. Also you would need the bot to ignore any of its own postsor any archive.is URL because otherwise you would be arhciving archives. lolI dont have the time to code this up anytime soon but if I get the time I will contact you. I just wanted you to know that it is possible.A quick google found a python wrapper for archive.is ,RequestABot,dctstva,1,t5_2yfrq
