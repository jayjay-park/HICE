4035618,0,t3_36oj9c,My guess is that love.filesystem.loaduses loadstring while supplying it with a filename argument which makes the lua vm cache the output and returning it asis again whenever your test.lua is called.Id suggest reading the content of of test.lua as a normal file and manually do a loadstring without specifying a second argument to the function...Try this for your last function untested    local testLuaModTime testLuaFunc    function getTree        local modTime  love.filesystem.getLastModified        if not modTime or not testLuaModTime or modTime gt testLuaModTime then             loading a file once every update is bad for performance             made it only load it if modified            testLuaModTime  modTime            local buffer  love.filesystem.readtest.lua            testLuaFunc  loadstringbuffer        end        return testLuaFunc    end,love2d,crgahbu,1,t5_2sjyz
4125571,0,t3_37x9d7,Its a game where walls come at you and you have to go through the holes. Its a pretty familiar concept but the twist comes when you have to control yourself in polar coordinates radius and angle rather than rectangular. The game is more or less fully functional  the gameplay elements are done but I need to add music a start menu lives for the time being it tracks misses instead and a game over screen. The game gets harder over time you can keep track via the level counter but it caps at level . The counter will keep going but the game wont get harder. If you want post the highest level you can get before you get  misses. The score counter is just a frame counter and you get a level up every  frames.ControlsAD  Rotate around center WS  Change radius dont use the mouse its a debug featureFeel free to criticize the hell out of this I definitely need some input on how to improve it. Id advise not looking at the code its really quite a mess and Ive hardcoded screen size and time is framebased.,love2d,crqjghw,2,t5_2sjyz

6389397,0,t1_czfv7sh,The main thing which breaks you out of the source folder is the fact that filedropped gives you an active file handle no matter where the file was. I was hoping that we could somehow read the data in from the file normally then put it into a data structure which love could use to create a graphic. Fortunately it worked! seriously I didnt expect it to work at all    fileopenr Opens the file in read mode regardless of where it is. It returns false if it failed so we slot it in an if statement. Beautiful.  fileread Reads the whole file. It spits out a string. Bytes dont really exist in Lua...  fileclose Selfexplanatory. We dont need the file anymore since we have the contents in the data variable.  pcall Calls code which might die but without dying! If it didnt crash it returns true plus any return values from the code it ran  ie. the image. If it did crash it returns false.The code we get pcall to call I made neater by storing the method names in short variables just above but heres the whole lot expanded and in full    love.graphics.newImage            make an image from image data      love.image.newImageData         make image data from file data        love.filesystem.newFileData   make file data from a string          data                        the string we loaded from the file          img                       name of the data being processed. saw it in some stack traces when I messed up          file                       base encoded file or not? not                  Finally we do Luas equivalent of the ternary operator to set the image which is being rendered currentImage depending on whether we were able to load the image from the file or not.currentImage  success and img or defaultImage which is equivalent to        if success then      currentimage  img    else      currentimage  defaultimage    endHope this helps! Let me know if you want anything else clarified.,love2d,czfwpee,2,t5_2sjyz

9070565,0,t3_54gphg,A little more context would be nice. Layout for a game level? I dont know exactly what youre deciding but for the most part I think theres very little reason not to use lua for things like what youre describing.Biggest advantage no parser or converter to worry about it just works because its lua. You can make .lua files that just have one big hard coded data structure in it which is going be the same as a json object or xml document but now you also have the option to generate parts of it with code if you wanted.A common pattern I use for reading files is like this     level.lua    return  colorred      main.lua    level  requirelevel    setbackgroundlevel.redAlso if you wanted to say insert some custom functional behavior to a sprite or something you can just add lua functions to do so.So basically by using lua you get lots of flexibility with almost nothing you need to do to get it working.So why wouldnt you want to do this? Some reasons might be you need predictable load times scripts could take a long time to run or if you really dont want the risk of scripts taking down the main program scripts could get stuck in a loop. You might also need to communicate these data structures to other programs that dont use lua but you could potentially just run the script and findwrite a converter that turns it into jsonxmlwhatever depending on whats in the structure. And lastly if the people working on these structures dont know lua but know jsonxml better.So yeah I dont know Im tired and just dumped my brain hopefully that helps you in some way.,love2d,d824vhn,2,t5_2sjyz
