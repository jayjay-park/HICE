7846413,0,t1_d3xzonv,Basically since that sentiment is shared by a lot of people and I disagree with it. I like the movie a lot solid  for me but I dont think it is even PTAs best work of the decade PDL and feel like too many of the films elements are way overblown. Essentially I think too many elements of the film draw too much attention to themselves giant geometrical shots and huge camera movements alongside DDL and Danos bigger than life acting with a colossal epic American dream plot and everything just felt thrown in my face constantly. Im also generally not a DDL fan as I think especially in this movie his acting is so ridiculously emotive and huge that feels at odds with every other performance although this could be to the films benefit in a sense that his character is separated from others in another way. To me it also doesnt hold a candle to the films that Id consider the best of the decade Yi Yi Three Times Tropical Malady that I think have a much better sense of pacing emotionally and visually using moments of far greater intimacy as points for emotional connection and contrast for high points of grandness and striking beauty.,topfilms,d3y07oz,1,t5_3da4b
