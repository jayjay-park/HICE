Perhaps Stargates could function as downloads of other players planets that let you travel to them as your character.In case that sounds confusing I mean you would Download a planet from a website and place it in your starbound folder. Go into the game build a Stargate and place it like any other furniture. Enter the coordinates for the world you downloaded and enter the Stargate just like your FTL drive.That way the original world still exists on your game you can choose which worlds you want to download and you can travel to them instantly but only downloaded planets.,starbound,cegwndb,1,t5_2tkp6

That sometimes creates what I find annoying spikes of smooth responsive play to slow unresponsive video lag spikes.  Thats been my experience with testing in a lot of games.  I havent yet tested that with Starbound but over the years its become a general rule of mine to keep Vsync on for a more middle of the road FPS performance.One thing I did test with this game was forced AO.  Even though the game doesntcant whichever use AO it makes a different in FPS when turned off.  I found that to be odd.  I generally keep AO off as well.,starbound,cepn0gw,9,t5_2tkp6

181373,0,t1_ceyyw30,Im not saying your sentiment is wrong although like others have expressed here I appreciate Chucklefish being so forthcoming with their Beta plans.  But you are playing really fast and loose with your numbers from Steamcharts in drawing your conclusions.The Day Z Chart notice that none of the days post release are below k yet the December average is only k.  Looks like the metric is taking in a lot of  data points when comparing Day Zs stats between two sets of  days due to some data appearing from prior months oddly.  Considering Day Z was a huge mod before becoming a standalone Im not surprised that it is maintaining its concurrent usage numbers which are somewhere in the k range.  But the data does not show a doubling at all.Rust Rust has relied on little fanfare and much more word of mouth.  Once again it is part of a very popular genre and the growth is both commendable and not at all surprising for a game that came practically out of nowhere.  Im not sure if it is the best comparison to Starbound for reasons I will set out below.Seven Days to Die the growth is small but its there.  On the other hand the average users gained is around .  Were not talking the same scale of adoption and drop off as Starbound which is why Im not sure this game is the best comparison either.Which brings us to Starbound huge peak to start off with going as high as k.  Thats a much steeper ledge to fall off of than any of the other games above.  Furthermore there was a HUGE preorder campaign that included Steam keys meaning a number of people got the game maybe logged in once or a few times to see the early access then decided to set it down either to play later or graze on the next game in their Steam library.  A drop off is to be expected.  That Chucklefish has announced multiple times Oh hey wipe time has certainly pushed the numbers lower.  But this game is in an entirely different universe from relative unknowns  Days to Die and Rust.Which means the better comparison is Day Z.  And what I would like to know is how many people were playing the ARMA mod that transitioned over to Day Z and whether Day Zs performance represents growth decline or neither.In terms of numbers a better comparison could be Terraria in terms of its drop off from the October update to November  Lots of people already had the game then the update pushed and a bunch of people jumped on to see what it was all about.  Then you get a similar albeit not as steep drop off from a huge peak.  Plus similar genres at least give a better comparison in terms of how each game will perform with the Steam playing public.Yes Chucklefish could have waited until the last possible second to wipe but it would appear that they are trying to play the long game and grow their fan base instead of pissing them off and alienating them.  Isnt it a fair counterpoint to say that people wont want to play Starbound if they might log in the next day and their stuff gets wiped? Youve seen how the numbers play out with an announcement.  It would be much more grim for chucklefish to see a player drop off like that because of an environment created by sudden unannounced wipes.I hope people dont just blindly downvote me because they disagree with me.  All Im trying to do is add to the discussion.,starbound,cez3ffp,41,t5_2tkp6

300966,0,t1_cfbonh0,My suggestion is to make them not single items that you just find. Make each one have unique and non unique pieces that must be obtained to create the mech. After that certain pieces can break and need to be replaced instead of simply repaired. In terms of balance it could just be that they provide higher armor than normal and when they are hit it effects their components instead of your health and has a chance to break something. Give them special ammo that cannot be crafted or that requires materials not easily found.Probably not an easy thing to do but just something I had been thinking about.,starbound,cfbylvf,1,t5_2tkp6

Rise of the Hlyotl  This looks like it should be an essential expansion pack for starbound.. Novakid Race Mod  Another well designed custom race.

Or just edit their gear by adding s of HPDMGDEF. So yeah I only believe people are not cheating when they share the name of the mod with others while posting preferable in the title.There are even mods where you create a new character and can enter Sector X immediatly. I dont mind those kind of people ONLY when they tell they do it on Reddit though nobody cares to share therefor it feels like just cheating for me.As a multiplayer gamer myself Ive seen lots of people join my Steam Communitys server and just kill everyone while having  HP amp DMG because they edit it. If you think its not cheating well Im not surprised about the american part of the community as people in america are known to be cheaters in games like CounterStrike Call of Duty etc. Its too easy to say no I dont cheat whilest actually cheating thats what has been happening all the time.

946020,0,t1_chbszpt,First thanks for responding in a civil and thought out matter.And to be honest Im somewhere in the middle between your point of view and the view of the OP. And Ill admit that I came into Starbound at the point of the Humble Bundle so Im a late comer to this so you know feel free to completely ignore me.I think that Chucklefish has made some great decisions and some poor ones.The mod system even sort of incomplete as it is was a great plan. Many developers would not want to allow modding on an unfinished game but I respect the devs for throwing it open. It also allows them to look at what mods are popular and see in what direction the community wants the game to go. That is a huge tool and coupled with incorporating mods into the base game and hiring modders is a very good step.Involvement in the community is a sort of mixed bag. I greatly respect Tiy for coming in and posting a thread a while back saying what do you want and then listening and making changes. The combat changes that came out of that are solid and good. That said Id like to see more involvement with the community more posts about whats happening development wise not just teaser pictures of new ships. It seems like weve gotten a lot of teaser pics of ships but they still arent here. And I understand as uDemanRisu says above its hard to come into a community that seems to be dominated by negativity.  But that doesnt mean that as developers they shouldnt. Come in post a thread asking for how to improve X part of the game and then listen to the comments and implement them. That builds community and gets some positive energy back into the subreddit. Start posting expected release schedules for new features and then keep us updated on them. I personally dont really care if a date is missed as long as there is a new date and an explanation.Now the ugly. In my opinion posting and talking about the Pirate game is a rough thing to do. No matter how many times you say that it isnt taking away development time from Starbound the perception is that it would logically slow things down. And its hard when it seems like more than half of the tweets by the devs are about the new game rather than the old. It is entirely possible that they are completely separate games and teams and they dont impact each other at all but the perception is that they do and that hurts.EDIT Also I dont see why people are downvoting this thread. He has a different opinion and maybe not the one you agree with but hes presenting it an a respectful and thought out manner. If you disagree then respond in kind dont just downvote it,starbound,chbthye,8,t5_2tkp6

1055952,0,t3_266o48,Recommending from our experience yes if you play to explore and enjoy being dumb together you can make nice months of it c the progression is gradually faster once you reach certain point and its not complete so you might want to take things easy on the progression of tiers and weapons theres a lot of stuff to do and a lot of things to see but its not complete so after maybe  hours for someone that is not creative you might want to take breaks.Its not hard but if one of you dies it can become time consuming to find eachother and explore together since you spawn back at the starting point so you might want to troll not to the point of death theres plenty of resources around to keep you alive tho!Regarding the loot its commonly underpowered but you can get some very sweet loot sometimes not only weapons but resources clothes musical instruments anyways he crafting system will always stay on level with the difficulty so dont worry if you get unlucky often! An update in progression is currently announced and itll affect the very start of the game so you might want to wait for it!,starbound,chobego,2,t5_2tkp6

If this is a case of vocal minority then its a bad call to reimplement features based on what the minority wants In other cases such as or changing the number of tiers from  to  it signifies that not enough time went into planning baseline ideas about the games structure and progression.In yet other cases such as Armor Penetration making weapon damage difficult to gauge and understand it shows that either not enough time went into testing these ideas during the eight months of time that they were supposedly refining SB into something that was largely feature complete OR that CF needed this feedback from the community to understand that most players didnt like or understand the system.

These questions are hella loaded and really arent designed to be answered theyre designed to criticize or possibly bait CF into saying something that the hatewagon can jump on for a few days.So youve got two options if you really are curious about their answers Find a way to ask them in a way that isnt so accusatory that gives the benefit of the doubt and assumes that CF actually wants to make a great game. Keep complaining about the fact CF isnt feeding the trolls here and if that doesnt work start reposting them and get banned.I personally think  sounds a lot more fun reasonable and less likely to stir up unnecessary drama.Somehow I think no one is going to try  at least not seriously.

1611701,0,t1_cji5srw,You cant directly use wood as fuel but you can turn  wood into  coal using the furnace and then use the coal as fuel. So what you need to do in order to use wood is find a whole bunch of wood and a bit of coal then turn a lot of the wood into coal use that coal to burn more wood into coal and then use that coal as the fuel. Its super inefficient but its a good way to get fuel at the start if you go around cutting a lot of trees down and its a sure way of getting fuel instead of hoping to get lucky finding the ore you can use as fuel.Edit Took out an extra period I had at the end.,starbound,cjiblm2,1,t5_2tkp6

1723809,1,t1_cjwfwuh,What constitutes a feature? If I deliver a patch that adds new abilities or entire classes perhaps entirely new facets of gameplay does that mean my my game is in alpha? Eve online regularly delivers overhauls of massive chunks of the game disassembling entire rooms to make them better. World of Warcraft also implements new content outside of expansions which invariably introduces large swathes of content so WoW has been in public alpha for  years? Starcraft also has balance patches that change how the game is played on a regular basis. Skyrim had a launch day bug that crashed my game on a mainline quest it rendered the game unplayable for almost a month. Was it still in beta?Games are no longer produced as one monolithic entity. They are often being changed and patched on a regular basis. They are usually modular in design so that they can be expanded upon easily long after release. ,starbound,cjwg852,2,t5_2tkp6
1723928,1,t3_2e5q40,Im glad most people i this thread are rebuffing the whiners. We all or at least I bought the game knowing full well it was alpha. That said even as an alpha Ive put in many more hours than I have into some AAA titles. Ill play it for a month or so shelve it and come back in six to see whats changed. My impression of the people whining is that they have no real comprehension of what level of work goes into making something  anything at all  and making sure it lives up to not only your standards but your customers as well. Especially when it comes to figuring out how to implement a notcompletelyrepetitive questing system into a procedurally generate game.,starbound,cjwgrlu,1,t5_2tkp6

1771438,0,t1_ck27pyd,Minecraft isnt a totally bad example in that it still uses a tiered picks and its still a sandbox survival game. Terraria is infinitely better but amongst my circle of friends more of them have played minecraft so its an easier example to use there. This isnt that circle I know but personal bias can be hard to  avoid. Part of starbounds planned progression though is that before you can explore new worlds and collect things there youll need better gear. A new pickax is part of that gear. Ores that are rare on your starting planet arent so rare on higher tiered worlds. Theyre a nice bonus to find but not being able to mine them because you lack the proper gear for a tier where theyre common makes sense to me. The other big thing about this that a LOT of people dont seem to get... Its a nightly build. The tiers and things exist but its far from being  totally implemented and  balanced. Sure in the nightly right now needing just about every tier of pickax to get off the starting world is dumb but tiered pickaxes in general fit very well with what the devs have told us about how they want progression to work and once implemented and balanced properly will likely be fine. ,starbound,ck2g1i1,1,t5_2tkp6
1773385,0,t3_2erzob,Im no game developer but it seems to me that one of the biggest issues surrounding balancing in this game is the fact that armour and weapon values increase exponentially across tiers. This makes the transitions between tiers massive and makes any enemy in a higher tier than the gear you have way too powerful. Reduce the rate of value increase across tiers and in doing so reduce the importance of always having the strongest armour and the game will be much more fun.,starbound,ck2ourz,4,t5_2tkp6

1937815,0,t1_ckm56p7,Is this the entitled kid analogy? Starbound Devs are our cruel parents that dangle a promised christmas present in our faces and laugh at our dispair? These guys arent my parents. They are artists and coders promoting a project they are working on.Just a question have you ever purchased fine art or custom sculpturefurniture before? Didnt think so. Think of finished video games as your super bike but from IKEA with cheap prefab interlocking parts so you can have your full bike game quickly. Its already designed theres no waiting. But its expensive for the particle board that it is and you cant do much with it except buy extra parts that you wanted expansion packs IMO not the best value. IKEA is made in bulk to sell to a saturated market.Or you can go buy a custom made bike from a small shopindie release. It will be somewhat expensive but you will get to have parts custom made and welded. In this case you can watch the workers weld your bike together before your eyes. You can watch them troubleshoot the parts and find solutions to make it better. You buy it up front and wait a little longer because you know the quality will be better than the same investment in IKEA. Sure you can be a little upset if the bike shop takes a while to build your bike but the fact is the little bike shop doesnt have an army of engineers to make your product complete in a short amount of time like Ikea does. They must take time to fit the parts together and try to incorporate what was in your order without compromising the structure of the bike. Development runs into roadblocks and has to quickly circumvent strange problems that come out of nowhere and they do it with a tiny fraction of the workforce that companies like EA do. As long as they are giving updates and working to incorpoarte the stretch goals which I see plenty of evidence for then there is nothing to complain about. You just invested in a different quality product than you intended to. Cheap fast good. Pick two. The two that I pick are Cheap and Good. Buyer be ware. To me an artist buying these early access games feels exactly equivalent to purchasing custom art or music up front. And the last thing you want is for an art peice to be rushed because then you will loose out on the quality and value you invested for in the first place. ,starbound,ckmp5xs,2,t5_2tkp6

Placed blocksitems on the spawn point making it impossible to spawn there.  . Placed blocksitems in the background over the spawn point  it counts as the same as placing blocksitems on top of the spawn point.You can customize your beam in point but you cant block it in put a roof over it or place stuff in the background over it.

2978371,0,t3_2u8s8l,Seeing how were still in beta there might be more equipment light sources on the way. I think Lantern On A Stick is a great Tier  light item just based on how lowlight it is but still good enough to at least not leave you in complete darkness.And maybe well get a Hard Hat item that is just a wearable always active flashlight that has a strong light cone in front and very small ambient light on the top bottom and back maybe similar in power to the Lantern Stick. Maybe itll have a mediocre steelhelmet level of a defensive boost since it is a construction helmet after all.Although I am liking the idea of a floating light bot that would be a little stronger than what the Lantern Stick puts out. After all we are in the spacefuture. I dont know but I can see the reason why as for now things like torches and cheap lights are being pushed. I guess the devs dont want them to just become completely irrelevant after getting a lightproviding wearable item. Which was pretty much the case for me when the Lantern on the Stick first came out. The light output for that thing was very good so torches pretty much became obsolete for me. I dont have longterm goals on planets that Im mining so I pretty much have onperson lighting just as a quick and dirty mining frenzy.Granted placeable light sources are good as breadcrumbs in deep tunneling and as beacons.I guess its just the trade off of if I want to make a bunch of weaker and stationary lights for dirt cheap or if Im willing to go through some significant work for a wearable item that gives off great lighting. For me Id ALWAYS go for the latter.,starbound,co6nn4p,0,t5_2tkp6

3007021,0,t3_2ulb0a,I would be far more sympathetic with you if you werent so whiny and entitled about this. I agree with the basic premise. This change seemed to come with no announcement and negatively effected me. I personally got over it and actually hope they stick with the nerfed storage. That said I also think they should have announced it or something.But goodness gracious man get a grip. Disrespectful? You were disrespected because of a nerf in a game? How dare the developers not show specifically you one guy proper respect. Good freakin grief man.And unnecessary? Its balance to the game. Yes thats subjective. But subjective means youre not right either. And in the case of no one being right guess who gets the final call? I bet if they polled for whether or not to nerf youd get most telling them to do what they want some saying dont and about an equal amount saying do.Waste your time? Blowing hours and hours on a beta game is a calculated risk. Youre the one who took it to build a colossal bland museum. This time the risk didnt pay off. I blew money on Castle Story and that game is a boring lame duck compared to this game.Might this be frustrating? Yeah I was right there with you.

3061414,0,t3_2v7lpf,I agree with you overall. However I think there are more interesting ways the game could ask you to manage hazards i.e. cold besides just stand next to a fire for  seconds.Its kind of a pain whenever a game asks you to stop playing. And thats basically whats happening when the game says okay youre cold now take out the fire and stop everything youre doing and heat up. But! I think even that would be fine if there were some more costly alternatives to let you heat up without having to stop. A couple of ideasFor one thing the suit should have both a passive and an active effect. You should be able to press a button on the suit to do a quickheat effect that heats you up  a full bar of energy should be enough to fully heat you but lesser portions could be used to top off your heat too.Another option would be something like Plasma Torches. Torches in the old game gave a tiny bit of heat but not much. So lets add in a new type of torch thats much more costly  maybe it requires Erchius Fuel or Uranium or something to make  but it burns super hot and as long as youre placing them down along your path youll be creating a safe area.If you have a few different options to help combat the hazard like that then I think itd be way more interesting. Itd help make the hazards more fun and itd help make the things you do to combat the hazards more fun too.,starbound,cofb9l9,8,t5_2tkp6

3064209,0,t3_2v7lpf,From my post at the official SB suggestion forumAt the moment if you go to irradiated hot or cold plantes you quickly lose HP plain and simple. This serves as a hard ban from exploring other planets and is boring. You want a challenge? Nah just follow the only combat path linearly. A nice comparison would be from Terraria where I jumped from silver to jungle equips by putting myself in great danger although the reward was great. Instead of maintaining a hard ban from environment to environment a soft ban should be used to allow players to challenge themselves rather than restricting their paths.For my suggestionAll of the effects increase the stronger and the longer the players are exposed to these types of environmentsRadiation decreased attack power. Can be remedied by drinking rad meds. Materials should be available in radioactive planets as wellFor temperature this is inspired by Monster Hunters mechanicsExtreme Cold slower energy regen lower max energy. When max energy hits  player takes DPS. Remedied by drinking hot drinks hot choco coffee etc. shelter and heat sourcesExtreme Heat decresaed armor. Initially slow but exponentially increasing DPS. Can be remedied by drinking cold drinks lemonade cola etc. and shelter.EDIT OR decreased armor and an increasing chance to spontaneously combustThis would also allow for a multienvironmental condition planet. One that has both extreme heat and cold and is irradiated while your tech would only protect you from one of the conditions.What do you guys think?,starbound,coflp3n,3,t5_2tkp6

Basically just to top you off between falling or taking a single hit so you dont have to use other forms of healing for scratches. Better food lasts longer or regenerates health faster. Bandages need to be something you use after combat instead of constantly during. They should restore a significant amount of health  over a significant period of time. Say  to  seconds. Stim packs should be the panic button. The I want healing and I want it now! button. They should restore  health instantaneously but have a long cooldown between uses.  seconds sounds appropriate. Beds can remain the same. ,starbound,cok374g,9,t5_2tkp6

3227385,0,t3_2x3dck,So I really like a lot of the techs available to us but several of them fulfill the same role only tweaked very slightly. The obvious examples are particle thrustparticle boost and energy chargeregeneration. So my suggestion is to make techs upgradeable with more blank tech cards or even specific items from questsexploration!. While the examples shown in the mockup are mostly placeholders I think the idea itself has a lot of potential. Either as direct individual upgrades or a branching tree where upgrades unlock addition improvements. Here are some example upgrades that could be usedMerge particle boostparticle thrust Have increased speed of particle thrust as upgrade Ability to change direction in flightMerge pulse jumprocket jump Extra midair jump at cost of energy That second midair jump no longer costs energy Rocket boost jump unlocked as upgradeLight Rig Energy still regenerates when  light is on when  lights are on etc Brighter lightsGravity Bubble Faster horizontal movement speed Move upwards slowly at the cost of lots of energy Hovering in place no horizontal movement prevents energy regeneration but uses no energyRocket Boots Hold shiftctrletc to increase thrust dramatically at significantly increased energy costs Significantly reduce energy consumption of using rocket boots Increase base rocket thrustMerge energy chargereneration Add health regeneration as upgrade Energy recharge delay is reduced while tech is equipped Passive energy recharge boost as long as tech is equipped Can walk not run while actively recharging energyhealthMerge energy dashFTL boost Extra long dashing FTL boost length on ground as upgrade shift could also be used to reduce dash length to normal once upgraded Extra long dashing now works in air tooPossibly merge boat and human mech Boat upgrade to mech allows it to travel on liquids automatically switches when liquid detected Short rocket boost to allow it to climb very short heights slowly Additional rocket attack with long delay between each rocket Uses less energy over timeMerge morphballbouncy Morphball can be made bouncy with upgrade hold shift not to bounce maybe? Higher jump Faster movement speed when morphballedTargeted Blink Longer blink range would require nerfing current range? Can warp through  block thick walls? might break dungeonsbalance. If used I think they should warp to just past the wall so they have to blink again if they want to go right to an enemyShield Immunity to lava upgrade would require making lava hurt you with base shield Lasts longerIm sure there are tons of suggestions I didnt think of and lots of ways to implement this stuff. Let me know if you have any more suggestionscriticisms and I might add them to the list! Really hope Chucklefish decides to add some of these changes because techs seem to have a few top level choices now with no incentive to switch unless you are doing something very specific. If techs can be upgraded it gives a sense of more progression and a lot more content for completionists to unlock. It also allows techs to be extremely usefulpowerful late game without breaking balance when you first unlock them. And since techs dont need to be balanced to work for early and late game equally anymore they can be nerfed for base levels and seriously buffed at the top levels giving even more sense of improvement over time.,starbound,cowiuf3,21,t5_2tkp6

Maybe you could hire defense contractors or something to protect your planets if you were going on a long journey. The possibilities are so much bigger than getting annoyed by notifications all the time. Maybe the events only happen on the planets your character is currently on.

And as Endeschonheute said beyond the quests it is a sandbox building game you can make and do whatever you want.As for your second question the Unstable build is currently exactly the same as Stable so you would not see any change. The Nightly build however has tons of changes. If you would like to see those changes earlier than sure it is worth playing.Just remember the Nightly build is not for normal gameplay though. Most of the changes are incomplete or broken. For example if you started a new game on there you would be stuck on a Snow planet unable to get the Iron to progress to another planet.

4638487,0,t3_3eig3c,So recently the hydration mechanics were changed so that you can only hydrate soil from the top. This makes automatic irrigation much harder because watering from the top risks breaking the crops. After many design concepts I finally found one that works consistently. The reason the plots of dirt are spaced the way they are is so exactly  block of water is dropped on each dirt block. Dropping  block of water per block of dirt also ensures you never break a crop. Other more crude designs I tried would work about  of the time but either failed to hydrate all the blocks or occasionally broke crops.

5089653,0,t3_3kl3sr,Its clear to everyone that it was this vehicle that caused the apocalypse on the planet. And this story thatll follow simply popped into my head as I wrote that.Once upon a time this strange vehicle mysteriously arrived and landed on this planet. Its cataclysmic arrival did not go unnoticed. When locals investigated the arrival site of the  enigmatic object it would be the domino effect of their reaction that would lead the planet to its doom.These people have never seen such a strange looking device before! Never before have they known that an object could have such thick outlines! And how could they? Such objects were rare in the universe as is. So... they set out to become more like this machine! They wished to look as mysterious and striking as this strange object sent from the sky! To become more like it! To become one with it!They zealously adored the appearance of the vehicle and soon a cult was made. Their numbers would rapidly rise their ideals washing through the masses like a tidal wave... Their members would openly accept any and all efforts to change their appearance whether it be through genetic experimentation physical modification and other drastic means...And this made people afraid... Not long after but far too late to prevent this zealotry from becoming cemented within the populous... a rivalry group surfaced.Within it resided members who desired nothing but the dissolution of this cult the destruction of the device and an end to the ideals they believed...They sought out to stop them from achieving their goal through any means necessary...The initial reasons lost to time a raging war was soon waged. Both sides would lose countless numbers. Towards the end of their days an act of pure desperation was soon taken...And in the end... the cult was finally defeated but the rebellion group along with the planet had experienced too great a loss. In their dying days they went out and eradicated any trace of the cults presence save for their coveted object. The device had gone missing near the cults final days.And with the damage done to the planet the last of its civilization had finally passed away. But not without some unusual sideeffect...Little did anyone know the vehicle was still on the planet! It was merely buried where for years it resided. Over the years of the war through as negative emotions rampaged across the planet the device had absorbed so much of these feelings that it achieved some form of sentience...And though it would be damaged by erosion wear and tear from the soil it would fair much better then the surface. With the last of the population gone it would reside underground buried for decades.And then... one day for some unknown reason it would unbury itself to reside upon the surface perhaps in the hopes of repeating the cycle once more...Anyhow I absolutely love that mod. Its the only one I play with.,starbound,cuzhuno,2,t5_2tkp6

That you might need to play around with.With  switches I use levers and an XOR gate you can get the following functionality Pulling the switch at either level will cause the elevator to move. The elevator will come to rest once it reaches the top or bottom after one pass.This gives you the desired behavior of being able to walk up to the elevator pull the switch to get it to come to your level board it pull the switch and ride up or down. Wee!To wire Connect the top switchs output to one of the XOR inputs. Connect the bottom switchs output to the other XOR input. Connect the XOR output to the elevator input.Enjoy!

Now its a much prettier wider universe but the only gamey elements have been removed.

6419624,0,t3_43c4ek, Damage has been universally lowered in the latest Stable. Enemies deal about half the damage that they used to and the gap between each gear tier is a LOT smaller meaning its not suicide going to a planet just one tier up just so you can get the gear FOR that planet. While it was a common occurrence before I dont think Ive had a single death in Glad Giraffe which I felt was cheap. Well other than those Apex testing labs anyway. Why do each INDIVIDUAL tesla block still deal  damage now when Max HP has been universally lowered? Wooden pirate chests? Why not craft a Shiplocker? Not to be confused with your ships builtin Ship Locker They hold  items and can be mounted onto walls. They also take up exactly the same horizontal space as the writable signs so you can easily make labels for all your stuff. You can teleport from underground. As of Glad Giraffe youve always been able to. I believe this will become a difficulty setting later down the line though  Casual mode will have underground teleports enabled while Survival and Hardcore modes will not.

6644583,0,t3_46nkz3,A lot of the technology in the Starbound universe seems to be based on the ability to control matter. The obvious example is the matter manipulator which can easily move assemble and disassemble objects from a distance. There are a lot of other examples of this technology such as teleporters efficient D printers high tier crafting stations and the ability to form vehicles out of a tiny pod of nanites. Even your inventory probably functions by converting everything you pick up into a form thats easy to carry then back into an object when you want to use it.This is the same technology that the guns use to make bullets. When youre on the frontier of space theres probably no where to restock  on ammo so it makes sense for guns to have the ability to produce their own. The rate of fire is the time it takes to synthesize each the bullets which is why higher damaging weapons take longer between each shot because the higher quality bullets take more time to make.

There are people in the outpost who will sell weaponsore for a high price but if you have a large amount of income say from a colony you can buy them.Last I knew they werent very strong weapons compared to those that youd find. So they seemed rather useless comparatively.gtAlso as far as getting better equipped npc party members if you build a house with a certain ore type for the furniture i.e. Durasteel table lights chairs ect the npc who spawns will wear that level of armor.Admittedly this I did not know. Thats pretty sweet. I see your comment even mentions being able to buy ore thats a most welcome change.gtAlso Im surprised you think that weapons of the same dps should be a available to the builders as the combat specialist they are combat specialists after all. The builders have a different way of fighting they can hire mercenaries or build a trusty crew to help them get through their challenges.Not same exactly but similar.

Worlds arent as polarizing as in starbound of course as the world gen in Terraria is designed to create worlds that have access to a majority of the games content without having to go to a new one so they all i.e. have a majority of the same biomes. In starbound you wont land on a desert planet and find snow the entire planet is covered in sand which makes each planet more unique but makes planets in general less complex than a world in terraria. ,starbound,d44qig8,2,t5_2tkp6

8377931,0,t1_d5orc7c,Yes Skyrim is a first person game therefore the rules is applied do not apply to a D side scroller. Just because the two both have roleplaying elements does not mean anything. They are played from completely different perspective therefore have different requirements for controls UI layout and overall design. In Skyrim you use your mouse to control the camera in Starbound that is not the case meaning it can be utilised for other purposes which allows for huge disparity in UI. As a good example in Skyrim the only real way to do use a potion would be to open the inventory and use the potion thus the favourite system which let you quickly access needed items. In Starbound that is not at all required because you can simply drag something out of your inventory at any point and click it to use it something that is only possible because of Starbound being a D sidescroller. ,starbound,d5osgpn,-2,t5_2tkp6

8412716,0,t1_d5t43jn,Im not really sure how you would fix any of those problems. You could have it so that planets had different ore but because of tiered progression the only place that makes sense would be the final tier for the three separate types of ore for the different specializations.  I personally think it would make it slightly more interesting if even lowtier planets had this ore and it wasnt superhard to mine but the costs for making stuff out of it increased a ton.  That way you could search specifically for planets that have Ferozium for example.  Like instead of going to this Ocean Planet go to that one because it has Ferozium and dig some up for later while youre looking for Hylotl stuff... Eh randomsprited monsters doesnt really make a difference here.  When they were all randomly generated they were all dramatically samey.  At least now youll get some interesting and refreshing encounters in certain minibiomes and have to deal with specific kinds of threats in normal exploration for example volcano crabs on Volcanic planets or the flying lightning robots on Scorched planets. In this case the structures are based on the races that live there. Its a bit of a shame that almost always you get only the preferred species on a planet Forest is almost always Floran Snow is almost always Apex etc but it would make sense that Floran prefer to live on forests...  And as for terrain features well.. Theres only so much pregenerated stuff they can add and all of it is going to look samey if its designed to look like it fits in a Forest biome. I agree with weapons.  And even staffswands are less exciting than one might think since theyre all basically one of five different attacks since the element might as well not exist except that Fire and Poison are typically best burning is good damage and it lights up the enemies to make them easier to see while poison also is more damage and doesnt get put out by rain or water and Cold is pretty bad the chill effect isnt significant enough and at least electricity is great for groups since if you manage to shock all of them the damage is increased drastically since the status effect scales multiplicatively with each additional shocked enemy nearby.  The Staffs zones are all pretty samey but at least theyre interesting Regen is a handy tool Gravity and Energy Regen would be better multiplayer Repel and Time Slow are okay defensively.I dunno.  I think the only way to drop these issues would be to take away the tiered system altogether so you can get Forest Planets in the difficult regions and so on.This might be the way to go actually.  Still make the different star types denote difficulty and still require the EPP to keep progress steady since a Frozen Star would be colder no matter the planetary biomes.  Make some planet types rarer on certain stars Ocean Planets maybe only spawn on Gentle Temperate and Radioactive Stars Molten Planets maybe only on Radioactive and Fiery and so on.This would still keep the tiering in place but give more options for planets at each tier.  Just make sure the planet is more likely to spawn with colors appropriate a Forest around a Fiery Star could have redcolored dirt and darkcolored sand and the trees could always be blackbarked with brightcolored leaves like yellows or oranges.  That could work a bit and would let the unique monsters shine a bit more too since instead of never seeing some of them again due to never bothering to go back to some of these lowertier planets you can encounter more difficult versions up on your current difficulty...,starbound,d5t4t8w,9,t5_2tkp6

The enemy usually spawns some minions from capture balls and he also does a ton of damage.   Quests where you have to travel somewhere in order to find a lost friend and escort them back home have a high chance of the questgiver joining you assuming the friend doesnt get themselves killed on the way back.  The escort me to location X quests rarely have the questgiver join you.   Deliverytrading quests never get the questgiver to join you.   Quests where you have to kill a single or group of weak enemies never get the questgiver to join you.

8439738,0,t1_d5wdchq,I think the problem is what discussion would there be to be had?Some people dont like certain elements Starbound introduce while others do. Its something that should be obvious and not really need to be debated.Ive learned that its extremely hard to change someones opinion on most subjects and almost impossible when it comes to preferences.So youre basically just putting yourself out in the firing line to get flamed for throwing out negative opinions here. Yer not really going to be successful in changing their opinions and theres not much discussion to be had.I mean Im not a fan of some of these mods like I do think the seeds is kinda silly as plant hunting opens up more reasons to explore planets. But I also agree with the light augment mod because the light augment is just universally the best augment in the game right now and it should be a default function on the backpacks perhaps toned down a bit. Very little reason to use any other augment and if you do want to you have to use a separate backpack for it which just wastes inventory space and doesnt add anything to the game. You still have to hunt for the augment so the mod doesnt weaken gameplay or exploration potential.But I dont really bring any of this shit up because... Why would I? This is a post to get the word out that these mods exists. Me coming in saying Oh I dont like mod A and B  would be met with Okay...? Then close the tab?

There is an invisible wall there i chequed on the debug and boxes. You cant place any block over it as people did with the old bug on the novakid ship. Even if I try to break it the invisible blocks or the back wall it wont work. I can walk through the begginig side of the ship  but cant cross to any of the new rooms.Anyone got a solution yet? Ill have to delete my character with all my things if there is no solutions to this since my ship is almost useless now I insist this problem does not fix by placing a block over the invisible wall Im playing on Starbound .The official forums has no answers to this issue because the old solutions does not work on this new bug.

8523074,0,t3_4wfo39,Tips for a great build. Use a variety of materials for your buildings. I usually play with a minimum of  but sometimes  or more in one building. If the material you want doesnt match the rest youre using try painting it a different colour. . Avoid using only rectangles and squares. Try sloped ceilings floors and walls. Try adding ledges to windows. Little things like this make a building interesting.. Sometimes the best block is no block. Sometimes a gap in a wall is more interesting than a solid one. E.g. an arched gateway.. Rather than using furniture all within one theme e.g. Avian Medieval or Steampunk experiment with furniture that matches in other ways colour shape material.. Play with vegetation. Most builds will benefit from well placed trees and flowers. Maybe that pillar would look good with a vine coiling around it!. Even if youre not a naturally creative person creativity can be a learned skill to an extent. Start by copying other builds then try taking some inspiration from real life architecture. Do a google search and try building something that comes up. Eventually youll find youre building better things all on your own!,starbound,d66y2d7,5,t5_2tkp6

8534782,0,t1_d67yzne,You are correct. In Terraria there is a fraction of a second delay between when you hit the platform and when you drop through it if youre holding S  Down. In that fraction of a second your velocity is slowed and you are considered to have touched the ground for purposes of flight  double jump and fall height. Thus you can safely descend a long vertical line of platforms by holding S as long as they are spaced such that no one gap is high enough to inflict fall damage. Contrast this to Starbound in which holding Down  Space just ignores all interaction with platforms and you have yourself a problem. Terraria had a lot of nice little quality of life things like Shift For Torch smart cursor for mining auto build etc. that made the game a lot easier to play. I feel like Starbound lacks a lot of these and while I know Terraria did too at this point in development I know at least one member of the Starbound team helped make Terraria a reality and I am just a little disappointed the lessons learned both from working on that game and from watching its success did not inspire similar quality of life changes in Starbound.

Sometimes you could be VERY unlucky creating an alt character whose mine dungeons would misgenerate and miss essential chunks and thus come out of it with only  fragments forcing you to dig toward the core anyway.Giving a whopping  to the mother poptop is a good way to ensure that a player is assured to get those  is going through the surface exploration effort to find the mines and fight her. Otherwise to find and clear the mines only to have to dig to the core anyway could be very frustratingsince a player might asks themselves why they just didnt dig toward the core in the first place.,starbound,d7fs4xb,1,t5_2tkp6

If you start taking too much damage switch to defense maneuvers and heal up.Rocket launchers are pretty good to use. But in my experience at the stage of the game you unlock this mission throwing weapons are the fastest damage dealers when dualwielded.

10025141,0,t1_dbeasdi,I know but i kinda expected that we could upgrade our weapons to lvl  which sadly seems not to be the case.I would love to see a raid mode for a group of players of players who have enough skill to make it alone.,starbound,dbeaxzb,1,t5_2tkp6
10048144,0,t1_dbgt9e4,Best campaign for a multiplayer FPS ever. Right up there with BFBCs.,starbound,dbharoo,3,t5_2tkp6
10064793,0,t3_5jvtg0,This game needs a life insurance mod the more you live in the hardcore world the more pixels and items you inherit with a new hardcore character if you die or maybe just leaving the universe the same and using a new hardcore character with no powers and abilities whatsoever to travel to that planet and rescue the loot from your dead body. No reason to waste all that stuff since the moon is inhabitated and those item shold not despawn. just an idea,starbound,dbjgs99,9,t5_2tkp6
10119459,0,t1_dbqjko0,Hmmm maybe try adding more color to your shadows? Especially with skin. Shadows in skin are tinted red due to all the blood we have all up in there! and not getting that red in there is a good way to make it look dead or dull.When I was first starting out painting I was afraid to use colored light but now I cant get enough of it. Id recommend avoiding white light. Most light in the real world is slightly tinted yellow anyway. A handy trick to remember is that if your light is yellow your shadows are probably tinted bluish. The shadows of light are usually tinted the opposite color  so a red light generally gives cyanish colors a magenta light gives greenish colors etc. going off of cmyk wheel here.,starbound,dbqkmwh,2,t5_2tkp6

10142450,0,t3_5kz2io,Between all of the collection stuff and randomization of trying to find Legendary weapons or cosmetics I am still enjoying the game post  hours. FU is a completely different beast with far more crafting and things to find in addition to added mechanics. FU could consume you for the foreseeable MONTHS if you enjoyed starbound enough to tackle it.,starbound,dbtkdbc,1,t5_2tkp6
10149744,0,t1_dbuicz1,hmmm any reasons why they need to be underground?if you  cant have a surface farm try using glass to top it off. Might be the light issue. Or maybe its deeper than that the game might detect that they are below what should be the surface and stop them from generating new items.If you really need a farm out of the way safest bet would be a glass skyfarm with dirt flooring.,starbound,dbuiii6,1,t5_2tkp6

10193635,0,t1_dbz3krf,In all honesty it was cool to land on a new planet and find out what special abilities the inhabitants had.

10301304,0,t1_dc9zv89,I was thinking this too!! I would love a mini map or a guidance system. I feel like S.A.I.L becomes useless later on in the game. Id love to see some passive traits on it based on upgrades like periodically extracting ore fuel or other things while in orbit or an orbital cannon! Or a chance to swoop in at the last minute and rescue you with an emergency beam up system with an long cool down period. ,starbound,dcbpije,3,t5_2tkp6

Download fresh install of starbound gt install frackin universe mod gt create shortcut to desktop or run direct via steam.As long as you run the vanilla from the shortcut youll have  separate versions.Its not perfect but should suffice.,starbound,dcjgvtn,1,t5_2tkp6
10386702,0,t3_5or4ue,Yes. Literally copy your starbound game folder to somewhere else. Note Copy not move then just run the game from there. If you have mods from the workshop then run the game through steam so you know those will load and for vanilla just run from the copy. It wont have steam integration but meh small sacrifice. Ive not run the game through steam in over a year.,starbound,dclebdy,6,t5_2tkp6
10395303,0,t1_dclogbe,Dude chill. All I meant was that in about six months the game will likely have developed to a point where the end game is more about a player having fun than farming for  completion.

10899163,0,t1_de45ls7,Not sure on the coding side but the characters could still be shared so you dont have to redo the creation process. Inventory and shipworld is what needs to be separated. Given how the game stores stuff I would still make characters entirely serverside but add an option to copy the creation details from SP and also download such appearances of your own characters from servers in case you want to switch in the opposite direction,starbound,de466d6,7,t5_2tkp6

11790049,0,t3_67wqpz,Ive been playing since almost the beginning and here are a few of the things that were added or that I think majorly improved since beta Crew members Crop farming and cooking recipes Fishing Colonist procedural quests were a big draw for me at first Collections feature is really useful and gives incentive to seek out new bugs or fossils or figurines A lot of biomes look better than they used to updated block graphics parallaxesHere are things I think are worse or not improved I dont like the story at all and I like the missions only a little Planets have less variety due to restrictions in biomesubbiome combination Combat has added some interesting tools but still feels boring or tedious to me Other than a few villages and microdungeons not much new to explore if youve spent significant time playing in betaOveral I think the game is better than in beta. But Im primarily a player who builds colonies so your mileage may vary.,starbound,dgwfwux,2,t5_2tkp6
