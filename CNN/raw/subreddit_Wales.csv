TLDR you can take your bike for free but its best if you reserve a bike space.I suggest getting acquainted with First Great Westerns bike reservations for the trip down from London Paddington.  All train services to Cardiff and Swansea are provided by First Great Western.  Most do not require reservations for taking your bike but a small amount of trains do  better safe than sorry.  PDF Link.Inside Wales almost all trains are run by Arriva Trains Wales a different company.  Theyre stricter with the number of bikes on their services smaller trains so Id book as far in advance as you can.  Link.Virgin Trains also operate a few services in the north.  Heres their policy.

10747634,0,t1_ddnk5bx,The very fact of being an electoral force enacts change in Westminster whether that change was initiated by a Plaid MP or not. Do you think Scotland or Wales would have received devolution without parties like the SNP or Plaid advocating for it and showing Westminster there was a demand? Voting for nationalist parties like Plaid or antiEU parties like UKIP influences the two large parties to enact policies that typical Plaid or UKIP voters want. By threatening to take votes from the traditional parties and even more importantly threatening the very fabric of the Union parties like Plaid can enact change far beyond the number of MPs they have. Thats why if you want more powers for Wales you should vote for Plaid. Im a card carrying LibDem but a vote for the LibDems in Wales is no where near an explicit demand for more powers than a vote for Plaid is simply because thats the raison dtre for Plaid  voting for them is a more direct message that cant be confused for anything else. Sure you could vote for Labour or the LibDems if you really dont like Plaid and theyll probably vote for a few of the things Plaid advocates for but its Plaid thats holding the flag and pushing the narrative for greater powers. With a weak Plaid the pace of change would be significantly slower with a stronger Plaid it would be faster. ,Wales,ddojbol,3,t5_2qhrl

11163583,0,t1_dew4ldo,Right without going into much detail a few benefits as I see them The freedom to implement a tax regime that benefits the Welsh economy. Personally I think that does mean concessions to encourage business to grow and relocate here but I also think it means rethinking the burden of taxation fundamentally. Incomes here are simply too low to make the current tax system sustainable. I would be very curious about the impact of shifting the burden away from incomes and towards assets the first step might be a land value tax. Getting rid of the Pound which has historically been grossly overvalued and probably still is. A lower value currency would benefit Wales by making exporting cheaper  and exporting is always going to be a key economic activity in such a small country with such a large manufacturing base. New government departments and agencies. Costly for the public purse but good for the wider economy. Wed need buildings to house them and wellpaid staff to run them. A proper judicial system. A diplomatic service. Some sort of national security agency. An independent army navy and air force and headquarters for each. Government departments for things like policing and defence. There are a whole range of government functions that have never been present in Wales before. Just the act of establishing them and maintaining them would be a significant boost to the Welsh economy.  It would also simply be a huge vote of confidence in ourselves that would force people here to view events from a Welsh rather than British perspective.

11733539,0,t3_67fqjx,I dont see a labourplaid coalition ever happening except for the sole purpose of getting May out of power the fact that she is bringing it up shows she is taking it seriously which makes you think given the recent posts on all websites showing the shock predictions of conservatives making huge gains across Wales.  Methinks those predictions are a little off if the conservatives are still playing this game.  On the other hand this will be the first time since maybe the s that labour in wales has been called nationalist.,Wales,dgq0ys4,1,t5_2qhrl
11739261,0,t1_dgqhbzf,Tbf the NorthEast has been in the balance for a little while its usually fairly close between Labour and the Tories. Ynys Mon Id be surprised and very disappointed by if it turned Tory. Could be a geriatric effect... but tbh I think a strong Plaid candidate would win out there Albert Owen just about survived in the last election with Plaid a close nd. If the UKIP vote mostly flipped to the Tories though it could be bad news.On the geriatric point though I wonder if anyone has looked properly at the effect of internal migration on these voting intentions. A quick search for migration statistics shows gtk people moved from the rest of the UK to Wales between  predominantly from England. The age group with the largest inflowoutflow was  to be expected really since it includes uni students but the largest net migration was in the  age group amounting to  netpeople per year. By the original post this category in Wales are most likely to vote UKIP and more likely to vote Tory than younger age groups.Obviously isnt the full story because unfortunately there are plenty of Welsh people happy to vote Tory against their interests I know a few but I wonder if its a significantly contributing factor.,Wales,dgqobff,5,t5_2qhrl
