So he went to do his dream of telling jokes and became famous he added value to a genre.And did all while raising his kids.Raise your middle finger to the people who told you not to do it by doing itIt should motivate you its like when you tell a little kid not eat that cookie he is gonna eat it regardless. And its not bad nor GoodIts human nature.,nickelodeon,d818kh5,1,t5_2s99k
