6177456,0,t3_3xdr5b,Nice job with the headlights man they look great! I was thinking about installing the same kind of LED lights in my car but had a couple questions. Did you have to get any kind of conversion kit from the halogens to LED or did that come with the bulbs you bought? Also do you still have the link to those lights? Ive looked on ebay but I cant find the ones that you put in.,sonata,cyrt9hy,1,t5_2u76c
