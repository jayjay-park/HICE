11011626,0,t3_5jkbx9,I have carried a Surge for many years and cant think of anything bad to say about it.  Everything works well including the bit and sawfile holders.  The thing is built for heavier use than most multitools and it certainly hasnt found anything that Ive thrown at it challenging.I have carried all three at one time and ended up with the Surge but I think that at this level it comes down to your particular uses and preferences.  They are all outstanding.,multitools,deg4y46,1,t5_2u3tt
11027316,0,t3_5wzcom,Have we come to the end of true innovation in the world of multi tools? I hope that this is not the case. Maybe Leatherman Gerber etc should ask users what they would like to see in future tools such as a ratchet driver system.,multitools,dehx6er,1,t5_2u3tt

11342014,0,t1_dfhkhmb,Took me a while to get used to it. At first I didnt want to look like one of those guys. now I am one. When working my pockets are sometimes full of stuff and my hands are dirty. I started using a belt clip with my old tool enjoyed the pliers and then the sheath with the upgrade.I love the raw chunky power of the surge. Other multitools now feel like toys Other pliers now feel like tweezers  and the blades are good. I can hold something in my hand use the other to open the blade without putting whatever down... and its funny but when I walk down the street sometimes it even gives me a little thrill knowing that at that very moment I am breaking the law!,multitools,dfhlitj,1,t5_2u3tt
