8547975,0,t3_4wp3us,I do hope that Seb Stan is getting a nice big chunk of all this Bucky related merchandise because goodness knows its sprouting up EVERYWHERE. At the rate they are going if he is hell be a billionaire by the time hes  even they are only paying him pennies per item. Tshirts jackets toys Halloween costumes dog tags key chains  posters phone cases pillows its just staggering the amount of stuff I could buy with Seb Stans face on it.I know some of it cant be legal but enough is that the guy would be living large for the rest of his life off the proceeds from even one item. This is the kind of thing that really blows my mind about being famous. I mean what it be like to go to the toy store or to shop online and see your image being used to create at least half a dozen toys? To see your face on as many tshirts or whatever. I would be very daunted I think maybe a little bemused too but definitely daunted...,BuckyBarnes,d6a2hek,1,t5_38ymn
