2740508,0,t1_cnfbnd5,The sound of a fist colliding with a face is so much more organic than one would always expect. Regardless of the noise it makes in most cases it carries the same effect  this was one of those cases. The black haired man collapses to the ground clutching his face. Blood begins to escape from the cracks in between his fingers as he squirms on the ground cursing.Your knuckles feel slightly sore but unbroken as the padding allowed for your fist to avoid full contact. A small splotch of fresh blood stains the back of your hand wraps and you can feel the wet spot when it touches your skin.The white haired man and the captain help the black haired man regain his balance and he scrambles to his feet. His face bloodied and nose mangled he grumbles and spouts gibberish as the captain tries to talk sense to him. He pushes the two away and tries to take a step forward but his balance is off and his eyes sway back and forth disoriented before he collapses to the ground again.Argh! Who the fuck hit me!? He manages to formulate his speech into coherent language finally but his eyes are still pinched shut against the flowing stream of blood.The sun has disappeared from the sky entirely by this point covered now by a shroud of black clouds proving that darkness is only the absence of light. A collective sound of swords being sheathed and tensions absolving rings out into the thick foggy air.You can hear the prybarrion gentries begin to giggle while some hold their mouths surprised by your sudden explosion of action. Jamelia steps back among her ranks and looks at your curiously. Her hair is whipping around through the high winds so she wraps the nijab back around her face securing it in place.The white haired man rips his shirt off and kneels by the black haired mans side. Ive gotta stop this bleeding or he could go into shock. I need you to hold still alright mate? He balls up the shirt and holds it to the black haired mans nose. The black haired man complies and quickly goes quiet.The gun smacks against the hard wood of the deck and everyone joins the black haired man in his silence. The crowd of empty faces stare up at you eagerly waiting for you to speak.Control your men for fucks sake! your voice comes loud and firm the captain bows his head ashamed like a child that had been caught stealing candy. You continue to make your point heard These women have business to attend to and they dont have time to scrap with you idiots. You turn to face Lord Jamelia and shift your tone from one of authority to one of respect. I apologize Your Royal Highness. and you offer a slight nod to her guards I apologize to you fine women as well.You cant see her face but as you look into her deep blue eyes they light up you can tell that she is grinning beneath her face coverings. She waves to you as her women rush quickly across the plank back to their trireme. It has been a most interesting encounter firstmate Cuervin! She shouts over the strong winds that only seemed to be gaining strength as time progresses. If you ever find  yourself in Berenhal be sure to ask of me! I will remember your name and I never forget a face. Until next we meet fare well! She disappears off of the ship and is across the boarding plank in an instant. Seemingly in the next instant the boarding planks are lowered and the prybarrion trireme is once again out of sight.But the end of this encounter does not mark the end of your problems as the storm rages on and the winds begin to be wettened with the thick layer of rain that had started to accompany it. The black haired man lies injured and groaning on the floor the captain wont break eye contact from you and his ill intentioned glare burns on the back of your neck. Phirrushuu is still nowhere in sight and Orion had stayed below deck throughout this entire ordeal. The crew of rathman dont act.What do you do now?,Youarecravingburritos,cnfl1k3,1,t5_32zi9

I lean on the counter top and rest my chin on the palm of my hand keeping the other loose and nonchalantly on the pommel of my hidden dagger. My eyes soften as my face changes into a more flirtatious visage.,Youarecravingburritos,cyuuexe,1,t5_32zi9
