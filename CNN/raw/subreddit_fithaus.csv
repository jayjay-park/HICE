8029366,0,t1_d4ih2fm,For me I skip the jump rope. At first it was because I didnt own a jump rope. I wanted to attempt the jump rope when I first found this routine but I was never any good at it as a kid so I figured I should concentrate on things I know I can do.Depending on my energy level Ill do  jumping jacks instead of   squats instead of  and usually skip the spiderman steps unless Im feeling really good and energized. Also Im not the kinda person who goes from one exercise straight into another. I usually take a  min break between the more cardio focused exercises. I dont do any heavy lifting afterwords. Lately Ive been attempting to do this everyday MF with some deadlifts and dumbbells afterwords and then on the weekends a good walk around a beach area. Not trying to go for muscles or gains or anything just using it to stay relatively skinny and strong.,fithaus,d4ikquf,2,t5_3eham
8250322,0,t1_d58skiu,gt budget current fitness levelI know its not cheap especially for a good school. I was lucky enough to still be dependent when I started than then began working part time as an assistant instructor at the school later on. That being said most fitness clubs or even YMCAs generally have some sort of initial martial arts classes.gt Ive got it sitting in my downloads but it always happens that Im fighting for disk space.The real struggle here tbh.,fithaus,d58uhi0,1,t5_3eham
9571106,0,t1_d9sq0ea,Haha this always comes up in the supplement discussion. Honestly we probably have different goals if youre able to not take supplements and thats okay! If I were to try and get my daily nutrients through food I would probably be  pounds overweight and deep into debt. ,fithaus,d9su17q,1,t5_3eham
