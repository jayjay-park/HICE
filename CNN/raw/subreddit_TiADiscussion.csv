150866,0,t3_1vssvg,At my colleges LGBT society there were a few batshit people in it last year.One started tearing down prolife posters that were put up on noticeboards with consent from the college theres an equal or greater number of prochoice ones up. I pointed out that thats exactly what our government did to legbutts for years still does a little bit came down heavily on public discussion of it and treated it as a mental illness basically censorship. I told her that wasnt cool and she went batshit ranting about how what I was saying was oppressive even though it was literally the opposite of that and problematic she refused to elaborate on what that meant. She brought privilege into it as well but I dont remember what about...Also there was a talk about rape in the legbutt community apparently its fairly common and there was a slide about malemale rape and some girl stood up and said Men cant get raped. Someone asked her what she meant and she basically said that men want sex all the time anyway so it doesnt count. I pointed out that I had been abused as a child and she started going off about how I was erasing the greater problem of women being raped. In a conversation specifically about samesex rape. She did get kicked out of the society and issued a formal warning by the university and the union though so at least nobody was agreeing with her.tldr censorship is only real when other people do it Im erasing women being raped by being raped myself.,TiADiscussion,cevm51c,9,t5_2zsos

However I also agree with the Nanny state a fair bit If you get sick or are disabled the government should help care for you This means that the people that would otherwise have to support or fund this person can focus more on increasing their own place in society and give their kids a better start.Im Actually really big on Police aswell however growing up in Northern Ireland is possibly clouding any sane perspective to the contrary.Speaking of NI Im a Unionist I support our ties to GB mostly for economic reason as well as believing that Dont kick a beehive is in full effect.,TiADiscussion,cevnt7r,11,t5_2zsos

570174,0,t1_cg2tle9,It depends some other things have deep meanings for a culture things that come from a religious practice or cultural practice that are tied directly to other things.  Doing a war dance or a rain dance just cause is offensive because it comes from a religious practice and as such would be like a bunch of Chinese Buddhists deciding that getting Baptised is a relaxing way to spend an afternoon.  Other things are meant perhaps for one gender of another.  There are cultures that have objects that women are not allowed to touch so having white women touching them would offend.  Most of the time its much ado about nothing.  I think its only really objectionable when its religious or has taboos around it.

Then remember the fact that financially speaking the U.S. media is fucking dead in water and the OMG The Politician You Hate Said Something xist copy already brings the clicks even without an election going on.  This is a recipe for an even uglier election than last time.What I expect to see is these gender issues clickbait articles ramp up multiple notches since they seems to be the goto flavor of provocative horseshit during these lean nonelection years.  SJWs might be dumbfucks but theyre numerous and passionate enough to make for reliable readers and news outlets are going to aim to grab as many as possible.Theyll try and achieve plausible deniability through publishing opinion pieces on their blogs from young up and coming feminist writers who will not only bring in the traffic but will likely serve up the content gratis since SJWs are by and large gigantic attention whores.So youre going to have a chorus of smears of racismsexism even louder than what you saw with Romney.  Also the demographics of the U.S. have changed so that winning minorities and women is enough to tip the electoral scales.  I anticipate a lot of dog whistle antiwhite sentiments in nonblog articles and if the GOP candidate is male a continuous barrage of dog whistle misandry.

693223,0,t1_cgiploa,My sister is genderqueer but doesnt like to use that word thanks to Tumblr. She explained as some days she wakes up and really truly feels masculine. She feels almost as if she is a man sis if you see this and I mess up please correct me and prefers to actdress that way. We have nice male shirts and outfits for her on these days. When she wakes up feeling feminine she wears makeup and pretty girly shirts and almost cant stand the idea of wearing masculine clothing. If she feels one way and has to dress the other for something important she will but she doesnt enjoy it. It is like a mild form of dyshporia but with no warning at all whether she will feel it or not. It can be frustrating for her if she thinks that she will stay feminine for a few days and then turns out masculine and her masculine clothes are being washed. We have hit that spot a few times and she had to go out dressed girly. There is the difference though. When she realizes she has a responsibility to go out and do something errand or college she sucks it up and puts on the outfit that goes with the gender she doesnt feel like. She isnt like SJWs who just shutdown and refuse because her feeling of her gender while important does not go above everything else. She isnt a child about it all basically. That and few people even realize. She doesnt mention it and people just assume she has a wide range in tastes when it comes to clothing.

718457,0,t3_22e5oy,Well theres a few like twospirit which are more or less based on a mixture or presence of both male and female attributes. Theres also bigender two genders not necessarily MF and genderfluid where people claim to actively change between genders. I dont really believe in either of them. Beyond those....theres not anything tying them to reality apart from selfidentification. Somebody literally invents a gender in their head and says this is what makes it a thing and then identifies with it and others can too. The whole thing is an attempt to further separate biological sex with gender. Genderbased SJWs typically claim that the imposition of the malefemale binary is oppressive to those who dont fit into the box they are assigned. Most reject the idea that gender only exists in two forms male and females but others go further and reject the idea of gender being based on malefemale in any shape. Once you accept that premise gender either a ceases to exist or b takes on any meaning you want to. In both cases gender loses any meaning as a classification for me  if someone identifies as Star or other shit Ive seen on TiA Im classifying them as agender because nothing fucking meaningful comes from Star  your favorite color tells more about you as a person at that point. I accept those who identify as male or female whether they identify as the gender they were assigned at birth or otherwise. Im also fine with people who really dont fit into either role either agenders or genderqueers those who identify outside the binary but not who identify a specific gender. ,TiADiscussion,cglxxbt,10,t5_2zsos

I wonder what the ratio of them telling off actual racists to them calling out bad allies truly is. I bet its a lot smaller than I hope.I think the major goal of SJWs is to make people out to be enemies more so than actually making a positive difference in the world. I didnt press the matter but I was talking to an SJW I know about who makes the biggest difference in the world and she hated the idea that those who have the biggest impact are those who everyone respects I gave the example of a popular attractive high school football star talking about LGBT rights vs. a skinny nerdy lesbian girl. Like wait youre attacking those who are trying to help you for some idiotic and arbitrary reason like hes privileged? If being attractive is what it takes for LGBT to finally be seen as something serious then Im all for it. To be blunt it helps if LGBT champions are attractive like Pennsylvania representative Brian Sims who is gay and rugby player Ben Cohen Theres nothing wrong with that.,TiADiscussion,cgsnp5r,6,t5_2zsos

950844,0,t3_24zjgg,Its true that the tone of of argument doesnt change the merit of an argument.  All squares are rectangles because all squares have four straight sides and four right angles and a square has four sides and four right angles just like a fcking rectangle. Q.E.D. motherfcker! are both equally valid arguments.However tone can change the meaning of what youre saying in the first place. Lets compare two true statementsJews in the United States have closeknit communities and high levels of education which allowed them to attain a high level of economic and social success.The Jew is a an insular creature which prefers its own kind to what it describes as gentiles. In addition they spend superfluous amounts of time and money in sending their children to elite schools. This combination of tribalistic ingroup bias and nepotistic educational tradition has allowed them to steal a place in society to which others are more deserving. Both of these statements make true arguments  social support and education lead to economic and social success  but the tone of your argument changes the context and implications of that argument. This is the problem with tone policing. If people are accusing you of being a dick when you talk to them you are actually saying a lot more than just the argument which is being policed.

The first either you use a positive term such as person of color or a negative term such a nonwhite. Either of these terms is going to foster an usvsthem mentality. ANY label distinguishing one group from another is going to foster an usvsthem mentality.The second point why use the term color? Because historically the term color has been used for nonwhites. The term has precedent. As for your third point that one is interesting. The label Person of Color does essentially apply to any who does NOT belong to a certain racial group.

Im sure theres been a few but shit is extremely rare. Even among poor people and gang communities you dont get driveby shootings here. Again Im sure theres been a few but its super rare and when it does happen it is on the news here just like the upper class shootings for this reason.So what I take from this is the problem isnt necessarily racial  although there may be a racial element for sure  but more with American society as a whole. I posted this on Tumblr and I think it pretty much sums up my thoughts. You live in a country where anyone saying you should even so much as put more restrictions and checks in place for buying guns is accused of taking away mah freedumbs. Which is why Elliot Rodger a guy who was prescribed antipsychotics and was seeing multiple mental health professionals was able to legally purchase not one not two but three handguns.

1317672,0,t3_294t8j,I honestly think its doing pretty damn well at this point. I understand why in a standard game with a protagonist and love interest that these people arent a minority. Itd be nice to see it once in a while but it makes sense from a business and development perspective.That being said there are strides that go a long way especially in terms of gaming where your character gets to represent you. Mass Effect  of course is a given and as minor of a role that your love life played in that game it was really inspiring to see my Manshep declare his love for Cortez.The inclusion of others as side and supporting characters as well is great.Part of a gray area where theres a perceived issue that may not be there is that every part of a character isnt laid out there. Theres a lot of games where the character isnt spelled out as one way or another. It certainly doesnt feel censored nearly as much as it used to be. Its a tough line to walk to make the changes people want and despite the fact that theres still a certain lacking in the representation its making a consistent change. That being said maybe its that Im just apathetic but I dont really notice either way. I loved Mirrors Edge but didnt feel inclined to note that the main character was a female but simply that she was awesome. Someday probably soon honestly well see an LGBT main character but I dont feel underrepresented seeing it as an available option in a game where youre given the free choice.My thoughts and feelings dont change the statistics on heterosexualscisgendersetc. ,TiADiscussion,cihushb,1,t5_2zsos

1350216,0,t3_29iqbj,You dont know how long I have been waiting for someone to ask this so I can try my analogyLets say you wanted to do a survey of college students about whether they have ever received an ugly sweater as a gift. You do the work to make it a well designed survey asking some preliminary questions about their background have they ever been given clothing as a gift have they gotten a sweater as a gift in the past six months? Was the sweater ugly? Did they return the sweater? If not what were the reasons? Questions that can be used to analyze the data in rich and informative ways.You run the survey at a few schools with a statistically meaningful sample size and get the results . of the respondents said yes they had been given an ugly sweater in the past six months. Now we want to extrapolate those numbers to include the full college experience the full four year experience from freshman to senior and since the data only covered the past six months couldnt you just double the numbers to get a  year figure or ? And then multiply the annual figure by  to determine how many college students will receive an ugly sweater as a gift while they are in college  which would be  or  out of every  students?That may seem reasonable and that is in fact quite similar to the methodology that is used to arrive at the  in  women will be victims of sexual assault numbers that everyone from Joe Biden to that redhaired motherfucker Canadian chick uses.But...If you conducted the ugly sweater survey in January that means you are going to capture a prime giftgiving season  Christmas  which is going to skew the results. While students also have birthdays and other occasions where people  family members like to give them gifts there is a far greater chance of getting an ugly sweater during the Christmas holidays. This I would argue is analogous to the reporting of sexual assault in a period that includes Freshman orientation and a brand new college experience. There is a spike in sexual assaults at the start of every academic year because John and Jane Freshman might use their newly found freedoms to make some very poor decisions.Also if you conducted this survey at only a few schools which you did because they are expensive and if those schools happen to be in colder parts of the country then those students are almost certain to report a higher number of ugly sweaters than students who live in warm parts of the country where it may not ever snow. It isnt the fault of a school to be located in a cold climate but it is the choice of a student to attend a college in a cold climate. Those students are knowingly or not putting themselves at increased risk for being gifted ugly sweaters. This is analogous to students who chose to drink alcohol while legally underage they put themselves at increased risk of sexual assault. This isnt victim blaming it is a matter of misunderstanding or miscalculating risk.Not only is it an increased risk it is a recurring risk whenever the circumstances occur a student who goes to a Midwestern school  chooses to drink while underage will continue to be at increased risk for ugly sweaters  sexual assault and they might alter their behavior as they become aware of the behavior. And unfortunately the ones who continue to choose the increased risk are more likely to be the victims of ugly sweaters on more than one occasion. The victims of ugly sweaters arent spread evenly in the population.And then there are those students who get a sweater that they dont think is ugly but their friends convince them otherwise. Or those who get sweaters that might be ugly but it isnt worth all the hassle to complain about it. In the analysis can you take those students and report them as students who refuse to admit they have ugly sweaters? All those careful statistics and now you want to introduce a subjective bias into the numbers.In the end the results of the ugly sweater survey are the results of the ugly sweater survey and nothing more. No one should try to extrapolate those results where they dont apply and certainly no one should be making claims about the future that  of students WILL get an ugly sweater at college.,TiADiscussion,ciljhnu,6,t5_2zsos

1595944,0,t1_cjgbhg6,gtUnsafe...on the internet? You are literally unsafe because someone disagrees with you or holds a view different from you?Did I use the word literally? You seem to have added that in.The concept of safe spaces exists online just as it does in reality. Im not saying that TiA is ever was or ever should be a safe space  hell I left rLGBT because it was taken over by SJWs trying to enforce safe space rules. What Im saying is only that it risks becoming an environment where people in actually oppressed groups not the Tumblr definition of oppressed feel unwelcome and prone to being attacked. Being in any environment where actual mockery of LGBT people is tolerated would make me and many others feel unsafe in that sense. And for many of us the reason were on TiA is BECAUSE we care about these issues but are sick of being misrepresented by the extremists on Tumblr. So TiA needs to not become a place where real sexismracismhomophobiatransphobia are tolarated.gtThis sub isnt politically aligned its amoral.The subs politics are shaped by the kinds of content posted and the kinds of comments people make. This has actually shifted away from productive conversation although plenty of that still happens. The politics are going to exist regardless of whether people acknowledge them or pretend they arent there.gtPeople dont HAVE to believe in privilege. In fact its a highly debatable concept. Just because its your golden child doesnt mean its infallible. What in your head makes you think privilege IS a concept people should believe in? It works both ways. What about it is debatable? The very fact that there are people who dont believe sexism racism etc. are real issues in our society is in itself the perfect example of privilege. Privilege is not having to think about these issues. Privilege is being able to say I dont see racegendersexuality everyone is the same  youll notice how the only people who ever say those things are white male and straight respectively. Stephen Colbert uses this line all the time specifically satirising how oblivious white people tend to be to their privilege. Privilege is the ability to say things like that and to see the world in that way. Minorities dont have the privilege of being able to ignore sexismracismhomophobia as an issue because its their everyday lived experience. They have to deal with the fact that yes many people are sexist racist or homophobic  and denying that is utterly absurd.White people in western countries have the privilege of never being harrassed or attacked on the street for their skin colour and of never having to even fear that such a thing might happen or even being aware that its something that happens. The same goes for men almost never being subject to sexual harrassment or inappropriate treatment from strangers  ask any trans person about the difference in how people on the street treat them pre and posttransition and theyll be able to tell you quite a lot about privilege.Then of course there are literally privileges in society that oppressed groups do not have access to. Straight privilege is being able to marry the person you want to. Its not having to be secretive to anyone for any reason about the gender of your partner. But again more than that straight privilege is the ability to be oblivious to the discrimination that queer people face  the fact that it can be harder for them to get and keep jobs in many places the fact that they have to constantly think twice before holding hands with their partner or showing any affection in public the fact that theyre more likely to be homeless or suffer from mental illness and the fact that they have concerns beyond just being able to get married. Straight privilege is being able to say I support samesex marriage now can we all stop talking about this? Its being able to say Im not homophobic I just used that slur as a joke. Its being inherently unable to understand the personal experience of being in a group that is presently or historically oppressed except to the extent that they can empathise with what members of that group have told them.When it comes down to it privilege is the fact that a straight white cis person never even has to think about any of the above in order to live a happy successful life. They will never be forced to confront those issues or suffer any impediments to anything they want to do as a result.Again privilege may be an abused term used as an ad hominem argument on Tumblr but Tumblr isnt as indicative of feminist theory as people have started pretending. Checking your privilege simply means something like this Remember before you speak on an issue relating to this group that you arent a member of that group that this issue doesnt affect you directly and that you should make sure you listen to the views and experiences of the people it does affect before forming your opinion. What is so controversial about that?,TiADiscussion,cjgc6xw,-3,t5_2zsos

1755437,0,t3_2ejjwi,The original concern was basically that certain cultures perhaps all cultures? have symbolic items of very specific meaning and significance and people taking that and turning it into just something sold as a trinket divorced from meaning or significance devalues the original.To take American culture for example in our culture there are many items with little natural or intrinsic value to which we assign great significance in our everyday life as a matter of social consensus. Small pieces of speciallyprinted paper are the most accepted items for trade. An unassuming little piece of plastic determines whether or not you have the privilege to operating a motor vehicle. Our society punishes anyone who attempts to create these symbolic items without authorization  such as forging currency.Drivers licenses and money are pretty common but our culture has other symbols that are much rarer and more presitigious a bronze star medal an M.D. diploma from Johns Hopkins University a Pulitzer Prize.Other cultures have stuff of very specific symbolic significance too obviously. I believe two examples that often come up are tattoos among the Maori allegedly each Maori tattooing pattern is unique and copying someone elses would be a type of identity theft and certain headdresses among American Indian Plains tribes such as the Lakotas e.g. maybe each feather represents a specific test passed or achievement.These concerns are often amplified when the culture transforming these symbolic items into trinkets is generally much bigger richer and more influential than the culture that originally created the symbolic items.However Tumblr antiappropriationists usually take this to ridiculous extremes by acting as if everything from a given culture were deeply significant. Either that or they think that cultural exchange is wrong even if there is no deep significance to the allegedly appropriated items or practices. Effectively this leads to cultural segregationism.,TiADiscussion,ck0fiff,1,t5_2zsos

2015911,0,t3_2htjby,Seeing how the term affirmative consent is used in other laws doesnt inspire confidence that you know what youre talking about. You do know that affirmative consent laws exist for things other than sexual conduct right? And that these laws act to remove part of the burden of proof from the accuserprosecutor?Feminists have been talking about this very thing using this very language to describe removing some of the burden of proof for sexual harassment. Their articles blogs and even books have been calling for an affirmative consent standard for sexual assault specifically so victims wont have to prove that consent didnt exist. The accused would instead have to prove that consent did exist otherwise the sexual activity is presumed to be assault. Theres a whole campaign based around the concept of yes means yes that directly opposes your hyperoptimistic view of this law.If this law really does nothing why is it being hailed as a way to make punishing offenders easier?  gt The affirmative consent standard will help change the revictimizing insensitive reporting procedures instead allowing students to seek help and hold perpetrators accountable said Meghan Warner chair of the University of California Associated Students Sexual Assault Commission. This is a major victory for all California students not just survivors. I hope the rest of the nation will follow suit.Meghan seems to know something you dont that the term affirmative consent has a meaning with very real legal consequences.

2017769,0,t3_2hup18,Theres a subtle difference between the feminists who want women to take control of their sexuality and the feminists who want women to not be objectified in the media by men. One could argue that this is the same position since objectification by men takes the control of sexuality out of the hands of women but there are enough differences that dont completely bridge these two factions so theres a ton of sublety and nuance which almost everyone on the internet has a problem with. Thats a conversation going on inside feminist theory right now so well see where that ends up. I personally favour the side that wants women to take control of their sexuality but I also see it as a family fight and not a civil war like some would like it to be its why Operation Fourth Wave was silly but they get points for effort.

Just thinking about ways of addressing problems without saying which groups of Americans are having those problems involves a lot of tonguetwisting where we end up talking about the same things and the same people anyway.

It also reinforces that these people are part of the country and are not bound by their ethnic origins.

Im okay with that since if I have BDD or Im not nonbinary or whatever I would like to know and make decisions accordingly.So feel free to poke me in future and see how Im getting on heheh.,TiADiscussion,cmtmrx4,2,t5_2zsos

They chose to address this issue by viciously attacking deriding misrepresenting and insulting the speaker.This is how feminism uses their limited resources. This is how feminism prioritizes its time. The fact is  When women are suicidal feminism consider their lives important. When trans people are suicidal feminism considers their lives important. When gay people are suicidal feminism considers their lives important. When straight cis men are suicidal feminism considers attacking them for speaking important.Because what feminism cannot does not and will not consider important is whether or not men live or die.And feminists do  and no dont queue up a merrygoround of excuses that feminists dont  feminists do care enormously about men supporting them. Feminists care enormously about telling men that men are obligated to care about their causes from rape culture to patriarchy to privilege to hero saves the princess plots in video games to man spreading. Feminists care enormously about criticizing men up and down the line for a nearinfinite ever expanding list of reasons with explicit  not implicit explicit  claims that men are morally obligated to care about these criticisms.And they do this while being unable to demonstrate sincere concern for whether or not a man lives or dies.If feminism has more important things to care about then whether i live or die then every single other thing I can do in my life is more important than supporting feminism up to and including spending my time here telling other men that feminism does not care whether they live or die and that they too should judge feminisms demands for their own commitment accordingly.EDIT for clarity organization and making this somewhat less of a wordwall,TiADiscussion,cncb4sx,11,t5_2zsos

I never actually worked in social studies I wound up subbing for a year and then getting certified in Biology over the summer because theres just not much demand for social studies teachers theres a lot of recent graduates with social studies ed degrees and administrators have the luxury of being picky about who they hire.

The whole toxic masculinity concept just doesnt really leave much room for any other aspects of masculinity to shine and seems to demonize mens desires over womens. The desire to have men not act like the stereotypical jock seems like what they want but then the discussion of benevolent sexism comes in when guys are nice to girls. It just seems like they know what they want but dont actually have a solution besides not have masculinity at all which seems to be driven by an idea that feminity is good so the opposite in masculinity is bad.Also I apologize if you did not appreciate the PM I sent you a couple days ago about your views on whether you appreciatesupport the actions the first and second wave got for women despite your ideas that feminism as a whole seemed to have a somewhat problematic origin. So sorry if that was the case.Edit Also what is your opinion on the transformation of feminism from an activist movement to an ideology?

2950052,0,t3_2ty7zo,gtThey seem more angry on the Internet perhaps its because theyre insecure about their own life?This is a side effect of the anonymity of online interaction. Due to a lack of tangible and direct consequences for what one does online people are often emboldened by it and basically become a hyperbole of themself. Its one of the reasons the Tumblr folk are actually more like a board like chan than they would admit. Im not ideologically comparing the two but rather commenting on the Horseshoe theory nature of an SJW mentality. They use this anonymity to justify and to act out their far left ideologies in the same way a person of the far right would. The ideologies themselves are different but the mental processes to arrive at the positions they do are similar. People in this community spend significant amounts of time with each other and on the same topics which leads to a thing in social psychology called group polarization where members of a certain position become more and more radical in their views because of the containment within the in group. That and the fact that most human beings suffer from some level of confirmation bias where they only take into account things they agree with and thus strengthen their positions.gtthere are real people hiding behind this veil of relative anonymityOf course there are. It is somewhat sad to see such hateful opinions and someone who lives in such a state of closed mindedness but ultimately to address your point about gtwhat can be done?I dont think much can be done. Im of the mindset that the true extremist positions like the prominent ones showcased on TiA come about from illogical mental processes as I said above. It doesnt really matter how they justify it they are pretty much stuck in that position by their own accord. As we see with the AMA with the former SJW this is something that only they can pull themselves out of  albeit seeing good neutral information and opinions cant hurt. I know this is a point often overlooked but I do think its important to consider the humanity behind the anonymity as you said. As clich as it is everyone is fighting a battle that we cant see and even if they act like an asshole and say terrible shit they deserve to be treated like a human being. After all isnt the ability to treat even the assholes like a human being with decency what separates anyway from being an asshole themself? Again many people will simply move on from these points of view as many extremists do and others wont. Treating them like shit will only feed into a persecution complex that would further entrench them in their views as they see the resistance as proof of being right. This is all very general but Im operating on how most extremism works coupled with the whole Internet anonymity thing.,TiADiscussion,co3fnp6,1,t5_2zsos

A study just came out on how trans children experience their gender in similar ways as their cis counterparts. So attempting to for example fix a trans girl so she thinks shes a boy would be psychologically identical to fixing a cis girl so she thinks shes a boy. The former would experience a body matchup the way the latter wouldnt but what becomes of that original person? Would they even be the same person?

People dont seem to understand that Israel and Israels actions do not represent Jewish people. I find it funny how only the most visible people usually Orthodox not saying that others arent attacked as well but Orthodox are obviously the most visible are attacked when they tend to be the most antiZionist as well. Just goes to show how much antisemitism is still prevalent even in the USA where they dominate higher positions and are over represented. Jewish privilege just isnt a thing outside of Israel.,TiADiscussion,coxk28q,4,t5_2zsos

3277955,0,t3_2xo8gg,Well gender is a very important label. If youre fairly comfortable with your gender you probably dont notice how frequently gender becomes relevant. But its literally everywhere all the time. You make little choices countless times every day that express your gender identity the way you refer to yourself the toilets and changing rooms you use the people you categorise yourself with... Saying gender isnt an important label is really just shortsighted. If you think more carefully and take more notice you will realise how important it really is.It also sounds like you are not distinguishing between sex and gender. Sex is the physical biological reality of our bodies. Most people fit roughly into a binary of male or female a smallish proportion of people are intersex meaning they have a mixture of characteristics in some way. Gender is an internal and subjective sense of identity. It can be related to sex for example some trans people have dysphoria because their physical sex does not match their internal identity but they are very much not the same thing.This makes things complicated for trans and nonbinary people. When you say we should be referred to by the gender we are youre actually talking about sex. You think that a nonbinary person with a penis should be called he and male and a man because of that penis. But if that persons gender identity is not that of a man and even moreso if they have physical dysphoria about their sex characteristics then being referred to in those ways is extremely distressing. It becomes more than an objective description of their body because people mix up sex and gender so much. Being called male wouldnt be upsetting if it really just mean person with a penis. But it doesnt just mean that. It means a whole bunch of other stuff that is associated with having the gender identity of a man.As for how or why people identify as nonbinary in the first place  I really dont know. All I know if that I find it uncomfortable and upsetting to be referred to as either a man or a woman. Its not that the stereotypes dont fit me like you said they dont find anyone really  its that the very idea of being placed into one of those groups of expectations and identities is completely jarring. And for the same reason I am bothered by being referred to by my physical sex except in very specific situations where it is relevant i.e. discussion of medical needs. Because being referred to by my sex isnt really just that  its being put into a category that doesnt fit just because of my physical characteristics. Id prefer that noone knew my physical sex or ideally that my physical sex wasnt binary at all so that they couldnt use that as justification for assuming my gender is binary too.,TiADiscussion,cp1ww13,1,t5_2zsos

And it keeps turning out like that.When it turns out that smear campaigns to isolate a victim are conducted by a percentage of the population equal to the kinds of people who do commit the horrendous crimes theyre accused of.How exactly are they going to react when ALWAYS BELIEVE THE VICTIM which theyve coded to mean always believe who I say the victim is collides with the fact that they were actually systematically targeting victims.Weve already seen attempts to reconcile these toxic beliefs Openly stating that its acceptable to ruin mens lives for the benefit of women what? flameouts trying to stick to their narrative the Duke Lacrosse case etc.Mostly I figure the pseudofeminist pseudoantisexist groups will try to exploit positive discrimination to say that all pain is equal but some pain is more equal than others but thats going to stop with children who are universally seen as more vulnerable than women and then I start wondering whats going to happen when women abusers are being validated for targeting their children and how theyre going to cope with that.gt This utterly confounds me.

Abusive parents raped by a schoolmate bullied in school ostracized by their community for being gay or black. The actual victims who are trying to make sense of a reality that is utterly hostile to them who are looking for a reason their pain is valid and their existence matters and who will latch on to the highconflict personalities as a way to derive a sense of self and selfesteem.So to me thats always been it.

That bandwagoning idiocy where if you dont immediately scream for the death of evil whitey youre automatically some kind of skinhead in disguise. That attempting to look at a situation objectively rather than as some grand avatar for greater social mechanisms makes you a shitlord.The kid shot a church full of black people. He was obviously racially motivated. He is probably mentally ill. He is poor. He is from South Carolina. He is white. He is male. None of those factors made him do it but all of them had a hand in why he did what he did to who he did it to. Yet he is treated like the avatar of every acceptable target demographic he fits in. He represents the ills of white people. Of men. He represents the pervasive culture of white racism.Its exactly what Fox News types do when they pick a particularly violent black criminal and parade him about. This kid then represents the ills of black people. Of thug culture. Of nontraditional families. Of poverty. He becomes the avatar of black violence.In one its white peoples fault this kid exists. In the other its black peoples fault this kid exists. When in reality each would have a multitude of reasons for acting the way they did. In all likelihood this kid would never have lashed out were he not poor. If he had a healthy support system. A better education. A better life. Just the same for the Fox News criminal.Its infuriating to watch people that decry Fox News for their biases and lack of logic when they report on the evil scary black criminal and then turn around and shout about the evil scary white criminal. Because had the person possessed a different skin tone theyd actually be looking at the situation instead of immediately shouting crap.The shooting itself is sad and sickening. Senseless loss of life like that is horrible. Families destroyed. People dead. Irreparable tears left in human hearts from the loss. These people need privacy and time to mourn. They need empathy and care. Not what they have gotten.Fuck the people that parade these types of events in pursuing an agenda.

4331447,0,t1_csdnbst,gt first wave had the backing of the KKK focused on getting booze banned. The right to vote was a side effect because women at the time were much more likely to vote in favor of banning the sale of alcohol and could be better leveraged as a political bloc.Thats an extremely disingenuous interpretation of how women got the right to vote and suffrage wasnt the first or only legal inequality they overturned in fact it was one of the last. The KKK didnt see an influx of temperance women and spontaneously say we should give them the vote because theyll vote for temperance! For one the KKK wasnt the the origin of the temperance more movement and wasnt the most important organization in that movement and for a second the suffragists already had a movement independent of temperance. This is also a very US centric view since the UK was where a lot of early feminist thought and agitation happened and where propertied women first gained enfranchisement tho I think they had universal suffrage a few years after the US.The first wave of feminism wasnt all Christian conservatives either. Early feminists like Cady Stanton and Susan B Anthony argued for the universal human rights for women and blacks alike from a secular natural rights perspective that posited that women should not only have equality under the law with men but also that women and men were fundamentally equal. Their organizations support for black rights and their antebellum support for abolition cause a huge rift in early feminism and the suffrage movement and it was their brand of radicalism that would later incorporate academic rigor to become second wave feminism.

Whether they come out and say they self diagnosed or not its always obvious theyre full of shit when they spout that kind of shit.I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was  but I didnt believe it... just thought I was a moody teenager. I got rediagnosed at  and put on meds. Over the last  years Ive gone to my shrink once a week I take my pills and Im working as hard as I possibly can to handle my shit. I had to do a medical withdrawal from a semester of college because my medications werent working for me and I lost my mind. My fiance has to deal with the nastiest craziest mood swings I say terrible things I act like the worst cunt you could imagine.Every time I selfdestruct because of my mood disorder I take responsibility for it. I cant totally control what I do when I have a swing but Ill never stop trying to prevent them. When I come back to sanity I take responsibility for the shit I said and did I apologize and try to plan for the future so I wont repeat the same mistakes hurt the people I love.These fucking kids act like because they think they have a mental disorder the world should bow and bend to them. They act like theyre not responsible for anything and should never be held accountable for their actions. They focus on yelling about people using abelist slurs like crazyinsanedelusional but those of us who actually have a fucking chemical imbalance happily own the fact that we are crazy insane and delusional.This is clearly something that really hits a note with me. The worst fucking part is that theyve taken away the safetysecurity some of us felt about telling people we have mood disorders. I used to not be shy about admitting that I have bipolar disorder to people even if I didnt know them well. Its the biggest defining characteristic of me and since Im medicated and working every day to get better I didnt feel ashamed or anything to tell people. Now I dont tell ANYONE Im not even sure if Ill submit this comment. Because why would anyone believe me? Having a mental illness is a tumblr thing right? Everyone claims they have that shit. Even though theyll never go into detail about what they have to the degree that legitimately diagnosed people can eg I have bipolar disorder type  with rapid swings plz find me one person on tumblr who ever even acknowledges there are multiple classifications of bipolar disorder. I feel obligated to back up the announcement of my diagnosis by listing off the medications I take just to prove Im legit.

4434147,0,t3_3brpp9,Hello. I am reading this post from Norway. I am however writing this in American and the internet itself is invented in the USA. In other words you have went from empty prairie to the center of the world in less than  years. Do you have any idea how freaking great for the world as a whole what white people and a little bit of black people have done in the US? You invented industrialism. You founded a country for the first time ever based on religious freedom. The US is or at least was the land of the free. Slavery had been common all over the world for thousands of years but it was first illegal in the US. Then a loophole caused one guy to be allowed to actually own a slave he happened to be black if that matters which opened up for actual owning of slaves making slave trade much more profitable and common. American history is the biggest success story for white people ever and the amount of horrible things done are actually quite low. at least compared to the rest of history Its basically just that they drove the indians off their land and held slaves like the rest of the world at that time which they are guilty of. It is unfortunate that there has been so much racism in the US though. However by being racist against each other one doesnt solve that that only makes an even bigger gap between people. I think colorblindness is the best way to avoid racism benevolent or not.

4536541,0,t3_3d4qft,This is myyyy topic! Here we go. I will be fair though...Im black and when I was younger I would say both white and black people expressed an equal amount of homophobia. But when I grew older the tide shifted and I found black people expressing it in harsher ways and white people became more tolerant and supportive. Personally Im not too fond of the white colonialist excuse. Mainly because I feel that people are responsible for their own actions and they can choose what they want to believe. I find this excuse dehumanizing as if to say black people have no control over their thoughts and do whatever the white man tells them to. I grew up in a strict religious household and despite being taught how evil the LGBT was I personally came to the conclusion that everything my church said was full of shit. And I dont see why others cant do the same. Homophobia in PoC communities is a big elephant in the room that somehow the press seems to look away from. Buzzfeed may be quick to pull tweets from white right wing conservatives but in my reality I might stumble into the BET comment section and read about how we are in the end of days and how disgusting I am for having a rainbow avatar. And thats just a sample of the nicer comments.Im not going to argue over which race is more homophobic or what not but I would like to see social justice communities especially the mainstream press spend more time encouraging LGBT equality within PoC communities. I think its a thing weve been ignoring for too long and the white colonialist argument gives people an excuse to continue behaving terribly to LGBT youth. To put it this way complaining about white people doesnt fix the situation Im in but reaching out educating and encouraging tolerance in PoC communities will do wonders to my quality of life. ,TiADiscussion,ct2gnwd,3,t5_2zsos

4592932,1,t3_3dw8at,Im fascinated by how the western narrative of trans is not universal. The western narrative takes the issue of trans very seriously and indeed why not. So that to be trans is extraordinary bad fortune and that the people who suffer by being born in the wrong body as the narrative coheres cannot be dismissed as faddish or and this tends to be the greater criticism as fetish. This narrative however is greatly undermined by the looser reality in nonwestern countries of trans individuals. In my last job around  of my students were trans. They were typically the prettiest girls in the room. But their behaviour tended to have an ironic twist. Sometimes for example they would lift their skirts to show their underwear to their classmates. In other words they didnt quite believe it themselves. Of course the counterargument is to make the Hegelian point that to be a woman requires recognition of the other. One of my students took me by surprise when as she put it she was manhunting during the lunch break. She told me that she became a girl because she could get more guys. She said her heart was a mans. This is obviously a rejection of an ontological trans position. It has a doubleimpact since people judging trans will be more accommodating the more beautiful the transgirl is this is of course wrong but it is the way of the world. Knowing all this and the way they clearly undermine the western narrative of Im a woman born in the wrong body to what extent are you prepared to moderate. mediate away from the pofaced current narrative. I note a deep conservatism in the trans position a desire to be mainstreamed and for gender to remain a clear cut divide. And this conservatism shows up its more unpleasant side by the trans demonification of men who like trans as tranny chasers. If you accept my claim that the western position of Truth on this issue is simply a currently dominant truth with a small t then the issue broadens.You obviously could not suffer from gender disjunction if you were the only person on earth. It must be the product of the valences of the dialectical relations with others. So the western narrative Im trapped in a mans body despite being contingent has had a huge effect on your life. Im intrigued how you balance the historical contingency of your condition and the nature of your identity. EDIT I note that Ive been downvoted. This is in line with expectations. The dominant narrative will always punish awareness of its contingency. Part of the western narrative is to claim a universalism. Indeed it can only live with this condition. I should point out that I am deeply in favour of queer rights and strongly campaigned for them. ,TiADiscussion,ct9j6kt,2,t5_2zsos
4596993,0,t3_3dz95p,Like most people here there are multiple reasons. I might not get them all and Im sure I will find a couple here and think oh man how could I forget that? Perhaps most important is how they take legitimate issues of racism sexism and antigay sentiments and hijack them for their own narcissistic purposes of self aggrandizement. Look at me and how RIGHTEOUS I am! I saw the same thing growing up with fundie Christians in the South. Its not about Jesus but about making sure everyone else sees how much you love Jesus. Then theres the ideological dogmatism. To most SJWs there is not any room for discussion or disagreement. Now within the confines of their little political cult thats fine. But thats not the end game. For all of the SRSs talk of Freeze Peach the point that private entities are not bound by the First Amendment is correct. But thats not where it ends. Advocating the advent of hate speech laws is almost universal among SJWs and its done under the Orwellian premise that hate speech isnt free speech. But thats not even the endgame. Many advocate outlawing cultural appropriation which is not even something that exists. Basically the most adamant committed SJWs are not big on civil liberties and as hyperbolic as it may sound I am convinced that if God forbid they were ever to have any real power some people would eventually end up in concentration camps. I find the chances of this happening to thankfully be very remote though not impossible.  Related to this is their wholesale explicit rejection of Enlightenment values. Im not just talking about civil liberties but about core concepts of Western thought like logic and empiricism. There was a thread on here a couple of days ago about SJWs rejecting science itself. This is an unfortunate trend that has infected the social sciences like a virus we can never be completely objective therefore objectivity as a goal is not worth striving for. Postmaterialism is more dangerous than a form of intellectual nihilism  it can be used to justify absolutely anything. If logic itself can be rejected on the basis that its a Western concept with its roots in imperialistic racist patriarchal oppression and words themselves are tools of oppression then anything goes. Anyway thats just off the top of my head. Edit added a few words and reworded some stuff. ,TiADiscussion,cta1ila,25,t5_2zsos

I understood although at parts disagreed with everything you said in this comment long before you wrote this down. I wasnt asking for the difference between what CHS calls the wage gap and what CHS calls the earnings gap I was asking what the difference between wages and earnings is. I thought this would be clear when I said CHS differentiation between the two was like differentiating between water and HO.gtyour wages your rate of pay are the same but your earnings what you take home are not. That distinction between wage and earning is completely arbitrary. I could just as easily say your earnings your rate of pay and your wage what you take home and it would make just as much sense. The words have completely interchangeable meanings and as the Oxford English Dictionary points out wage often refers to what CHS calls earnings. CHS is framing the wage gap as something that only refers to someones hourly rate despite the fact that that isnt the only definition of wage and despite the fact that this isnt how many feminists and even the white house folks use the term. Its intellectually dishonest and aims to create exactly the kneejerk wage gap dont real! reaction you displayed every time the gap comes up. ,TiADiscussion,ctvj6mh,0,t5_2zsos

5175225,0,t3_3ltyqx,As with many things in life its complicated. I worked an EMS Bus in the NYC East Village during the s and s so this is mainly based on my personal observations over the years in dealing with the rather diverse population therein. Yes in my experience Trans individuals tend to have a substantially higher mortality rate. This comes from a number of factors and while some of it is from violence not as much as is sometimes implied. Nor is the trans nature of the individuals typically a direct cause or reason for said violence. Suicide  As others have said Suicide rates are incredibly high among trans. Insanely high. lets be frank with ourselves at the root of it all the individuals mind and body do not match. The person is by definition not at home of comfortable in their own skin if you were. Thats a lot of mental stress.  Death by misadventure ie drug overdose  Probably the number  killer in the trans community. Remember there is often a lot of related issues going on with the trans individuals. Other deeper psych diagnosis. Self medicating and substance abuse is common. As are the results of doing such things. Violence  Due to a number of reasons. Being socially ostracized having low income as a result other underlying psych issues drug and alchohol issues trans tend more often than not to end up living on the fringes. In places rife with conflict violence and crime. Most are not Jenner type millionaires. Further the trans community itself can be a rather tightly wound group. Rather like a bag of cats. A lot of people under a lot of mental stress and tension. Things under tension will often snap. I hate to put it quite this way but back in the day one of the things I was always taught when dealing with the NYC trans community is there is always a knife. Make sure you know where it is and that the patient has no intention of showing it to you. As I said things under tension will sometimes snap. Those living on the fringes will take steps to protect themselves and what little they have. Sometimes these two facts meet in a nasty way.Some of the issues that lead to increased mortality in this community can be lessened by greater social acceptance. Mainly those that relate to the trans individuals being able to earn an honest wage and live in someplace other than a demilitarized zone. But the death rate will still be absurdidly high from suicide and substance abuse. Those can only be addressed individual by individual.Just my c from all the scenes and calls I handled over the years. ,TiADiscussion,cv9szd0,18,t5_2zsos

5227572,0,t3_3mkgeh,gtHe used the word structure in the most bizarre way also unsupported by the dictionary and Im still unsure by what exactly he was trying to say. Can anyone help me out here?Sociologists often use the term to describes organizational aspects of social systems. In other words How do the various elements of a society relate to one another? When a sociologist talks about structural inequality generally what they mean is that the inequality is a consequence of the relationships of the social systems being examined. As and example consider this graph       ABC      |      DHere we have a graph that maps out the relationships between four social agents. A social agent is just a unit that acts in society. They could be individuals families corporations whatever. An exchange theorist would say that B is a high power actor in this network because if A C or D want to interact with one another they must go through B. That fact gives B a lot of leverage in any sort of exchange that occurs within the network. The power imbalance in this network is explained in terms of the relationships of agents to one another so we say the distribution of power in the network is structural.  In my experience laymen are prone to the misuse of Sociology jargon. When discussing social issues someone might be tempted to pepper certain terms into their conversations without fully understanding what sorts of ideas a particular word is meant to convey. But you can see that it isnt actually that hard to present an explanation for the meaning of the word admittedly this explanation is simplistic but you get the point. If someone asks What do you mean by structural? and a person cannot offer a coherent explanation or resorts to insults then that is an indication that they probably dont know what they are talking about.     ,TiADiscussion,cvg43j4,10,t5_2zsos

Beyond that Id say that theres a difference in the way you feel and the way you act in response to feelings. Its clearly not a choice for anyone to feel gender dysphoria but its clearly a choice to transition. Im sure that youre aware that transitioning isnt a cureall for all of the issues associated with gender dysphoria from what Ive seen postop transgender people still have higher suicide rates and other worse outcomes than people without gender dysphoria. Even if you dont see it as a real choice i.e. you think that the pros of transitioning massively outweigh the cons such that no person with gender dysphoria could rationally choose to not transition I think theres still a problem in that transitioning covers a broad spectrum of activities. Again clothing hair style etc. are unquestionably choices...but they also seem to be somewhat significant components of transitioning. If you say that having a ponytail doesnt make someone a woman youre basically left with the two original possibilities either biological sex is what makes a woman a woman or woman simply refers to anyone who believes that they are a woman.For the record I want to make sure that youre aware that Im not trying to minimize your feelings or anything. I just think that of the two major viewpoints sex  gender GID  mental condition and sex ! gender GD  physical condition that should be treated with SRSHRT the former makes more sense. ,TiADiscussion,cvigjet,1,t5_2zsos

5356933,0,t3_3oda11,Yeah I am pretty far left leaning as are some of my favourite podcasts.The obvious example is the Skeptics Guide to the Universe. Solid all around podcast with Rebecca Watson occasionally ruining topics with her SJW freakouts. Since she left at the end of last year it has been infinitely better. It was becoming very tiring hearing her cash in her victim bucks when the latest internet troll calls her a cunt.Another podcast I listen to is about current issues what young people are thinking about the world politics etc  triple j Hack lately these SJW viewpoints keep worming their way into the discussions.For example there was a ridiculous political beat up about  dont tax our periods backgroundAussies pay a  tax on almost all goods and services. A small number of things are given exemptions like condoms and sunscreen. This was because when the law was coming in  years ago a small political party held enough influence that they could save a few products from the extra tax and they chose a small number of  public healthsafety products. Womens hygiene products were not exempted.Now its a huge feminist issue because condoms are tax free and tampons arent.... they are not the same type of product or equivalent in any way and . of products out there have the tax applied but apparently that enough to be angry about.There was another radio issue where at a comedy show a comedian told a rape joke and a feminist in the audience heckled him and freaked out. He gave a bit back and suddenly the media is tearing him apart for verbal violence towards women you cant make this shit up.Lately the whole thing seems to be about domestic violence towards women. Not in general only towards women and more specifically when its perpetrated by men. Any attempt at laying some facts out about how men are victims too lots of children are also murdered by women even how other women kill women is quickly shouted down.Honestly it can be quite upsetting.

I know nothing of Korean but I assume it is similar in this aspect. And if your name does translate perfectly to Korean then not using it while talking to Koreans makes no sense. If nothing else it is a flag that youre interested in Korean culture.

She is interested in Mexican culture and on her Instagram she assigned herself a Spanish name. She also went on a mission to Mexico recently. This is the behavior of the overwhelming majority of mankind. They are proud of their cultural achievements and want to share them with others. Think about what culture is...its a vague set of customs foods clothing beliefs etc. The popularity of all of those things is measured by how many people use them other people adopting aspects of your culture means that your culture is in some sense winning.gtAnother argument I hear is that by assigning yourself a Korean name you are being ignorant because you never had to suffer being bullied for your name or people not being able to pronounce it This is ignorant there are few people on Earth whose names are more difficult to pronounce than the Polish and theyre pretty pretty white.

Funny enough that guy later became his friend and when he was over at my house like  years later and he brought it up in front of her and she was rather upset as she was STILL in denial. My dad didnt go to jail he was drafted around the same time  and the judge basically did a boys will be boys thing and said you will be punished in nam basically. Dads laterfriend refused to testify as well. It was gang violence related. Another thing is my brothers friends mom. His friend who was a sociopath who did drugs and abused animals was seen abusing their families dog. The mom was in complete and total denial about her children and blamed every other kid in the neighborhood for things her kids did. She tried to press charges or called the police on? keep in mind I was  so idk the whole story on that front on my brother for that abuse and claimed he sold this kid drugs. My brother was basically a basement nerd who played games like Ultima Online all day and probably called weed a marijuana cigarette. Later on both of her kids went to prison for drug dealing. I heard the animal abuser kid owned a pet shop later I shudder to think about it. Their mom was nutjob levels of denial and their kids acted like Eric Cartmen. Gave them everything they wanted the one kid was fat as fuck even and talked like Eric. I remember once he got a Sega Genesis for EASTER of all holidays and he wanted a SNES so he threw it against the wall and demanded a SNES. He got the SNES.My brother stopped hanging around with him after that dog event. ,TiADiscussion,d1lwvby,3,t5_2zsos

7732756,0,t3_4bwd39,Im halfLatino Portuguese and Mexican which is SUPER common where Im from and half Euromutt. I grew up poor in California and then poor in Nevada. We moved constantly because of evictions or work concerns   I went to  elementary schools and  junior high schools. I got all of the excellent benefits of living poor bad schools police harassment assumptions that Im stupid or lazy or dirty or sneaky when people found out where I live...its nice.I have light skin and white features. I have green eyes. You dont really ever hear about discrimination in the Latino community except the typical darker people are not as desirable narrative. Within the Mexican community though if youre white looking youre not Mexican. You dont belong and its clear. When I first moved to Nevada I was too Mexican to hang out with the white kids too. You live WHERE? At best I was called poor white trash. At worst I was a wannabe spic. Its exactly as OP has it  Im white looking so my nonwhite identity is out the window. I dont get to be Latino regardless of the fact that I grew up in Latino neighborhoods identify as Latino and AM Latino because Im not dark enough. The Social Justice movement tells me Im white and have white privilege at  after having gotten an education on my own after having worked for  years as a bilingual laborer this white guy speaks Spanish!  I guess I finally get to fit the profile because I was finally able to afford a nice car and white looking features. I dont get pulled over like I used to. I work in an office now and wear a neat little suit so I dont get followed around in stores like I used to. After years of being alienated from both sides of my ethnic background Ive come to the conclusion that I dont give a damn. I stopped trying to have an ethnic identity and identify as poor. I will freely admit Im biased against people with money and people who have never really worked. I distrust the system in every form. What remains for me now though is being shouted at by privileged angry white children suffering from survivors guilt about how Im a piece of shit. Im in a Masters Program at a prestigious East Coast school for mental health counseling now and Im taking a course in Multicultural Counseling. Were reading Sue and Sue they literally defined the Social Justice narrative. Im a distance student so my teachers dont know anything about me other than my writing style. Im in agreement with the ideals of social justice. I have not had great dealings with the Social Justice Movement. On facebook my white looking picture gets me plenty of hate from SJWs because Im a privileged Cis White Male. In class the assumption  I havent corrected anyone yet  is also that Im a Privileged Cis White Male because with the exception of one black guy every other guy in the class is a Cis White Male so since I didnt say Im black I must be part of the problem. Really what I am is someone who has been denied ethnicity and inclusion from both sides of my own blood for nearly forty years and now Im being told what a shit head I am. Im smart enough to hold my tongue in class discussions. Even very mild disagreement is construed as condoning racism. I was reprimanded for the tone of my comments about concerns with some of the fallacies present in our text I watered down my comments so much they were almost nonexistent too.

7741130,0,t1_d3lptmt,It may have something to do with how the media portrays male friendships as well. Say youre an individual who gets most of their information about social interaction from television and movies. A lot of the time when men are together in media their conversation is about women partying or other macho things. The only time men in media generally show any kind of tenderness or emotion is to their love interest. So it becomes part of the accepted media grammar that if a man is being emotional or sweet or kind to someone they must be romantically involved. Pair this understanding with very little interaction with men in real life or worse a general fear of men which Id be willing to bet is the case for a lot of the more tumblry parts of the crowd and you get complex male relationships boiled down to they want to bang. I think something important is missed if you make Steve and Bucky gay. First off their social narrative isnt exactly progressive what with them being born in the early s and raised in that culture. Secondly and more importantly a lot of the dynamic between the two the reason they work as friends when their story first starts is because of women. Steve isnt good with them or appealing Bucky is. Hell Steve remembers all of Buckys girls by name. Steves emotional narrative is built partly off of this. It motivates most of the first movie the lack of a counterpart hurts him in the second movie and the death of the only woman to give him time makes him want to salvage the only remaining part of his past. Youd be changing a superficial aspect of the characters in a way that would harm the roots. ,TiADiscussion,d3m3zf7,15,t5_2zsos

It is just what parts of their believe system end up doing. If you remember the Catholic molestation cases what happened there is that the deference and respect the catholic clergy commanded ended up enabling pedophiles to abuse these positions of trust. Catholics certainly werent trying to enable pedophilia. Same with feminists... Female victimhood is a central part of their ideology feminist inspired policies usually automatically ascribe the victim role to the woman in DV situations because that narrative fits their preconceived notions of men and women better than the actual stats do. This automatic trust in female victimhood ends up enabling women who are actually perpetrators. So.. youre right that progress doesnt come instantly. Lets progress then.

8778800,0,t3_501pxp,I know a few cases but Ill only detail the oneA girl I went to high school with. She was from an immigrant family who sheltered her and pushed her to succeed. She graduated high school struggled in college and eventually graduated with a degree in a field she dreamed about as a child but didnt actually like once she was in it. After college graduation she moved out of town and struggled in her field. She became hyper focused on swing dancing a hobby she had in college which became her social circle. She went from super stuckup and prude to hyper sexual and flirty before having a bad experience that sounded like sexual assault. From there she became hyper political hyper feminist and hyper sensitive in regards to gender. I havent seen her in person for a few years but the growing intolerance and hyper sensitivity were apparent last time I did. Her Facebook posts are attended by dozens of likes and comments from radfem women and the occasional guy who spends all of his time apologizing for being born male. Anyone who disagrees is harassed shamed and then deleted while the echo chamber congratulates themselves on silencing the oppressor.My take? She went from a highly structured environment with her parents to college where she found freedom and floundered to real life where she struggled to support herself. Then she lived a consequencefree lifestyle until reality caught up with her in the worst way. Now she has no real career has understandable emotional trauma and lives in a feminist echo chamber where she hides from her emotional issues rather than dealing with them.

My life is going to be shitty because theres baggage that comes with being trans. Janet Mock is trans and black which means her life is shitty because theres baggage that comes with being trans and theres baggage that comes with being black.Privilege is not having a particular disadvantage and just because you have one disadvantage doesnt mean you may have another this is where intersectionalty comes in to play when discussing something with someone who has more than one when you yourself dont have the extra disadvantages.If we look at white privilege from a historical lens it was still a thing. People talk about the historic persecution of Irish immigrants but its important to know that they were persecuted on the grounds that they werent seen as white.Yeah your life isnt going to be perfect because you dont have one of the disadvantages but a disadvantage is a disadvantage.

9397908,0,t1_d96zygm,This is some amazing fucking historical revisionism. Its clear you dont know a fucking thing about eastern Europe or Soviet policies.Like every single paragraph is objectively wrong. gt In fact the level of life there was quite high.Fucking no less than Khrushchev himself noticed the massive disparity between life in the Soviet Union and the US. Quality of life in the Eastern Bloc was always significantly less than the US and remained significantly less after Europe recovered from WW.gtThen  happened all these countries cried for the dissolution of the bloc and indeed it happened  bloodlessly mind you. Youd think for a brutal dictatorship without social liberties thats not too shabby but thats not the point.Ignoring the hardliners demands to break the protests with military force which Gorbachev opposed explicitly because he knew that the Soviet Union could be dragged into a bloody interstate war across most of Eastern Europe. This policy nearly lead to him being killed in a coup attempt.The fall of the Soviet Union was entirely inevitable by  and all he managed to do was create a controlled decent. Thats not a not brutal authoritarian regime its a popular revolt.This also ignores that the collapse of the eastern bloc had been happening for several years prior to  from anticommunist and prodemocracy protests in several countries including Poland and Romania. Again Romanias revolution was comparably bloodless but thats because it was an open popular revolt across the country against the entirety of the Ceausescu regime nearly all at once. That didnt make him not brutal.gtThese brave independent governments enjoyed their independence fully. Well on paper at least. In reality they trashed the infrastructure that was left there by the Soviets and found themselves economically incapable of adapting to a capitalist society. Again no. The planned economy was designed in such a way as to accurately describe it as Soviet Imperialism. Their infrastructure was not well built to be sustainable among themselves but to make them dependent on Russia. No one went about blowing up their own bridges after the Soviets and communists were forced from government. Sometimes infrastructure was left purposely in disrepair as a warning. In the words of an East Berlin friend of mine whom I met years after German unificationThe Soviets made sure never to repair some of the damage from World War  in certain parts of Berlin. It was a reminder to what they could do to us.gtIn short they were incapable of utilizing the soviet legacy.Soviet Legacy was a lot of very old equipment that was often in disrepair. This was also the common case in Russia. The Soviet Union and by definition the Eastern Bloc was in serious economic trouble for years long before the collapse. Who the hell is telling you this crap?gtI can only compare it to what happened in Africa after the colonial powers pulled out... albeit with none of the war or genocide.So your comparing the socially liberal policies of Russian and European Imperialists? This is a bad plan.gtIn fact there was  and does still exist  an illusion that the western europe would welcome them with open arms the moment they drop the Bloc. The only country that welcomed people with open arms was the Germans and they realized how crazy a proposal it was because they had no idea how bad things had gotten in East Germany. Western Europe did welcome old soviet bloc nations so long as they could fix themselves and not have to become totally dependent on the rest of Europe for everything. This is what happened and we can see this in Poland the Czech Republic  Slovakia and Eastern Germany.gtIm also really unaware what I as a Russian citizen lack in social and economic liberties that western Europeans enjoy. Id love to be enlightened on that.Jesus dude youre this badly informed on your own history. I didnt think the revisionism was that strong.gtRight to free speech and a just court of law? You dont have this. Straight up you dont. Theres nothing to suggest that you do. Ill grant you its better than the old Soviet days but you still really dont have the same right to free speech that any American Englishman German or Frenchman would recognize.gtGender equality?The Soviets always talked a big game but the lack of actual and consistent representation of women in areas that werent traditionally recognized for women showed that their attitude towards gender equality was mostly about tokenism or just a total farce.The reason for that is because communist doctrine relied on the idea of traditionalist values where as the west was always trying to infiltrate and degrade good society with ridiculous notions. Authoritarians love focusing on tradition because it creates a strong cultural affiliation to keeping things the same and not supporting revolution.Take the list of female astronauts for example. The first female astronaut was from the Soviet Union. Many decades before the first US female astronaut. It looks like they achieved gender equality long ahead of the Americans. However the Soviet Union had only one additional female astronaut after her. And they flew  missions.But looking at that list after Sally Ride the Americans had many and continuously. On top of that many flew on multiple missions.Theres no question that in the US misogyny and actual patriarchal standards explicitly prevented women from getting into science let alone the astronaut program. But once that barrier was broken women stayed. In the Soviet Union they didnt. Instead they were just used as an example to claim that they had gender equality. Thats not equality its tokenism.For an easy American comparison look at black representation in congressDuring our Reconstruction period after the American Civil War the Republican Party which had control of the federal government created governing bodies that specifically targeted the black vote in former confederate states in order to get reelected. Many black congressmen were put into political office in this time. As reconstruction ended  black people started to lose positions of power within all of those southern governments because of concerted efforts by white supremacist politicians and groups in the US. Youll notice that there are just one or two for a couple decades once the th century begins.If I were to claim that America had achieved racial equality as early as  and point to pictures of those first AfricanAmerican congressmen it would obviously be a farce. They were literally taken out of power by racist groups. Racism in America lasted far longer than that. The Soviet Union did the same thing with their female astronauts.,TiADiscussion,d9791hc,4,t5_2zsos

9619334,0,t1_d9wgaq6,Oh I agree that its not impossible but its not without costs including raising the price of consumer goods which will then generate its own backlash. The problem is this youll find that the exact same people who talk about how awful it is that jobs have moved to other countries are the same people who major bargainhounds and will gladly buy the cheapest products they can regardless of where they are produced. So imagine that youre a family thats having a hard time affording sending your kids to college. A major industry like textiles gets brought back to the United States but production costs rise along with consumer costs. Now the family has to pay more for clothes. At the same time production is much more automated than it was before that industry left in the s so only th of the workforce is needed. Or if costs can somehow be kept down even then you will not see the return of numbers of factory workers you would have had in the s and s.Take Elon Musks warning seriously.

So it looks like a social construct but beneath the surface its a biological construct. gt Have you ever looked up gender in a dictionary?Yes I know the dictionary definition. But it only has an elementary usefulness in this kind of discussion since it relates to common use of the word but not the theoretical discussion about it. If dictionary definitions are fluid changing over time as word usage changes then you cant view definitions in a fixed way. gt every major dictionary describes gender as a persons social roles. You are literally incorrect.The assumption you make is that my position must align with that of dictionary definitions to be correct when in fact its still open for discussion what gender is and what its based on. You assume divergence from the common understanding of what gender is means one is incorrect but it is in fact the common understanding of gender which is incorrect. All the definition really tells us anyway is that the common usage of the word refers to social roles not that gender actually is that  just that thats how many people view it. gt I really dont understand your denial of the definitions of words.Im not denying the definitions of words I just realize that definitions are irrelevant here. You cant make the truth a particular way by simply defining it as such  reality doesnt conveniently conform to meet definitions. I seems like you cannot differentiate between the label and the thing that is labelled. Like how the sun is what it is regardless of what we call it or in what language we refer to it. Whatever gender is however it works is the way it is independent of how we choose to label or define it.gt Though it is a common misconception to think gender and sex are the sameI assure you I recognize they are distinct things but sex affects gender greatly  its the biggest causal factor affecting gender. You cant pretend they have no connection to eachother. they are in fact intertwined. gt youll find that all psychologists sociologists etc. Have a consensus on this.I see. So the least scientifically rigorous and most ideologically biased disciplines of science all agree on something so it must be true. Just like the consensus told us that the world was flat and the sun went round the earth. Often those who go with consensus do so when they happen to agree with it anyway but the moment its not convenient they will ignore it. But free thinkers ignore consensus. Its unreliable and leads to an echo chamber closed off to new insights and nonconforming ideas. Intellectual diversity is important.gt I honestly dont understand how a person can be so dense that they try to change the meaning of a word thats remained unchanged for half a century just because they dont understand it.Because they are not dense they do understand it and realize that dictionary definitions only reflect common understanding of things and change over time to reflect what people believe and while dictionaries are useful if you dont know the meaning of a word in a theoretical discussion a dictionary is of little value. Its just a crutch. gt Honestly this is very difficult to explain to nontransgender people. Misgendering somebody is a serious deal. How would you feel if people kept referring to you as the wrong pronoun even after you correct them?Look I understand its hard for transpeople I really do in fact Im very close to a transwoman myself. She has to deal with people looking at her and judging every day and people not understanding her etc. But she realizes you cant blame people for not understanding the trans issue  its counter intuitive to think that someone is a female trapped in a male body or visa versa. And so the way to get through to people is patiently explaining what gender dysphoria and transgenderism is not having a go at them for not using the pronouns transpeople want to be referred to as. And it is overdone the whole use the correct pronouns thing because because it demonizes people and portrays it as the worst thing that could happen ever. Its overdone and it puts people off trying to understand the issue. gt This is splitting hairs... the sex youre assigned at birth is the same as your chromosomal sex in every case besides a few exceptions for intersex peoplewhich is incredibly rareIts not splitting hairs its important because if gender is assigned and not already objectively the case it would mean that gender is just something arbitrarily imposed to everyone at birth  which is preposterous but what the constructivists want us to believe.  ,TiADiscussion,d9zhhlo,2,t5_2zsos

10769366,0,t1_ddqq9hx,Yeah youre sort of misreading me but its okay. I should have covered how the MLK movement actually managed to crack the codeAssert the humanity and dignity of nonwhite people assert the injustice done to them but always with encouragement invitation and love.  Not colorblindness but not racebaiting either colorblindness is the goal not something you can just wish into being. The problem is that he got killed before he could go all out on class. Never mind that MLK may well have survived to today depending on how his health went if he even got  more years then American politics is RADICALLY different than today  likely you have more working class whites stay in the left coalition while you have less radicalized black people the death of MLK and Malcolm X made a LOT of blacks give up on integration which was the precursor to a lot of the SJW concepts you see today. Basically the death of MLK created a negative feedback loop in which black people are radicalized and act out against the law which causes whites be antagonistic against civil rights which makes more blacks be more radical so on and so forth. This pushes working class whites into the conservative camp which likely also delayed them coming around on LGBT rights feminism and other social justice issues and allows them to retrogress into the old attitudes towards blacks just hidden behind dog whistle politics which was a deliberate rightwing strategy as per Atwateretc which fuels  years of GOP rule the effects of which fall heavily on black people. If MLK survives a lot of this doesnt happen which means you have a stronger more robust left movement and the GOP remains relatively moderate because of that.,TiADiscussion,ddqs3sh,4,t5_2zsos

Im not a politician and I dont have the budget for professional speechwriters to analyze every phrase for the possibility of selective quotation.Instead I have to rely on the practice of inserting qualifications or clarifications of meaning close enough to use e.g. in the same sentence for HONEST readers to understand what the point is.gtThese are all derivative of the need to reproduce where need means the necessity that every one of our ancestors logically needed to reproduce for us to come into existence.In the case of circumcision you have two completely independent practices with completely independent histories one of which was deliberately renamed after the other to grant it greater legitimacy.  This is important to point out.Each of these practices is biologically gender specific so that the derivation from reproductive constraints is so mindbogglingly obvious that it sounds silly to state.  But I will state it.Women with penises cant reproduce.  Therefore women dont have penises.  Therefore Jews etc. dont even consider to circumcise their women.A similar logic applies to the other practice now called FGM in the West and known by its practitioners by various other names.  Men dont have vaginas or clitorises so it is never even considered to practice FGM on men.EDIT ....and there you go.  You got me to answer stupid questions.

11367593,0,t1_dfk2cqa,Thats not what I was saying. I think there are many problems outside of myself and outside my nations political climate that I would like to see addressed and resolved. A big one for me is seeing Islam undergo a reformation and ensuring the freedom equality safety and independence of groups oppressed under Islam in the Muslim world atheists LGBTQ women etc.. I am not personally affected by this yet it is something that I deeply care about. I recognize there is a problem in the Muslim world and I would like to see it resolved. I cannot say the same thing for SJWs or at least the ones in my social circle. They deny there are undesirable elements within Islam or shift the conversation away from the problem of oppression within Islam to issues that directly affect them whether manufactured or not. In my previous comment I was referring to people who manufacture outrage for political reasons. You can see this in Suey Parks campaign to CancelColbert over a clearly satirical joke or Anita Sarkeesians Tropes vs. Women in Video Game series or the whole Hugh Mungus fiasco etc. These people understand that words and outrage can be used to manipulate others perceptions and they use it as a tool for political gain. ,TiADiscussion,dfkhtjh,3,t5_2zsos
11371338,0,t3_626qop,Its not academia as a whole but the academic humanities specifically. They arent constrained by facts and reason in the same way the sciences are but they want to go through the same motions and pretend to have similar credibility. Most erroneously theyre allowed to selfregulate just like other more legitimate academics. Its right for astronomers to be the only ones judging the competence and value of other work in astronomy biochemists for biochemistry and so on because experts are the only ones who understand the work. We have to trust them and although theyre not perfect thats a good system. However the academic humanities have latched onto the same standards and abused that trust. Theyre overrun with people who lack interesting defensible ideas so instead of coming up with better ones they just try to dress up their bad ideas in insanely elaborate obfuscated language. They pull fancysounding words from all kinds of places including the hard sciences especially quantum mechanics with no regard for their actual meanings. They fawn over those who write the most flowery and incomprehensible gibberish. When somebody outside their club takes the time to decipher their nonsense they claim only they as experts can really understand it. But thats not true their situation is not like the hard sciences. Any genuinely interesting idea in the humanities can be easily communicated in plain language. It really is not rocket science. Those who pretend its similarly complicated are faking to cover up their lack of good ideas.The newer humanities have always been a prolific source of bullshit brilliantly exposed by the Sokal Hoax and its fallout but theyve become far more harmful with the rise of the Identity Studies. Now when the bullshit artists want financial support they can claim some sort of prejudice on behalf of administrators who turn them down. Nobody can tell them theyre wrong because theyre experts and nobody can deny them support because thats prejudice. This con game is a cancer on academia and its devastatingly undermining the reputation of academia as a whole. Thats a shame because the nation now more than ever needs to start trusting legitimate academic experts on issues like climate change conservation trade tax policy etc.,TiADiscussion,dfkx4op,17,t5_2zsos
