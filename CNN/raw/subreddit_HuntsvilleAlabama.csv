62916,0,t3_1usrpp,Legalizing pot isnt really an issue I care too much about either way.  However I think its really stupid to waste resources on prosecuting and imprisoning people for minor pot usage when there are real crimes those resources should be used for.  A friend of the family used it back in the s for pain related to cancer so I understand its medical uses.As someone else said theres still the insanity of dry counties in this state.

430207,0,t3_1z00wd,Thank you for finally mentioning this. Its been bugging me for some time now how otherwise helpful and informative posts and comments are being downvoted into oblivion. Go look in any post for the last month or so  almost everything post and comments has at least one downvote and maybe more. This didnt used to happen.I will say that it has curtailed my commenting activity on rHuntsvilleAlabama. Several times now Ive gotten into typing a reply and then thought no this is just going to get downvoted by whoever has a beef with this sub for whatever reason. I got really tired of trying to write a thoughtful comment just to see | or | and no other votes because of the scoring algorithm that shifts it to the bottom.At the end of the day yes they are just Internet points. But we do attach meaning to them and when everything you post gets downvoted you kinda want to stop contributing.I guess what Im trying to say is that I dont think we can counter whoever has decided to downvote things just by talking or by mod activity. The right way should be to upvote more to offset the downvotes. And if you do feel the need to downvote explain why.,HuntsvilleAlabama,cfpctq3,15,t5_2qq6o

A lot of those conveniences  are things men might not think of  regardless of your stance on feminism the fact remains that more women stay at home than men and are likely going to be the ones who would  think of things like the pantrykitchen right by the garage for unloading groceries.

1545371,0,t3_2boycs,Unfortunately there are animals being euthanized every week not just at Huntsville Animal Services but also at rural shelters such as Athens dog Pound and Scottsboro shelter.  This isnt anything new that they are having to put down animals.  Sometimes not because of health issues but because of lack of space.    The shelters try and keep everything as clean as possible but its impossible to keep every animal healthy that comes through.  Kennel cough is a common problem with dogs and there is ALWAYS a risk when taking in an animal from a shelter that it could have an illness.  Kennel cough is just like the flu dogs catch it coughing on each other and having running noses.  Just like kids at school who pass it around.  With antibiotics it goes away.  People need to know that they are accepting the risk getting a shelter animal.  What you see is what you get and you take the animal home that day.  They do minimal vetting which is why adoption fees are so low.  If you want to adopt an animal with a  clean bill of health then you need to go through a rescue that will gaurantee their adoptions which means they will gladly take the animal back at any point in the animals life.,HuntsvilleAlabama,cj9zi16,2,t5_2qq6o

3503745,0,t3_30eder,The main reason is because there hasnt been any political will to make it happen.  Most of the movers and shakers in this area are happy with the status quo which are a lot of smaller events throughout the year.Big Spring Jam largely failed due to the inability of the organizers to adapt and evolve.  What worked in the s and early s suddenly didnt as big festivals like Coachella Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza became widely popular in the mid to late s .  Attendees had better options to choose from and one of the biggest being just a mile and a half north of us was a big factor.  As soon as Big Spring Jam couldnt pull in a crowd from outside of town anymore it started shrinking and largely just featured local acts.As far as Ive understood it Big Spring Jam became kind of an embarrassment of riches for everyone involved in planning it.  In addition to being unable to adapt going through a lot of lack of preparedness it also lost a lot of money in its last failing years.  After that nobody is really willing to take the political or financial risk to try anything big anymore.Birmingham is lucky because Red Mountain managed to parter with  AC Entertainment the guys behind Bonnaroo.  They have significant pull with artists and bookers which gave Sloss Fest the seriously impressive lineup for its first year.  We simply dont have a private entertainment group like that in town that would be seen as reputable enough to work with someone like AC.So if were going to have anything like this in Huntsville any time soon there either has to be someone with enough courage in city leadership to take a chance or we have to have a private company take the lead.

If your wife really is comfortable with Dr. Callison then the odds of you being able to influence that change so far into her pregnancy is not good.

My plan pays almost double for a cesarean emergency or scheduled. They have each doctor listed with the amount they charge for either birth mode. Being an emergency cesarean vs being a scheduled cesarean does not affect the amount the doctor will receive. They still make more for performing surgery versus catching a baby.

3953363,0,t1_cr6vrxv,I agree with you and that is a challenge. I think that is mostly due to culture differences and how poor people tend to focus on short term goals. I am referencing a study published in Science titled Some Consequences of Having Too Littlegt Poor individuals often engage in behaviors such as excessive borrowing that reinforce the conditions of poverty. Some explanations for these behaviors focus on personality traits of the poor. Others emphasize environmental factors such as housing or financial access. We instead consider how certain behaviors stem simply from having less. We suggest that scarcity changes how people allocate attention It leads them to engage more deeply in some problems while neglecting others. Across several experiments we show that scarcity leads to attentional shifts that can help to explain behaviors such as overborrowing. I think the city could drastically help the poor by limiting or closing predatory lending businesss redeveloping derelict areas to attract more business and give taxfinancial incentives for businesss to move to poorer communities within the city. It would also be nice to have a robust public transportation as well to help with mobility for those unable to afford a car this is a drive everywhere city that limits job opportunities for those without transportation. I think the programs are good and the funding is not an issue but the outlook for the community is bleak in general. Why take advantage of those programs if you are just trying to scrape by? We need to give people a reason to think long term. They are already living paycheck to paycheck and these programs look good but the opportunity cost of taking advantage of those programs is too much.So as a TLDR of this the city could bring those communities more opportunities for success. Having options of where to work good work not just more chain fast food joints and being able to get to work public transportation is cheapereasier than owning a car might get them to think in the long term. If they are more comfortable financially then they can afford the time to take advantage of these programs without risking their bills food or health. ,HuntsvilleAlabama,cr6x0s1,2,t5_2qq6o

After working for Bob for about  years  of us were contemplating going out on our own to start a place of our own. We had a sit down with Bob at his house one Saturday and this was what he told us.gtIf you really want to open a restaurant you need  things a name or gimmick to bring people in the willingness to work hard for almost no pay until the place is successful and  million dollars.gtYouve told me the gimmick and I think it would work. Youve all proven to me that you have what it takes to work in the business from the muscle to the minds. But do you have the money?gtAfter explaining how we were going to raise the capital Bob said OK boys take that money home and lay a million dollars out on the bed. Then take the other million and a thousand bucks at a time flush it down the toilet. When its gone go to bed. If you can sleep at all that night pick up the cash from the bed and go open your restaurant.Of the  of us that were wanting to go into the business  of us chickened out and landed careers outside the industry. The rd guy has just closed his th restaurant to fail. Stats show that somewhere around  of family owned restaurants close within a year. The area around Huntsville has much more competition than most markets this size.However there is not a decent family owned Italian place around.

You still did not answer the question will someone spinning a going out of business sign be a distraction and if so why are not railing against them?  You simply restated your original case which leads me to believe your not against distractions but simply against religion.  And if your against religion at least grow some internet balls and say that.  There is nothing wrong with being against religion. What is wrong is trying to deny a person right to practice it.  ,HuntsvilleAlabama,ctnavtl,1,t5_2qq6o

4764339,0,t1_ctuypsj,gt The state of Indiana has reviewed PPs practices and found they have done nothing illegal.Even I knew it wasnt illegal though I have an ethical issue with what theyre doing with the...tissue. And while Im fairly openminded about such things many arent. Reconciling the legality of terminating a pregnancy is one hurdle. Donating or selling the resulting tissue for research may be scientifically valuable but it should also be subject to approval by at minimum the donor. gtI think anyone who understands that low cost or government subsidized sexual healthcare facilities are a benefit to society would be outraged over this regardless of political party affiliation. If you want to learn more about how that video was a clear attack edited to make PP seem like they are doing something illegal read up on it here.This sounds fantastic on paper or on screen and yet we still have scores of occurrences of the very incidents that theyre supposedly there to educate about and prevent against. Im sure you can shame plenty of people with your monologue but Im not one of them. And while I support the ABILITY to choose without legal complications Id prefer a specific choice is made. Its not up to me or the government to dictate that. And yet thats exactly whats happening  the government is using the taxpayer money to contribute to organizations and programs that some taxpayers dont support. Thats bullshit. I have no issues with the services that PP providing being legal but if you dont want the govt involved in the legality or not of the service then dont ask them for money either. Surely if the services that they provide are so valuable and altruistic then they should have no issues conducting a yearly fundraising drive for their organization. gtI feel that anyone who cares about the society they live in should be outraged when their Governor goes against what the law says and reduces funding for services the are a benefit to the very well being of that society.Now youre injecting personal bias and opinion  youre also mixing multiple issues in an attempt to claim superiority. Funding cuts happen. Sometimes there isnt even a reason. That the Gov chose to make a politically polarizing statement associated with the cut is bizarre especially considering its not an election season and hes not eligible for reelection. gtThe real political rhetoric here is coming from the people who want to shame PP and cut off funding for their services.So you respond in kind by shaming the government for making cuts? Granted the total amount defunded was so pitifully small that it makes no difference in state budgets or PPs budgets  so its just posturing on all sides.Stop overreacting. ,HuntsvilleAlabama,ctv37yk,1,t5_2qq6o

6688590,0,t1_d0as749,I dont have any specific information about Huntsville Utilities existing infrastructure. I found public fiber maps for WOW Zayo and Southern Light but nothing for Huntsville Utilities. So yesterday I emailed the city GIS Manager who very reasonably replied saying that those routes are not disclosed for security and privacy reasons. The City of Huntsville grants access to rights of way by franchise agreement with Comcast Southern Light and other networks. It stands to reason that the city would grant the same if not expanded rights to its subsidiary Huntsville Utilities. I suppose there could be some private railway or federal ROWs to cross but those do not usually have specific use restrictions that would allow some kinds of communications but not others.Good idea on using existing pipe systems. Just a few months ago the city replaced my natural gas main and service line as a matter of normal maintenance. The contractors doing the work said the old lines are approaching  years old. The old service lines may soon be too fatigued to be trusted with gas pressure but they could be repurposed as fiber duct if theres nothing more economical available for a particular area.,HuntsvilleAlabama,d0b5q51,1,t5_2qq6o

8702179,0,t3_4z6cxh,North Huntsville right now is a political battleground between really  candidates.But voter turnout and age demographic of those who turnout would determine who wins the City Council seat for District .Devyn Keith has been very aggressive lately. He has sent out a couple of mailers in the last week alone to residents of District  including  with a picture of him and Showers saying Respect our Past Elect our Future!. He has been very aggressive with his campaigning on social media mass media and of course his street team.Michelda has not been so aggressive as Devyn but she is young and full of ideas. She is the one who was really pitching for a new library for N. Huntsville and one of her campaign goals might soon come to fruition with the recent pledge of funding by RFCU for the libraries. She has also promised closer collaboration between local banks hint RFCU and the residents of N. Huntsville towards financial responsibility and home ownership.Then theres Showers. Councilman Showers honestly hasnt done much but you can obviously tell that hes the one with the most money in this campaign. He has a few signs up...a few VERY big signs a street billboard on the corner of Pulaski and University for example and he is already popular with the older residents of N. Huntsville and business owners who like N. Huntsville just the way it is aka dead and lacking in development. He might be the likely winner if no one shows up to the polls but the usual old and retired residents. This is more than likely and is a very scary prospect for much of the progressive residents of N. Huntsville.So well sit and wait. Watch what happens.,HuntsvilleAlabama,d6telj6,2,t5_2qq6o

10455971,0,t1_dct4n5l,Weve had occasional trouble over the years with finding a contractor to take on a job but most will and will finish the job.The trick to weeding them out is understanding the Southern tendency of wanting to avoid personal conflict i.e. saying No.With contractors it runs something like thisWe call a contractor about a job they come and tell us theyll have an estimate in a couple days or so. Three or so days go by with no contact. We call them they say theyre working on it right then and will have it out to us in a couple days. Three or four days later we call another contractor.They simply didnt want to take on the job. Fair enough for whatever reason but you couldve just said you didnt think its a good fit for your business and suggest someone else. We wont get mad promise!

Sir this is the ballot we were instructed to give you. Oh and then Im like Limestone county and theyre like This is a Huntsville City election. Moron! Huntsville City is in Limestone County too!I was there for two hours! I called Huntsville City Athens Dale Jackson Will Culver. Eventually a Will Culver campaign representative came down to see what the issue was.Apparently what happened was they got a binder that said Limestone County and it had all of the District  people in Limestone County in it. They didnt know what ballot to give them so they called Athens City and asked them. Since Athens City only had one ballot style in THEIR ELECTION! they told the poll workers Ballot Style  which corresponded to Huntsville City District  Richard Showers District.The poll watcher was there the whole time. She kept looking and smiling at me. When it was all done and I had voted she told my wife Tell your husband hes a hero for staying and fixing this. Im not allowed to interfere.

10511430,0,t1_dczjnlq,gtIf you believe in climate changemeaning global warming lets not mince words herethen do you also acknowledge the deleterious effects global warming are going to inflict on the Earth and its inhabitants? Yes!  I do gtDo you think those effects are serious enough that they need to be addressed in a timely manner? Timely meaning...pretty much starting now? I genuinely think society is not willing to do the things which can address climate change in a meaningful way.  Driving electric cars and reducing fossil fuel usage will not cut it when the global population is rising exponentially and we have industrialising nations.  I think the better more sensible idea is to have a mitigation strategy for the effects of climate change and to reduce the impact on people as those changes begin to manifest.  Its not the perfect solution but it would save lives.  gtIs it not then worthwhile to study a steadily worsening existential problem so that when the body politic someday realizes that something has to be done that we understand the problem as well as we can and have identified ways to remedy it? I agree that the ongoing research of climate change is worthwhile.  The problem is people tend to think the solution is to throw more and more money into climate change research.  This just means we start studying less essential aspects of climate change in addition to the important stuff.  I think we overstepped the bounds when we had a large chunk of NASAs funds dedicated to climate change research.  We should have a modest efficient community of specialists pushing forward the idea and focusing on the big picture.  If we are to spend more money on climate change related goals I suggest we invest that money on research into alternative energy.  Or heck take that money and just plant trees with it which in my opinion would would be a greater benefit to the global community than the outcomes of  of climate change research projects.  Finally I want to say that the credibility of scientists weighs heavily on our ability to be impartial.  To just stick to the facts.  Scientists becoming political and marching for their beliefs means they put ideology before the scientific method.  How can you trust such people to be genuinely impartial in their research?  There is massive incentive for them to skew the numbers in their favour because they BELIEVE something should be a certain way.  And when they are caught out it makes the whole field of research lose its credibility.  No no no!  Scientists must never be political!  ,HuntsvilleAlabama,dczkz28,3,t5_2qq6o

10850537,0,t1_ddyxufk,Yes for teacher led schools and classrooms but your idea of minimum standards couldnt be more wrong. Thats REALLY bad pedagogy. Minimum standards only work if children come standardized. They dont. You say we cant afford individualized instruction but thats BS because we are affording it were just only only affording it for students in affluent public schools. So what youre actually saying is were going to pick winners and losers only the children of affluent families will always get picked as winners. This is essentially affirmative action for the wealthy. Youre actually totally wrong about Singapore. Singapore is succeeding specifically BECAUSE theyve deliberate tried to be less like the American system. They are individualization instruction and emphasizing critical thinking of standardization and testing. Which of course raises the issue that PISA is essentially meaningless like all standardized tests. Agree with the need for student supports. The best public schools in America dont just have good teachers and new text books. They have students who arrive at school healthy with a full stomach secure housing and parents with secure employment. In fact the single strongest correlation with student outcomes is poverty status. The most effective thing we could do for our students is make sure they dont live in poverty. But thats an answer that has been known from research for decades weve just chosen as a country to let some usually black and brown kids fall behind so a handful of rich families can get richer. ,HuntsvilleAlabama,ddz5mom,2,t5_2qq6o
