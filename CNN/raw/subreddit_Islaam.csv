4610859,0,t1_ctbr29a,gt It is not an accusation to state a reality. You are a layman. I am a layman.Youre not going to say this and expect me to just deal with it. So let us end this once and for all. You swear to Allaah three times that the reality is that AskYous me is a layman and I swear to Allaah you are speaking from ignorance  suspicion. And we both swear to Allaah the fourth time to curse the one of us who is lying.See whos the truthful one now.I take your insults on me of higher weight than the discussion at hand. If you retract your accusations made against me edit and apologize then we can continue to your next points and perhaps get back to the topic at hand.,Islaam,ctbs4uf,1,t5_2vdub
