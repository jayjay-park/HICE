8218515,0,t3_4rx0ac,No one really knows yet but you probably wont because it will no longer provide a legal solution to become compliant without registering it.However our wonderful state isnt known for giving us back many freedoms in the firearms arena so its hard to tell.Register it today and end up with a new bullet button type of law next year for all assault weapons.Remember the bullet button wasnt official policy or a presented legal solution. It was a private invention created to comply with the law stating that a tool would be required to release the magazine from the weapon. Tool being that the tip of a bullet would work.Prior to the invention of the bullet button but after the  law had passed the presumption was that the rifle would need to be broken down to remove the magazine. Then came the bullet button to satisfy the tool portion of the written law.This is pretty much the content of that one law that was just passed. The legislators felt circumvented and resubmitted this new law to remedy that defining the mildly ambiguous language of the older currently active law.The confusion most of us have comes from the term assault weapon which is already clearly defined under California law. Minus the  round California magazine capacity an assault weapon has no cosmetic restrictions other than not being fully automatic.So the presumption is that yes if you register your AR you should be able to have all the evil features that you want. Flash hiders collapsible stocks vertical forward grips pistol grip etc. Im not so sure about the grenade launcher though.However like I said earlier... with California you never really know.,CAguns,d54vc2k,8,t5_31iwc

Honestly this situation is a very common one just not always because of firearms.  Its just an annoying roomate situation.  The likely scenario is everyone on the lease will have to pay through the end of it at which time some can move and some can stay on a new lease or everyone can move and go their separate ways.  For peace of mind I would drop the  just to get a feel of the situation and end it at that.  I wouldnt bother getting the landlord or anyone else involved unless the lawyer tells you to.

Whether or not anybody comes after you is another question but do you want to be the test case?Edit Another relevant example of whether an assembled lower can be considered an assault weapon is the magazine release.

You could always buy a MampP Sport  or Ruger  and then change out the furniture or trigger but youll be paying a bit more at that point as youll be buying things twice.  The only thing I think you might not like about those rifles is the triggers and even then it wont be a huge deal as theyre not bad just not amazing.However know that if you go the build your own route you only need to get the lower completed by Dec st if youre having a gunsmith do it.  You can shop out the rest of the parts after that though you might need an upper by the end of  to register it properly.  Thats what my brother is doing Im building his lower with a Geissele SSA trigger for XMAS.I drive all the way from Torrance to Riflegear because of how shitty Turners is and theres one within walking distance of me.

You could probably get a away it it since its clearly labeled a muzzle break but say you get stopped by an over zealous cop he doesnt understand the difference between featureless and an illegal assault weapon. He takes it as evidence. But when he gets back to the station the police chief does know the difference and starts to panic. They call their lawyers to covers their asses the lawyer checks every single piece of your rifle to see if you made any mistakes they can exploit. He does the research on the muzzle break sees that it mentions flash reduction. You end up in court. You tell the jury that it is labeled a muzzle brake. The lawyer says that call it whatever you want if it reduces flash its a flash hider. Now youve got  antigun liberals that were stacked against you during jury section.

I dont experience the flex that I did and I think its good to go.Thoughts on how to keep it from flexing is to obviously beef up the arm until it doesnt flex but im not sure how thick you need it to be before you accomplish that.Now if you drill a hole laterally into the arm fill it with an epoxystock bedding materialjb weld then let it dry and sand it until flush that might be enough to keep it from flexing.You could also insert some rebar or thick paperclips wepoxy and perhaps that would work too.

11111606,0,t1_deqqovl,I am sorry but this is just wrong.First there is currently no such thing as a bullet button assault weapon. Second the law is very clear on this.  With regards to rifles an assault weapon right now today.. sicne  is defined as followsgt a Notwithstanding Section  assault weapon also means any of the followinggt A semiautomatic centerfire rifle that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of the followinggtA A pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon.gtB A thumbhole stock.gtC A folding or telescoping stock.gtD A grenade launcher or flare launcher.gtE A flash suppressor.gtF A forward pistol grip.gt A semiautomatic centerfire rifle that has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than  rounds.gt A semiautomatic centerfire rifle that has an overall length of less than  inches.That is what is an Assault Weapon in California period.  There is no such thing as a Bullet Button Assault Weapon.  There might be when DOJ puts some rules out... but right now there is not.If you possessed this rifle prior to  then you have an exemptiongt . . Section  does not apply to the possession of an assault weapon by a person who has possessed the assault weapon prior to January   if all of the following are applicablegta Prior to January   the person was eligible to register that assault weapon pursuant to subdivision b of Section .gtb The person lawfully possessed that assault weapon prior to January  .gtc The person registers the assault weapon by January   in accordance with subdivision b of Section . You will not have any trouble if you take a BB rifle to the range I have heard of a lot of people doing this with no issues.You will have to transport it in accordance with the rules for Assault Weaponsgt  In order for a firearm to be exempted under this article while being transported to or from a place the firearm shall be unloaded and kept in a locked container and the course of travel shall include only those deviations between authorized locations as are reasonably necessary under the circumstances.So TLDR  It is an Assault Weapon.  There is no such thing currently in law called a Bullet Button Assault Weapon.  You are exempted from the possession part of Assault Weapons laws until  it needs to be registered by then currently not possible to do. You must follow all other laws regarding Assault Weapons including Transporting of those weapons it is not the same as just a normal firearm. ,CAguns,derhowi,2,t5_31iwc

11567795,0,t1_dg6kn3z,funny your explanation pretty much solidified my decision to go traditional DASA. At the moment I only own double and single action revolvers and as fun as shooting a single action semi auto is I never much felt the need to get one until I woke up one day with a mm bug and figured I might as wel make it my potential future carry. of course this is irrational and ridiculous but the safety system on glocks and most other striker fire polymer pistols make me feel like theyre just itching to go off. double action to me is the ultimate no nonsense just works safety. excluding ugly options that leaves me with the sk or the sig p which isnt quit a sub compact and way more expensive and Ive heard bad things about their current manufacturing quality. anyway Im understanding it like this LEM  more like glock DASA  more like revolver. I still plan on finding one or the other to handle somewhere that will make my final decision for me. ,CAguns,dg77r1q,1,t5_31iwc
