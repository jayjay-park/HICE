6088319,0,t1_cyhkue0,He withheld certain information and didnt want to lie so he made misleading statements.  Fair enough.   Not the same as lying.  The board was not consistent today as there were much bigger odds favorites.  Florida State was too easy that shouldnt have been on the board.  And despite Xavier  and Providence  having great records those were certain losses.  Same with unbeaten Clemson and Michigan St. But everyone is in the same boat.  I dont believe the props were loosened to give one person an advantage over another.  I think it was just to acknowledge the end of the year and the championship bowl games.  And two unique basketball games. And this is a free game that we play for fun.
