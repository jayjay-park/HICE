Maybe it was someone else at the school who asked jay to try and frame Adnan since it was a very believable story.It would not surprise me much if neither of these kids killed her but since there was no physical evidence and Im sure that person who may have killed her wont confess  years later there is no way for us to know for sure.,Composition,d0kubjl,1,t5_2qo1v

I think a lot of people feel that in a case like Hae Lees ending with murder someone needs to be blamed or sentenced. I think this is a human quality to want closure. I can not even imagine how Haes family felt but I would assume that there was something satisfying about having an answers and someone to blame. ,Composition,d0lixzz,1,t5_2qo1v
