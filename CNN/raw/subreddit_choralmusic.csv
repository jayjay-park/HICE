998882,0,t1_chggioo,Yes! Its probably a sign of my navet but I was really surprised at the number of folks in my state universitys music program didnt even have a functional grasp of basic Italian or German diction. College is definitely a good place to learn those things but honestly I think youd be really behind if you didnt have at least a passing knowledge of one or two languages diction rules. A basic knowledge of IPA is really helpful too  in fact its probably more helpful than knowledge in a foreign language since you can apply IPA to pretty much any language. ,choralmusic,chhtwoz,1,t5_2rw8f

1491491,0,t1_cj388m1,Yeah I was originally using a metronome and recording separately from the other parts. My main problem was that I would drop in pitch the further into the recording I got and then chords would be just that much further from working. Ive set up a simple MIDI file to sing along with though and things are going a lot better.,choralmusic,cj38eke,1,t5_2rw8f

7857671,0,t3_4i0bjk,Love these competitions!  But it begs some pretty dark experiences that is not very well addressed that being when the line crosses from traininglearningrehearsal to outright abuse. Furthermore training singers  particularly volunteer singers  how to handle abusive choirmasters and directors.  For example and beyond the obvious belittlements  what should the singers do when forced to perform standing on risers inadequate to support the weight of the ensemble and forcing the singer to remain standing near motionless  for  minutes.  These abuses and this is not by any definition exclusive are common in a variety of ensembles.  Community choruses orchestral choruses with all volunteer singers probably take the brunt of the abuse.,choralmusic,d3z9ua3,1,t5_2rw8f
