3563611,0,t1_cpyh0z6,Im happy to contribute. Addressing your concern I talked about that with multimod here But to summarize we would still use our discretion for some offending posts so not always the first one stays and all the others are deleted because some are much more indepth or just have better writing. Discretion and not uniformly applying it should work I think.,FuturologyModerators,cpyh7xo,1,t5_2ziqo

9728640,0,t1_da9fkus,I agree that this is a good way to make mods think twice before reapproving a postcomment and giving a controversial post more moderator attention.  But the somewhat arbitrary rule of remove on  mod reports is flawed. If  mods are in favor of the post and  mods for removing it then only the  mods get their opinion exposed enough to prompt an action.  I think multiple mod reports after a postcomment has been already approved? should prompt a discussion in some way. Maybe automated mod mail or post in this subreddit?  This would have the flaw that it doesnt help a quick reaction by the mods to a potentially rule breaking postcomment.  ,FuturologyModerators,dac9neh,1,t5_2ziqo

9978739,0,t3_5ibnsd,I vote no.   As mods we are already in a position of power other rFuturology users are more in need of being protected by our rules than the mod team.   We already have Rule .  Possible compromise Add clarification that repeated rule breaks after having been warned will lead to appropriate punishment.  That would pretty much cover the usual insult mods after having comment removed case.  ampnbsp  As a separate issue Im against hard ban times regardless of the type of insult.  While it would be refeshingly straight forward and transparent some insultsthreats are just worse than others. Im more for judging on a case by case basis with modmail and rfuturologyappeals as backup in case a mod messes up.  Edit Guidelines for ban times would be welcome though.  ,FuturologyModerators,db89ak2,2,t5_2ziqo
10394179,0,t1_dcm7ldq,Yes you can do it with the automoderator as I said in the other post. Get the code they use in rscience.If there is no flair the bot removes the post posts a comment with a reminder and instructions and once flaired the bot approves the post and removes the reminder comment all automatically.In fact the bot is clever enough that all you need to do is reply to the comment with the category e.g. space and the bot actually flairs the post for you.,FuturologyModerators,dcm8w1w,1,t5_2ziqo
