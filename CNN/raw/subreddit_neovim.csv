Things that have rightfully taken over a year to get completed were advertised as being doable in the space of a couple months. ,neovim,cuzh6rg,0,t5_30kix

8227633,0,t1_d55pgpo,Yes there is already a .rplugin file in my home directory but not in the folder where Im starting NeoVim.  I use Deoplete with NeoVim and about  minute after I start NeoVim in a folder where I havent done so before I get a warning that I should run that command.  Afterwards there is a .rplugin file in the current working directory.Heres my NeoVim version.  And I never use the u option.  Thanks!         nvim version    NVIM ..

8819848,0,t1_d77ym6a,If you change your terminal colors instead of using a proper vim color scheme all the advantages and disadvantages of color color schemes still apply to you. The thing that a proper vim color scheme offers you is greater customizability. For example in the default vim color scheme NonText and SpecialKey are given the terminal color . If you want to assign different colors to these highlight groups youll need a vim color scheme.,neovim,d780wyl,1,t5_30kix
8919751,0,t3_52eu6b,From a user perspective Neovim is unlikely to offer you much in terms of functionality at the moment beyond the embedded terminal which is a nice touch at times. Looking to the future though Neovim has the potential to become much much more than just a fork of Vim. The project was forked from Vim a couple years ago as a communitydriven development of the editor after Bram had denied some of the progress on mainline Vim. Its focus has been cleaning up the codebase improving it where it can and creating a platform for developers to improve upon without having to deal with the rather arduous process developing Vim faces. ,neovim,d7k0v0m,18,t5_30kix
8941515,0,t1_d7ks5wo,Actually NeoVim is to blame for any forward or backward compatibility not Vim. NeoVim is the fork and Vim is the main product.,neovim,d7mmzop,-1,t5_30kix
9946226,0,t1_db3n2so,gt Wooo this is excellent!Thanks!gt is there any reason not to alias vi to nvr?Well there are subtle differences. E.g. just nvr will output its usage instead of starting nvim.A good way to check if youre in a normal shell or in a child process started by nvim is to check an environment variable only Vim sets. E.g. MYVIMRC. Or set one yourself let VIMINIZED  .Then create a shell function vi that checks if MYVIMRC or VIMINIZED exist and use nvr in that case or nvim otherwise.,neovim,db40o7n,2,t5_30kix
