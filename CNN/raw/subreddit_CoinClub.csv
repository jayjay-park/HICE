So check that out for sure there are scholarships available.  From there armed with some experience they start working for dealers coin shop interning or working on their own.  Some even recruited out of the classes at ANA.  I received an NGC scholarship two years ago so I knew they had an eye on me.  The new PNG internship is interesting as well I also know another dealer doing an internship program where the person spends a few days at PCGS a week.  The big thing is get connected and Summer Seminar at ANA is the best place to do that.  It is a blast and I have made some of my best friends from there.  If you cant go to that try to a coin show that has some classes andor an auction.  Many people will tell you to go through a whole Heritage or Stacks Bowers auction cover up the grades and see how close you are.  Its a free easy way to practice you have to constantly view coins that is what is important.  I went  months without doing coins too much this year and was drifting off my grading lines.  Internet pictures and books do not give you the skills really you need hold coins that becomes most important.  ,CoinClub,cmgk6um,3,t5_2u699
