363586,0,t3_1y8xnx,I wouldnt see a very useful way of merging in new geo. Extrusion adding edge loops and moving verts will be your best method.   Merging geo means you have to weld verts and if the number doesnt match then youve made extra work for yourself compared to just extruding. However if you wanted to model on paw for your griffin then duplicate and merge it to your other legs then that would be a good idea. Probably the best idea. Another good idea would be to use zbrush for your modeling cause its amazing. But in the end just keep your mind open. Dont think tutorials or advice are gospel.

You can select a camera and Panels gt Look Through Selected to get the MEL command you need.The fastest way to switch to cameras within default Maya is probably the spacebar marking menu hold space then hold left mouse button then drag to the camera  it gets really fast and might even seem instant when youre used to it.  If you add custom cameras you can also add them to that marking menu.  Alternatively if you work with the outliner open you can drag a camera from the outliner into your panel with the middle mouse button which is also a shortcut for selecting something then panels gt look through selected.Pressing space once probably shouldnt be what you get used to.  It doesnt actually go to the  camera display it goes to whatever panel layout youre using.  Which might be the  cameras and is by default but as you get more experienced youre going to want to be using panel layouts to work faster  not to select cameras.,Maya,chphth7,1,t5_2qihn

4619963,0,t3_3e759c,To me the biggest issues are twofold The lighting is really flat so it does not model the objects or guide the eye in any meaningful way. It might be a good starting point for general ambient light but you need some additional lights probably a key and a rim light to make the furniture items pop from the environment a bit. Study film lighting its hugely important. The camera setup is not very dynamic and it doesnt feel real. I would start with a mm lens on your camera make sure you use depth of field either inrender or in post and set the camera to have a much more interesting viewpoint on your scene. If you go look at really successful architectural renderings youll notice a huge portion of the look and feel is derived from the location of the camera and the way it sets up the room. Having a large flat expanse of wall running horizontally behind your scene is pretty boring and in your case its slightly off axis which makes the whole scene feel uncomfortable like were on a ship thats about to sink.Nice start though dont get discouraged!

4820335,0,t3_3gg6yd,I had this issue about a year ago when I animated a character riding a surfboard. Unity doesnt recognize much more than meshes and joints and whenever I baked down the animation it would look great in Maya but the surfboard animation would be completely lost in Unity. Luckily I found this script that bakes rotationposition keys onto the selected geometry in your scene. You will need to export your prop meshanimation as a separate fbx than the character animation and get them working together once youve imported into unity.  Also be sure to save a version before you go through this process because the script will kill all constraints locators etc when baking. Like I said its been over a year since Ive used the script so I cant recall all the steps to get it working right but I do know that it really saved my bacon for this very problem. ,Maya,cu255ir,2,t5_2qihn

5776511,0,t1_cxd3ips,It matters because its a waste of time. You already have the primary framebuffer. You can duplicate the channel in post if necessary... duplicating a framebuffer at rendertime makes little sense efficiencywise since its that much more information to write to disk during rendering which is why its not really an option.,Maya,cxd4pj8,1,t5_2qihn

If you have a face exactly on the symmetry axis that doesnt get deleted when you clear half of the mesh the face gets duplicated and upon welding the seam the coinciding vertices are welded too creating a lamina face.

7056680,0,t1_d1efxq8,No problem at all! I dont recall exactly how many subdivs I ended up going with but Im pretty sure it was . I believe I just doubled what you had originally. That way instead of extruding out  faces to make the shape on the side of the cylinder I used  faces. Im sure there would have been a subdiv level that still got the shape prevented pinching and was not so heavy in geometry but this was just easier for demonstration purposes. Sorry to hear you arent being taught a ton of information at Uni. Unfortunately we dont use any literature in any of our classes. I wish there was some huge document I could send you that had all of the information but for modeling we just go by what Paul says and we are very lucky to have him. Every summer he goes out to California and works at big studios like Sony Disney Pixar etc. So its nice because he sees what big studios are currently doing in their pipeline and can change the class curriculum based on what he is seeing every summer to help make us more marketable. I think thats really the biggest thing you should look for in an education that the educators have direct experience in the field they are teaching. Im not sure what other suggestions to give you other than keep watching Pauls complex shapes tutorials. I believe he is in the process of making more so hopefully by summer there will be a new one. Either way those tutorials are exactly the same way we learned to model. I think the next step is applying your knowledge to an actual object. Our first assignment was a Cannon GX camera which was hard as shit for never truly having modeled anything before but I learned so much while I was doing it. Depending on how much work you have at school you could try doing something like that in your free time. You could also try making small but complex shapes like space suit vavles I tried to make that shape a few weeks ago its very difficult but also very fun!Anyways I always end up writing too much but I wish you the best and hope you can find ways to push yourself to learn more. Dont ever hesitate to ask if you have questions. There are significantly better modelers than me on this subreddit so one way or another you will find some answers here.,Maya,d1g8fgo,2,t5_2qihn

7750704,0,t3_4lglow,All of the responses so far are incorrect. The actual problem is that Maya is attempting to shade around the edges but the angles of those edges is too sharp for the algorithm to shade well.

From there it has all the keys you have selected laid out in the dope sheet. In the dopes sheet you can select those black keys and they will high light yellow. The top line is separate from the rest it selects all the keys in the columns below. If you scroll the dope sheet out to the point you can see all your keys it uses viewport hotkeys and controls for the most part you can then select the keys you want. Then move those keys around like you would in the viewport. I think you have to hit w for the move tool and then middle click to move the keys left or right.I feel like this sound more confusing if you have never done this before but the dope sheet can be pretty handy for organizing or moving a lot of keys!,Maya,daokcpy,3,t5_2qihn
