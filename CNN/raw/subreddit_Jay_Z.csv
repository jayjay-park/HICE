11362865,0,t3_5z8tdk,Hovs verse was one of his best but Eminem came through and scorched the earth. I think Ems first verse was better than his second. I rank them thusly. Eminem first verse. Eminem second verse. Jay first verse. Jay second verseEminems flow and breath control is absolutely incredible. I know the song word for word but Ive never once in  years been able to rap along to either of them perfectly without needing to take a breath.Remember it was Ems song first. Jay should really have delivered something a little better. He also doesnt perform it very well hes always offbeat. ,Jay_Z,dfjyjjc,1,t5_3j29z
