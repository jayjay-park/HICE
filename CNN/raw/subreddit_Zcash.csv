7884610,0,t1_d4232w4,Yep I sent this private message. The whole point of creating this thread was to advertise that I was working on a cloud mining operation. Sammie would you consider redacting my email address and linkedin? I do not mind if people know who I am actually I think its essential to trying to do this but Id prefer not to have that information archived for all time in a reddit thread for spammers etc. to harvest. Also one note Im not looking for investors and I didnt use the word invest. I envision this as miningasaservice so to speak.  ,Zcash,d42ax2v,2,t5_3bg7u
