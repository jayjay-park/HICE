6508101,0,t3_44qxl6,I remember renting this game because I only got to purchase games for my birthday and christmas really back then. A good friend of mine and I played through as much as we could in the week we had it but eventually lost of all the progress because we didnt have a memory card. ,FinalFantasyIX,czshjkq,5,t5_2wlj6

Data miners to my knowledge work with the running code of things in the ram which you could do however it would all be hexidecimal gibberish and its very unlikely you would find something like what youre expecting. So your probably better off with a mock image from scratch,FinalFantasyIX,dcbb3oc,1,t5_2wlj6
