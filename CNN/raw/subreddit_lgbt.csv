31233,0,t3_1ugyew,I hate when people ask this question in this way because it always leaves out one of the most important partssome people elect to identify as queer in response to the way that the more mainstream gay movement caters more to male cisgendered andor white individuals. It recognizes that not only are gender and sexuality not binary but they often intersect and interact with other forms of oppression in varying ways. Simply saying the term is more inclusive does nothing to elucidate why such a term is needed which seems like a key consideration if you are asking why people choose to identify as such.,lgbt,cehzken,5,t5_2qhh7

As in straight lookingsounding. Unless I told you or you picked my subtle clues you wouldnt know Im bi....Which is also what I tend to look for in potential partners. I am not inclined to effeminate men nor butch women. I get and enjoy having gay moments once in a while like going shopping but not speaking or acting like a woman when you are a gaybi man. I accept and and sympathize when it comes from trans people but not that much when it comes from gays or bisexuals. I mean if I wanted to date someone that behaves like a girl I would be dating one. I want someone strong to rely on as that someone would like to rely on my strength to help carry our relationship through.  Although it might be just my annoyance that as my countrys society assumes that gaysbisexuals   effeminate newsflash Ive known gay men with more balls that a soccer team put together I am more than interested in showing that we are not all like that.

There was a woman at a group I found outside of school who would run sessions on homophobic bullying and she said it was still really hard to get into schools to do it in the first place  I only left school two years ago and even then there was no coverage of LGBT issues in sex education and homosexuality was only mentioned a few times in RE and so briefly that I cant remember if it was positive or not.

187112,0,t3_1w8uaz,I think you are misunderstanding what crossdressing is and what gay means. Crossdressing is just wearing clothes of the opposite gender. People do it because they like the aesthetics of it and it makes them feel more comfortable. There is no conclusion you can draw from someone who crossdresses  they can be gay they can be straight they can be transgender they can be cisgender. I wouldnt say crossdressing is for fun because if youre a man who dresses up as a girl for fun then youre a drag queen not a crossdresser.Gay simply means attracted to the samesex so gay men are biological men identifying as such who are attracted to other men. If these men feel like they should be women then they are not gay they are transgender.,lgbt,cezr1k9,8,t5_2qhh7

Obviously he was upset enough to post it on the internet to ask for advice. You cant stuff these kinda emotions down and ignore them because it will eventually have an effect on the friendship whether either one is conscious of it or not.  Trust me Ive tried it both ways. Open communication on both sides of any relationship is imperative. I also think telling someone to get over it is a meanspirited and incredibly immature especially in this subreddit.

At the time I was in denial of the fact that I was attracted to guys and I was projecting this at others in the form of hatred towards LGBTQ individuals. So its quite probable that your classmate was in denial about being gay and was projecting it in the form of hate.For me I pretty much suspected I was gay from the age of I was always attracted to guys and only ever felt love probably better to call it lust for guys. I never really was afraid of being touched by a gay guy or catching the gaythere were no out gay guys in my school until my senior year of high school.You are at a stage in your life where you are discovering yourself including to whom you are attracted. The most important thing is to not stress about your sexuality because youll eventually figure it outlabels arent important. Easier said than done I know. Only you will know to whom you are attracted whether it be guys or girls. Whomever you are attracted to that is okay and there is nothing wrong with that.

He isnt trying to justify the bible to the LGBT community hes justifying the LGBT community to Christians. Yes some people of religion are antigay and yes they use their religion as a reason for this but dont you see how you generalising everyone of religion to be backwards thinking illogical idiots from the dark ages is exactly the same as people generalising the LGBT community. The bible is an extreme example of what happens everywhere and what will always happen. The US constitution remains the same but laws surrounding it and different interpretations changes all the time but because slavery and discrimination of black people was once legal does that mean that all Americans are racist and need to wake up and stop being American? I personally dont like ordered religion to the extent of the Vatican but this guy is opening religion up to be as loving and equal as he and many others believe it should be. Religion helps millions of people become better people Im not saying you have to be religious to be good but for some people religion is something to work towards that gives them a drive that other things dont. Also Im sure there are some Christian gays here in this sub so seeing something like this will hopefully give them peace of mind and change other peoples views on religion this is supposed to be a safe place for everyone this guy hasnt done anything offensive or hurt anyone hes striving towards equality but its people like you who will corner us and push away to what is normal just like how extreme feminists are viewed.,lgbt,cgfr5h6,1,t5_2qhh7

700224,0,t1_cgjtty6,Yeah that sounds right to me from what youve said so far. It also sounds like you are attracted to people who have aspects that you would like to have for yourself which is common  more so with personality traits and status than physical traits but Im another person who is attracted to people who present and express themselves similarly to me. I hope you will feel good in exploring expressing femininely and not face trouble with others in doing so. There are a lot of awesome open minded people and communities around and it seems people in general are becoming fine with people being free in their gender expression and sexuality.  Also yeah from my experience it definitely got better after school especially moving to a queer friendly city with a diverse range of people and just starting to explore and be honest with myself and others. The internet is also awesome for learning more about yourself and talking with like minded people. Ps. it might not just be feminine males that you are attracted to. Perhaps you would be interested in the idea of a feminine presenting female who is into pegging where a female uses a strapon to penetrate a male. You may be interested in dominatrixes? I only suggest as it sounds like you are fantasizing about subdom situations in which you are submissive penetration being a big part of that fantasy. There are female bodied people who are into being the other side of the coin and so there is more for you to explore if you wish to. ,lgbt,cgjv93v,1,t5_2qhh7

959579,0,t1_chd9mp7,I did read it. I just think its a shame that allowing all characters to have the marriage option is actually seen as social commentary. And from a programming point of view some programmer had to code a check for a Miis gender. Someone made a conscience effort to exclude  nonheterosexual couples. They can pay as much lip service as they want to their lack of social commentary but they added to the landscape of heteronormativity. They are free to do that if they wish but they are not free from the consequences of their choices. That being said I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. The game came out over a year ago after all. Even if they wanted to right their wrong its a little late for that particular property. Now if they release something else that is similar and they STILL have excluded LGBT relationships then it might be time to conclude that if theres no room in Nintendos games for us then maybe theres no room in our budgets for Nintendos games.

Something for you  and your sister  to remember is that ever since the day she was born they have been making plans for her life and having dreams and ideas for how her life will go. Now with one sentence of information all of those dreams have altered  not disappeared just seriously meaningfully altered. This is really what I think most parents have to adjust to. Your parents lives have now changed  not bad just different  and they need time to get used to that. You can lead the way in showing them how to be accepting by accepting them and their personal struggles and accepting your sister and who she is.

They did not possess our cultures concepts of sexuality neither homosexuality nor heterosexuality. If what is meant is that homosexual behavior was widely practiced and accepted then thats what he should say.Furthermore I dont know why your father would assume that homosexual behavior was accepted in ancient Rome or Greece or anywhere else only during its decline and not during its rise and at the height of its power. Its a question hes begging i.e. asking you to accept as an assumption. Challenge it. Demand evidence.You might as well assume that Rome was more accepting of homosexual behavior during its rise to prominence and that its decline saw decreasing tolerance.

Given that it is possible what basis do you have to assume British immigration is homophobic rather than that large amounts of Jamaicans claim LGBTbased asylum? None other than the fact that it pushes LGBT buttons.gtb. being pregnant is not a basis for an asylum claim.It doesnt matter that being pregnant is not a basis for an asylum. My analogy was that there can exist a myth regarding immigration asylum which induces a large number of people to try to get into a country via that myth. The fact that the myth is actually false or true has no bearing on whether people believe it is true.gtIf the applicant had been transgender and the court rejected the claim based on the assertion that they had lied about their gender on entry it would clearly raise concerns about discrimination.That is a terrible analogy. The issue of the asylum case was whether the guy was bisexual or not. Its a realm of uncertainty and therefore has the potential for bias. With a transgender person there is no uncertainty. If the court found that they had lied about being transgender they would have to be willfully blind to the physical evidence. So yes that would raise concerns. But thats because there would be no reason for their decision other than bias which is precisely what were talking about in the first place and you already admitted an alternative explanation in this case.

1654709,0,t1_cjmrt7o,Ugh... You have no idea what youre implying. Being out as trans often results in discriminationharassment even in healthcare settings. This  causes trans patients to be less likely to seek medical care for anything. This is detrimental to trans health and raises mortality rates. If A  B and B  C then A  C.A few more points You are legally obligated to provide your legal sex. If you say youre a woman theres nothing stopping you from requesting a prostate check. The prostate shrinks as does the risk of prostate cancer under the influence of antiandrogens and estrogens. In contrast the breasts grow as does the risk of breast cancer. If youre a trans woman on HRT then your musclefat ratios and basal metabolic rates are Female. These are the relevant variables between men and women. So if you say you are physically male then your doctor is significantly more likely to reference male dosage charts and thus prescribe you an overdose  meaning cardiac arrest liverkidney damage and much much more. If youre a trans man on HRT then your musclefat ratios and basal metabolic rates are Male. So if you say you are physically Female then your doctor is much more likely to reference Female dosage charts and thus prescribe you an ineffective regimen  meaning that the medication doesnt achieve its desired effect your condition worsens and you may then find yourself with an iatrogenic condition or infection.So no physical sex as you interpret it genitalia does NOT necessarily need to be noted. It only needs to be brought up if it is relevant to the given condition.For example I recently had a bookcase fall on me at work. It impacted at my neck and shoulders. I felt fine until the next day whereupon I woke with significant pain and stiffness spanning from C to T vertebrae. My bosses sent me to the clinic. I listed my legal sex my meds and kept my trans status to myself throughout the drug test and Xray process. Only in the final review did the doctor figure out that I was trans because I hinted at my discomfort with discussing my meds around others and implied that he could look into them himself if he wanted which he did. Low and behold my trans status was not relevant tothe dosage CNS muscle relaxant already prescribed the Xray the urinalysis or what was going on with the muscles in my neck.In the end all he did was apologize for any discomfort that may have been caused when asking about prior conditions. My genitals werent relevant to a neck ache  go figure. Now if I had a urogenital issue it would probably be relevant and Id likely mention it.Really we can take care of ourselves tyvm. Stop pretending that you know what we need better than we do. And better than the AMA which supports the right to change legal sex and ID despite the chance that some trans women neglect to have prostate exams... because theyd rather have trans people be able to access regular healthcare for everything else than have trans people suffer discrimination and avoid accessing healthcare as much as possible.,lgbt,cjnqmt6,2,t5_2qhh7

We should have extended the rights and privileges granted to families led by married couple to all families instead of redefining a long held traditional institution. In the s we didnt redefine blacks to be white so they could drink from the same fountains. We took down the signs. Our current approach leaves out families led by people who dont share a bed.

It was about five years before I had my first really functional healthy relationship and I dont have any regrets about that either.Were married now.It takes the time it takes.  Deal with where you are right now coming out online.  Think about what your next step is.  And dont look too much farther than that.  Just take one step at a time from where you are now to a slightly better life.You dont have to admit to being gay in public or to be in a seriously relationship unless a time comes when you want to do those things.

I am also struck by the fact that so many people are actually in the closet and one of the few ways they see any hope for themselves is by seeing open gay people out in the media. That is very powerful and so I keep making movies.,lgbt,cm6q78b,5,t5_2qhh7
2387891,0,t1_cm3xa1v,The problem is when you say Polygamy what you really mean is Polygyny one man  many wives. However in the modern world compound marriages can not and will not be limited to Polygyny or Polyandry  wife  many husbands. I twill be many wives and many husbands and doesnt that more than anything make marriage pointless?When one husband can have  wives and the wives can each have  other husbands who in turn can have  other wives some of how are the wives and husbands of others then who is responsible for who? Are the children of the fifth wife of the th husband the responsibility of the fifth wife by the st husband. Then there is the problem of genetics. When ...pretty much... everybody is married to everybody then how do you keep track of the genetic blending of DNA. Can the son of the th wife marry the daughter of the rd wife by the same husband. This is so socially complex  so genetically intermingled and so legally complex that I cant see it every being allowed. Im sure some will make a fair case for Polygyny others as a matter of equal right will demand Polyandry  but ultimately  it become many wives and many husbands and a legal and genetic mess. ,lgbt,cm6un6p,1,t5_2qhh7

Not just assent to the proposition but actually believe it.  After all since you choose to believe something or not it should be easy right?  Just choose to believe it for a bit.You cant of course since belief is not actually a matter of choice.  Sorry but my skin crawls whenever I hear people use the phrase choose to believe.  Belief is a condition that occurs when sufficient evidence or reasons are presented to you.  You can guide that process to some degree by seeking out knowledge and engaging in critical thinking but ultimately belief is not about choice its a cognitive state that befalls you as a result of the circumstances some of which you can set up but some beyond your control.Im less certain about love but I believe its in some respect similar.,lgbt,cmfkqen,2,t5_2qhh7

Beyond that I think its a moral philosophy that by and large seems to act as a moralethical disability. Even if you take out God I seem very little evidence for its worthiness of continuing. All that being said Im a pragmatist and I know that most people arent going to abandon their religion. So what I do is try and move people as far as theyre willing.

Dont just cum and then halt everything and dont ask if he wants to cum because no shit he does we all do. Keep the ball rolling. Another redditor mentioned that even you asking him is making it seem like you dont want to but actions speak louder than words. Either make him cum first or keep it rolling. Let him know how youre feeling communication is key. Its not fair that he doesnt know these feelings your having while he politely says he doesnt need to cum and then breaks down over text to you.

Until such a law is passed or the Supreme Court makes a ruling saying otherwise the states are each free to make their own laws concerning this. Each state has its own constitution. My states constitution defines marriage as the union of one man and one woman and doesnt even recognize samesex marriages performed in other states. It also extends no protections to LGBT folks. You can be fired just for being LGBT. States Rights is a big thing in the US though the states arent sovereign the people are. ,lgbt,coj8pi1,5,t5_2qhh7

Never out anyone for any reason. That is his information to share not yours.Yes his feelings are legitimate and it would be very damaging to suggest otherwise to him. Ive known I was gay ever since anyone even told me what the word meant.As for HIVAIDS and other STIs there is PrEp that lessens the potential of HIV infection. He also needs to go to the clinic and get tested with new partners. Every time. Together. People lie about their HIV status all the time in order to get laid.

No one wants to feel lied to betrayed or like their significant other doesnt trust them. How you approach the subject is important though. Its important that when you tell him you ensure he knows that youre telling him because you care about him and trust him enough to share this part of your past with him. Talk to him about why you got into it in the first place why you got out and how much youve worked to rebuild your life. It is also important to make sure he knows that you get tested regularly so he doesnt have the same reaction as your last boyfriend and that some of the things you did as a porn star you never want to do again. From there how much you tell him should be a matter of how much he wants to know and how much youre comfortable telling him.It may take some time for him to digest but hopefully if you make it a conversation and a matter of trust and intimacy hell be open to it.,lgbt,cq86u5r,1,t5_2qhh7

So the ACT knowing that if they put between two people in the legislation would be rejected so they made between a man and a man or a woman and a woman to try and get it passed without conflict.

3958849,0,t3_35snqc,OK. Youre making a lot of generalizations some of which are related to common prejudices and theyre leading you astray. Anal sex is not something which is only performed by gay people. Gay men do not try to be effeminate talk with a lisp use valley girl body language etc. If person A finds masculine men attractive and person B finds effeminate men attractive it does not create a paradox simply because both person A and person B happen to have the same sexual orientation. Thats like saying its a paradox because one straight guy prefers blondes and another brunettes.The answers to most of your questions can be figured out simply by treating gay people as individual human beings. This shouldnt be as hard for you as it evidently is.As far as your questions about the logistics of anal sex if youre really curious about it you should try it. If youre not curious about trying it then your fascination with it is a little fucked up and to be honest kinda creepy. Your post is coming across as a little homophobic given that you began with an overlydescriptive portrayal of heterosexual sex as beautiful and concluded with an overlydescriptive portrayal of homosexual sex as disgusting.No. Your fascination with gay sex is not the main question many straight people have about gays. It does seem to be a fascination shared by many homophobes.,lgbt,cr7jjcr,15,t5_2qhh7

Peterson which had been written in  by Elkington. The letter was to Oxford academic Peter Thonemann sending images of a copper tablet and asking for information on Greek text on it. Thonemann replied that the item was a modern forgery created during the last  years in Jordan because the text copied a truncated tombstone inscription AD  from the Archaeological Museum of Amman  Thonemann said that he would stake his career on his belief that the material had been faked. Professor Jim Davila also published Elkingtons letter and Thonemanns reply. In his letter to Thonemann in  Elkington said that he had been told that the codices were from Egypt not that the material was from Jordan as stated in his press release. gtOn  April  The Mail on Sunday published an interview with Hassan Saeda whom it described as a Bedouin trucker aged  including extra images from the material and a story of how they came into his possession. The paper made a claim that a face on one plate could be the face of Jesus but gave no authority for it.

Im a gay teen so I guess I would be your target audience The opinion of mine and others that I know that are LGBT is that it doesnt matter what you identify as as long as you are supportive and just simply listen. One of my biggest allies is straight. Hes a good friend of mine. He doesnt know what its like to come out cause he has never done it before. But it doesnt matter because he listens and fights for me. The amount of times he has come out of nowhere and had yelling matches with people that have said homophobic remarks to me is amazing... The amount of times he has wanted to meet my boyfriend or all the other times he has gone out of his way to make me comfortable with who I am makes me feel so incredible. The biggest thing he does is he gives me hope that acceptance of LGBT people is possible outside of the gay community.

4291636,0,t1_cs8kyvq,This one isnt that difficult to contradict The reading of this text is unmistakable  God delivered the people over to sexual lust    Again... This makes no mention of loving samesex relationships built on monogamy and commitment.  Its talking about lustful relationships that were happening during pagan worship ceremonies.  The two arent the same in the least.  men with men committing indecent acts  Still not talking about loving samesex relationships.  These pagan ceremonies frequently involved bloodletting group sex and other such things none of which could even be remotely considered loving samesex relationships.  There is no mistaking Paul here. The reference is clearly to the practice of lesbianism and male homosexuality.  No mistaking? I beg to differ.  The author is still ignoring the fact that Paul clearly painted a scene of idol worship and the things that were going on there.  He also ignores these verses For although they knew God they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him...They exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator...  This clearly shows that he is talking about converted CHRISTIANS who were continuing to take part in their former pagan worship practices.  THAT is what Paul is addressing.  They knew God but they didnt glorify him...  ALL of the following verses continue to build on these passages. But to top ALL of that off... The author clearly shows he doesnt know how to read Romans since he takes a single verse from Romans  that fits his bigoted agenda and stops there.  He doesnt seem to realize that Romans  is ALSO part of what Paul was saying.  Lets take Romans  You therefore have no excuse you who pass judgment on someone else for at whatever point you judge another you are condemning yourself because you who pass judgment do the same things.    Ah... Interesting isnt it?  Paul was setting up the people that would judge others.  He was pointing out the sins of those taking part in the pagan ceremonies getting the Christians who thought they were hot stuff behind him then he turned it around back in their faces.  Exactly what you and yours do when you take this one verse in Romans to condemn a minority group of people. Thats one thing you who love to condemn Gay people seem to forget is that this is a judgment on you as well.  deals with the fact that God has innately made Himself known to humanity but He has been rejected and replaced by other objects of worship.  Again... Hes wrong.  Paul was specifically addressing the newly converted Christians who were taking part in Pagan worship ceremonies and also those that were pointing fingers at them.  Because of this God has delivered two judgments  Wrong.  Paul was describing the things that were happening in these ceremonies nothing more.  Indeed shrine and homosexual prostitution certainly existed in the first century but there is no explicit textual evidence in Romans  that indicates Paul is referring to that.  Except for the parts where he specifically sets up a description of pagan worship ceremonies.  Lets pretend those verses dont exist.  He simply cites homosexuality as degrading  He does no such thing.  He describes the entire scene and those involved as degrading not one specific act. then all the other sins listed that result from a depraved mind vs.  must also be deemed right and good apart from idolatry.   Im not sure why hes assuming that since there are plenty of places in the Bible where those specific things are mentioned as opposed to the six that supposedly mention homosexuality that are easily debatable.  The argument of homosexual sex performed in conjunction with idol worship andor shrine prostitution is clearly one of eisegesis  As is his opinion.  He is ignoring the scene the author was clearly setting up and taking ONE verse out of many to make his point.  That is called cherry picking and it is the worst kind there is.  Taking ONE verse out of an entire chapter and pretending that that is all that Paul is talking about is twisting the scripture to fit your own biased prejudices.  as is the idea that Paul is addressing unnatural homosexuality vs. one that is natural. Why think this assertion is true?  Why assume that its not unless you have an ingrained prejudice against gay people?  that people naturally and instinctively know right sexual practice because of how the human body is made.  This clearly ignores the fact that homosexuality happens in hundreds of animal species.  It also ignores the fact that Paul lived in a heavily patriarchal society where only men had rights.  It ignores the fact that Paul was proslavery said women shouldnt talk in church and were tantamount to property and he contradicts the other apostles and Jesus himself in several places.  But yeah... lets take PAULS word for it. Just as creation is clearly seen leaving the unbeliever without excuse vs.  it is also plain from the way God made human bodies how sex should naturally be carried out.   Except this ignores basic biology and human anatomy.  If we are to pretend the human body was made by god It almost seems as if the human body were made specifically so that sex with either gender is pleasurable.  Women can have pleasurable sex with women and men can have pleasurable sex with men.  One of mans most sensitive erogenous zones the prostate is easily stimulated through the anus at right about the length of a normal penis not to get too graphic.  Why have the body made that way if it was unnatural?  One of the most sensitive erogenous zones for women is found on the OUTSIDE of the body allowing women to pleasure each other without the need of a man.  Again... Why have it this way if the only natural way for sex to happen is with a man?  Why would homosexuality exist in nature outside of humanity if it supposedly wasnt natural?  Those championing a prohomosexual theology are right in that Paul is making an argument of whats natural and unnatural but they are in error as to the crux of the argument itself.   Wrong.  It is the author that is in error since the only way to come to his understanding is to ignore the context of the entire chapter and zone in on a single verse.  Again.  Thats cherrypicking of the worst kind.  The author also clearly ignores that due to the rabid patriarchal society that existed back then loving samesex relationships didnt exist in the same way they do now.  All Paul saw was the sexual relationships with no love involved.  He saw incidences of pedophilia prostitution and idol worship none of which even come close to what exists now.  As Ive said before the authors OPINION for thats all it is is based on nothing more than his ingrained biases.  He has no understanding no love and no reason to think otherwise.  In the end I honestly couldnt care less what you believe.  I believe the Bible itself his inherently harmful and degrading to people in general.  My purpose isnt to convince you to change your beliefs.   Continue to be a selfhating homosexual in a fauxmarriage built off a lie of you want.  My purpose is to counter you and show others that your way of thinking is wrong and built on a faulty foundation.  ,lgbt,cs9e0bm,1,t5_2qhh7

Presidential elections are rarely a landslide now.  Unless the Republicans front a completely unelectable candidate I wouldnt expect one now either.

However there is science to it as well.One place to start is with this video  TLDR  This will explain What the Y gene does. Its just a quick switch to make an already female baby start to become male. But sometimes things can go wrong in more ways than youd think. This video here will show you that is the SRY gene on the Y chromosome that causes physical maleness and how even the genetic factor of XX XY might not determine gender. Issues like these tend to cause intersexed situations. I know i havent touched transgender but plz bare with me. Now if intersexed is the Physical spectrum of gender transcending even the fallacy of the strict XXXY gender concept. Transgender is the brains same effect. Early on in development is a surge of hormones that tend to correlate with ones genetic sex and is triggered towards the body to help it develop one direction or the other. If this surge is incorrect or of an insufficient volume or strength it may result in physical abnormalities or differences. Later in development Another surge happens this one is geared more towards the brain. Influencing its development If things go wrong here it can effect the physical aspects of the brain. Making it land somewhere on the spectrum as well. Much like the previous surge.TLDR  Intersex  physical body  Transgender  Physical Brain Or different sides of the same coin.To expand on the point. The hormonal flux alone could account for a transgender child being born. being it stress on the mother or any number of environmental issues.There are also Genetic predispositions of the fetus to take into account.    just for referance ,lgbt,ctqm22h,4,t5_2qhh7

As a disabled guy I know what you mean when stories are zeroing in on a certain aspect of a person rather than viewing it as a piece of a greater whole. There is value in doing that at times but it almost never ends up being a thorough investigation and examination and just shallow and insulting instead. Trouble is getting a feeling for when what matters in which way but thats what research is for.The idea of societal misfits coming together buding their own world is something that appeals to me a lot and is something Im writing. The topic of how to do proper representation is a difficult one for sure. We need writers from all backgrounds but they shouldnt limit themselves to only firsthand accounts either which is mostly true for novelists because movies and such have usually multiple writers.I think you need to walk the line between acknowledging the various ways being say trans impacts their life but not letting it consume their entire existence. The impact varies wildly and there is no easy answer. ,lgbt,ctynl7g,7,t5_2qhh7
4796237,0,t3_3gio51,I think its also exciting that judges who throw a fit about same sex marriage are disqualified from other cases where sexual orientation is a factor. A common example is if a man and a woman get divorced and while figuring out child custody issues it comes up that one of the parents is straight and one of the parents is bisexual or one of the parents found out they were gay later in life. Doesnt matter if the bisexualgay parent is momdad of the year they sometimes have custodyvisitation knocked down after that ,lgbt,ctz3ru4,2,t5_2qhh7

4926400,0,t3_3i1oj7,This post is  days old but I felt compelled to make a post.  A lot of studies from the s. You cannot support a samesex families damage children in  argument solely based on research from a time when the LGBT family was rare and ostracized by society. Using this logic I could cite published research from a time period when women werent allowed to receive higher education and then use this to support an argument that women are less intelligent than men. The same could be done for Race. Its entirely flawed logic.  Authors most powerful Major American Study quote is from the Paul Cameron literature review that emphasizes one particular study again from the s. Here is her big quotegtchildren of homosexuals will  be more frequently subjected to parental instability of residence and sexual partners and  have poorer peer and adult relationships. Also as is held to be true of their parents homosexuals children will be more apt to  become homosexual  be unstable have emotional problems and difficulty forming lasting bonds with reduced interest in natality and  be sexually precocious and promiscuous Turns out the Author didnt include the entire quote.  In the same sentence as the quotegt...the elaborate socialpersonality theory called common sense predicts that because like produces like...The paper uses this common sense theory to support their conclusions. This theory is the universal assumption that children will be identical to their parents in all psychological and behavioral aspects. The authors quote is merely a list of assumptions justified by this theory with no direct evidence. Here is the sentence directly preceding the authors quotegt...because psychopathysociopathy informs the major expressions of social deviance including homosexuality children of homosexuals will...Funny how the author didnt include the part of the quote that states all homosexuals are psychopaths or sociopaths it might have made her Major American Study appear a little biased and unscientific. Maybe this is because this review was created by the Family Research Institute of Colorado Springs wellknown for strict antigay policies and biased research.  author cites research that suggests all samesex studies have limitations to try and invalidate all samesex research that contradicts her argument. As a result with irony completely going over her head her attempts to invalidate the evidence of the opposing side have invalidated her own evidence. This is pretty much the nail on the coffin in her argument and discredits her entire authority as a writer.  Author references two of her own UNPUBLISHED research papers to conclude the existence of a mountain of social science research.   The studies on the harms of stepparents vs biological parents. This has nothing to do with lgbt families and more to do divorces separations remarriages etc. Here is how easy it is to interpret research as the author has done through her entire argument Divorces separations and remarriages have a higher risk of harming children. A high majority of divorces separations and remarriages come from straight couples. The evidence therefore suggests that straight families present the greatest risk of harm to a child. ,lgbt,cufifgs,1,t5_2qhh7

4998801,0,t1_cuoc4q4,gt I wouldnt say that homophobia and transphobia are VERY common in atheist circles.I think maybe it doesnt matter how common it is what matters more is that atheists homophobes and transphobes have their own unique brand of homophobia which borrows a lot of the language that atheists use when arguing against positions they deem illogical. And thats a point that is very hard to miss. Its not people looking for excuses for why theyre phobic its people who use science and reason specifically as their reason for their opposition against gay people.gt Thats pretty different than religious people who are phobic because their religion tells them to be. The Big Three can point to the exact verses in their holy books that says they are supposed to not only hate gay and trans people but actively persecute them.See this is exactly where we disagree. Im an atheist living in a Muslim country in which the penalty for samesex intercourse is execution. And I can tell you how little the scripture means when arguing with people about homosexuality and whether or not it should be acceptable. I never had to convert a Muslim in order to show them that their views on homosexuality is wrong. Just talking about my own experience and explaining the misunderstandings worked pretty fine. And Ive never received a reaction along the lines of Well that all makes sense but books says no!. People are not robots controlled by their religion people are people and religion is the excuse. Lol its weird that this reminded me of an actual quotation from Imam Hossein Muhammads own grandson with more or less the same subject                    Translation People are slaves to this world and religion is just a plaything on their tongue. When their lives is full they tend towards it but when theres a disaster few of them are truly religious. I promise Im not religious I was in a weird highschoolYou say that their religion tells them to be phobic. That is true but thats not why theyre phobic. Theyre phobic for other reasons being brought up in a homophobic society for example. Its not as though they read their scripture and say huh I never knew I should be a dick toward this people better start!. Its not as though they see homophobia as a logical conclusion of being a MuslimChristian and they decide to be homophobic.gt  So I think religious organizations have not only a responsibility but a duty to speak out against phobia wherever it manifests. I think ulegsintheair is right on the mark.I agree with that but the problem is I often feel like... You know I see Christians being homophobestransphobes and atheists being homophobestransphobes and they all do it in their own unique way and i just dont think that it being more common in religious people means that its in any way different.But perhaps what irks me is that transphobia in internet atheists communities does exist and it has does have its own unique form and so it needs to be addressed separately.,lgbt,cuojjh8,1,t5_2qhh7

Any hormone limit would be based and IS based both medically speaking and competitively soeaking upon the ranges considered healthy in a cis member of the persons identified gender.As for SRS being the legal distinction that is increasingly untrue. In my state for example a bill was passed two years or so ago which ensured that I only need a letter confirming I transitioned medically in some way to change my birth certificate.  Federally changing my gender in the social security system no longer requires confirmation of SRS.   Internationally there is also a movement away from SRS  based gender marker policies.  Argentina Denmark Malta and Colombia all allow people to selfidentify and Ireland just passed a bill that allows trans people to selfidentify their gender.  I believe the UK doesnt require SRS either though Im not sure on that one.   So no it is increasingly NOT the legal distinction even in the US.,lgbt,cuyrksp,2,t5_2qhh7

The evolution of language is a natural phenomenon that occurs because of how language works. People who refuse to allow an insult to become normalised are not working against the evolution of language they are working to ensure the language doesnt evolve into one where homophobia becomes normalised.The sentiment you seem to hold though I am assuming something here so correct me if Im wrong is not uncommon. It has been expressed elsewhere in this thread. The idea that gay has two meanings Homosexual and generic insult and that using it derogatorily is not offensive is frankly stupid.

5194031,0,t1_cvc222d,Oh well I can agree with that. But ofc we must remember half of all LGB people In the US and the study didnt include trans people are religious.It just seems strange to accept part of a premise reject another part of it and then say the claim is a failure. You invalidated part of the premise so naturally it wont come out like the claim.And supernatural divine healing may not exist in any aspects of our world today but at least Christianity is usually discussing the afterlife also not shown any proof in our world unless you accept general proof of a religion as supernatural proof so there are many aspects of the premise already off if you are asserting it onto our base reality.In that same sense however a religionphilosophy without an afterlife could generate premises which disregard the other of society and as such I dont think its the inherent absense or presense of the afterlife which determines the relationship of The other created by people to the rest of the group.That is... the attempt at reconciliation between Christians and who they perceive as others and attackers... this attempt at forgiveness... is sort of an inherently progressive system.If Christians always perceived LGBT people as attackers and themselves as victims there could ofc be no reconciliation as long as they were just required to purge us. But instead they are suppose to forgive us... which requires them to be around us and meet up with us... and eventually discover we werent a problem all along. once again we are ignoring the old testament and only focusing one aspect of Christianity so dont get me wrong this doesnt suggest its all perfect. In a similar sense... if a person is required to forgive a thief that stole bread it forces reconciliation and perhaps a discovery of social situations which forced that person to steal.With our rapist example asking a person to forgive their rapist forces the victim to confront the world which created the rapist. It recognizes the rapist not as a lone entity but as an actor within rape culture. Without such confrontation rape culture is not confronted as creating the rapist to begin with and thus progress is slowed.I think there is something to be said about understanding people who are in a position such that they cannot forgive but I see a large purpose in why the west has come back around to accepting LGBT people and also reanalyzing other aspects of our society as having come from the drive to forgive those who harm or in our case are Perceived to harm but never were harming to begin with.,lgbt,cvc2p5n,1,t5_2qhh7

We tried to get the addicts into shelters and to arrange work study programs to get the ladies off the street.  We also promoted safe sex with those who chose to persist in the trade.Well on a late Friday night the police arrested my outreach worker and charged him with solicitation.  The pictures of all my workers are in the data bank to avoid such confusions.  All the cop had to do was bring it up to confirm that my associate was working for the city and state.  The policeman refused and put my worker in the tank late Friday night so he would have to stay in all weekend.As they put him in the tank they shouted out to the redneck drunks hey boys here is one of the faggots from Montrose.  Setting him up for a beating or a even a killing.  Unfortunately for the bigots I had deliberately recruited an ex Army Ranger for this position.  He turned to the holding cell and said Thats right boys!  Im the deadliest cock sucker in the Western Hemisphere.  Whose first?

Id say the visceral reactions to things that are different are what needs to change in society.Id also say gay is an insult if you believe being gay makes you inherently less masculine and you value masculinity and your fragile about your masculinity.  Im not gay Im bi but thats something I had to deal with.  In the end I just decided that the ancient greeks and romans were wrong about that too to go along with all the other stuff they were wrong about theyre the ones who popularized the stigma against being gay.In the end I decided I am who I am and even if Im not hypermasculine thats ok and Im still a man.  I dont have to worry about being seen as less of a man because other peoples opinions about that sort of thing dont really matter.

6185506,0,t1_cyso6gm,I was not aware of the proposed changes I will look into them  thank you I think that changing the term mental illness to mental health in general will go a long way. ExampleLaws have been already passed to change it and in the field the term Mental Retardation is no longer used  we have to use the term individual with intellectual disability lt Person first and then the learningbehavioral difference. The DSM V has attempted to align itself with the ICD  as far as diagnostic codes and if I understand right in part diagnostically. From my personal experience it isnt so much that people view transexualism and for that matter asexualism as a mental illness but something that they cannot wrap their head around. Another comment I hear is that well it was in the previous book. Yea well homosexuality was removed but it turned into sexual orientation disturbance which was another CYA measure. No matter what is done there will probably always be a CYA clause in the DSM. Personally from use of that book in the field I think people put too much weight into that thing.    Not to sound defeatest or anything but everything takes time and I remember when the discussion about anything LGBTQIA wasnt even being discussed. It is good to see services and safety being provided to the community. Slow change is good change it seems that when we as a society do change quickly it isnt for the greater good because there is less input and other problems. This is pretty new to society and given time it will hopefully change for the better. ,lgbt,cysq7io,1,t5_2qhh7

6540062,0,t1_czvedd9,Im on mobile so I cannot find a way to link to a comment I made earlier so I will copy paste under yours. So sorry if I annoy anyone  I wrote this elsewhere but Ill paste it hereIm not extremely into politics but I read the news everyday us and world and think am quite informed. That being said even human rights campaign HRC whose almost sole purpose was to fight for marriage equality was against the idea of taking it to the Supreme Court so soon which ended up happening and marriage equality was finally legalized nationwide. I remember following a link to a press release pdf on their website explaining why. My first reaction was that they probably wanted to drag it longer so they can get more donations funding etc I have donated to them by the way. But at the same time I thought maybe they are right maybe it is too soon but I didnt really believe it. Also when Obama was running for president and he said he is against gay marriage I was  sure it was BS and I still think that now. I think he was in support of it but it would have been a huge risk for him to accept it. I mean he wasnt gonna loose any gay votes because he opposed gay marriage since the Republican candidate would have been  times worse. I strongly believe it was a fake till you make it situation. And in the end it benefitted the whole LGBT population I believe the Obama administration did more than any other for gay rights movement. They repelled dont ask dont tell they stopped defending the so called defense of marriage act he was the first to openly support gay rights and marriage followed by almost  of the Democratic party and even NAACP Hillary speaking to U.N. about gay rights and finally marriage equality becoming legal across America. Had Obama lost the election because he said he favored gay marriage we wouldnt have any of these! I believe this was also Sanders case even though he was much more honest and vocal about it waaay back before it was mainstream even if he didnt say he supported gay marriage explicitly. Edit btw Im not a huge Sanders supporter my heart says Hillary but my brain says Sanders.. I just wanted to give my point of view. Tldr I genuinely think that Obama didnt really oppose same sex marriage before he got elected  he just took that stance to get elected. But in the end his administration did more than any other to accomplish LGBT  rights here in the US.,lgbt,czvsni1,3,t5_2qhh7

6574516,0,t3_45niyx,gt Well as a part of this community Im sure youve all heard or saidgt at least on one occasion something along the lines of I dont wantgt to define myself I dont like to put myself or other people in agt box or I dont like labels when discussing ones sexuality orgt gender identity. Ive heard that many times and Ive also said thosegt things about myself. I feel like its a common feeling in thisgt community.Speaking as one of the Bs in LGBT my experience with this tendency is multiedged but always sharp.Sometimes if feels like a defensive reaction to omnipresent homophobia. If I dont wear the pink triangle maybe I wont get beaten up or killed.And sometimes it feels like defensive adolescent posturing. Youre not the boss of me.A lot of the time however it feels like bisexual erasure. The Anything But Bi ABB syndromeHumans categorise. Its a strongly selected for behavioural trait. Its limiting and frustrating and reductive as hell. And it turns so much of our experience as humans let alone as humans who experience otherthanexclusiveothersex attraction into clich or platitude.But we all keep categorising and being reductive because this cognitive shorthand is too convenient and useful to do otherwise.So since we cant stop categorising Id argue for improving the categories.For a start Id argue for GSM Gender and Sexual Minority over LGBT or LGBTand yet more letters.GSM is more inclusive and doesnt require adjustment as more folks look to add their experience to our shared and gradually opening up history.And should things ever improve so much that compulsory heterosexuality withers away and we manage to institute a set of social norms that privilege honesty and intimacy over status and power we can kindly but gladly abandon even GSM because it wont matter anymore.

The clothes are forbidden because they lead to toeva rather than the clothes themselves being inherently forbidden.Which is why theres no conflict between this passage and the traditional custom of wearing drag costumes during Purim. Because the costumes are for celebration rather than adultery theres no violation.,lgbt,d0ia7up,1,t5_2qhh7

6930520,0,t3_4anmcy,Okay so this is not a direct answer to your question as I am unsure whether I am LGBT yet still questioning. However I have tried testing the waters with my mom by asking her about what her opinions are on homosexuality and other sexual minorities. Thought she would be supportive but really... it was a little bit of a letdown. Long story short she agreed that she wasnt supportive of homophobic slurs and insults against them but all she is concerned about their physical wellbeing and them being protected against violence against LGBT. However she seems to think that anyone nonheterosexual does not have the full rights a heterosexual person does such as being able to adopt children in samesex couples and such. She calls it unnatural. So that was that. Not sure if that necessarily answered your question as I am still shaky about my sexual identity but there you go.,lgbt,d11weec,2,t5_2qhh7
6935494,0,t3_4ap3xd,So it sounds to me like youre looking for a trial balloon some place or activity where you can go and see what it would be like to live as an openly gay person far away from your parents and friends.  Other people have suggested SF where I live and NYC where I dont and there are plenty of other gayfriendly big cities in the U.S. and Canada you could go to Chicago Los Angeles West Hollywood Miami D.C. Toronto and Vancouver all come to mind.But youll probably find that gay life in those places is... mundane.  Its nice to be gay in public but most people are still going to be worried about their jobs and personal drama and not super interested in making new friends especially with a guy whos just starting to stick his foot out of the closet and will want some emotional support.My suggestion take a gay cruise.  Everyone on a cruise is there to leave behind the mundane parts of their boring lives at home and party in beautiful places with beautiful men.  Itll be a gaysafe space your family and friends wont be able to call you while youre at sea and the people you meet will be more willing to make new friends.But in the meantime reread these parts of your post...gt pressure from family and friends  gt starting to feel suffocated  gt an outlet for these feelings  gt take the pressure off  gt explore this a little more  Taking gay breaks to take the pressure off when youre feeling to depressed or stifled or suffocated to keep going is not a longterm solution to your problem.  Its a bandaid over a gaping wound better than nothing but its not going to cut it for very long.You need someone you can talk to.  Thats the only answer that will take the pressure off in any meaningful way.  Consider therapy.  Consider coming out to whichever of your friends is most trustworthy and nonjudgmental.  ,lgbt,d12gr3p,3,t5_2qhh7

Instead they can give it lip service and just not do much. Im disappointed that in the THIRD reboot of SpidermanPeter Parker  hes still a white kid from NYC which statistically hes not even likely to be. Black Panther is African not African American completely different voices. And Nick Fury and Falcon are secondary characters. Any Hispanic Asian Indigenous Middle Eastern or even nonAmerican white heroes? Does Black Widow count  shes basically been downgraded to secondary as they refuse to give her a movie.

Orientation is considered a better word because its implication is that its just the way you are set up i.e. from birth no choices involved which is how it is.Word choice can seem nitpicky and small but its important that the words we use reflect reality especially when there is still an abundance of confusion and animosity around.Again sorry if my previous comment was offputting and hopefully this helps! ,lgbt,d358n7h,1,t5_2qhh7

As well not all lesbian feminists and certainly not all lesbians are hostile to trans women there is a stigma in the lesbian community which was largely propagated by feminists. As well one of the biggest names in feminism who still is very prominent is transphobe Germaine Greer. Also  today there is an idea that is catching on in a lot of feminists circles that gender is a social construct. Ive had to deal with university teacher throwing that one around. And gender being a social construct is contrary to how a lot of trans people feel and what a lot of science has to say about us.

7959765,0,t1_d4aq4jp,Can I ask you this what is the harm in a one time psych evaluation? What wrong comes from it? As for modular design far enough. Perhaps I should rephrase it. The AR was selected for its efficacy in killing. This is documented. It is a highly deadly weapon in anyones hands in a crowded environment such as this club. There is speed shooting. There are people who practice accuracy. In my experience these people seem to be gun enthusiasts.  They seem to be people who train and respect guns. I dont think they are the ones behind these types of atracks. However even if some were. It is obvious that less skill is required to make an AR deadly. Now perhaps what should be considered is caliber rate of fire and standard magazine size. Sniper rifles are high caliber  but lack the rate of fire an AR has. If a gun has a combination of these features above a certain threshold then it is the type of weapon that could be used in a situation like this. Now perhaps this generalization isnt the best. However I dont think it means one cant be found. Admittedly I am not the most knowledge when it comes to guns if I found I cant proper generalize then that could be a fault of my own. Not a fault of it not being able to be done. Now as for the farmer and the gun enthusiasts. These are people who I think could easily pass a psych evaluation. Most in my experience are sensible people with nothing that would be considered out of the ordinary in a negative light. And if they couldnt pass then that says something about them. Again please instruct me as to why psyche evaluations are bad. Thats part of why I am so unwilling to let it go. I dont see by the downsides and I see a potential increase in safety. I will admit that it would be a bit of an inconvenience  but that doesnt seem a big enough enough of a reason to not consider it. Driving a car takes steps which are inconvenient  but it is a price we pay for safety and its not something that must be done over again. ,lgbt,d4ar3s9,0,t5_2qhh7

7993654,0,t1_d4egh7v,I agree that far too many people are homophobic. I just hate to put of a vibe that someone who is a straight ally is someone we are against. I am sure the article wasnt intended to attack every single straight person but I think authors over such an important subject should be careful with wording. We need to make it known that straight people ARE on our side loud and clear so that more straight people are comfotable being vocal about LGBT rights and so bigots dont feel like they are safe to be assholes in front of any old bloke just because he or she is straight.Back when I thought I was straight there was a big problem with embarassment to stand up for LGBT because I felt like only queer people did that ironically and there was also a problem with people who thought I was straight thinking it was ok to talk bad about gay people to me because of that.Those are common issues that I was not alone in facing. I think getting more straight people comfortable with being on our side would be a massive bolster to our movement.,lgbt,d4ek9n6,1,t5_2qhh7

Seems fair enough to me.Protest efforts have to be constantly evolving to remain effective. Protest is about making it impossible to ignore the problem and people can become accustomed to anything given time and repetition. Pride was a massive demonstration and still is. But it is also now just a thing that happens every year. It has lost much of its power to actually enact change.

8180351,0,t1_d4zw4kr,How are you letting your sexual preference define who you are for embracing your sexuality. By that case heterosexuals do that too. Because they a lot of times talk about who they find attractive thats just preference. And its okay to have nothing in common with gay people nobody said you must find gay friends were humans and we all think differently. You should be proud to be who you are because of who you are not who is around you.I dont want to insist but I think being gay is unique because the majority of people around are heterosexual. If you have a friend and you tell your other friend he is heterosexual no big deal. But if you say he is gay its more notable because gay people arent the majority so they stand out.

If you see that as a curse so will the folks around you. If you see it as an asset so will the folks around you.Having gay friends helps but ultimately the effort to deal with those issues up to you.

For example Im fem and my gf is gender neutral so from the outside people would straight up assume that she is the man in the relationship based on the fact she is less feminine than myself.Sexuality isnt just black and white there is a whoooole lot going on under the surface.

8449908,0,t1_d5xpbbd,I understand its a complicated subject as is.  Im glad you dont view that as the popular viewpoint.  What I meant by making sure is when everybody around you tells you that you are an alien and dont belong here then you will eventually begin to have mixed emotions about yourself and your integrity.  Popular opinion can often affect a persons judgment.I live in the rural country and am surrounded by people who at least sexually are still quite primitive in their views and I wanted to hear a more modern and advanced approach to my situation.  I hope that in the midst of creating equal rights across the board for all genders and sexual orientations we also implement equal responsibilities and taboos.  For example no means no regardless of any other circumstance.  Nobody should be on a mission to enlighten somebody else sexually if they are given a stop sign.He managed to make me feel guilty because at first we were friends.  When I began working there I noticed he took a liking to me very quickly.  I honestly thought he was just looking for friends and liked my personality so he made it a point to be nice to me laugh at my jokes and all those kinds of social perks.  Then he started making it sexual and when I backed away he started trying to guilt trip me.  Like asking me why I didnt talk to him much anymore.  Well for the same reason anybody stops talking to someone when all they want to do is creep on them and try to make things sexual.  It creates a cold disconnect and thats life.  After looking at the situation from a distance I do not feel guilty.  Strong sexual advances can ruin casual friendships when warnings are not heeded.  They can most likely ruin serious friendships too but luckily I do not know that from experience.,lgbt,d5xrwzs,3,t5_2qhh7

Like someone else in this thread said hes appealing to the allies who dont follow LGBT news not the actual community. At least Clinton is making moves to be supportive regardless of whatever she believes inside. But you know what? People change. I was raised very Christian and believed that any sexuality other than straight was a sin. And I changed luckily before I discovered my own sexuality so I didnt have to come to grips with it so much as some people raised conservative but I changed. If Clinton says she has then Im willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.,lgbt,d5y9zc0,3,t5_2qhh7

In particular Stephen Schwartzs decision to prohibit productions of his plays in NC has hit the theatre community hard a community comprised largely of LGBT individuals and one of Governor McCrorys biggest opponents since way back when he was mayor of Charlotte. Also while you might be tempted to say that North Carolinians are to blame for this administration there are actually years of gerrymandering and voter suppression efforts that targeted young and minority voters to consider. Even before HB arts venues have already been targeted by taxes on ticket sales and budget cuts and doing things like blocking productions or cancelling shows even at a concert venue consider all the local technicians and staff that have one less payday for every show cancelled they are part of this community mostly further injures one of the groups already amongst the hardest hit by HB. ,lgbt,d60iq0v,2,t5_2qhh7

8582021,0,t3_4xb3iu,Not me personally but my partner. Hes trans and went in about a month ago for a hysterectomy. After surgery his recovery nurse came out to get me and explained to me that because his doctor is a obgyn the higher ups want to put him in womens services for the duration of his stay. The recovery nurse had said no but was being overruled by the department head. She brought me back to recovery where I wasnt really supposed to be to see my partner who was in a lot of pain and still pretty spracked out on meds and unable to stand up for himself. The recovery nurse and her direct supervisor were fighting with the department head for several hours before it came out that the real reason they wanted him in womens services was because if they didnt have one more patient they were going to have to send a nurse home. By this point hed been in recovery for  hours when he should have been in a room after . I was fed up. I told the department head that this treatment was unacceptable that the surgery was a part of my partners transition and that waking up in womens services would be detrimental. I refused to allow it. As soon as I said that the department head backed off. Moral of the story always have someone who can advocate for you when youre out of it. ,lgbt,d6ec6o1,3,t5_2qhh7

8652452,0,t3_4yadc1,It may be helpful to look at advice given to straight women who are in love with their straight male best friends or straight men who are in love with their straight female best friends. This is a universal situation that happens to everyone its just slightly more complicated for being gay.Some people can stay friends with people they have feelings for. Some people cant. But its almost universal that after a confession or a reveal or things coming to a head everyone needs some space to come back down to a calm place before trying to be friends again. So its on you to set clear boundaries here. Look I dont want to be a terrible friend to you but I need to get a handle on myself to be a good one. I need amount of time to even out. Then we can try being friends again. Then take that time. Id say at least a month. Then when you hang out again give it a week or two and if you still cant handle yourself make a quick but polite and platonic affectionate exit. You seem to have a very solid understanding of the fact that youre not entitled to anything. Thats good. And its one of the few pluses of being a GSM person in these situations straight people seem slightly more likely to get confused if the scripts theyre socialized with dont work. What you need to work on is how you view your romantic feelings. You want reciprocation and you want affection and thats fine but there is a merit in silently loving someone and never seeking to be with them. Think of old chivalric courtly love. If you can reframe your feelings you might not need to control them quite the same way... but if you cant thats ok too.The most important thing is that you need that space. You have to take care of you first and any friendship or romantic relationship has to be based on accepting boundaries. Set this boundary and see where the boundary and the space take you. Best of luck.,lgbt,d6n64v7,1,t5_2qhh7

8676043,0,t1_d6psqea,Yeah. Its a valid defense in the sense that the court hasnt outright said you cant say that!. It very likely wont work as a defense though.All that Californias change did was specifically state that its NOT a reasonable heat of passion defense for having found out orientation gender identity etc. The specific part of the bill beinggtFor purposes of determining sudden quarrel or heat of passion pursuant to subdivision a the provocation was not objectively reasonable if it resulted from the discovery of knowledge about or potential disclosure of the victims actual or perceived gender gender identity gender expression or sexual orientation including under circumstances in which the victim made an unwanted nonforcible romantic or sexual advance towards the defendant or if the defendant and victim dated or had a romantic or sexual relationship. Nothing in this section shall preclude the jury from considering all relevant facts to determine whether the defendant was in fact provoked for purposes of establishing subjective provocation.So the accused cant claim they were provoked in any way. Of course even without this text its very  unlikely for  such an argument to pass in most places. Likely would require a homophobic or transphobic judgejury. Which however is a valid concern. Im reminded of the shit people got away with towards black people in times when juries were almost certainly extremely racist.

8862099,0,t3_51m6l4,I dont see why this sort of information should be known by the government. The government gets any information regarding the gender of people used for any policy from the Census so having a gender marker serves no broader purpose to the government. Its pointless except for indentifying individuals which isnt effective anyways since names are heavily gendered and because even when theyre not even with gender markers men get held responsible for what a woman with his name does and vice versa all the time so they dont even work reliably for the only purpose that they do exist for. Regardless of how much information you think the government should have on you it is obvious that there are significantly better ways of identifying people that arent used. One suggestion Ive seen is greater involvement of social security numbers. One could even include social security numbers using something like a specific QR code encryption on your ID that only the police have the means to decipher. Police identification is done via computers over  of the time as is so it just seems like a logical extension into the future to limit information on your government ID to only being legible to the police by digitizing it.,lgbt,d7d3lf5,1,t5_2qhh7

It means not only that it can be used as shorthand to include all LGBT folk but also as...well a catchall for people who dont fit anywhere specific.   For example I identified for a few years as queer because I was trying to reconcile my attraction to women with the fact that I was with a trans guy.  Bi didnt seem right since he was the only guy I found attractive but lesbian didnt fit either since I was dating a guy...so queer worked best. Of course that relationship ended up being a flaming dumpsterfire and in hindsight I was increasingly finding him less attractive as he transitioned but thats a whole other story.It hasnt been renamed queer rights for exactly the reason they stated above.

9387957,0,t1_d95wbyx,gtThe line between religion and cult is difficult to draw sometimes but I think that this is where we can unequivocally draw the line between teaching and brainwashing. Ie once we agree that an entity is a cult we can necessarily say that it engages in brainwashing.If it doesnt meet the definition of brainwashing it doesnt matter the source. Religion and cults can both try to brainwash people as can nonreligious groups. gtJWs back up their authoritarian approach with a religionwide system of manipulation repression and control. JWs can be punished severely including being permanently shunned by all of their loved ones for having wrong thoughts. If one cant use the term brainwashing to describe teachings used to further this level of institutional control Id argue there is no use for the word to begin with.Brainwashing could describe the overall system you just described but not inherently a single video. Its the difference between  Education vs Indoctrination vs Brainwashing perhaps? A single video doesnt mean Brainwashing but how that video is used in conjunction with other toolsmethodsapproaches wouldcould be described as brainwashing.,lgbt,d95zn9t,-3,t5_2qhh7

The problem is the weird biblethumpers that surround him hate. our. guts.Pence who comes only second in the trump package deal is a fervent believer in conversion therapy and writes stuff like gt Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a discrete and insular minority entitled to the protection of antidiscrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities. Then trump made it clear that he would appoint supreme judges from the far right to stop abortion and punish the women who get aborted. Well guess what the second step for these lovelies will be right ripping apart the marriage equality act and all the progress that was made under Obama for Lgbt people. So you cant just think trump likes gay people hes gonna unite us all because he said so and he held a rainbow flag. You have to look at the big picture. And when you say that you hoped for discrimination and fear to go away well Im sorry but everyone in the world saw those trump rallies with people doing the nazi salute. trump supporters are reeeealy creepy some I assume are good people and if I was american Id be really scared. trump is good at this exhalting peoples anger peoples fears dividing them.

9627854,0,t1_d9z7a6m,Thank you!  Yes it does seem hard to explain I guess this is why I dtill dont fully grasp it. With my sexuality I know that I am attracted to people by their personality and not by their gender. Its a real emotion and a real attraction I feel.  And maybe Its the same for gender for me. I have always gotten along with male friends  more often and as you desrcibe I also just did not understand my female peers.  Personally I wish this whole gender thing did not exist. But I can understand that not everyone feels this way and many people do want to idetify strongly as one gender or another.   The whole gender binary is what we are raised in so thats what I am used to. I dont think I am doing it in defience. I do feel as if people might think that though. I just feel as if I fall in the middle  of the spectrum when it comes to everything haha.  I dont know if I care about pronouns personally although it would be better if we lived in a society where no one just assumed pronouns. And I guess if I did live in a world where no one assumed pronouns maybe I would prefer they them. It would be cool if theythem was the assumed pronoun and if people prefered he or she then they would say.   But I just dont know for myself!  I dont want to make people feel as if I just stick to my assumed pronouns because i dont want to make a fuss because this doesnt help the advancement of lgbtq rights. but I just dont feel strongly towards any pronouns.  Maybe I will change but currently I dont really care if peopled refered to me as hehim sheher or they them.    ,lgbt,d9ztx70,1,t5_2qhh7

9643450,1,t1_da1r5vb,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,lgbt,da1r5xw,-3,t5_2qhh7

Inside your head you know being gay is a choice because youre equally attracted to both sexes and you are making a choice to be straight. So antigay bisexual people would naturally project this onto everyone. They think everyone thinks like them and therefore everyone is bisexual and therefore being gay is a choice. gt Same with closeted and in denial gays. They think everyone is just resisting the totally natural urge for gay sex. So they preach hard about resisting the urge and making the right choice because they themselves are constantly fighting the urge...gt They dont realize that straight people dont have any homosexual urges and its not a fucking choice.

Not your Biological Gender which you can only change through surgery and is decided on by outward physical characteristics And neither of those are Biological sex which you are stuck with from birth and is identified in your chromosomes There are only two biological genders Gender ROLE is a sliding scale between two ends of the spectrum with as many named points as socially accepted. People shorten both of these terms to gender which then of course leads to massive confusion.So.Your Sex is Male sorry hun bad luck.Your Biological gender at the moment is Male until you get surgery.And your Gender Role it seems to me is Demigender back in the s people would say you wanted to be a tomboy.,lgbt,dabh0m7,1,t5_2qhh7

I was unaware of the whole spectrum and how gender is actually very fluid until my psych college course about a year or so ago.     At what age did you decide where you fall into what you identify as today?  Ive always identified as a bisexual female.     Where are you from very general? Is that area accepting of there being more than two genders?  I currently live in a redneck town so no they are definitely not accepting of that. Myself and a couple people are though and we try to make anyone who doesnt feel welcomed at the least feel safe with a friend.     How do you view your own gender?

Its crazy. I can find anyone attractive I can love anyone regardless of gender identity thats it! End of story. It doesnt mean Im going to leave someone for someone else...

9911632,0,t3_5he8cl,gt When transwomen call themselves lesbians there is a category problem as lesbians by definition are not attracted to biological males. I have urged trans activists to find their own words as them calling themselves lesbian goes against lesbians rights against homophobia.I see the claim but no substantiation of said claim.gt Transwomen are not part of our sexual attraction so including them is very problematic and refusing advances from transwomen many times result in unwarranted aggression and false claims of bigotry all because of a personal preference as I am sure many fellow lesbians could attest to.Not sure how shes been elected to speak for all cis lesbians. Fortunately whats true for her isnt true for all lesbians.gt Transactivists should learn how to be welcome in other peoples homes...You certainly seem welcoming. gt No one supports lesbians in this...Theres entire Gender Critical subs that do nothing other than provide an echo chamber for identical views.gt Intelligent non misogynistic and non homophobic transwomen that know their proper place  out in the alley are welcome...gt Otherwise I see the LGBT will fall apart.No it wont fall apart. For all the caterwauling Ive never witnessed a trans lesbian try to guilt a woman into dating her and Im not sure how that would even work.Your preference is your own and if you allow someones opinion to force you into a relationship against your will the fault lies within you. Im sorry you categorically dismiss trans women as women  but thats your prerogative. I feel no need to engage you and try to change your mind. What does bother me about your screed is you claim to speak for all cis lesbians when that is obviously untrue. Unsure what your purpose was but luckily you dont set policy all cis lesbians nor do your words represent all their beliefs.,lgbt,dazibml,2,t5_2qhh7

Appreciate the distinction and stop twisting my words.gt Im not sure if I get what youre saying here Then simply ask rather than ramble on speculating about my meaning.gt Also Straight people do automaticallyWhat I mean is that straight people are unabashedly straight. Your argument that sexual orientation is a private issue is a completely false one. Every time a straight person introduces their husband or wife or girlfriend or boyfriend or says something like My boyfriend whom I live with said the darnedest thing the other day around the water cooler with their coworkers they are declaring their sexual orientation. Its written into their lives and publicly so. The only reason gay relationships arent public is because they go out of their way to avoid being public. Being straight is never an issue of privacy. Youre conflating sexual orientation with sexuality... and all too frequently people use this as an excuse to avoid being out because they are still embarrassed by it.

10028246,0,t3_5janhn,You are in the process of making a choice on whether or not to be open about your life with the people you love. If there is any chance that your dad and brothers anger might turn even a little bit violent dont come out just yet. Wait until you have a secure life away from your family. If you can make sure you have the originals or certified copies of any identity documents medical files educational records and anything irreplaceable away from your family home. If you live with your folks stash them with a trusted friend or relative who knows about you and wouldnt keep them from you for any reason. Consider adding spare clothes and medication and maybe a sleeping bag. Hopefully you wont need it but its best to plan for the worst.Once you have a safety net in place have a think about what you need them to know. That you love them and will continue to love them and hope they will be able to do the same for you. That sometimes you will introduce them to someone you love and that person might be a man a woman or something else again and they would only get to see someone you are serious about. Or whatever is true. That you hope they would be able to respect the fact that the person you introduce them to is important to you and treat them with the respect they deserve as a human being. That you will answer questions honestly and openly even if the answer is I dont know yet. Theres probably other stuff too but try to stick to the essentials to start with. Coming out can be a lot for a sheltered family to take in so go slow and be clear.Sometimes family can surprise you for the best reasons. Over on the trans subs we get stories every day of family that was presumed to be too conservative to be safe spontaneously becoming the strongest of allies because no one messes with MY family. Of course that goes the other way sometimes too where the opennest minds just cant get behind a LGBTQ child in their own house.

10041471,0,t1_dbgf2bu,hes probably so accustomed to having representation that anything that deviates from the norm to him feels forced. Textbook example of being privileged. When deviation from the norm happens those most benefited from the current norms often feel threatened or at odds. They dont have the agency to decide what is and isnt okay in regards to stories that represent us. Also everything doesnt need to be straight either. Actually if every narrative featured an LGBT character in some form it would probably be a good thing and would cradle more positive attitudes towards LGBT people especially amongst young people instead of perpetuating homophobic ideals that a lack of representation reinforces. So no the dudes argument doesnt have as much going for it as yours probably does. Ill take challenging the status quo over keeping things the same any day because the way things are causes  people like us to deal with a lot of crap we shouldnt have to just on the basis of who we love.

10149329,0,t3_5lavba, First thing is making sure she is safe which means getting her away from her abuser if she wants she might not want to it takes an average of  times for someone to fully leave an abusive relationship. Could you get her the number for American Samoa Alliance against DV www.asalliance.org  ? Flying her back might not be an option right now but they might be able to get her somewhere safer. Also Im not sure how it works in Samoa but I know the police in the states can issue an emergency protective order they often dont want to offer it because it means more paperwork that can be a stopgap measure until she can get a restraining order. Third is shethis abusive guy there with the military? Our armed forces have some programs that might be able to help her out  if thats the case. Lastly dont forget to take care of yourself. There are a lot of hotlines you can call if you need to brainstorm more ideas vent or process your own feelings about this situation. We cant take care of others until weve taken care of ourselves.

Look at this thread almost no one shares the same definition of bisexuality. In my opinion the purpose of announcing ones sexual orientation is to signal to potential partners whether or not one might potentially be attracted to them. For me pansexual accomplishes that by telling people in no uncertain terms that I am attracted to people of all sexes and genders. In light of that I personally find the bi label to be essentially useless though I expect there are plenty of people who will vehemently disagree with me.,lgbt,dcgz18q,2,t5_2qhh7

10390435,0,t3_5or97g,You know the FBI records that most hate crimes are targeted towards gay people. Who are incidentally the ones most likely to end up homeless. Theyre also most likely to end up either verbally or physically abused than any other minority group.I tend to agree that a lot of people use the whole gay thing to cry Oppression! when they live rather lavish lives but to generalise that to the entire population is quite horrid if you ask me. On an unrelated note I take personal offence to the Muslim comment. Im a middleeastern kid and honestly if whoever wrote that comment saw half the shit gay people go through in Islamic countries theyd liken it to war crimes. I cant tell you how many lesbian friends I have who got locked up for months on end because their parents suspected they might not be straight. One of my friends was forced to go to a special jail that holds homosexuals and other people threatened by their families because if the state lets them out their families can kill them under the banner of honour crimes and thered be no legal repercussions. Within us Christian minority its not exactly any better. Honestly being left alone would be a godsent for many people who didnt get as lucky as me.

Transgender people have up to  of those things that match their real gender. Chromosomes arent the end all be all. There is so much more to it. gt If its mental it would be the first time we would be suggesting a person get mulilated to resolve an issue in the brain.I once had surgery to remove a cyst from my arm. It was surgery not mutilation. Since when does surgery to treat a legitimate medical issue considered mutilation? Also... Id say a majority of transgender people never have any type of surgery on their genitals. gt Is this considered a mental disorder or physical?As I said before gender identity has biological origins. Dysphoria which is caused by the mismatch is a condition. Dysphoria is what gets treated by transitioning. Its the only known treatment that works for gender dysphoria. gt If you using that restroom causes everyone else to feel uncomfortable? It gets confusing there.Before I transitioned people were uncomfortable with me in the womens room. I have a hormone condition that caused me to get facial hair since I was . Women would often confront me assuming I was a guy. I made them uncomfortable. Was I really supposed to use the mens room just because some ladies got freaked out by my presence??? No one has a right to be protected from people they find uncomfortable. To be really honest amputees used to make me incredibly uncomfortable and grossed out as a kid. I didnt want to be near them.

Genderqueer is one of several identities that captures not identifying as a girl or guy. There is also a distinction between identity and expressionsome people will identify as a woman for example but prefer masculine or androgynous expression. If you look online Wikipedia would be one place to start you can find information about the range of specific gender nonbinarynonconforming experiences and its possible one may really speak to how you see yourself.I cant say what your identity is but I can say that what youre experiencing is normal.

10960139,0,t3_5wixgy,For starters trans women are not biologically male. Someone biologically male would not have the requisite brain physiology to develop a female gender identity. You might be able to argue a few lesser points on the issue before HRT enters the picture but post HRT the biology of a trans woman is female.The people calling lesbians transphobic for not wanting to date someone with a penis are an extremely tiny minority among trans people. Nearly all trans people agree that disliking an unusual genital configuration is not transphobic. But you seem to be under the mistaken assumption that all trans women have a penis. This is far from the case. What IS transphobic is if they only reason youre not attracted to someone post op and post transition is their trans status.Some people have a tiny bit of fluidity to their sexuality. One exception does not require a person to change the label they identify with.Im not even binary female Im trans feminine non binary and rather androgynous and Ive still dated straight guys and lesbians. Hormone therapy is powerful stuff.Straight trans people dont transition to avoid being seen as gay. A cis person transitioning usually ends up experiencing gender dysphoria similar to what trans people experience. A persons sexuality is independent of their gender identity.,lgbt,deaglji,3,t5_2qhh7

11062842,0,t1_dela782,gt i think its sad that the more i pay attention to trans issues the more cracks i find in LGBT unity. Theres a very long history of this problem going on. In anthropology they actually have a hypothesis that transsexuality is the reason for homophobia in western societies. The TLDR version is that western civilization went through this process of wanting to resolidify eroding gender roles and LGBT people were assumed to be more or less the same problem to the strict genderrole proponents. Its easy enough to see why in the time before medical treatments for trans people there was no way for the public to differentiate between flamboyant gay guys amp MtF TS people or between masculine lesbians amp FtM TS people. gt not only do i see many people outside of the LGBT community openly hostile to trans people but its disheartening to see allies within the LGB fanning the flames by suggesting that we kick the T out because apparently to them sexual orientation and gender are completely incompatible and nonrelated issuesIts a two fold problem. The first problem here is that LGB rights probably can advance faster if they drop T inclusion. This is why Harvey Milk and Barney Frank were openly transphobic throughout their entire careers and went around stripping trans inclusion from any LGBT policy to come across their desks. Year after year Barney Frank while using disgusting slurs to refer to trans people would have them stripped from ENDA.This was the morally wrong thing to do and I disagree with it but it is unfortunately true that it is easier to get the public on board with LGB protections than Tinclusive protections. In state after state antidiscrimination policy proposals have gone down in flames the moment T inclusion is part of the policy. Without fail what happens is some usually religious right politician starts talking about but what about your daughters encountering trans people in bathrooms?! and then the entire LGBT proposal will just die right then and there. This has happened in state after state over the course of decades.The second problem is that the umbrella T term of transgender includes unrelated conditions that dont share anything in common other than the way the public treats them. So there is no relevance or consistency within TG much less LGBT. Back when TS was seen as a psychological disorder it was listed in the DSM as an identity disorder while TV was listed as a paraphilia where it remains to this day. Eventually TS was delisted from the DSM after all these brain studies proved that trans people really do have a brainbody mismatch problem going on and therefore are dealing with a physiological not psychological medical problem. This is in complete contrast to transvestitism which is when someone engages in cross dressing for sexual pleasure as a sexual fetishkink.But this second problem is not really a problem because even if TVs are fetishists that doesnt mean it should be legal for people to commit hate crimes against them for it. From an ethics perspective if they are facing job or housing discrimination or assaults rapes murders etc. something should be done about it regardless.,lgbt,delye2y,2,t5_2qhh7

Skype doesnt let you call emergency numbers but this was a direct call to the police station itself and I guess it worked fine.When I tried to call the number I got an error message from Verizon and I think other people got the same sort of thing.It wasnt a Skype account but you can call actual celllandline phones from Skype and this let us get past carriers stupid noworldwidecallingunlessyoupayextra schemesSkype Rates,lgbt,dfx8gh8,3,t5_2qhh7

I mean I dont think the way its been put across here is subtle at all or right but when someone with male anatomy identifies as female surely they shouldnt be able to do things that either put them at an advantage or disadvantage to others? Because then you just have trans female wresters constantly winning or trans male boxers constantly losing for example. This isnt sexist its just factual that males and females are biologically different and theres not too much you can do about that right now. ,lgbt,dg007qm,37,t5_2qhh7

11578247,0,t1_dg8a5oe,Jesus fucking christ that is chilling. Shit even just you relating you were being hassled pisses me the fuck off. gtThere were many ways they could take you away to jail for the night or the weekend under existing laws wout having a law that actually mentions bathrooms and thats if you were lucky enough to not have something on you like drugs or an illegal weapon of some kind for self defense which could result in you staying in jail a lot longer.Yea I bet if the cops were feeling rowdy theyd slap you with a psych hold for being the wrong gender too. This bit Im not surprised about. Theres a reason I dont piss cops off but the worst thing is being trans or black or whatever theyd hate you for in the s and s means you dont get to decide to piss cops off they find you. Wow I never knew about the Stonewall riots! Holy shit. This reminds me of an article I read the other day about Alabamas previous governers one of which was antisegregation and actually spent half his time in office encouraging systematic attacks on blacks and even himself physically attempting to block black students from entering university campuses. In school they taught us all about Jim Crow and how people used to treat black people and that sort of history but while I knew it was bad for homosexuals and the like around the same time periods I never imagined it was on par with the systematic violence and prosecution almost step for step.Thanks for educating me on this! Theres so much I STILL dont know about the LGBT community despite actively spending time on reddit and news sites and such reading about them!I hope its better for you now though. Id like to think Americas made giant leaps and bounds of progress for this too. If not maybe I should start wearing a dress as well to make a point. ,lgbt,dg8efjy,3,t5_2qhh7

It took a long time for her to rebuild.Jenner on the other hand has shown an amazing lack of self awareness that boarders on insanity.EDIT I think some young people are confused by what I am talking about. When someone comes out I America now no one cares. When Ellen came out few knew what a gay person was. Conservative family people were SHOCKED to see they liked one of those homosexuals.
