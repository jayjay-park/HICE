577076,0,t3_20oh94,I agree w discokittie. A little heavier wire would make the pin less flexy. You might also try tempering the wire by slightly flattening it with a small hammer and gentle taps once its formed. This will make it springier and a tiny bit wider. Really great wrap on the herringbones and I love the bead!,WireWrapping,cg5v97w,2,t5_2z89v

5016969,0,t1_cuqm0dm,I really appreciate the feedback actually. I had thought about sanding the wires and curving them up top. I will try it out next time but I dont want to alter the design to much. Wrapping the wire around the crystal in the end is probably the hardest part and I did my best to keep it even. Not much else I can do besides doing it better next time. Thx for the  reply and follow much love to you. ,WireWrapping,cuqqh48,1,t5_2z89v
5128327,0,t3_3l408j,Theyre pretty but you should stay away from drilled and beaded stones and try to add some accents. Wrapping one stones cool but the more the merrier,WireWrapping,cv45m38,1,t5_2z89v

6808966,0,t1_d0o2x0x,From what Ive heard from several people the liver of sulfur does last longer if stored in a glass bottle.  It also emits less fumes when you open it because there is less to react with. I dont have any experience with this personally though.  The small felt wheels do last for a short time but I love them also.  Have you ever tried silicone or chamois wheels?  Any of the M wheels?  Ive personally tried the silicone wheels and love them.  You dont need any rouge with them and come to a much finer polish.,WireWrapping,d0o3cs3,2,t5_2z89v

Maybe its too busy with all the tentacles? I think if you decluttered one gentlemanelement it might be a bit clearer? In terms of execution  flawless. In terms of design its the tiniest bit confusing.,WireWrapping,d7dn7en,3,t5_2z89v

11132568,0,t1_detv4jj,I tend to think of the central idea cab small stone settings and then build from there as I go. I have a couple ideas sketched down but sadly Im a terrible artist lol. But worth an attempt. The current sketch is certainly more creative then my wing it attempts! Thanks for the tip  ,WireWrapping,detv73o,2,t5_2z89v
