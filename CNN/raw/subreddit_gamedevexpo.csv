10288361,0,t3_5nbyu5,I thought Id give a few details if anyone is interested.Ive been developing this for about a week. It was going to be a completely different game but after watching a few great talks from different developers I decided to make this. Here is one of my favourites from the group of talks This is a prototype level so I havent had a chance to explore everything I want to. I have a ton of ideas for level settings hazards really challenging levels etc..Each level will have a leaderboard as I like the idea of trying to beat someones score. Also youll be able to view your personal best.This level is very easy as Im treating it as level  where nothing can harm the player and they can explore the mechanics.The music is not for the game just something nice to hear whilst watching.,gamedevexpo,dca8pl3,1,t5_33945
11310812,0,t1_dfe1vzr,Its a DDR style game where the various stages are mixed up and toast comes down the ramp faster as you are successful. Its not intended for s of hours of play but a quick easy challenge to play when youre waiting in line or doing something else. ,gamedevexpo,dfe2a7s,1,t5_33945
