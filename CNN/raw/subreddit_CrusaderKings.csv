It does tend to get trashed in battles where you have less than twice the opponents numbers but when people talk about the skirmish retinue sucking in battles I find they tend to disregard that they rock when theyre in heavily superior numbers. Like if you drop a k skirmish retinue on a  strong enemy army you will annihilate them before you ever get to the melee phase losing maybe  dudes at most and destroying the enemy stack. When you drop a retinue of the same size thats geared towards fighting evenodds battles lots of cav horse archers HI etc. theyll still win but theyll take more losses and its more likely that the enemy will escape with  men or so.,CrusaderKings,cf3m7z5,6,t5_2tgic

401250,0,t3_1yogvw,Burghers hold cities and bishops hold temples as a noble youll want to hold on to castles county seats and baronies beneath them. A holding will receive pretty significant tax and levy penalties with the wrong type of ruler. In general when you get the Wrong Type of Holding notification you should try and give it to the correct type of ruler. Either to an unlanded courtier previously landed vassal or a newly created one through the given holdings menu. Thats not to say theres never any reason to hang on to the wrong type of holding for some amount of time. If you have really high stewardship you can still get a decent amount of gold out of a city or temple as a noble. Sometimes youll want to wait until your new vassal has come of age gets married has a child or some other factor. Keeping a temple holding around for a pesky uncle or brother can be useful when youre still under Papal Investiture. Additionally you can end up with a holding that is part of a county contested in war that you end up having to hold on to even if you dont want it until the conflict has ended.Also worth mentioning is that you can still gain advantage in giving away a holding you cant properly hang on to. If you have for instance a newly built city in a county you dont control give the city to a younger siblingcousinsome type of claimant of the county rulers title to introduce some instability in what should have been a pretty clean succession. Additionally you can doubledip on the positive opinion bonus by effectively giving away the holding twice first to whomever you give the holding to and another time when you transfer the vassalage over to the proper ruler.,CrusaderKings,cfmcsvy,1,t5_2tgic

This is my ongoing Ashinas ironman game for those of you who dont know theyre the owners of Jerusalem at the  start and are extremely fun to play. I first spread to form the kingdom of Syria before putting one of my kinsman on the imperial throne eventually I claimed it for myself and usurped the empire. From then on it was just mass invasion after mass invasion and now Ive become completely unstoppable Im waiting for the Mongols to have an actual challenge. Also I did a bit of RP in this game thats why I have  million kingdoms. Also instead of killing all my kin I just say its family tradition and imprison them when I rise to the throne. Its important to keep them alive in case you dont have sons one of my Caliphs didnt.So yea pretty much .

537611,0,t1_cg182xh,I... dont quite follow.It seems like youve been told these verses or saw these verses as singular messages and use them as oneliners out of context.Firstly the Christian faith doesnt take commands from the Old Covenant.  That is Jewish Law.  Its explained a bit in Galatians  .  Paraphrasing it is stated that the law was put in place to guard and protect Gods chosen people from the world but now that the savior has come we no longer need the Law as a guardian.Secondly you are taking the verse completely out of context to justify your viewpoint.  I would recommend reading the entirety of chapter  before coming to your own conclusions.  To be Christian is to attempt to be Christlike  so of course the Christ would be highest in priority regardless of instance from my point of view.  However in  John  its made clear that God is love and love cannot be had without God.  As such to love God is to love well love.  To place God in this instance Jesus above your wife is to place the very power and emotion of Love above the actual things that you actively love be it a relationship person or item.As for the Veggie Tales being watered down  yeah it is.  It is very watered down.  Read st or nd Kings alone and youll see why.  The Bible can be a very morbid thing just as any history book or religious book or  if youre of the opinion that the Bible is fiction  any work of fiction may be.  Parents dont want to subject  year olds to the horrors of famine and plague and mass killings.  If youd like to explain to your child what war is and what it is like to kill or be tortured or have your eyes plucked from your sockets and then held captive for years on end as a shell of your former self feel free to do so.

784289,0,t3_234104,The secret to winning wars  if youre playing for optimization  is archers. Having a retinue of k archers will destroy almost any army of comparable size and will let you siege any holding without hesitation.    If you want to assassinate a person make sure to put your spymaster in their county with the option build a spy network. This way when you go to assassinate someone from the diplomacy menu you will have almost no chance of getting caught depending on the targets intrigue as well.    There are many nuances to this game. One of my favorite ways to continually wage war especially if you have multiple claims against someone but can only press one at a time is to park my spymaster in the enemy capital and assassinate the enemy leader after making a truce. This way you can declare war on the new leader without getting a truce breaker penalty. This is especially helpful for holy wars.    Marry your heir to princesses of other empires or kingdoms. This will hopefully give you a grandson who can now inherit both your kingdom and the other kingdom. Youll probably have to help the other kingdoms heirs find their way to the graveyard if there are any in front of your grandson.    Keep an eye on other nations that neighbor you. When they have regencies or female rules you can press weak claims. In my current game I just usurped the HRE as the empress of Britannia.    Just keep playing. Youll have many aha! moments,CrusaderKings,cgtfe94,2,t5_2tgic

The game does have different start points across a  year time frame from when the continent of Westoros main continent was ruled by the Andals the first people. Then came the Targaryens with dragons and united Westeros and ruled for about  years before Robert Baratheon rebelled and usurped the throne. The dragons died sometime in this time frame. Robert ruled for about  years before dying and the throne went to his son Joffrey. Both of Roberts brother believed they should have the throne and there was a succession war.

1007394,0,t3_25mvy6,The key to defeating the muslims is to destabilize them as much as possible before the jihads are triggered. Holy war the hell out of independent muslims and look out for when the caliphate is undergoing a decadence revolt or shia caliphate uprising. During the revolt declare a Holy War for land that will pretty much be uncontested while they fight the decadence revolt then if the new caliphate is sufficiently weak declare war on them as well. This might be unlikely because of leftover event troops from the decadent revolt but its still possible.I managed to crush the muslims as the Armenian vassal of the Byzantine empire. I cut off fellow dukes from Holy Warring the independent muslim states and gathered them all under my vassalage. When the Shia Caliphate declared war on the Abbasid Caliphate for Mesopotamia I had an uncontested Holy War on the Abbasid Caliphate because their forces were destroyed by the Shia. Then after the Shia carved out their own land I declared war on them to take even more land. I triggered the Jihads when I retook Jerusalem but that triggered the Holy Orders for the Orthodoxy meaning gaining more land was even easier. Note this is while I was still a vassal of the emperor and not the emperor myself.The only threat that ever came from the muslim world was when the Seljuks emerged and retook Mesopotamia but they soon vied for independence after I managed to destroy most of the Seljuk doomstacks. Retaking those lands was simple. After getting most of Jerusalem and Mesopotamia under my rule as the Queen of Armenia I finally was able to press my claim to the Byzantine Empire against a  year old empress. I defeated her and am now the Empress of the Byzantine Empire.I of course executed the little girl before she could challenge me for the throne with her strong claim or bear heirs to inherit the claim.,CrusaderKings,chisr5r,6,t5_2tgic

1088583,0,t1_chs07t0,Possibly one of the nerdiest of debates i might enter myself in to in a while  Khal Drogo was at first to Dany just this weird relationship but it definitely expands beyond that Dany sacrifices her child for the chance of Drogo living. Moon and stars and all that. Rhaegal twice was a typo. Rhaegar was the ideal of a Targaryen quote King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness were two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born he said the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land. Rhaegar firmly fell on the side of greatness with most of the seven kingdoms acknowledging it. Dany honouring Rhaegar makes complete logical sense.I agree Viserys seems like an unlikely choice but she is the only family Dany ever knew for so long and whilst he was manipulative and conniving ultimately he was family. Dany knew that Viserys had to die for disrespecting the Dothraki but she didnt take any pleasure from it.A Song of Ice and Fire isnt the story of Aegon the Conqueror in fact i would argue that Aegon was conquering seven kingdoms eventually six rather than reclaiming the Iron Throne as Dany is.There are parallels but to place it in the context firmly of history isnt acknowledging the defining attributes that make Dany Dany. ,CrusaderKings,chs0wec,2,t5_2tgic

Its much easier to make sure five kings have  opinion than  dukes. Then again if you play with a few king vassals and you cant get them high enough theyre probably powerful enough to give you major problems especially during succession with a young heir.I know Arumba likes playing with King vassals and seems to manage them well. If youre Norse or a Republic and you can get loads of money for gifts and stuff then it might be worth it to do Kings. If not its a harder game.,CrusaderKings,chu8pq0,1,t5_2tgic

This is very very generalized but still basically true. There havent been any Orthodox crusades.Not to say that Orthodox churches havent taken sides in disputes they have.

1778820,0,t1_ck2cx91,This is something I would absolutely love to see. In both history and fiction the lasting relations between dynasties is a hugely important factor in politics and warfare very good fictional example is StarkBaratheon. It gets aggravating when you have to risk inbreeding just to maintain an alliance for more than one generation or have to hand your ambitious prick of a son a prized ally while you gain nothing from the deal. A  modifier and possibly outright allianceCB between two families would be an incredible addition to the game that would make diplomatic strategy even more important than it already is.More importantly though to me think about the storytelling and decision making elements this would add to the game. Backing your long time friends as they stake a claim for the throne or betraying them as their enemies descend upon their lands. A ducal family never forgetting that their kings grandfather is the one who got them those lands in the first place. Two families hold generations long grudges after a murder.

I can find no record of a significant battleready AngloSaxon fleet in the sources I have access to in regards to the invasion of William on JSTOR on google books or anything but the fact that you think that William was fighting in the th Century and that there would be a pitched battle in the English Channel between men in armor more akin to Sluys in  but even then armor was not something the common soldier would have had. That would not be what naval warfare would have been like. Merely because  of Harolds ships were involved in the invasion of Wales does not indicate that it had any role in the battle against William.gti said his preparations were part of what delayed william.No you didnt. You said gtwilliam the conqueror would have had to have been an idiot to not realize the threat that harolds navy posed especially considering it harried harolds brother earlier in the year and basically forced stamford bridge to happen.Stamford Bridge happened on Sep  . Hastings happened on Oct  . In fact William landed on Sep  . He would not have known about Stamford Bridge at the time of his landing or if he did information would not be sufficient to indicate fear. How would the information of any battle or even any harrying of Tostig have reached William on the other side of the England within such a short period of time?And Im merely addressing your statement thatgtnaval battles or rather fear of one was a big consideration in william the conquerors invasion. in fact he delayed the date to avoid running in to english ships that hed have to battle with.I see no sign that Williams decision to attack at the chosen time as one out of fear of a naval battle. At time time he would not have even have known or at least known well or any harrying of the Norse fleet in Stamford Bridge merely weeks ago. This is  not . Im demonstrating that there werent any English ships hed have to fight with and even if there were theyd be irrelevant in the consideration. Please cite your sources to show that the AngloSaxons had a fleet worth Williams fear that William feared such a fleet and that it made a difference in his decision. JSTOR pages are fine Google books are fine websites are fine anything. But you pulling it out of your ass isnt.Cite your sources.

Theres also stuff like trade over the Russian rivers which first brought the norse there. Come to think of it theres also the problem with Merchant Republic trade zones where the lack of proper trade routes leads to chokepoints not providing as much money as they should. For example having control over the sea of Marmara should pay dividends larger than those youd get from simply trading with the cities there.

England got an intestacy act in  and Scotland in . This determines what happens if you die without a will and it largely gives children equal shares in the estate. Feudal obligations the main reason for the existence of primogeniture were mostly abolished in .What I think the story is saying is that in Scotland under what is known as family provision legislation if you disinherit someone who the law regards as someone you should provide for that person can sue the estate for a judicially determined portion. However when it came to land if the testator disinherits all except the eldest son no right to sue would arise.,CrusaderKings,cmhvh43,2,t5_2tgic

2680880,0,t1_cn8i2kc,Actually it would be more akin to being a team captain rather than a coach. This is because during this era a combat leader would personally lead his men into close combat. I mean Richard III didnt train all day with a sword so that he could impress party princesses during dinner. He did it because as a leader of men he was expected to get stuck in and this is how he eventually died.After the late medieval period it became more common for leaders to lead from the rear but any officersleadership training would include a lot of personal combat because you wont be any good if you ride into battle at the pivotal moment leading your men and get instakilled. It wasnt really until the massive armies of the Napoleonic wars that the general of the army would stay way behind the lines in relative safety Remember that Henry Paget got his leg shot off at Waterloo while seated on a horse right next to Wellington.So being a good combat leader should automatically lead to a significant increase in personal combat ability.Edit Im not saying the stats are the same but Im saying that if you study war then that should automaticall increase your personal combat stat because that is how it worked in medieval times you studied one and you studied the other.

If you start out as the Abbasid Caliphate and manage to stabilize your internal situation then its fairly easy to unite the sunni world through subjugation. Even outside of that there are plenty of decent Sunni Sultanates who can expand through holy war county conquest and invasion. As a Shiite the only good choice in terms of power and geography is the Idrisid Sultanate and although its not terribly hard to eventually form the Shia Caliphate the small number of Shia nations means that you will have very few allies on Jihads and even fewer good targets for subjugation.  Theres also one small Ibadi Emirate in North Africa I cant remember the name off hand but due to the small size and lack of other Ibadi nations they definitely have a weak starting position compared to any of the powerful Sunni Sultanates.,CrusaderKings,cnbatcx,2,t5_2tgic

With the highest city taxes your laws and tech allow of course. Coastal cities can build two income producing upgrades instead of just one so you get a lot more tax from them.In addition to that a merchant republic can build trade posts in the coastal provinces which will increase the income of the cities there. If there is no merchant republic nearby you could consider making a vassal merchant republic yourself out of a coastal duchy.

If you play your cards right you could get a large chunk of Africa and Spain before you border Eygypt and the Abbasids which means you could maybe do another invasion for Arabia and form the celiphate. Its hard because youll start to lose moral authority a few years after your outburst of holy wars which means lots of revolts for extended periods of time unless you can get the men to invade the Abassids and gain some holy sites.

3003877,0,t3_2ul2u6,Credit to Migshark for the technique.So I figured out the way to make this work. First you need to be an Emperor. Second you need to have a kingdom you can give away. Third you need a vassalized holy order. They longer theyve been around the better.Now give your kingdom to the holy order. The kingdom is the higherlevel title than the holy order so all the money from the king will go where the kingdom goes which should be to the kings father brother or son if he had any before taking the vows. Find this heir and imprison him then kill the king.The holy order should be inherited by some random courtier who took the vows. We dont care about him. The kingdom and money which we do care about will go to your prisoner. Revoke all his titles. I was impatient so I incurred some tyranny doing this but if you want you can excommunicate him and then spam arrests and releases until he rebels and you get tyrannyfree revocation.Once hes landless figure out whose court he belongs to. Butter up his liege then propose a matrilineal marriage one of your kin in your court. Now his liege is you. Move your marshal in for that awesome arrest bonus then imprison him and banish him. Boom more money than youll probably know what to do with.I decided to give a chunk of it to my pet Serene Doge so he could expand his trade posts. The rest I used to build temples in every spare holding. After two years this happened.  new baronylevel holdings almost all of them bishoprics. Clicking the Wrong Holding prompt will cycle you through them all which I used to ensure that they were all building church walls so they could next upgrade to Monastic Schools later for those sweet sweet cultural tech points. Then you just find all characters of your culture and religion who are landless content and male and start handing out the titles. This way they turn into your direct vassals and all their taxes go to you.,CrusaderKings,co9cluu,25,t5_2tgic
3006433,0,t3_2um0h3,I dont understand. If you wanted to change your own inheritance laws you could have changed them on the law screen.

You can lose your capital your pretenders are given titles that didnt exist before and can go independent even if they are de jure part of your kingdomempire.Best way to deal with it is to only have one heir but not always easypossible.

These traits can be inherited and gives flat bonuses. You shouldnt rely too heavily upon gaining these traits if youre not using some kind of elective succession since most congenital traits only have a  chance of inheritance . if both parents have given traitAvoid bad congenital traits like hunchback since these can hurt your entire line like good ones can benefit your entire line.Choosing a guardianAs stated in the education wiki a good guardian has balanced stats Not just an insanely high score in a single stat. This will ensure the maximum number of statgains per year. A good AI guardian has diligent kind and temperate while a bad one has zealous and proud.Coming of ageWhen your heir has come of age. Dont lock him up in a tower. If he wants to be marshal appoint him. He will gain an extra stat point the first time he completes that ambition. Let him lead armies so he has a chance of picking up traits. If he dies its not the end of the world. Im sure his brother will do fine.Final thoughtsIf you want to go through the game with  in all stats on every ruler you can do that with loads of genetic engineering and childkilling. But it really isnt necessary. You can do fine with a character with  in all stats. Yes having a good ruler is awesome and its hard not to become a perfectionist about it.Try playing a bit of ironman.

3727407,0,t3_3335d7,Karen is generally considered to be the purest of the Zoroastrian games as you begin as a Persian Zoroastrian dynasty and have the nastiest fight for survival especially if you refuse to convert to avoid the nasty holy wars.  If you want to go this route there are several strategies to be found.  Secondly there are a couple of count level Turkish Zoroastrians just to the north of the Karen start.  They have a slightly easier start with a buffer against the Muslim blobs and theyre outside of the du jure Persian realm reducing interest in their activities for a time.  Otherwise you concentrate north into the steps to build up a base of power before turning south to begin reclaiming Persia.  Similar to the Karen start.  Then there is the Saffarid conversion strategy.  Effective if youre merely looking to tick the achievement off from your list and entertaining in their own way.  You start from a position of some strength weaken yourself for a time after converting and increase the likelihood of the Abbasid blog attacking.  The last option is the least frustrating in the long run.  About a year ago I made a serious attempt with the Karen start.  That resulted in quite literally dozens of restarts before I found a game where things went well long enough that I could start to snowball.  The challenges with Karen can be incredibly annoying.  Ive had superior armies with superior generals positioned in mountains lose battles due to the Islamic morale bonus for low decadence.  Once your combined army loses that first battle the route is on and the game is essentially over with some specific exceptions.  If youre really interested in a Zoroastrian game I would suggest that you search for more detailed accounts of the Karen and Saffarid strategies.  The Turkish strategy as previously alluded is really just an extension of the Karen strategy of conquering north to gain strength before crashing south.    I will say that I found Karen to be simultaneously the most frustrating and the most rewarding effort that I ever invested in CK.  A further warning ... regardless of which route you choose beware the mongol hordes and be prepared to concede and fight another day.  Best of luck to you! I hope you enjoy.,CrusaderKings,cqh5e01,3,t5_2tgic

3916849,0,t1_cr2hah9,Oh objection. That is only the case for the Twelvers who were not the dominant Shii group until towards the end of the time period. The Ismailis were the most important during most of CKs time period most notably in the form of the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt and to a lesser extent in the form of the Hashashin. The Ismailis and protoTwelvers split after the reign of the sixth Imam with each supporting a different claimant. While the Twelvers believe that their Twelfth Imam went into hiding the Ismaili story is very different. The Fatimid Caliphs were considered to be the descendants of the Ismaili Seventh Imam with the last ones going into hidingg though in the nowdominant Nizari Ismaili branch of Ismailism there never was any occlusion going into hiding or ending of the line  is the current Imam of the Nizaris.However to my knowledge there never was an incident where a boy was claimed to be Alis descendant and used as the focus of a revolt no. A man called Ubayd Allah alMahdi claimed to be an Imam gained support and revolted against the Aghlabids and Abbasids becoming the first Fatimid Caliph but this is not exactly the same.There are also the Fivers or Zaidis an earlier split the Houthis who you may have heard of are of this sect. Also there are some extinct branches and several Ismaili branches aside from the Nizari the Dawoodi Bohra and Druze are still around of those although the Druze are not always considered to be Muslims. The Nizaris are particularly interesting for leaning far more towards secularism and pluralism than many other branches of Islam a tendency of religions which have historically lacked political power.This handy table explains the splits ,CrusaderKings,cr2r8zm,11,t5_2tgic

As a result theres not much worth targeting. The areas around Seattle San Diego LA and San Fransisco are definitely targets due to military bases and major ports. Portland could be but Portland is far enough away from Major targets that the only place around Jefferson that may be hit is Klamath Falls which is on the far side of the Cascade Mountains and downwind of everything. On top of which its a bit further from the major areas which face chaos meaning less looting.The wind helps too.

4000524,0,t3_36asqz,I want to share some knowledge with fellowplayers. I think with the things Ive researched throughout the game I could do the same conquest but  years faster..A tip how to speed up your conquer. I think of this as little exploit of the game. After holy wars dont create duchies! Give counties to nonruler dynasty members and then Transfer vassal to your most powerful vassals. After you declare war on your enemy you can simply raise all your vassals army at this county! After some time you can reunite these counties when you dont use them as teleportators anymore. See  for example between Persia and Orissa.After certain amount of time when you have a k retinues you can oneshot independent counties. Just move your army to their boarders begin moving on it and  days before arriving declare war. Enemy will raise lowmorale army youll easily defeat it and then siege a capital for  WS..Vassilized Holy Orders provide you their troops for free! They work similar as a retinue so you can declare a war even if orders troops are raised  very useful in holy wars. Keep in mind that they will not enter a battle against an enemy of the same religion..There is no attrition for troops on the boats. So you can gather a k army on the water and then strike an enemy on the shore or quickly assault of barony..Dont hesitate to press Assault button on seized county if you have  times more troops than defenders. Losses will be  on a barony and about  on temple or city. If you have x troops its still ok if youre in a hurry to win a war..Dont be afraid of gaining Truce Breaker if you are not afraid of targets same religion neighbors and if you have enough diplomacy to not go over vassal limit when you get  diplomacy hit. This  diplomacy and  opinion modifiers last for  years but it doesnt stack and it doesnt work on your vassals! After breaking the truce it will just be refreshed to last for the next  years. .When you are in war with the hordes your main goal is to lower the number of their event troops. If you can take a defending position behind a river and wait them to come. Even if you lose a war its ok because after their event troops are being killed during several battles hordes become an easy target for next wars. Aztecs in my game were defeated in one war because they landed in Britain and divided into k stack along the shore. Ive put my troops on the boats and attacked the Aztecs from the water..You can select one war target but siege another counties to get your warscore. For example while I was dealing with Byzantine I pressed claims on duchiescounties all over the empire but sieged Sicily over and over every war with my attacks from sea. I broke the truce after the war ends and go for same baronies which hadnt replenished their defenders so they became oneshot targets. This way I was gaining  WS in  months .Set in game options to show up messages of army arrival battle and siege and pause game on these events. It will really help you not to lose army to some tricky enemy and not to forget about an army youve sent around the world. Also set a message and pause on Vassal Inheritance  event so you can send  gold gift on that day. Next day game will recalculate vassals income and gift would be more expensive..If youre catholic request money from the Pope as much as you can. Dont be afraid to angry him send him money back as a gift. Popes dies in several years after election so you can get this help quite often..Try to be the one who requests the Crusades from the Pope so you can target the most suitable target kingdom. Cooldown of Crusades is  years. You can check when was the last crusade if you remember the target. Go to the target kingdom tab and press History button.. After the death of your character check your wifes stats. If she isnt genius just divorce with her. Use character search to find woman with genius trait. If youre lucky you can get a very good heir this way!.Focus on Diplomacy and Stewardship characteristics. First is must have to increase your Vassal Limit and make vassals happy. Second is important too because it increases your personal demesne which leads to more money and troopsretinue. Martial is ok to have but it shines only in early game when you dont have retinue..If you have troubles every succession dont make your ruler an army leader so he cant die in a battle. In my opinion its not worth having battle modifiers on your character for a chance of death. Exception is gaining the Crusader trait just put your character on large army and defeat someone or siege a castle during the Crusade..Dont spend all your money keep it for the succession. When your king dies you probably will use this money for sending gifts to angry vassals. If you have extra money first spend it on retinue.  Large retinue counts towards  of liege strength on factions screen so vassals would not rebel..Always educate your children yourself. You can pick Diplomacy  Stewardship traits for your heir. But you may send them on their  age to another character who has nice educational trait Grey Eminence  Midas Touched..Have an AgnaticCognatic Elective Monarchy in your empire. It give you a nice choice of heirs but in order to support your pretender your vassals must have positive opinion of you use your money to send gifts give honorable title and make them educate your closerelative children. In extreme situations where money doesnt help kill the most popular pretender via excommunication  plot..If you cant create some kingdoms in my game they were Saxony and Magyars and if you dont want to keep dukes as vassals claim revoke and destroy their titles and transfer counts to neighbor kings..Learn how claims work and how to press them. It will help you while conquering same religion territories. Strong claims can be pressed any time. Weak claims can be pressed only if the TARGET duchycounty have womanchild on the throne not their liege! Even if enemy king is a male you can press someones claims on a duchy which is ruled by a womanchild. Dont forget to grant a land title for the person whose claims youre pressing. If he has even a baronylevel title in your empire he can bring kingdom under your wing if he has claims on it..Try to make the Pope your vassal antipope can work too I didnt tested. Excommunication can help when you dont want someone to be elected as your successor. It also increases chances that someone will join a plot against excommunicated person. The most important feature of vassal Pope  for  piety you can get a strong claim on every duchycounty under catholic ruler. When you have a claim on your vassals title you can revoke it without other vassals opinion hit. It works on other states as well but you must go to war with them. You can request as many claims as you can and press them all at once. I have once defeated a rebel kingdom which become independent  just got claims on all of its duchies declared war and the kingdom is mine again!.After some time you will start suffering from the Vassal Limit. You can change Centralization Law to increase the limit but dont lower centralization too much  you need money from your demesne. Your best choice is to adopt Viceroyalty Kingdoms and grant vassals viceroyalties. This title will return to you on vassals death and his retinues too!. The most suitable target to make a viceroy king years old man with Content trait. This way he will always be with positive opinion of you and even if your character dies this vassal will not live long too so he will not bother your heir too long. If you have a large retinue you should not be afraid to give multiple viceroyalty kingdoms to one person to decrease your vassal limit..If you have high relations with your vassals use their troops up to  opinion modifier. On your characters or theirs death this modifier goes away so there is no need to be polite with them. Another option to use these high opinions is revoking kingdom title not a viceroyalties for  opinion for  years. These kingdoms vassals can receive by pressing claims or if they created it by themselves. So try to create a kingdom a grant it as viceroyalty every time you see that vassal has  of its de jure territory..Holding more than one empire title is quite risky with no real advantage. You wont worry about gaining extra prestige while you have it more than . So in my game Ive destroyed every empire title I have usurped from enemies. Try to usurp title from your foes it will divide their realm into several independent states for an easy upcoming conquer. If the usurped title doesnt match you succession laws and you cant change them you can destroy this title if it doesnt have gavelkind or just give away as viceroyalty in order not to have problems after the succession.,CrusaderKings,crcahvd,24,t5_2tgic

4124691,0,t3_37ws2h,Regarding your question of whether to use your claim on Mann or Holy WarClaiming Mann would just give you the county title. The baronies in Mann will remain in the hands of the presumably NorseNorse characters currently holding them until you revoke them.Using Holy War and succeeding would give you control of every holding King Helgi of Mann controls in the duchy of Suoreyar including the baronies. This is a much more powerful casus belli but nearby Norse rulers will have the ability to join the war against you notably Jorvik. If you are powerful enough to defeat the King of Mann King of Jorvik and Manns allies then the Holy War is almost certainly your best option. Either way if the county of Mann has been converted to the unreformed Norse religion your besieging forces will take massive attrition while in the county if their numbers are above your supply limit there both the religion and supply limit are listed in the county screen. If your forces remain below your supply limit you wont take any attrition.,CrusaderKings,crqfucb,6,t5_2tgic

If you start as Sigurd in the Charlemagne start its pretty easy to reform the Germanic religion and with the raiding youll have an easy enough time to build up your tribal holdings.  Alternatively you could do it with the Romuva pagans in Lithuania another relatively easytoreform religion though theyre defensive pagans and as a result get fewer CBs.

That said if you do intend to make such an event event modding is super easy btw. be sure to check for all cases. By your description above every time this event fires all heirs and children with living parents who arent betrothed are goners.Also Id like to point something out. It isnt really that there are a bunch of courtiers alive but more so that they have existed at all. The creation of lag is simply because the save files record the previous existence of these characters and has to read through every single line of the file to get to where you are. So while an event killing them wouldnt actually help one erasing their existence might.But that isnt exactly possible with basic event modding. You might as well bleed your eyes and dig around the save files in that case.Fortunately this new expansion and presumably the patch that comes out at the same time is said to do a bunch to reduce lag which is nice. If it will actually happen. Some people are skeptical.,CrusaderKings,crunpo2,3,t5_2tgic

4163613,0,t1_crustna,Aye I remember what they said about the blindingcastration. There was also another piece of data they gave that I dont recall exactly at the moment about how many seconds it took for an ingame year to pass by.However even all that said I still have to be skeptical for now. The devs also made similar claims with RoI and presented evidence back then though its been a while so I dont remember exactly what but the results turned out... mixed at best. Theres no way the devs can test on every single machine that meets the games original system requirements for instance. Additionally the game might run insanely fast at first but then slow down to a halt a couple hundred years down the line for example which happened with RoI from my experience and a lot of other people and I honestly dont know if the devs can do enough of those longterm tests on enough variety of machines.I dont mean to say that the optimizations wont work. They probably will but to what extent generally speaking I dont know and I would prefer to wait until we actually get the new patch so I can see for myself how well the optimizations work. And even then that will not necessarily convince me that adding hundreds of provinces in China Japan and so on would be fine  for all we know that might just as I said earlier cause performance to drop to where it is now or worse.,CrusaderKings,cruv0ke,4,t5_2tgic

Such mismatches in a checksum could be due to corruption of the file or even computer viruses.gtIn the case of EU Paradox uses checksums to let players know their games have been installed correctly and also as a way to ensure players are using compatible versions when playing in multiplayer games.But your checksum agrees with mine.

These tactics then modify the amount of damage each flank deals and how many troops they lose from damage taken.By being careful with your troop composition easier for retinues harder for levies and leader assignments you can have significant control over the outcome of battles. By being more careful about the terrain when choosing to engage you can have even more control. Finally you can gain even more control by convincing your enemies to make bad choices in these regards. For example baiting the AI into attacking across rivers or into mountains can give you an advantage over larger armies.,CrusaderKings,cstvprm,4,t5_2tgic

Someone reading the bible back then would most likely see discrepancies between it and actual church law.gtIf the EOC can take over Rome and make Catholicism a heresy then the Catholics should be able to do the same to themOrthodox Christianity is the far more traditional form of Christianity and if one of them  is going to reform the church then its going to be Orthodox.gtThis is more Paradox than CK but in EU alot of Catholic teachings are presented with a Protestant biase for example holding to Churh teachings increases the heresy chance They still did a pretty good job thoughThats because Catholic teachings at the time were insanely abusive of the lower illiterate classes the pope had blown his credibility and the church had turned into a way to attain power and money.

4739797,0,t3_3fqztv,I did that this weekend actually.  Im the emperor of a very large Scandinavia and I had plans of taking over the Byzantines  my neighbor  after finding out someone in my realm had a claim. So I landed him and gave him a wife and then realized that since its an empirelevel title he wouldnt be my vassal doh.  But the thought of a reformed germanic pagan emperor of the Byzantine empire made me laugh and the guaranteed civil wars would certainly help my absorb he empire.  So I pressed it and won pretty easily.  He became the first Germanic Pagan emperor of Byzantium and everyone hated him!  He revoked some temple titles and everyone hated him more.  He inherited duchy after duchy and everyone hated him more for having too many duchies.  The revolts finally came and he...managed to put them down.  Three of them.  Then a jihad came for Anatolia. I was sure he would be doomed.  But despite being severely outnumbered he managed to get it up to  warscore.  After that I was sure hed have it wrapped up and stopped paying attention.  Later I got the message that he lost the war.  But the empire still remains.  I think its been about  years and two or three rulers so far.  ,CrusaderKings,ctrzuxm,2,t5_2tgic

The nobility wasnt supposed to busy itself with things like trade and commerce as that was a burghers pursuit and instead a vassals obligation to his lord was in troops not in taxes barons for example were allowed to call themselves barons only when they could provide their lords with ten knights whenever the need for battle should arise.Aside from that fund a proper and efficient army sounds easier than it does. Part of the reason kings even had vassals was because it takes forever to outfit and train an army and so you delegate a lot of that process to your cronies. If youd ask them to slip you money rather than soldiers youd be left having to spend a lot more money for a lot less soldiers what with medieval administration being nearly nonexistent in these matters.Also just as a final note fighting each other happened a lot less than fighting the liege lord did.

5064304,0,t1_cuvvka1,If I can get the portraits working Ill definitely add as many puns to the game as humanly possible.  Ill also modify events appropriately e.g. when you assassinate a child it will say the world is too cruel for kittens instead of children.  Cat flavor is essential.  This will also make the mod incompatible with everything else but fuck it I want puns.I need to start dissecting some other mods to see how theyre built before I can pick a direction to approach the mod from.  I think the easiest thing would be to copy what the GoT mod has for dragon portraits where its just a random image with no DNA traits or anything and just get a big selection of cat pics for the game to pick from.  The more difficult route would be to actually separate out all the different DNA features  Id have to make a set of cat eyes cat necks etc. so they could be mixed and matched to create an infinite variety of cats.  If I did it this way I could make gluttonous cats look fat and I could make blind cats wear sunglasses.  Youd also be able to have hereditary appearance DNA passed down.  Im not much of an artist so figuring out how to create the images myself might take a while.  Im going to try to see if I can get pictures of cats that somebody else has already drawn and pull apart the different pieces so the game can use them for cat DNA.,CrusaderKings,cuwfve3,2,t5_2tgic

You can immediately marry off your older children for alliancesinheritancesclaims instead of leaving them idle in your court so they dont fuck up everything like in primo. You get much better long reign bonuses. If your youngest child sucks you have basically  chance for an arrestexecute unlike your adult children. You can keep trying to make the perfect heir until you die if thats your thing. Its advantage over elective and I guess this applies for other inheritances like primo is also that electors almost never vote for children so youd be in a safer position for inheritance if your younger children are the ones with better stats or you only started having children later in life.,CrusaderKings,cv45i6e,2,t5_2tgic

The best way and the more fun way imo is to destroy it from the inside. Gain more and more land while still maintaining relations with the Basileus and his more powerful vassals. Make marriages for alliances and inheritances. If theres a powerful faction to install a bad claimant or lower crown authority join it but only if you joining it would make it likely to fire.

My point is if I never attacked their army and let him keep it raised doesnt he lose money gradually? I can just sit on his land with raiding on and let him slowly dwindle his gold away until he goes bankrupt. This of course  will make his vassals hate him leading to rebellion.

Giving land to the pope is a decent way to increase piety and his opinion of you so you can ask for money bonus points if the land you give him is next to pagans so you can reconquer it after the pope loses it. The problem is probably that much of west and central france consists of independent counts with no duke titles created for those regions there is no straightforward way around it if you are also trying to create the empire title which creating duke titles will just delay. You can always create some double duke super vassals by giving them all the individual counts of a neighboring duchy and hoping they create the title and that it gets split from gavelkind I think only elective gavelkind creates titles but I hesitate to recommend that as volatile revolts may be a problem once the bonus opinion from vassal transferring wears off.,CrusaderKings,cvpt1sw,1,t5_2tgic

Hmmm...Well lets see you have a lot of fiefs the kingdom of Ireland Eire and the kingdom of England Sasana is only the name irish folks call it.You can destroy the title of EnglandSasana retaining any fief or vassal you had under that title. Note that every de iure english vassal will hate you as you arent their rightful overlord.Alternatively you can hold on the english title and try to get your heir elected which is kind of trickier. I would suggest relocating to England giving away your irish fiefs to a vassal and picking a nice english duchy as your personal demesne. This way you hold an elector title. Also give a duchy to your son so hes also an elector. Hopefully hell use common sense and vote for himself. Next thing to do is to give the spare duchies to vassals. Im not sure about this but if you have no dukes in your realm you will effectively have rigged elections where the only dukes you and your son will vote. This will severely hurt your vassal limit tho. So look at this and if you can hold on some duchies do so. Just be careful because you will have a double negative opinion modifier because you have too many duchies AND hold too many elector titles.Hope this helps!,CrusaderKings,cxfshk8,2,t5_2tgic

The problem with this strategy is that there are exactly zero Jewish women in the Charlemagne start so you cant actually convert via concubine decision. Youd have to somehow get your hands on a Jewish man give him land and hope he reproduces andor converts your heir. Honestly youre better off starting as the Khazars in . Nomad is the best buffer to protect yourself against your aggressive nonkosher neighbors. Easyish Option be tribal pagan abduct Khazar women and abscond before the massive nomadic cavalry annihilates your forces. Then ply pagan nomads with money and missionaries in the hope that if they join your faith they will have less reason to attack you. Nomads and religion are tricky however and prone to changing on a whim as a new guy comes to power. Turtle Mode Create Jewish character in ruler designer and put him in charge of a remote patch of land unlikely to be warred over I recommend Crete. Not exactly the same thing as playing a historical Jewish ruler but still. It will be a slow start comparable to Socotra and somewhat boring but safe until you start to expand. Hard Mode Jewish Semien in Ethiopia any starting date where Semien is Jewish. Always keep a spare save file on hand to reroll because life is not fair and everybody will hate you. Its painful but rewarding I made it out of Abyssinia and into Arabia in my run.In all cases you can more or less forget about holy wars as a Jew if you are the only Jewish realm. Fabricate claims and attack isolated heretics only. Hoard your money and let it accumulate over generations someday it may buy you just enough mercs to defend againat a massive Muslim doomstack and if you beat them hard enough theyll pay it back in reparations.

6043113,0,t3_3ya6c9,gtgtDyeusgtDyus also Dyus phter alternatively spelled dyws is believed to have been chief deity in the religious traditions of the prehistoric ProtoIndoEuropean societies. Part of a larger pantheon he was the god of the daylight sky and his position may have mirrored the position of the patriarch or monarch in society. In his aspect as a father god his consort would have been Pltwih Mhter Earth Mother.gtThis deity is not directly attested rather scholars have reconstructed this deity from the languages and cultures of later IndoEuropean peoples such as Greeks Latins and IndoAryans. According to this scholarly reconstruction Dyeus was addressed as Dyeu Phter literally Sky father or shining father as reflected in Latin Ipiter Dispiter possibly Dis Pater and deus pater Greek Zeu pater Sanskrit Dyupta. As the pantheons of the individual mythologies related to the ProtoIndoEuropean religion evolved attributes of Dyeus seem to have been redistributed to other deities. In Greek and Roman mythology Dyeus remained the chief god but in Vedic mythology the etymological continuant of Dyeus became a very abstract god and his original attributes and his dominance over other gods seem to have been transferred to gods such as Agni or Indra.gtgtLater figures etymologically connected with Dyeus figures who derive the named from Dyeus Latin Deus originally used to address Jupiter but later adopted as the name of the Christian god Rooted in the related but distinct IndoEuropean word deiwos is the Latin word for deity deus. The Latin word is also continued in English divine deity and the original Germanic word remains visible in Tuesday Day of Twaz and Old Norse tvar which may be continued in the toponym Tiveden Wood of the Gods or of Tr. In Greek mythology Zeus In Roman mythology Jupiter pronounced Iuppiter and Dis Pater Roman god Jupiter is a form of Dyeus. In Historical Vedic religion Dyau Pitr Dionysus especially with the Thracians and Sabines Norse god TrThe following names derive from the related deiwos Germanic Twaz known as Tr in Old Norse IndoAryan deva VedicPuranic deva Buddhist deva Iranic daeva daiva diw etc. Baltic Dievas Celtic e.g. Gaulish Duos Slavic divese miracle Estonian Tharapita bears similarity to Dyaus Pita in name although it has been interpreted as being related to the god Thor.gtAlthough some of the more iconic reflexes of Dyeus are storm deities such as Zeus and Jupiter this is thought to be a late development exclusive to Mediterranean traditions probably derived from syncretism with Canaanite deities and Perkwunos. The deitys original domain was over the daylit sky and indeed reflexes emphasis this connection to light Istanu Tiyaz is a solar deity Helios is often referred to as the eye of Zeus gtIn Romanian paganism the Sun is similarly called Gods eye and in IndoIranian tradition SuryaHvarekhshaeta is similarly associated with Ahura Mazda.

Keep an eye on the messages for any bad stuff going down for your neighbors you can exploit and keep an eye on the opinions of your neighbors vassals to their liege or if youre playing a vassal keep an eye on other vassals opinions. Try and get the vassals to hate them so theyre less likely to increase crown laws disrupt factions and have a harder time during succession. Even if they manage to keep things together after a succession crisis which you can always try and instigate theyre likely to be considerably weaker.Get their vassals on your side before you attack and not only will they contribute less troops to their liege theyll also be a lot more content after you conquer them.Edit  also I usually enjoy starting as a wimpy vassal. So for example I started as a Shia vassal of the Abbasids in my current game so most of the early going was making sure that whoever succeeded to the Caliphate was not a Sunni zealot and trying to expand and create the Kingdom of Arabia before anyone else did. Now Im trying to continue to conquer all the other de jure provinces in Arabia outside of Abbasid control and when the current Caliph dies Im gonna push a faction to lower crown authority so I can take over Najd without going independent.

6308471,0,t3_41ziwx,. No. Province culture conversion only happens in the provinces that a ruler that is a count duke king etc. personally owns.. No. Since theyre under an ruler who has different culture their provinces wont change culture. They wont turn Andalusian. They wont turn Occitan. Theyll just stay as they are.. No. Not unless you specifically request to educate their children which AI lieges often do. If you dont theyll choose their own Occitan courtiers to educate their children therefore remaining Occitan. Ive never seen the AI choose the decision to convert to liege culture.Extra the only exception to these is melting pot events.

In a game I played as Scotland the HRE was formed under agnaticcognatic primogeniture without the decision. I eventually inherited from my mother. A random Scottish person ruling a bunch of Germans was interesting. In the game world I imagined it as a nominal position at least until he pressed his claim on Byzantium and united half of Europe under his rule....Point is though upon conversion to EU the game assumes the normal elective laws when it should be hereditary. So of course I would lose Emperorship and never be elected again. It makes sense given how EU works but its a bit disappointing.

6453515,0,t3_440wxv,Copying and pasting my post from the forum thread here Coalitions belong in EU not in CK. Plain and simple. I said it on Reddit and Ill say it here  the idea of a coalition is one that only makes sense in the timeframe of EU.CK is about ruling as the leader of a dynasty and governing your realm and managing your vassals. It is a game of titles the people who hold them and the land bound to them and the management of these.EU is about advancing the interests of a nationstate. There is no tier of titles that link up into higher titles or split off into lower ones. There is merely land up for grabs between regional powers in the struggle for dominance.A coalition is a group of nationstates that feels that their mutual national interests are at risk of being subjugated by an upstart power. It involves state bureaucracies and institutions and nationalism and lots of little intricate forces and entities that work in tandem to propel a nationstate forward. This is the Napoleonic Wars this is the Thirty Years War this is the Italian Wars all of which happen in EUs timeframe. The philosophy behind this style of governance and diplomacy came from people like Machiavelli and other writers in the renaissance initially applied to the Italian citystates eventually applied to powers like France and Austria and Spain and England with great success.However this philosophy is NOT within the timeframe of CK. CK focuses on the feudal contract vassalage and lordship families vying for power against rival families calling in their family members and whatnot to assist them. Its more akin to mafiosos while EU is more like corporate interactions.To put it simply in the CK timeframe a feudal ruler wouldnt give a rats patootie if some other realm hundreds of miles away was getting big after all the ruling families of the two realms werent interacting there was no marriage or possibility of inheritance there may be some sort of trade between merchants but the bourgeoisie werent influential enough in this time period to have monarchs care about what they thought. Realms did not have the necessary bureaucratic infrastructure or diplomatic mechanisms to even consider forming a coalition. There was no benefit to their House they were not being called to the defense of a family member or a trusted ally therefore who cared? Its just simply not the same mindset as there was in the renaissance. Furthermore if someone was pressing their claim to a title that was their right to do so after all its about family they share the same ancestor as the holder of the title theres no problem with it.The notable exceptions to this were times such as the Mongols where there actually WERE groups of realms which worked together to combat them when they were pushing into places such as Hungary and Poland but a this was an EXCEEDINGLY RARE OCCASION. As in the Mongols were considered an existential threat to entire kingdoms in Europe and as far as the Christians knew meant their downfall to a horrific Pagan foe. And b they were STILL nowhere near the size of coalitions in their current state. The coalition was if I recall correctly three maybe four realms in size? It was Hungary Poland and I wanna say the Pope and the Holy Roman Empire as well though my memory is fuzzy.This is why its immersionbreaking and frankly not suitable to this time period. It makes perfect sense in EU but not in CK.Not to mention all the silliness about rulers of your religion joining in the defense of a heathen in a Holy War...,CrusaderKings,czmu2yj,20,t5_2tgic

6464281,0,t1_cznwpg9,Cite an example in medieval times where a defeated army was again beaten days or weeks later by the previously victorious army after being pursued across the country side. You wont find one. You are missing the point. Yes most casualties take place during the collapse and retreat. Yes the victorious army does its best to kill as many as possible. Despite that effort a large part of the defeated army remains alive to regroup somewhere else. Lets take a historical example the Battle of Agincourt supposedly a tremendous English victory. Remember this is the worst it gets not some average battle. English forces  French forces    French casualties Even if we take the worst case for the French  men and  casualties  men went somewhere after the battle. Its more likely the number was really more like  French and  casualties leave some  men. They just didnt disappear into thin air. The regrouped somewhere else and continued the campaign without the English standing on top of them.Going through the list of Medieval battles Ill pick some randomly I will try to stick to ones you might have heard of that have both force levels and casualties. Where there is a range I will average Battle of the Golden Spurs  French losers  casualties. Battle of Dorylaeum  st Crusade  Muslim losers  Muslim casualties.  Battle of Stamford Bridge  Vikings  casualties.  ships from the fleet of over  were needed to carry the survivors away. Battle of Arsuf  rd Crusade  Muslim cavalry  dead note says numbers should be treated w caution and casualties are like to be far fewer.  First Battle of St Albans War of the Roses Lancaster  men  losses. nd Battle of St Albans  Yorkists  losses.As you can see battles dont destroy the loser I can give you examples like Legncia. Sizable forces exist after the battle and have to go somewhere. In few of those cases did the war end because of the battle Capturing Henry VI at st St. Albans didnt even do that. Destroying an army utterly is not the norm. We hear about because it is such an unusual event when it happens it is a game changer. By the time we get to the American Revolution where we have good documented numbers it is very clear that at  casualties even the most hardened armies break and run. They take another few percentage of losses in the rout but the majority of the army lives to fight another day and does so they are not pursued day after day like wild animals. The victorious army is just as tired as the losers to worried that if they dont consolidate they will lose the advantage they gained by the victory and to worried about being led into a counter attack by a force they dont know is out there to hunt down the survivors for very long. Beaten armies move off and reform.The moving several provinces is representative of all those who survive who will reform and potentially attack again.,CrusaderKings,czny96h,3,t5_2tgic

6472790,0,t3_44ajiq,I agree entirely. Given that alliances are now a bit harder to get I think that it was appropriate to make alliances matter more but making it automatic is a bit too heavy handed.I would have been happier if declining a calltoarms instead immediately revoked the alliance gave a massive opinion penalty to the other party gave a large prestige penalty and probably a worldwide opinion malus of Oathbreaker.An exception would be that if you are allied to two people who go to war with each other. In this case you would have to choose who to help and in that case you dont get the worldwide penalty or prestige hit. Alternatively you can opt to stand out of both wars in which case they both dislike you a little but thats it.However Id make some kind of other condition on it to reflect some of the scenarios youve given  maybe each time you accept a calltoarms it gives a stacking reduction to the penalties for declining and the penalty is also much less based on distancebeing in your own war especially a defensive war. e.g. if you accept a calltoarms it gives you a year hidden flag which reduces the costs. So if King Karlo of West Francia accept  callstoarms in a few years from King Karl of East Francia if he declines the fourth it affects him e.g.  less than if was the first one he received and far less still if he was defending himself against the Umayyads at the time of the request.Or something like that.,CrusaderKings,czotyoc,16,t5_2tgic

6498228,0,t3_44m9qt,I debated starting my own thread or asking in this one but since this is here first I figure Ill throw this out here for anyone who knows more about retinue comps than the average user.So as we know the Mongols have their balls back. They declare war after war almost nonstop. In my game they are currently subjugating the Byzantines. And winning. Coalition smoalition.I asked them if they were interested in a NAP and the tooltip said No Im busy conquering the world...and youre next.While I doubt Im next being that I control Persia Im certainly in the way so I wanted to ask about my retinues which are of course my first line of defense. Right now Im running pure defense retinues. But frankly thats boring and Ive got more money than I have sense. Id like to use my elephants. Im India for crying out lout. The most recent suggested retinue comps for elephants were  Steel Bow  Defense  Shock  Light Skirmish from this thread and  Steelbow  Shock  Defense from this threadI have no idea how to do the math for these things. I just push buttons you know? Will these comps make usable War Elephant retinues? Is one superior to the other? Am I dumb for wanting to use my cultural retinue and take advantage of my cultural buildings instead of just using pure Defense?Can these stand against the Mongol hordes? Or are the Pikes my best Defense? Thanks.,CrusaderKings,czrgrhm,7,t5_2tgic

6548850,0,t3_45b39v,Im speaking from my knowledge of  preconclave code You can put special titles but they seem to be linked to the actual titles rather than government type. For instance Basileus of the Byzantine Empire is specifically mentioned in the ebyzantium code IIRC. IDK if they changed that entirely with conclave though. You had to modify the localisation files.    title         key Gives localisation key for holders title if nonstandard e.g. Captain title  TITLEKEY    titlefemale key Gives localisation key for holders title if nonstandard e.g. Captain titlefemale  QUEEN gtFor cultures religions or titles will go with the name of the added title. For example if you added the title eaaa to landedtitles with culture fictoid in cultures and religion nonsensism in religions you would need to create a row for each of them.gtIt is possible to localize the name of the title apart for culture a Greek King is called Despot for example for character type too so to replace the Doge title for the ruler of Republic with for example Prince we could use the key cityduke so as you can change the name of the title itself to Principality using cityduchyof you could mix this with culture citydukeroman and cityduchyofroman for example and for religion citydukecatholic and cityduchyofcatholic. The equivalents templeduke and templeduchyof also exists.gtIf a title need a particular title that is not tied to culture or religion but to the title itself then you can add the line title  ltlocalizationkeygt in the title definition in commonlandedtitleslandedtitles.txt where the title is defined. For example if the ruler of eaaa instead of the default title of Emperor held historically the title of Supreme King you should add the line title  supremekingdesc and then add a corresponding line in the localization file. ,CrusaderKings,czwpdqg,3,t5_2tgic

But its no accident that he is rarely and only shortly mentioned in the annals of the Ua Chennselaig family. From what can be gathered of the few remaining sources it has been concluded that Fergal was a terrible king likely even insane. His reign has been said to be marked with a bloody civil war that lasted for almost his whole reign around  years. The causes and details of the war are unknonwn. During this conflict he was forced to abdicate twice to kings whose names are long forgotten however thanks to the law of seniority succession he regained the throne both times and held it until he died at the respectable age of  years. He was already over  years of age when he ascended to the throne for the first time hence his nickname.While his reign was a really bad one he did some good too. He had at least twelve children with multiple wives which pretty much saved the dynasty from extincion.

My main forces were too far away and none of the great powers of Christendom joined with me.

6842689,0,t1_d0rwh6i,Best example I can personally vouch for is their punic war series although Ive heard examples from people with focuses in other things theyve covered. They attribute the the starting of the Punic war to the Mamertines request for assistance from Rome in dealing with the Carthaginians but any historian of Roman history worth their salt knows this is complete nonsense. There are several reasons for why this war took place the most prominent being the political motivations of certain Roman families seeking to expand their holdings into Sicily long running concern over the growing strength of the Carthaginians within the Mediterranean and access to the Sicillian grain that was produced. Saying the Mamertines caused the Punic wars is like saying George Bush invaded Iraq because of WMDs it might be the narrative that was presented but anyone who actually looks at the evidence can see its not true.gtHowever as Im sure youre aware especially when talking about the  AD period its pretty damn hard to say this is exactly what happened you either present it this way or what you say is wrong.See that doesnt hold water because theyre the ones that make singular claims about complicated events not me. Im not claiming to know exactly what happened Im stating that a multitude of factors were involved and arguably are far more significant than the one factor they state is the sole reason the event occurred.gtTake their part II of their series on Justinian as example  they state why they chose to portray Theodora the way they did and not the way Procopius portrayed her in his works instead of completely ignoring his account like you claim they normally do. Now in your book I guess thatd count as misinformation Of course thats not misinformation because theyre specifically stating the potential failings of their position but just because in one prominent example they make this point doesnt mean they do the same thing for all their works.gtbut can you really say if Procopius or any other source is right or wrong?See that shows you have no idea what youre on about no one source can ever be considered right or wrong it requires a multitude of sources to corroborate any theory of what actually occurred. Along with that is the utilization of archaeological evidence to back up claims where applicable as it often is. gtbut with your constant ad hominem and ignoring any of my questionsI called you stupid once and that was the only time Ive insulted you calm down. The questions I ignored earlier were irrelevant.gtLike I said I dont know what bone you have to pick with EH and I have nothing to do with them but I dont get all the hate they get in this subredditIve already explicitly stated why they get hate because their research and presentation of the facts is poor at best and disastrous at worst. Gross oversimplification to the point of misleading people is not how you go about educating people. Hell I dont even have to touch some of their shitty behaviour outside of the channel to explain why people dont like them add some of that in and youve got a pretty good understanding of why they get so much hate.,CrusaderKings,d0rxa3v,1,t5_2tgic

6852237,0,t1_d0swrme,fuck yes. Money income dollar yay.  Actually just mayors of republics work out better at first give unlanded person city then county but once your republic has a huge network of ports the patrician works out better.  If you go the mayor route then give them small chunks of duchies but never enough land to actually create a duchy otherwise theyll naturally turn into a patrician note they still can gain gt of a duchy via inheritance and war so keep an eye on them.  The benefit of a duchy merchant republic is that it can be very profitable with just one county though.  Theocratic vassals give unlanded person temple then county are also good for money and dont have the issue that they turn into patrician  tax if they get a duchy title.  As these vassal types are ez money the game limits the size of them to  of your realm.   If you ever play as a Merchant Republic via DLC you must learn the art of trade zones though there are a ton of finnicky rules about trade income number of posts allowed and how profitable each one is.  The only downside Ive seen to having a Merchant Republic aside from the shit levies is that patricians often seem to take the seduction focus and help spread lovers pox around your realm and cuckold husbands which is annoying but not a massive deal.,CrusaderKings,d0t0cdv,3,t5_2tgic

7031724,0,t1_d1d2a8e,Fair warning Im not a clinical psychologist.  Its also been some time since Ive done this particular bit of reading so I may get a few of the details wrong.  If its important to you then you should try to look it up to double check.That said I have done reading on depression among other topics in the field out of personal interest.  One of the things that psychologists studying mental illness or just psychology in general sometimes have learned they can test in an objective way is how accurately peoples internal models of reality are.  If you ask a depressed person how likely some successful outcome is they tend to underestimate the odds of success compared to a normal person.  You might expect a normal mentally healthy person to be more able to predict whether theyre more likely to win or lose something where all the variables and unknowns are made available like a simple game where all the rules are explained than a depressed person.  It turns out that the average mentally well person is biased toward overestimating their chances of success compared to a the average clinically depressed person.  Depression causing people to tend to believe things are hopeless thus lowering their expectations of success by however many points on the margin from the healthy person helps adjust for peoples inherent bias toward belief in their own success giving them not a perfectly accurate model of reality and future outcomes but a better model than the healthy persons.This does not mean that the depressed persons is better.  Quite the opposite.  One of the big problems with depression is that believing that things are generally hopeless is one of the big reasons why depression is so maladaptive.  You lose all the times you dont try to paraphrase a number of proverbs.Theres a strong suspicion in evolutionary psychology that peoples bias toward our own success isnt an imperfection in the brain to go with our many other cognitive defects its there because it actually needs to be there to get us to go out and do the many difficult things that we need to try to do in order to eventually succeed from time to time.  Hunting mammoths or finding a job or finding a mate or whatever else.  Many times its OK to fail a number of times because failure isnt fatal and you only need to succeed eventually.So there you are surprising but true.  People in the throes of depression have more accurate models of reality and future events than those who arent and thats actually a problem.,CrusaderKings,d1defjc,0,t5_2tgic

7062224,0,t1_d1gsfg1,gt If youre trying to argue that Roman culture existed exclusively within the city of Rome No. Im trying to argue that it was more influential in Rome the Italian Peninsula and maybe in Iberia and todays France being that those areas were conquered very early and didnt have mostly strong civlizations and cultures before the Romans like Carthago Egypt and Greece had for example thats why the Romans were a lot more influential there. Im not questioning the Byzantine legitimacy to the title which seems to be outraging most people Im saying they werent Romans or if they were they should be considered as Romans as people in Iberia France etc. gtThere are stereotypical Texans and Californians etc. It gets even worse as some cities have their own cultural identities like New York Boston Phili etc...This happens here Brazil another american country too but the differences are minimal which I highly doubt it was the case for the Romans being that cities were less inhabited information took a lot longer to travel etc.gtA uniform language yes many languages were spoken but Latin was universal and was spoken and written in all corners of the empire.Again being that people were isolated from one another e.g. somebody in Iberia would take weeks or months to communicate with people in Egypt Latin developed into different types of Latin. The Latin spoken in Lusitania was different from the Latin spoken in Gaul etc.gtEspecially because its a country of immigrants there are tons of different lanuages flying around. Ya English is common but stroll into china town and BAM. Its like youre in a different country any of this sound familiar? Roman provinces parallel.Thats what Im trying to say. Roman provinces were different from one another though I highly doubt Rome had a Gaulish Town.

7188398,0,t3_4dxbjb,Im nearing the end of my first complete playthrough of CK. Ive thus far unlocked the achievements I was aiming for  Trade Empire and Uniting the Kingdoms. Everything is now under my rulership of the DogeinExile of Venice.Of course something happened a few rulers ago... the Demonspawn child. I figured Id have some fun with it since Id already gotten what I wanted to out of this ironman game.It started as usual with him having the demonic nanny that appeared out of nowhere.Who then killed herself.Of course then I died and I think a distant kinsman then took over briefly. I made Dimmae my designated heir when he turned ... but not before taking that selfsacrifice option where he and I became bitter rivals in exchange for his gain of the Ambitious trait.... then I made him my Spymaster. What could possibly go wrong?I mean Im just enjoying life not a care in the world as the Grand Prince of Alba!Oh... right...Well at least Dimmae squeaked by in the election.Oh well... that turned out exactly as expected.The usual demonspawn events. Like being a werewolf.And having  witches that helped lead an army of about  while I was mopping up the last holdings in Alba.One of them I eventually married. She was still getting pregnant at . What a trooper!Of course I was also batting for the other team the whole time.The first thing I did was take the Scholarship focus. This time to get the Necronomicon. Despite all this I still had a net gain of somewhere around  piety a month.I wanted to create an AntiPope but my temple vassal opinions were so low I decided if I was going to establish an AntiPope I should really go all in.Especially since Ive been torturing Bishops to death.And having sex with others.So I established an AntiPope but Satan told me I wasnt going far enough.So I pressed my claim to the Papacy. France and Aquitine helped me. My antipope was an Ethiopian Eunuch a trade caravan dropped off at my place after telling me about the mythical realm of Hindustan.So the Demonspawn claims the Papacy.God was wounded at this turn of events.After finishing up the Scholarship focus I became a Weird Scholar. Then decided to go hunting. My courtier brought me a puppy. Of course I had to name him Lucifer.But nothing lasts forever and I ended up building a pyramid for his remains when he died. It actually ended up bankrupting me but I had fun restoring order and slaughtering the Thieves Highway Robbers and Smugglers.Im now age  and I know I do not have much time left and I know Im not the only demonspawn ruler but I thought it was fun and I encourage everyone to try playing as one at least once.,CrusaderKings,d1v9cfd,21,t5_2tgic

7269463,0,t3_4exo2j,This is a story about the most annoying noble Europe has ever seen. Duke Guy II of Spoleto was a frail paranoid man who had eyes on stealing the throne of Italy from the Karling dynasty. Duke Guy seemed to enjoy taking every opportunity to be a thorn in his lieges side. He backed every faction he could including the ones with contradictory goals such as installing two different members of the dynasty on the throne at the same time. Despite the fact that Duke Guy spent the entirety of his near  year rule in hiding he was still able to muster a surprisingly large force. He grew to be such a pain that the Karlings of Italy gave standing orders to the kingdom to kill him on sight plot power  should he ever rear his head. Duke Guy was the focus of three different civil wars one for each Karling king he tormented each war was provoked by the reigning king in order to bring the rouge Duke to justice and each time the civil war was interrupted by another member of the Karling clan declaring war for Italy. As a result each war with the Duke resulted in white peace. In the end Duke Guys isolation drove him to insanity. He died a sickly celibate madman possessed by a demon from hell as many of the kings he served under had suspected.

Norse gives you a fantastic synergy with the cultural retinue while Altaic gives you the Invasion CB. Zuns dont suffer from the stupid high Short Reign penalty other pagans do specifically Germanics. Preconclave Zun Nomadic would be my choice. Reformed Zuns which was stupidly easy with Nomads retain all the nomad CBs and gain access to Holy War CB as well. I dont know if this is still the case in Conclave as I have not played nomads in the current patch. For culture Id take Alan for Blinding and Castration.

I know that different units have different levels of morale and I read that each death causes morale damage of .  So if you had a stack of  Pikemen only they would have  morale pikemen have morale .  If  died then you have  morale and morale damage of  so morale  is at ?  ??  This seems to be what it says on the wiki but it seems then that the morale of certain stacks like a pikemen only stack is extremely high. If I do the maths it looks like a  pikeman stack will need to lose  pikemen  of the whole flank!!! before they flee.  Ive never used or fought against a pure pikeman stack and I understand that most stacks are much easier to scare because of greater numbers of LI but does that sound right to you?  seems like most flanks start to flee way before  deaths.At the moment I am playing tribal so have been trying to work out a way to make LI strong in battle.

7941783,0,t3_4o1cxe,gtHello all its time for another DD! Today Im going to tell you about the Prosperity system which is a ltsecret DLCgt feature. Prosperity is rather like the opposite of Depopulation which I have mentioned in previous DDs. In essence provinces which have not been sieged raided or ravaged by disease for a long time will begin to Prosper and gain certain bonuses such as extra tax income and faster replenishment of levies.gt gtTo go into a bit more detail provinces will have a hidden value which increases every year based on things like random chance the terrain of the province the rulers stewardship if the realm is at war and if the province is the rulers Crown Focus. Crown Focus? Whats that? you ask? Well hold on Ill get to that soon. When this value hits certain thresholds the province receives a modifier and the owner is informed that the province is Prospering. If things continue to go well there are up to  levels of Prosperity to be gained. On the other hand if the province is sieged sacked by raiders or infected by an epidemic the Prosperity level will be reduced. If a province is Depopulated all Prosperity is wiped out.Various other factors can also affect the Prosperity value of a province many decisions and events which involve building things deals with merchants holding feasts and tournaments and that kind of thing now also have a Prosperity increasing effect typically in your capital if another province isnt involved. For the Norse theres also an event which can trigger when a fleet returns with loot which gives the capital a small bonus.And finally theres your Crown Focus. Independent rulers who are Dukes or higher and of sufficient size can set one of their Demesne provinces to be their Crown Focus  somewhere the ruler is devoting more of their attention to which causes an additional yearly increase in Prosperity. Further if your Crown Focus province has achieved the maximum level of Prosperity there are some new beneficial events which can fire there. The Crown Focus is also the cause of the crowns seen on the map in some earlier screenshots although were thinking of showing only your own Crown Focus icon to avoid map clutter.gtgtThats all for now but next week Ill mention the new Narrative events ltsecret DLCgt will add.,CrusaderKings,d48qb1r,13,t5_2tgic

There should be a little symbol of sword in a stop sign type thing in the marriage screen to indicate the forming of a pact.

But yes this game is often about laying seeds and waiting be if for a claim to fabricate or a person to marry and have a kid. You must seek out advancement but often it involves waiting for the stars to line up or the right moment. Get a good chancellor with a high diplomacy and fabricate claims on your neighbors. It is a long game   .Warscore is based on who owns the title being targeted in the war be it a single county or a whole Kingdom and battles. Battles won are in your favor lost are against you both start at  and tug of war each other through battles and sieges. If you are the defender and the attacker doesnt siege the title he wants after a while you as the defender will get a ticking war score because the war is over this title and he hasnt taken control of it. Likewise on the flip side if you are an attacker and and siege the target county or counties of the war you will get a ticking warscore in your favor.

Its less about playing a dynasty and playing with interrealm politics and vassal management and more about playing a nationstate with coalitions and expansion against other nationstates What goes on inside your own nation and with your ruler is basically of no interest.Basically in both cases youll have a nation consisting of all the territories you control with your last character as presumably the leader of that nation. In the France game France will be the emperor of the HRE which behaves very differently in EU than in CK and in the second youll be a merchant republic owning the british isles.That is assuming the converter works at all right now which I assume it doesnt.

If they have comparable levies from their vassals you shouldnt worry about getting more for the time being.Im also the Empire of Scandinavia in year . My vassal levies are k but I control Denmark Saxony Pomerania Lithuania half of England Sweden Finland and Norway. Im a merchant republic though so the majority of my holdings are cities so my personal levy is only k. I have k retinues so I have k troops combined which might not be a lot but its the third highest amount in the world. Only the Arabian Empire and Byzantine Empire have more than me at k and k. The biggest threats in Europe right now are West Francia and Italy with k and k respectively. The vast majority of my territory is Germanic faith which gives  to levies. If you have counties that arent your religion focus on converting them along with the rulers. Ignore Finland. They wont provide much levies. Instead focus south. Conquer Denmark first if you havent already then Saxony. From there either conquer Pomerania and work your way around the Baltic Sea towards Finland or conquer territories in England if they havent unified already.As others have said stop upgrading your vassals holdings.

The Karling often holds a few king titles and you will have to claim all of them to get all of the land.  You can check which titles hold which land by clicking the leader and clicking the title.

8842323,0,t1_d7an660,Ive never really played pagan since Paradox introduced tribal mechanics but my understanding is that if you want to play pagan you pretty much need to reform the religion before Europe gets its shit together so you can go feudal Pagan armies are entirely composed of light troops who will get wrecked by feudal armies with cavalry and heavy troops. Unless you know how to take advantage of pagan mechanics to get insane amounts of troops I wouldnt call Sweden an easy start. Starting as a vassal inside a large empire like a duke in France or the Byzantine empire is usually safe enough and lets you build a power base gradually and methodically inside the empire for you to be safely in control once you seize power from within.As Sweden Id probably grow as large as my demesne limit allows and maybe get some vassals or tributaries. Then Id go straight for the missing holy sites and small scale county conquests to raise moral authority until I can reform ideally while the Karling brothers muslims in Iberia and Lombards are busy fighting each other.,CrusaderKings,d7apzre,3,t5_2tgic

The vassal levy structure penalty is also based on your de facto capital. So as long as you dont move your capital you dont lose anything you just wont get quite as much from your new vassals in Jerusalem.Id set up a merchant republic or two in Jerusalem.

The AI doges are incredibly stupid always try to get your trade posts and most times they declare war on enemies they arent ready to fight. What you should really do is stay the doge all the time and get rid of families that manage to get too much land by killing all of their members. The intrigue focus actually works wonders in this case  imprison them then stick them in the oubilette until they die. The relatives dont even get mad.Yes you might say that playing like that is just as playing as a fake monarchy. But to really get to enjoy playing a Republic you should try to do that in Multiplayer.

Byzantium and the Turks are fighting it out and though the Byzantines have the advantage the Turks have all of Sunni Islam that could back them up meaning they are unlikely to be wiped off the map.

I started as William the Conqueror Stamford Bridge bookmark and played through to . The last couple of hundred years were just on fast forward to get the achievement as I had every kingdom on the map but Id had a policy of giving every title I could to a dynasty member on the way through. In the end the final count was  total members  alive.It was on Ironman but I admit I cheated a few times when there were tough battles  its possible to pause and save the game with a siege active then End Task in task manager. When you reload the siege completes with very few casualties for some reason.My technique for dealing with kingdoms was to revoke them all to myself change the laws where necessary to primogeniture then give just enough of the kingdoms to my heir to stay under the vassal limit. So the ruler has every empire and  or so kingdoms the heir has every other kingdom. The heir was always way over the vassal limit before taking the throne  at the time from the screenshot he has  direct vassals count or over. About  of them are dynasty members.It wasnt all that much fun to be honest but I had to do it once ,CrusaderKings,d8fv271,4,t5_2tgic

9386960,0,t3_595xz4,R I conquered England and broke it  in revenge for breaking a betrothal.My kinsman was a Prince Mayor of Mann and the Isles and I was his designated heir. I was betrothed to princess thelburg Iceling  the sister third cousin once removed of the King of England and his heir. Suddenly my kinsman died and I lost the election.Now new Prince Mayor is some poor guy who had like  levy. In my Most Serene Republic losing election is very painful since my dynasty holds  of  counties of the realm and other patrician families hold none I really dont like to deal with strong vassals. So when I lose my Prince Mayorship suddenly realm army becomes very small and everyone attacks my new liege. Attackers always siege my cities since most of the cities are mine and I with my k retinue for some reason cant join these wars and my battles dont count to war score. All I can do is crush armies and wait until Prince Mayor dies so I can become the war leader and white peace the war.So when my kinsman died the King of England immediately broke my betrothal with his sister third cousin once removed and attacked my new liege in an embargo war. Begun painful years of endless battles and sieges during which my dear thelburg became the Queen and married His Royal Highness duke Ye Olde Farte. Finally I won the next election captured the Queen in the battle and ended the war by releasing her at cost of two trade posts and years of restoration of my retinue.While I was planning my revenge the Pope declared the Crusade for Aquitaine which I won. With help of my council I decided to grant it to the Pope and then pull William the Bastard and request an invasion for England. And so I did. I sieged every holding in the kingdom of my dear thelburg at some point paying  ducats a month for mercenaries and in process contracting the Great Pox and recovering from it becoming a lunatic losing an eye and two trade posts again damn you norse raiders!. And then I destroyed the kingdom title generated random counts of my culture and granted them independence so her exRoyal Majesty could wipe her arse with her claims. I didnt really want all these lands since I like to play tall. I just hope Francia wont bother conquering them.Dont fuck with Merchant republics.tldr My girlfriend married another man I carthago delenda ested her ass.

9454382,0,t3_5a85ng,It really depends Sword of Islam adds much more to the base game because you unlock Islam countries which are really fun to play.

The republic has more use than sword of islam which I think only adds polygamy to the mod because you unlock all the city states of essos. But then again I only recommend buying it if you are interested in playing as a republic.So my advice is if you play vanilla or at least non game of thrones mod like hip and ck get sword of islam. Unless you think youre going to play more as a republic than as a muslim like I already said.And the election system is in the GOT mod pretty much the sameas far as I know except for volantis who have awesome yearly elections.,CrusaderKings,d9eerp1,2,t5_2tgic

I really should stop but I have a horrible addiction to seeing what my kidsgrandkids look like. I got here by having all my daughters marry matrilineally and getting my sons to marry landed girls. Though in the GOT mod they can reject you at the last minute so you have to have backups. Taking land from other religions and those who hate you who refuse to stop backing plots and giving it to your family Ive found landed couples have more children. It can be beneficial to be unpopular in this regard. I also invite men to my court and marry them matrilineally to girls of my bloodline especially landed girls outside of my court. And of course any geniuses and people with good qualities get married into my bloodline. While a lot of people prefer strong people I love having genius rulers so theres a lot of incest. But Ive only had one inbred baby in all the time Ive played and that was between and uncle and niece gross but necessary.

The post of chancellor remained empty as long as this was in effect.But then with Conclave DLC they inserted an actual horse to appear as a courtier and take the place of chancellor named Glitterhoof. Complete with a portrait.Eventually people discovered more things around the horse including an exploit to make horses other than Glitterhoof appear and make them breed.But what really made Glitterhoof famous was when a player went ahead and actually managed to become a horse banged more horses to create a horse dynasty...and restored the Roman Empire with itLater on he conquered the entire world replacing every province with horse culture and in effect wiping out humanity,CrusaderKings,d9pg5vo,14,t5_2tgic

Murdered my way down both sides of her family tree until she was empress of both. She then unfortunately died in childbirth after that leaving my  years old granddaughter the empress of both. So I killed my son so I could rule over all  empires faster.... and then it all went to hell after I died and couldnt manage the sprawling empire monster Id somehow gotten into. Ended that game after a string of assassinations left me the  year old duchess of Orleans who died like a year later with a nondynastic heir.

It depends on what you think learning history should be. Should it be about dates people events or should it be more focused on the causes systems and processes that really drove all those things.

Im not overly familiar with Conclaves law system but I think it still holds true that cities are best for money and castles are best for levies.  So youre want to increase town vassal focus on taxes and increase feudal vassal focus on levies.  However there are opinion penalties for making changes in these directions.Investing economy tech points in town infrastructure increases town taxes which should be a better return than castle or church infrastructure.  For improving levies there are specific buildings that increase levy size.  Also holding extra castles in the countyparticularly your capital will increase levies although you will miss out on taxes from holding extra cities.  You also want to have as big a demesne limit as possible and have as close to the limit as you can manage.  ,CrusaderKings,davdlp3,7,t5_2tgic

High Americans begin with level  techs and can embrace institutions on their own no reforming necessary.Basically the High Americans play like any nation in Asia or Africa now. Theyll be eligible for some institutions to spawn in notably they cannot spawn Colonialism but Europe will probably get all of them without player interference. Then players can just spam development in  province to introduce institutions in their land if it spawns in Europe.

10270332,0,t3_5n25oc,Duchies are collections of counties.  They dont really get you anything when youre a king unless youre short some of their de jure territory but destroying them pisses off the counts who make them up.Generally you should own two duchies and as many counties that are part of those duchies as possible and no counties that are part of other duchies that exist in your kingdom.  If you own counties in someone elses duchy theyll get an ambition opinion against you and if you have counts that own counties in the duchies you hold theyll also have ambition opinion against you but its better than the other case because theyre only counts and its only  as opposed to . So you should aim for holding two duchies worth of counties and only two duchies worth of counties.I dont remember how Poland is organized but you can find out which counties are part of which duchies by going to the de jure duchies map mode.  Pick two duchies based on which counties you own and give out counties not in those duchies to landless lowborns you have that part right and transfer them to the proper duke.  Secondarily its best to keep the best counties with the most troopsmost tax from cities but you can always build up your holdings in those duchies to improve those things.I dont think your heir is likely to have more than one additional demesne limit than you so you dont need to hold onto too many extra counties.,CrusaderKings,dc875j0,3,t5_2tgic

10526966,0,t1_dcxnnmh,Theres a lot of overlap between them but they do have different features. CK Plus has more of a focus upon mechanics whilst HIP focuses more upon historical detail. It depends what you like. Id suggest you download both and spend a couple of hours trying them out. As an example of some of the features CK Plus features a much expanded system of trade routes more complex vassal factions and the ability to reunify the Chalcedonian faith until the schism in the th century. HIP features IMO a much better campaign map and generally a lot more detail than vanilla. It has a modular install that gives the option to add a lot of content. It removes the earliest start date and does lots of other stuff besides. Best to check the paradox forums for more info about both tbh.Im not sure if I have a preference tbh  Ive played quite a bit of both.

Not having to disband them to declare war means you can have them sitting on the border or a ship of your war target and invade immediately after declaring war.  Usually you can mop up one or  enemy levies at half morale before theyve gathered together.All being one unit type makes it easy to control what tactic they will role.  Unless youre Italian or Scottish the best retinue is generic defense pikes  archers.

10819930,0,t3_5uodtp,Youre not missing much castles give you a complete fuckfest of troops and theres no way you can hope to influence their troop compositions. The thing about castle troop compositions is that the battles turn into a massive numbers battle because both compositions are so poor so things like terrain and crossing penalties become far more important along with commanders with high martial choosing tactics that wont lose the battle for you. HOWEVER  Retinues are easily narrowed down to a few troop types. I only care about the troop tactics and composition when deciding what kind of Retinues Id use. I tend to favor  Skirmish and Defense Retinues with one additional Defense Retinue to keep archers under  flank during the skirmish phase while keeping the chance of Shieldwall high during melee phase. If youre Altaic use pure Horse archers to abuse their cultural tactic. I believe any heavy cavalry based retinue can be in a pure composition with themselves but youll want your leaders to have the Cavalry Leader or Brave traits.TlDr Tactics matter but castles give so many troop types theyre overshadowed.

11029216,0,t1_dehyoob,Thats because the Septuagint is in Greek . . . mighty ones is or perhaps used to beI see this interpretation has somewhat fallen out of favor a proposed translation of elohim.  Granted elohim is also used in the royal plural fashion.  But then you have Psalm .Which is a huge argument used for henotheismmonolatry I used henotheism before because I like the word better but monolatry is probably a better characterization in Israel.  Also note   though I must again stress that the conception of LORD GOD was that of both the creator and sovereign over all.  Compare other pantheons where the creator godtitangiantprimordial force was specifically not the sovereign king of the gods and actually a lot of times overthrew the creator in the Titanomachy or similar struggle . . . hmm its almost like Judaism was restoring the creator sovereign to His proper place over the lower gods just like orthodox Jews Christians and Muslims profess.Its very interesting because you can be a strict monotheist spoiler I am myself well okay Jews and Muslims may disagree over the whole Trinity thing and still accept this.  As I mentioned before these mighty ones or gods  can be thought of as lesser gods or false gods  but is there much of a difference there?  The point of the mighty ones is that they a have a lot of power b arent humans c humans have worshiped them d humans should not worship them because all worship is due the LORD GOD who is infinite uncreated and sovereign over all.  Which makes those gods both lesser and false gods.  From a monotheistic perspective it makes sense that rebellious angels might set up their own cults.  And name themselves oh lets say Thor or Marduk or AmonRa . . . in which case they wouldnt be false gods in the sense that they dont exist but they would be false in that they are trying to be the LORD GOD but they cant.  Which also makes them a lesser god.So you can easily say that the Hebrews believed in these lesser godsand the monotheistic reformers recognized that only the LORD GOD was the true creator and God of gods sovereign and deserving of worship.Which could be called polytheism depending on whether you want to call those lesser gods Molech Baal etc. gods or henotheism or monolatry or monotheism.  It all depends on how you define those terms.  Its clear that the Hebrews for most of the time slipped into pure polytheism the LORD GOD was only one of many gods getting attention and those reformers were going for a straightup monolatrymonotheism.  And really the difference between modern monolatry and modern monotheism is purely semantic as well as I noted.  Christians Jews and Muslims all believe in angels mighty beings who areat the momentmore powerful than humans immortal etc. who could be characterized as lesser gods but they are created beings who are not to be worshiped and serve the actual true LORD GOD and they do not get any of the Divine Names.  So if we have a loose definition of god then perhaps the Abrahamic religions are still monolatry.  Note that a lot of the gods of pagan religions seem in many senses to be actually inferior to our conceptions of angelspagan gods have limited knowledge make mistakes have sensual vices etc.  But if we have a strict definition of God then the Abrahamic religions are monotheistic.  And its difficult to discuss this because Englishspeakers who are religious in the Abrahamic sense like me have an inherent dislike for calling mighty spiritual beings godsand rightfully sobecause our word for actual god is simply God and our word for false god is also god.  Capitalization isnt much of a barrier from veering off into polytheism or idolization.  A lot of languages have this issue actually.  Ancient Hebrew uses el and elohim for the generic god and gods and mighty ones heck even powerfulimportant humans but they also have the Tetragrammaton which I will not write myself as a more personal name for Godbut some of the writers because of the extreme sanctity of that name will simply not use it.  It is only to be said once per year by the high priest at . . . Im forgetting the holy day.  Sad.  So this whole discussion gets mucked up because when I talk about mighty ones being gods I mean gods which are not at all like GOD.  Confusing eh?  I could use the rather horribly anglicized version of the Tetragrammaton Jehovabut thats used in so many different ways by so many different groups now and is also a bad Anglicization.  Theres a better one out there but I wont type it myself.  Gods in the pagan deity sense of the wordextremely powerful and supernatural but still incredibly limited fallible etc.  In other words from my personal monotheistic point of view using the bad Anglicization when I talk about lesser gods I am not talking about lesser Jehovas  theres no such thing and its a contradiction in terms.  And I believe thats also the main message of the Tanakhthere may be lesser gods mighty spiritual forces but there is only one Jehova and He is incomparable.  We call Him god simply to underscore that the reverence worship and submission that people are giving their own gods is actually due Him.  Just as we call him the King of kings Lord of hosts etc.He is far more than that and other kings and lords of hosts cannot compare to Him.As a Tolkien buff I find an interesting comparison with the conception of the Valar.  As mentioned above the Valar are gods in the more pagan sense of a pantheonthey each have their own domain Manw is air Varda is stars Orom is a hunter etc. they are power superpowered spirits who rule over the earthbut ultimately they are not the one true creator God Eru who rules over them and all existence.  In the first versions of the Legendarium they were actually called gods and as at first the Legendarium was a history of ancient Britain and western Europe I infer they were supposed to be the basis of the Germanic pantheons.  But even in the early drafts while they were gods they clearly were not GOD and quite different from GOD Eru.  Tolkien being a staunch Catholic must have felt conflicted by using the term god for the Valar even if he knew they were not his God so he dropped the equation.  The Valar however remained the same well mostly even in power and status and if you read the Silmarillion they are basically superarchangels with the Maiar being angels.And now Ive veered so so very far offtopic and written too many walls of text and this all properly belongs on a different subreddit.To get back to the original topic Ive never played a Zoroastrian game and I think that will be my next run!  It will also allow me to check out the evil side of Monks and Mystics because I actually feel uncomfortable playing a Satanist from a Christian Jewish or Muslim perspective.

Even if only looking at it from a vassal management standpoint its easier to manage five or six king vassals than thirty forty duke vassals. Theyre more powerful sure but its easier to keep them happy so they dont rebel.The general consensus Ive seen here is to try to keep everything as close to de jure as possible  de jure duchies within de jure kingdoms and then an empire containing those kingdoms.

If you cant open your Technology tab and mouse over your Trade Post Limit in the top right to see what the issue might be. As you build them trade zones will appear on the map wherever a Patrician family holds the majority of posts. NonMuslim Patricians are allowed to own Castles and Cities unlike Feudal lords who are only allowed to own Castles.

Special game rules mean that lieges have a very hard time taking any kind of aggressive action against merchant republics  including the revoking of titles. These two things mean that you could do stuff like swear fealty to a Catholic Scandinavia while playing as a Sunni Republic of Iceland and enjoy some delicious Lethal Weapon  style diplomatic immunity.

Now Muslim and Jewish leaders will only try to convert a county if they have high zeal so try and appoint zealous vassals. Even with trying all over the place you still need the counties to convert and this comes down to religion MA Chaplain learning skill and culturalreligious similarities. This explains it wellThis does not seem up to date as  conversion chance seems to change every  interval and not  interval as described here. I will tell you that converting to Judaism from Germanic or Catholic when MA is above  and Chaplain skill of  or higher is around  chance per year to convert.,CrusaderKings,dfd8u9p,1,t5_2tgic

The realm started going to shit two dukes almost rebelled and the kingdom neary collapsed. At the age of  he escaped the tower and had his sister thrown in prison. Finally on his throne he married the girl hed fallen in love with as a child had two genius children and ruled for  years. He managed to survive until  before he finally died in his sleep and his son took over.Fast forward  years and I have transcended the blob ruling from Britain to the Midde East down to Spain al the way north and a bit into Russia.

11611732,0,t1_dgc006i,Alright so the biggest thing for small rulers or new rulers is having s high martial score it directly ties to your total number of troops. Next up you can tell your neighbors troops by clicking on him its ok the right of his portrait page. Should have a helmet icon. You can tell your total troops via the military page or checking your portrait. This should save you from ever getting in a war where you are outnumbered.Next up tributaries. Tributaries are amazing. You get a free chance to make your neighbor a tributary you dont get any land but they give you  of their income and much more importantly for you they always accept your invitations to war. So pick a couple neighbors with less troops than you declare tributary wars meanwhile fabricate claims on different neighbors. Now when you look to declare war you can check your enemy troop numbers your numbers and all tributaries numbers. If you get enough tributaries sometimes you dont even have to raise your troops. Let them conquer for you. Next up alliances. Another reason your enemies could have more troops is because they have an alliance with a neighbor through marriage. So before you declare war on a ruler check their relations tab if someone is listed there in green they have a non aggression pact which is fine. If someone there is listed as blue they have an alliance AI tends to accept allies requests for war because they lose prestige if they dont. However if their allies are in a war themselves they probably wont join or if they do they always prioritize their own wars first so you can probably sneak in an defeat the guy you after before the Ally gets their shit together and comes to help. Your realm splits from your succession laws. Gavelkind splits amongst your kids. Its a terrible rule but common for the age and much later. There are ways around this. When creating titles only have one of your highest title so say your a duchy dont create a second duchy because when you die it will split into two duchies only one of which will be yours. But if you have one duchy and several counties you will lose a few counties but they will be your vassals not independent. Still that sucks so..You can give away all titles except your duchy and capital county to one old unlanded lowborn with no family they will essentially hold it for you when you have poor health and think you will die. Your son can then kill off the old man and inherit everything thus side stepping Gavelkind. Now these are small fixes the real issue is...Gavelkind. Its got to go. The way to do this is upgrade your culture tech to legalism level  this should be your primary goal. Once you hit level  you can pass a law for late stage feudal. Once that law is passed you can swap to primogeniture succession. Then your oldest son will inherit everything stability galore. To upgrade your tech is easy if you have way of life dlc. You can take the focus for scholarship then go to intrigue tab and build an observatory. Then the event chain will fire and the first event you get you have two options the bottom option for  prestige says is there something out there? Follow that event chain and you will get the necrominon artifact getting this book will get you  culture tech points then awhiles later another event offering  more tech points to dive deeper into the book. This should get you  of the way to tech level . In one rulers life. Otherwise focus on learning its slow but tech builds more the higher your learning is. ,CrusaderKings,dgc77c1,2,t5_2tgic

You dont want to absolutely spam out kids because each new male is a potential source of decadence. Dont land your preferred heir until at least either A. He and his primary bride are both of age and you have secured  more marriages for him or B. You are sure you will not live much longer. Preferably both. The reason for this is otherwise he will marry a bunch of young women with terrible stats who will have  crappy babies with him.I also strongly advise against giving any of your family members a title less than  tiers below yours because if they become decadent and you fail to arrest them they will continue to generate decadence for the entire duration  of the imprisonment war which could last a long time indeed. If you have no other choice take the tyranny hit for arresting a decadent relative. Muslims get lots of relation bonuses with each other anyway so as long as you can limit the number of unjustified what the decadence system considers unjustified is extremely wonky and unclear decadence arrests you should be good.,CrusaderKings,dgjmlti,11,t5_2tgic

11715542,0,t1_dgnyswx,Youll have to do it piece by piece over time. It will involve revoking titles you want to have for yourself. You can do this directly and just eat the tyranny. Or you can wait for them to commit a crime and revoke after they resist arrest. Or you can fabricate claims on the things you want and revoke them tyranny free. Or you can marry your heirs to the daughters of the current holders of the title you want and wait a few generations for them to inherit a claim then revoke tyranny free.There are two main concerns you should have while relocating. First avoid holding counties that are de jure the property of your vassal dukes. This will make them mad at you. Second try to keep them all in one place. This makes it easy for you to assemble your forces in the event of a rebellion allowing you to go out to fight while your enemies are still assembling. IF youre running Gavelkind you also want your core demesne to be a duchy you hold the inheritance algorithm will avoid breaking up your capital duchy if at all possible... but you have access to Tanistry so I doubt youre running Gavelkind.,CrusaderKings,dgnzi0r,1,t5_2tgic
