511971,0,t1_cftnwdw,Yes thats a great point an exchange does live or die by volume.  Regarding verification of the signer there will be processes in place to check it.  At the same time the onus is also on people not to act fraudulently  use false documents etc.  So in a sense Tua is under the same constraints as the banks.  Whereby a face to face verification is required for documents that our processes deem to be questionable that maybe facilitate that through Video conferencing such as skype facetime etc.,NZBitcoin,cfygppx,1,t5_2wujr
662153,0,t1_cge2p8j,Ive rephrased the bidsask to make it easier to understand.  Place two bids like so Buy . XBT . .  Buy . XBT . . ... then a wildlyundervalued ask for the sum of the two bids Sell . XBT . . So in answer to your question the trader who placed the two bids receives cheap coins and the trader who placed the low ask receives no reward for their folly.Youre suggesting the bidding trader should cough up  despite the coins in the opposing order being sold at a lower pricepoint for a mere .Incidentally I found and fixed an assetunfreezing bug while recreating your orders so thanks anyway!  D  Beta should be updated soon.,NZBitcoin,cgfjbr0,1,t5_2wujr

4476166,0,t3_3bxrbl,Hmm. Yeah I guess that could be better..  I think its still fair if the  of a cent order executed first and actually executes at that price.On NZBCX we have input validations that prevent you placing orders over dp  or  cent.   If you get past that its rounded.  Then the trading engine also has a tick size set to  cent.  So would reject the order any way.   Its all done with Java BigDecimals on the back end... ,NZBitcoin,csuw2z3,0,t5_2wujr
