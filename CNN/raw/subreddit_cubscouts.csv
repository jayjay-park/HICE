1990849,0,t1_ckrbphf,Yep give them a job.  Dont like how the den meeting went?  Congratulations youve got next week.  Dont like the Pack meeting?  Congratulations on your promotion.Yes Im using humor but its still the best method I know of.  With a Pack thats  volunteers there is ALWAYS room for more help.,cubscouts,ckt3in1,3,t5_2strn
2997987,0,t1_co7tod7,Thank you for the advice. You obviously know what youre talking about and I know you are right. I invited the CM to get together and talk about the state of affairs  to see what he thought about how things were going and talk with  him away from his wife and the pack but he did not respond.  We are having a leader meeting tomorrow and the district execs.are going to be there to observe and talk with the chair do well see how that goes.  this was set up by the current  chairwoman I am taking over for. My agenda covers quite a bit including a couple topics that may upset some people  but that need to be talked about. ,cubscouts,co8qme4,1,t5_2strn
5675918,0,t3_3sjn2a,It sounds like youve found a solution. My suggestion was going to be that instead of offering to help lead den meetings you might organize the outings. Every adventure is supposed to include an outing. I for one cant get it all done without help. ,cubscouts,cx0njdx,1,t5_2strn

7296228,0,t1_d27g4tj,Well they were page written reports with about  paragraphs  but to me thats REALLY long for nd grade!I suspect the parents were heavily involved. My son ended up doing a powerpoint. My husband looked up the city data on houses built by year and had a map image showing number of houses added each  years. I added the images to Powerpoint then let my son play around with an opening and closing special effect. He also recorded his voice in the background of the slides to explain the images. He was very pleased with the outcome.When he finished his project he wanted to make another powerpoint for fun and added photos of himself and various shapes and special effects he thought it was really fun. ,cubscouts,d27j58n,1,t5_2strn

9156285,0,t1_d8clqha,the marshmallow one looks pretty easy as well. Ill see if I have any at home. Time to head out.,cubscouts,d8cmiqd,1,t5_2strn
9265135,0,t1_d8qellr,Thanks but the training and the Leaders guide recommends that the boys make their own code of conduct because by having a say in the rules they are more likely to follow them.Creating a den code of conduct is not my idea it is part of the program.Ill grant you that the Cubs are unlikely to come up with anything that is not already covered by the items you list.,cubscouts,d8qf6z2,2,t5_2strn
10843870,0,t1_ddvjr7d,I second that. Den leader is the hardest job in cub scouting. As cub master I would plan on two or three monthly meetings pack meeting committee meeting and round table. And I would plan an hour to prepare and an hour to review the pack meeting and committee meeting so I would commit five hours per month. You could also commit yourself to helping the den leaders organize things like summer camp blue and gold and pinewood derby. And you could help them with monthly outings if you have the energy.  Cub Scouts is a great size for a pack. I suspect you are providing a first class scouting experience with numbers like that. ,cubscouts,ddygw4m,1,t5_2strn
