3182741,0,t1_corna9d,I spent a lot of time on YouTube just now and Ive watched a few streams of Kromog and I couldnt find a single guide or kill video that didnt have the tanks offset from the middle and the melee rotated at least  degrees from the tanks. Id be interested in a reference on seeing the tanks in the middle because I just cant find one. Though I guess Sys friends team does that.I think bringing everyone closer is probably a good idea. I wish I could get a good analysis on how effective it was to have melee way way over on the side. If it helped a lot we could probably have the tanks in the middle and melee off to that side. If it helped only a little we can probably just move the tanks and melee a little closer to the middle.,massrezinc,corw2mo,1,t5_36cvw
