The blog is a daily read for all the photojournalists I know. Hes pissed off so many people he cant figure out who is running the blog but his online meltdowns attacking everybody he thinks is behind it are now the stuff of legend. And LOL over inconsistencies  he makes up the most ridiculous stories. ,internetisugly,cur4hh4,1,t5_2xdxv
