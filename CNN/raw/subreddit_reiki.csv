1367609,0,t1_cinprp5,I agree see my stigmatism with it is that when Takaya I spell names wrong dont hate me brought Reiki to the west she claimed she was the Grandmaster of Reiki and only she could teach it. Back in Japan the term Master isnt used at all. Should we be pressing forward with the Western version of titles or should we begin pursuing the Japanese titles of simply being practitioners? Noting that in Japan level  is much harder to come to than in the West because of the different lifestyles we liveWhat are your thoughts based on that?,reiki,cinpvnp,1,t5_2r0lt
1378933,0,t1_cip3ipu,I dont think theres anything wrong with charging money for performingteaching reiki. You are providing a service after all. Ive readbeen taught that there should be an energy exchange for reiki healing. While money is a common representation of that exchange it doesnt have to be. My teacher taught us that we shouldnt ever turn away anyone because they cant pay. Bartering for good or services is totally acceptable and often it is preferable. ,reiki,cip4uo3,3,t5_2r0lt

5232591,0,t1_cvdvg50,Hi thanks for taking all that time for me. I really appreciate this!I have updated my opening post about days .Yes I eat. I eat too much sweets. I am overweighted. I read in another topic about this and this spoke to me so I want to try to work on my health habits with Reiki too.Yes if I look back to when I started this topic a lot has changed. I believe in Reiki again and I no longer believe there is a dark side to Reiki. I believe that I had a choice either ignore everything and neglect Reiki never to return or start working on it with Reiki and change myself. I am now glad that I did the latter and I thank you and the other posters here for helping me make that decision.I really like this earthsky meditation. I have always loved nature a lot. I have always dreamed of spending my days in a wooden cabin in my private forest with my dog enjoying every evening. That dream is not really realistic but I dont mind because when I meditate I am there a little bit. I never harm others at some point in my life I even stopped killing mosquitos. I do eat meat though and I hope the animals are killed as softly as possible for this meat. So this earthsky meditation speaks to me. I cant say I have really felt the returning love from the mother and the father as explained in that web page but telling myself how much love I had felt good anyway.Therefor I have no problem at all with continuing with the earthsky meditations as you say. I also feel like doing reiki on those spots. I feel I need to.And yes I am very open to try another meditation! I am already looking forward to it!Thank you very much for staying with me!,reiki,cvgpuv3,1,t5_2r0lt
6080360,0,t3_3yskue,unpopular opinion one of the biggest problems i have with the reiki system is the fact that you pay to take a class and suddenly have these powers which i actually had all along you take a few more classes and suddenly youre a master. i feel the word master minimizes and invalidates the  ten thousand hours of practice that go into mastering an art or skill... i have yet to meet any person who has trained reiki with the same passion and vigor that could be said of other masters of other forms.i invite discourse please help me change my mind.,reiki,cygm9a3,3,t5_2r0lt

6187611,0,t1_cysye81,Only more reason to not watch videos for it. Start meditation do selfreiki and go back with your mind to places you like to be look around and think about what you want to see. Also go back to difficult memories and relive them but now be a third person supporting the you in that bad situation. Do these things and you will understand what I mean... Its all already in your mind you just need to look...,reiki,cysyswo,1,t5_2r0lt
