73245,0,t1_cemmp72,The problem is because you have to solo and do open world content in a dps spec it hurts healerstanks badly. They already get punished by having to get and carry a full second set of gear for tankinghealing.  This would just be a kick in the teeth.  It would force you to use subpar amps when youre soloing which punishes them for playing a role thats already underpopulated.,WildStarOnline,cemrnuj,3,t5_2x818
97898,0,t3_1usiti,OP if youre still around I have a few specific questions. Tier  Unstable Anomaly increases healing reduction to  on subdued or disoriented foes. What do those two terms mean specifically? Does the Engineer have any abilities that makes enemies subdued or disoriented? Edit Patch notes explain this. Was changed to blinded and stunned.. How much volatility does tier  Pulse Blast generate? Base spell generates  volatility and the tooltip for tier  says Volatility gain increased to . What exactly is going on there? . How many targets can Ricochet hit? Thanks!!,WildStarOnline,cepkq6b,1,t5_2x818

275732,0,t1_cf9b2pi,It was insanely fun for the few times but in all honesty the replayability is low I was in from the earlier phases so I ended up being wiped a few times and had to replay the first  levels quite a few times especially when I was trying out multiple classes to compare changes and updates.  So I have seen both intro areas and the area past the main city about  times now so its just a bit boring.  The quest are really good the first time and the story is amazing but the quest lines are insanely linear.  Wildstar is a very go here then here then here system so it gets very boring after the third time through.  The game is more linear than wow where at least you have different options in zones and have more dungeon options you only get  every  levels in wildstar.   In wildstar you have two intro zones for each faction which are based on your race but they are pretty much only for those races and after the first city it pretty much is the same zone every time and are completely linear AgtBgtC for the most part.    That said I did really enjoy the leveling and questing the first few times it just gets really boring the second time through due to how linear it is.I actually ever logged into the saturdays so I dont think I ever got a friend key always had something to do on saturdays and could never log in at least I never had one emailed to me but I still get my forum digest so I know I still have access.    I have not actually played in about  weeks but played pretty heavily before that I will probably check this patch and see what has changed though.,WildStarOnline,cf9cbu0,2,t5_2x818

1106731,0,t3_25rtg0,In the start I found it a bit hard because the voices that played didnt match the quest text and the text was so tiny but after playing it for a while during openbeta I got used to it. Its just different and things that are different may be hard in the beginning. Just give it time.. or install an addon to fix it. ,WildStarOnline,chu3cel,1,t5_2x818
