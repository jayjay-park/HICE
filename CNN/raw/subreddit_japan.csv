35315,0,t1_cei9q6i,You know I started enjoying Japanese TV a lot more when I figured out that all the network channels are like a giant neverending episode of Saturday Night Live Everyone is playing a character these characters are placed in strange or notsostrange situations regularly with varying comedic effect everyone gets along on the outside but is truly in vicious competition with each other.Even those shitty food shows where talents visit some restaurant and gush about the food can become entertaining when you figure that everyone is really competing with each other for screen time and promotional deals. Idiotic catchphrases become marketing strategies and stupid clothes are costumes that identify characters. Its actually a lot more sophisticated then it looks while still being vapid entertainment.,japan,ceigafc,7,t5_2qh2u
37507,0,t3_1uh86p,Its like people dont even try to understand the country they live in.Investigators look into incidents they dont ignore them. If theres no evidence of wrongdoing by someone or if there isnt enough evidence to win a prosecution then they dont pursue it. The margin needed to do this is severe hence the detainment and reliance on confessions  whereas in the US the bar isnt nearly so high. Essentially every violent crimeincident in Japan is reported on the local if not national news. There is violence but a lot of it is gang related. Its not perfect but its not wildly misreported either.,japan,ceip9hj,1,t5_2qh2u

Apparently some guy who made a Hiroshima documentary is supposed to be a good international agent?gt Taylor has acknowledged that he has had problems with Taniguchi but points out Do his issues with me justify him attacking my client and harassing her? Is that acceptable in Japan to victimize a woman out of a personal grudge? He has also demanded I turn over her contract to him. Its bizarre.And from a France articlegt Taniguchi has denied the allegations claiming that he was simply trying to track down the actresss American manager Matt Taylor because Taylor owed him money.Was there any money involved or is it as another article suggests a result of Taylor and Taniguchi both having been boyfriends of a woman who committed suicide?I dont know why the change.org petition is making it sound like she is a leading a campaign to get Japanese police to stop stalkers.  There are much bigger issues here.  This doesnt sound like anything that most stalking victims have to face.  Its about some kind of moneypersonal dispute between Taylor and Taniguchi Taniguchi using his incredibly powerful talent agency to bully the press and a woman who has found herself a victim of the dispute.

Namely the US military needing to prioritize efforts in other parts of the world and aggression and extreme antiJapanese attitudes from China. People listening were getting very uncomfortable by it claiming I was being racist against Chinese people despite studying Chinese culture and language for fun and that I was exaggerating things. A few months later there were antiJapanese riots in many parts of China. Almost a year later the Senkaku dispute inspired more aggression and riots in China.

He used development of its skyscrapers as an example for its continued progress for whatever reason. In addition to that he claimed that its pending demographic crisis was deliberately selfengineered for stability and harmony. Just read the article yourself.

You usually receive a reminder in the post then you go to the post office or other places and pay there. Its all nice and standardized none of this sign here and your soul belongs to us business.The guys who will come to your house are BBC TV detector vans. These are vehicles that can detect if a household has an active TV and that has not paid the bill. They will gently remind you that you need to go and pay. If things get out of hand the boys in blue will haul you in for a shakedown.The funny thing is the TV licence fee is not actually a tax the BBC sort of being a private business but at the same time you dont have any option to not pay if you operate a TV even if you dont watch BBC. Its one of those weird things where you can go to the slammer and be put in with Mr Big whos in with the warders if you dont pay.Like NHK you can stop paying the fee if you disconnect your TV and put it away in the attic with the old scalextric set and other crap.On the whole most people pay it some dont but its hard to get out of it. It doesnt have the same sleazy feel as the shady NHK guys who come to your door and who may or may not be scammers.One advantage you get with BBC programmes is that there arent adverts every  minutes.

I made my way around the side of the room and approached the kid holding the knife with the stoniest expression I could muster. He took away the knife from the kids throat and I got in his face and said Put that away. Right. Now.  He made a pretty terrible face but did as I told. I reemphasized that he was never to do that again and then went back up to the front of the classroom and resumed my lesson with my normally cheerful demeanor. I think the splitsecond shift from happy!teacher to angry!teacher was pretty effective in intimidating him but my really thick Kansaiben probably helped.The weirdest part was that when I confronted the teacher after class to ask her why she did nothing I mentioned that when he put the knife away I saw a pack of cigarettes in his bag. She went white and said What?? He had CIGARETTES??  He got in trouble for the cigarettes but not for the knife.  This kid was a known troublemaker and a lot of teachers were afraid of him especially since he was taller than all of the women including me and really resented teachers who told him off in front of the class.

Since China is still frothing at the mouth over something that happened  years ago I understand and support their purely reactionary militarization if they even decide to go that route but they have remained completely pacifist up until now so dont try to mislead anyone about their pacifist nature.Oh and lets just ignore Chinas continued occupation of regions like Tibet and Xinjiang where the people obviously dont want them there. Lets just forget when China involved themselves in the Korean War where they fought and supported those who fought like barbaric animals. Oh lets not forget how theyve supported genocide by the Khmer Rouge. They still continue to support North Korea today which is a brutal nation.

1410217,0,t1_ciszom8,gtI know soccer fans and Im sure you know more and most of them gave SB a slim chance to leave the group. My coworkers on the other hand were surprised and couldnt believe it. When the draw took place in December the overall consensus was that Japan had a more than fair chance of getting out of the group. The phrase group of opportunity got tossed around quite a bit and that wasnt unreasonable.Unfortunately all of the dominoes were arranged in such a way to telegraph a Japan failure over the next  months and thats what we saw. Kagawa and Honda riding the bench. Nagatomo Uchida Hasebe Yoshida injured. Konno being Konno. Kakitani underperforming in the JLeague. Yet with some more confidence and cohesion they could have beaten Ivory Coast and they definitely could have beaten Greece and then wed be having a much different conversation.You also have to consider the historical perspective Japan looked horrible in the leadin to  and they played fantastically at the tournament. In  they looked okay in warmups and then underwhelmed in Germany. In fact  was basically a mirror image of  Australia gt Ivory Coast Croatia gt Greece Brazil gt Colombia.gtI feel that the casual Japanese watcher of soccer was grossly optimistic about SB. Which is the point of this article.If you want to discuss why fan expectations are so high you have to look at Japanese mediamarketing and how they treat soccer Japanese players and the national team in particular. urandomjak points out that Japan has only had professional soccer for two decades but soccer media is even less mature.Journalists are spineless  times out of  when a journalists asks a question of a player or manager its in the form of an answer. You sure had a great performance today didnt you. Yeah I think I did. That goal looked like it felt fun to score. It was. Etc. Nobody wants to ask a question that makes the player look bad because it risks damaging their the journalists relationship with the player and the club.Clubs are spineless Clubs are hyperconcerned about anything negative that would drive fans away from the team so everything  from press conferences to exclusive interviews  are managed under the watchful eye of the PR department. Even the most benign shit. Its horrible.Sports tabloids Nikkan Sponichi etc Old Guard media who care much more about baseball than they do about soccer. If its not sensational for better or for worse they dont care.TV Japanese TV largely treats soccer as entertainment which means that it needs a theme song and montage videos and crying fans on screen and manufactured emotion.The fact that a clown like Yasutaro Matsuki is Japans most popular commentator tells you how bad the situation is he represents TV Asahis throwing of the towel and admitting that they cannot market the national team to anyone but the lowest common denominator. The focus is on whos got the ball whos taking a shot and how kakkoii Honda and Kagawa are not about educating the viewers on tactics and whats actually happening on the pitch.Internet media The JLeague does not in fact allow most internet media to cover games in order to maintain their relationship with traditional print and TV media who already feel like reluctant partners. That doesnt mean that theres no good analysiscommentary online but Goal.com and Yahoo!Sportsnavi are the only two sites that are pure web ventures. Soccer King Football Channel Gekisaka etc are all backed by publishing companies. On the whole Japan still doesnt take the internet seriously as a communications platform  its a tool to check the weather and buy things online but independentcitizen journalism in this country is at least a decade behind the rest of the world.Marketing The JohnniesAKBization of star players and teams has dumbed things down a bit more and thats another rant entirely but the bullet point is that theres little effort being taken to make the public more knowledgable about the sport. Instead the goal is to make players like Kakitani and Kagawa into stars who can sell products and satisfy sponsors.Smart soccer analysis exists  in magazines like  and  columns on SportsNaviFootball Channel the latter of whom publish Summit and in latenight TV programs such as CRAQUE and Foot x Brain. You can also find a lot of insightful commentary by freelance journalists on Twitter and elsewhere.Will things change? Eventually maybe. The first step will be improving the general announcing quality of national team games  aside from Matsuki there isnt much good to be found on NHK Fuji or elsewhere. I think the JFA needs to look at how the USSF succeeded in raising the USMNTs profile during the World Cup and I think the JLeague needs to look at how the MLS markets itself  by encouraging analysis and criticism. I think that as the current generation of veterans retires and start second careers in media things will start to improve... slowly.,japan,cit1tdi,11,t5_2qh2u

Besides why put effort into finding out that no Japan does not put video games in its urinals? That would ruin a perfectly good Budweiserfuelled bonfire discussion with Frank and Jim.All this makes it a perfect target for modern clickbait paybyview journalism. To talk trash about Japan you dont have to be in Japan or have experience in Japan. You just need to want money and have access to whacky Japan material. Dangerous? Hell yes.

Are they unable to call said hospitals? Its ridiculous that you believe that calling someone a drug user should be the first step in a doctors manual especially because of their race.First you forget about doctorpatient confidentiality. Not sure if its law in Japan but at the very least it could be unethical. Plus were dealing with a small town. They probably dont even use their fax machine unless they  must. Second by the manual is a figure of speech. You sound like youre eight or autistic. While were at it nobody records their schedules by carving it in stone there is no grape vine people hear things through and the conclusion of a discourse is not always at the end of the day. Third You make assumptions that this was based on race. How do you know that the doctor wouldnt do the same thing with a Japanese person if his crutches said Yamada clinic and his bandages said Nakamura? You dont. We just know that it happened to a foreigner and were making assumptions based on that. Whether theyre true or not we cant prove them. gtAlso are you saying that no foreigner in Japan should be allowed to get a second opinion?If anyones building strawmen its you. I said I dont condone what the doctor did but I dont think we should just pass it off as THASS RAYSIS! Just because I dont think its a case of racism doesnt mean Im saying it should have happened or should happen to all foreigners. OP lives in a small town by his own admission. Had OP been in Tokyo or Nagoya he wouldnt run into this kind of issue. The doctor wasnt being malicious. He wasnt some sort of evil Uyo Klansman. Its a simple fact that people will seize up sometimes if they cant effectively communicate with a person. And sometimes people become cautious.

Yukawa insisted he was a photographer and then implied he was a doctor. It was clear that his interrogators didnt believe him.gtThe interrogators made it clear why they didnt believe him. You thief? Why you have gun? You kill soldier?Since what was apparently his last video from Syria which has been shown on TV shows him sitting in his truck with an AK showing it to the camera and saying he always carried it for protection I would assume that is what he had when caught.Whatever his reasons for going if you are wandering around a war zone with an automatic weapon folks are going to assume you are a combatant.  Now if I personally was going to wander around a war zone in the middle east I too would want some firepower for protection.  If caught by ISIS I am going to have my head cut off whether armed or unarmed so I might as well be armed so I can put up a fight and either get away best option or kill as many of them as possible before being killed quickly by a round to the head or chest second best option.However before it got to that I would very seriously reconsider my travel plans and opt for visiting a place that was not caught up in a fight to the death involving muslim fanatics.

1808026,0,t1_ck70jkz,I see that this is a sore issue for you. However the way Japan treated Korea during its colonial period and the way China treated it when it was a vassal were very different. The Chinese still let Korea have its dynastic rulers and its language for instance. Also the dispute over Baekdusan isnt nearly as well known in Korea as the dispute over Dokdo and passions dont run all that high in comparison. Actually the tiff that Korea had with China over Goguryeo seemed to have caused more of a disturbance in their relations than Baekdusan the Yalu islands or Jiandao and even you dont mention that. The reason they bring up the issue of problems between Japan and the other two nations is that the tension from these problems are ongoing issues that are affecting their relations. Every time a Japanese Prime Minister visits the Yasukuni Shrine it makes big headlines. Every time a Japanese official makes a comment disparaging Korean or Chinese requests for a new apologyreparations changes in Japanese textbooks it is in the evening news in those nations. Relations between Japan and China are bad enough that there have been almost definitely orchestrated mass protests in China against the Japanese. Many Koreans Ive talked to are very passionate about what they perceive as injustice in the way Japanese have acted. Is it fair? Hard to say because the Japanese havent always helped themselves. At the same time the author and editor of the articles are writing it with a certain audience in mind. Theyre probably the type of people who would be thinking about the tensions with the Japanese anyway. They probably view the tensions as very much a part of the background information necessary to understand the negotiations. ,japan,ck71g5e,5,t5_2qh2u

1934713,0,t1_ckiledt,I think you are on the right track regarding an MA opening doors.Yes conditions are worsening or more accurately the economy is flat. In a shrinking market competition increases and those that were previously unqualified and working above their abilities have started to be weeded out. There is such a huge spectrum of professionalism. Some people treat the job as a chance to bank money for drugs beer and vacations. Those people usually do the minimum are terrible teachers and present themselves unprofessionally. These kinds of people will find higher pay and less demanding bosses I other places. So in that way Japan has moved on. However there is and will be huge demand for teachers with skills and professionalism. What are you looking for?You will probably need a year or so to become financially stable. There are many startup costs. It will also take time to build up enough teaching hours to balance the books. Depending on your city lifestyle and working hours you can save between  USD per month. You seem to be focused on salary. If that is the case you will earn much more in booming markets. Especially as a new graduate it takes  years experience to get good jobs. No you wont be getting uni positions with a BA in Japan. This is sometimes possible in less developed countries but Japan is filled with MA and Docs.I highly recommend this career choice if you want to work and live abroad. You can go almost anywhere experience different cultures and learn about the world. You wont be getting wealthy. You really need to decide if you are okay with that before you go down that path. Dont worry about having enough to survive though. Most teachers make comfortable salaries in about half the hours worked as a typical salary man. Some of us become lazy some focus on hobbies and passions others study some work second an third jobs to pay for expensive tastes. You will have new options and new limitations that you dont have in the US.Honestly the cost of living in the US is so high I couldnt imagine moving home. I feel wealthier here because I have plenty of pocket money after my expenses. If I wasnt in Japan I would be in another foreign country that I mentioned in my other posts. I like how standards are really high here. Other people prefer more a relaxed environment so maybe Japan isnt the best for them. Id be happy to answer any other questions you might think of.

However as you pointed out she was a smart woman  smarter than Tsujimoto Kiyomi that is for certain.  No one caught on that Doi was embezzling government funds for fictional secretaries until Tsujimoto got caught and had that classic deerintheheadlights press conference where she basically said what do you mean doing that is wrong?

But I guess youre fine with that I mean she was against the sales tax and forced the LDP out of power in the Upper House right?

2072479,0,t3_2ikcac,ugeekpondering answered most of your actual questions so let me weigh in on some stuff you didnt ask.First you need a visa to be in Japan. For a lot of countries you can get a day tourist exemption and for certain countries a working holiday visa but for the most part you need a visa to stay for an extended period of time.Now you can get a student visa which will only give you permission to make minimal income on top of paying tuition or you can go for a working visa which requires a company thats actually willing to hire you and sponsor your visa assuming you have the requisite degree or necessary year experience in whatever field you work in.You say average but average differs with each situation. For instance having a yard is definitely not average in a country where land is the singlemost valuable commodity. On the other hand trains being on time fresh safe food in bundance the ability to walk the streets at night with little fear of getting robbed is very much the norm. It all depends on your expectations.,japan,cl39a83,5,t5_2qh2u

2132163,0,t3_2jaz19,As maddg said just call or visit immigration. If youre up front about these things theyre generally very nice and flexible.That said Ill offer up my own personal experience changing residence statuses visas which I did a couple years ago just after the new law took effect. If I remember correctly technically the law says you should change your visa as soon as you change to a job which requires a different visa but you dont actually have to until your old visa is set to expire. In my case I worked on my old visa issued while the old law was in effect with passport stamps and everything for about two years after I had switched to a job requiring a different visa. When it was a couple months from expiring I went down to the local immigration office to get it changed and as far as I remember there was no discussion about my delay in getting the new visa beyond the immigration officer asking how long I had been doing my new job  to which I truthfully answered two years.As such based on my own experience you should be fine going overseas with your current visa and waiting to file for a new visa until after you come back and you will be allowed back into the country under that visa since it should for all intents and purposes be valid. However I would still encourage you to call immigration to get the official word as official as the immigration offices word can be considering most of their policies are guidelines rather than concrete rules and their interpretation is really up to the individual immigration worker. Most likely the will strongly insist that you file to change your visa immediately but I believe if you press them on it they will admit that in fact you can continue to use your old visa up until it expires.,japan,clauf7j,1,t5_2qh2u

2291709,0,t1_cluty8d,this is interesting. my wife is japanese and she really wants to go home to japan from Canada where shes lived for  yearswere planning to go in maybe  months or so though we are going for  months next year while on parental leave. its a little nerve wracking for me because by the time we move there we will be  years old. i have traveled extensively in my life but sometimes i wonder if  is too old for such a massive change.our plan is that she will get a job and i will stay at home and take care of our son and tutor English in the evenings. her family lives in a small town where there are not really any native English speakers so her sister is convinced there will be lots of people to hire me if we live there and would probably be better off than getting a job in an actual English school. plus her mom is in real estate so we can get an apartment for   yenmonth.our  biggest concerns are  me getting a visa without a job though i think on a spouse visa i should still be able to do it and  her getting a job as a  year old mother whos been out of the country for over a decade. ive been studying japanese  assed for a few years now but cant really get by conversationally yetjust pick out a bunch of words to get the gist.as your experience on a spouse visa and not speaking Japanese what sort of jobs did you find were available to you? what sort of business were you able to build? we talked about doing something like that too my wife has some business background me not so much but we were uncertain as to where to start.gtdecided its better to be a foreign expert than local Gaijin so to speak. By not blending in not learning the language not assimilating things completely turned around. ive thought of this and wondered if it might help me assimilate when im living there. based on what people say and my previous experiences being in Japan i know one of the most common frustrations of foreigners is that even if i spoke nativelevel Japanese and was perfect at every complex cultural nuance i would still be treated as a stranger. i wondered if it would be better just to embrace the fact that i will always be an outsider rather than get frustrated with it. ,japan,cluyzct,2,t5_2qh2u

2387100,0,t3_2mp0hg,Sorry the comments here are giving you so much shit. Nothing wrong with candor. I have a similar sentiment to you though so perhaps youd like to hear my view. My first girlfriend was White blonde blueeyed. My second was a brunette with brown eyes. My third was blonde with blueish eyes. They were all fine and I loved the first and the last. Now in my first year of college I met a Chinese girl. Physically I liked that she was pale petite and had clear skin. It just so happens that certain areas of Asia possess these features more than other areas. Ive always liked pale skin and petiteness and these attributes are often found in Asian girls. It can also be noted that Asian culture promotes paleness whereas Western countries right now are promoting being tan. Now she was actually the most liberal of the girls Ive dated and was Westernized to the point that she was studying Western philosophy. So I enjoyed her looks and I enjoyed her interests and she just happened to be Chinese.The year after that when I was reading outside a Chinese girl came up and asked me questions in broken English for a school project. Again pale and petite and also very skinny. She was a FOB fresh off the boat and so didnt know English too well. I enjoyed correcting her English but that wasnt anything that drew me to her. She told me she is considered perfect by the standard of beauty in Southern China. Again a lot of areas in China promote the features that I find attractive. Heres the funny part though when we really got to know each other I asked her why she liked me and she said with the most serious face because youre American!.Everyone fetishizes and it really isnt a big deal. Its only a big deal if youre creepy about it. Women in the West fetishize the tall dark and handsome. They fetishize cheekbones and chins brow ridges and noses. Attraction itself is simply a series of fetishes. In terms of attitude Asian culture is often considered timid whereas Mediterranean and Arab cultures are often considered dominant and thus attractive. It doesnt need to be said that timidity is universally attractive in women and dominance universally attractive in men other things being equal. Really the fetishization swings both ways and I dont think its something to be ashamed of.,japan,cm6r4wm,-2,t5_2qh2u

2462500,0,t3_2nr16n,Boy are you in for some surprises!First lets cover something most managers in the US think about incentivizing employees. Have you seen the movie Glengarry Glenn Ross? If not watch it now and come back. Done? OK remember the sales contest scene? Wont work here as a motivator. You cant reward individuals at all because it embarrasses them and makes others shamedjealous. Lets say you have  guys on a sales team Asan shows up early does all his followup calls uses a CRM to keep track of important clients and at the end of the year is probably at  quota. Bsan shows up on time handles things reasonably well overall and keeps track of clients in his own Excel sheet. By the end of the year hes at  quota. Csan shows up late frequently looks busy when he is in the office except when he is reading the sports news and seems to be out on calls but is in reality kicking back at the pachiko place or a coffee shop. At the end of the year hes at  quota?Your team is at  quota but you feel you should dish out reward and maybe punishment as well. Who gets rewarded and who gets punished in this case? Its not what you think. The answer is everyone gets rewarded if anyone. More likely theres no real reward at all because making quota is just whats expected. You cant actually punish much less fire Csan more on that later. You cant do something special for Asan either. The idea is that some people are good some are not so good but everyone as a team is supposed to do their best and help each other out. Reality isnt always that but you are probably supposed to act like the theory is the truth.So what about not being able to fire people? Labor law here is firmly on the side of the employee. You can reassign someone to a horrid location or sub division of the company you can refuse to give them any decent assignments at all but you cant really fire them. To get rid of someone who is a legal full time employee the company has to spend months or even a year trying to improve that employees attitude and results and there has to be documentation about this as well. All this requires the involvement of the HR department the employees line manager the division head and an HR rep and maybe even more people. Dont really expect the HR department to be eager to help in this at all. The right way to get rid of a full time employee here is to either bully them into quitting or pay them to go away. With contractors you have to pay them off early or just wait and not renew their contracts.When you say division director to me thats at least a department head job which can be one or tow ranks above line management. This means you probably wont have much day to day contact with the staff except line managers. By having zero language skills your direct report staff will know they can outright deceive you or do a campaign of lies of omissionlittle white lies with you. Also if you try to make changes to the existing Way Things Have Always Been Done they will likely resist you and in their minds you will be gone soon anyway unless you really are planning to be here for the long run and make that clear to them from day one.My suggestion to you is you spend every waking moment of the next two months in a complete submersion intensive Japanese language course.Note that most of the above applies to a general business and that if it turns out your job is managing Language Monkeys English Teachers things may be different.

You can also swap out the front child seat for a basket in the future. Im pretty happy with it my only complaint is I find myself maxing out the top speed sometimes so I wish there were more gears or they were spaced further apart. I usually leave it in top gear if the assist is on only on fairly steep hills will you need to downshift. Some tipsBridgestone ebikes are just rebadged Yamahas pas kiss gt angelino etc.  Try out the bike models you are considering. Not just the wife if you might ride it.

The one where people constantly mistrust each other and have this background level of mistrust and stress or the society that has a background level of politeness and trust?Japan in general is playing the prisoners dilemma where overall everyone cooperates every time.

This is controversial so well drop it entirely makes no sense as an approach to education it means youre effectively consigning yourself to turning out students who have no understanding of why things are happening in the world around them.This is exactly what happened to some degree in the UK in the s and s where in spite of the ongoing IRA campaign in the UK mainland the history of Britains involvement in Ireland was not included in the history curriculum. As far as many British people who grew up in that era were concerned they were being bombed on a regular basis for no reason  they had no context in which to understand what was happening and thus no framework to think about solutions or remedies. The fact that Irelands history as a colony was having an impact on contemporary politics ought to have made it into a core part of the curriculum just as the issues arising between China Korea and Japan ought to be core parts of the curriculum today.Having said that  I dont think the edits being requested by the Japanese government in this specific case are unreasonable since the textbook in question is notably obviously factually incorrect in its statements.,japan,cnqk2bn,5,t5_2qh2u

My grandfather was a German soldier in WWII and after the war he married a French woman. Her brother was fighting against the Germany army during the war. And still they became one family after the war. They sat at one table and my grandmothers family accepted my grandfather even though he was the former enemy.

ISIS knows this.So ISIS links the Japanese guy to the womans release.Jordanians apparently really hate that woman.  Her husband bombed a wedding fer Chrissakes killing women and children.But Jordanians also really want their pilot back and there is a notinsignificant public discontent in Jordan with their military and government attacking ISIS.  Folks may not like ISIS but they dont particularly want Jordan to be seen as fighting fellow Arabs alongside the West.  So Jordanians would probably go along with a trade the bitch for our pilot although they would not be at all happy with a trade the bitch for a foreign national who wandered into Syria on his own.Again ISIS knows all this.So link the womans release to Goto.

In Japan even the laziest American college student looks like a crazy devoted study machine.How the hell do Japanese doctors learn how to perform medicine?

3330305,0,t1_cp7u8n7,Incoming wall of text. Read it if you want to understand what on the surface may seem like a coldhearted and jaded response from mindkiller and other people with similar opinions.I dont want to totally speak for him but I think a big part of mindkillers point is that there are a lot of times Japanese people are really warm nice and polite because they feel obligated in the situation but if you get to their true feelings they are annoyed but also obligated to hide that. If you spend enough time in the culture you get an understanding for what kinds of situations cause the obligation feeling in others and how to avoid it so as not to inconvenience them.For example totally hypothetical if you sat down on a bench next to someone who was eating and talked about how hungry you were or even just looked like you hadnt eaten in awhile that person could feel pressure to give you some or all of their food. The normal Japanese thing to do would be to refuse such an offer and only accept it if the other person is persistent. Even then the Japanese person might be annoyed by the situation they were stuck in.Many foreigners dont understand all that and would just accept the first offer and think about how generous that person was never realizing the inconvenience they caused.This doesnt apply to every generous act of course. And Ive met many Japanese people who Im pretty sure genuinely enjoy going out of their way to help people  get involved etc... The thing is I only really started to feel confident in my ability to tell the difference after about  years living here. Now after  years and lots of close family level relationships with Japanese people I still only feel confident like  of the time about if Im correctly distinguishing between pure generosity and obligation it can be a mix often too.I also remember what it was like when I first arrived and naively thought every kind gift and overthetop help was pure spontaneous generosity.After living here this long call it jaded if you want you also see a bunch of shortterm foreigners running around causing implicit obligations all around to the Japanese they interact with. With friends and family coming to visit again and again you see them compliment how polite and generous people are while if you witness the situation you can see the reasons for the obvious social obligations they caused.So with all that said the assumption of most socially responsible longterm foreigners who hear stories from a shortterm foreigner about how generous the Japanese were when they subtly radiated signals of being in need of help... the assumption is going to be that you didnt yet learn to distinguish between Japanese obligation and generosity and that youre probably right sometimes and wrong other times about how much annoyance you caused or how genuinely kind the people around you were.And because its unlikely that you can accurately distinguish when you cause undue obligation its best to avoid the types of just looking at me you can see Im in need of help situations that cause them.Finally while you may have annoyed some people without realizing it overall Id say most Japanese people arent gonna feel it was a big deal and just feel like they had an interesting day. In the end you and they get interesting stories to tell.,japan,cp7vqvk,53,t5_2qh2u

The one from  BC or the more modern versions from around  BC?So your mirror that you make all these claims are already outside of the known timelines coming  years too late for Shinto and  years too early for Buddha in Japan.Want me to start pulling apart your statistics real quick too?

Shes told her mother her mum though because she knows what the score is. Her father my fatherinlaw is by no means what youd call a traditional dude far from it but this is one last holdover it seems. It can be difficult for boys and girls and men and women to just be dating. As soon as certain people find out they either need to commit or bail. Love hotels can only go so far in this regard. I can see in some ways its probably the path of least resistance to not bother trying to find anyone at all...On the other hand one of my wifes cousins has been dating a nice girl for a couple of years now with no trouble like that at all. She even came on the new years bender with the rest of the family at ojisans old uh acquaintances place.

4280968,0,t1_cs83fgw,gt This is dumb this only happens when the wage is variable.Why would anyone study or develop skills if there is no benefit?gtBased on what? Izakaya talk? Probably you dont have any data to support this. People who assume things without data make abysmal software. So lets see some data on that.Data? Have you used any Japanese software? It almost all sucks. Can you think of a single popular piece of software to come out of Japan thats not a game? Theres a reason why AndroidiOS have displaced Japanese smartphone OSs. How about Toyotas appalling code Toyotas developers used MISRAC and the OSEK operating system both good choices for a safetycritical realtime system. But then they ignored sidestepped or circumvented many of the very safety features they are designed to enforce. On a cyclomaticcomplexity scale a rating of  is considered workable code with  being the upper limit for some exceptional cases. Toyotas code had dozens upon dozens of functions that rated higher than . Tellingly the throttleangle sensor function scored more than  making it completely and utterly untestable. Toyota had more than  global variables. And in practice five ten okay fine.  no were done.  It is not safe and I dont need to see all  global variables to know that that is a problem Koopman testified. Toyotas failure to check the source code of its second CPU supplied by Denso even as executives assured Congress and NHTSA that the cause of UA couldnt be in the engine software He was critical of Toyota watchdog supervisor  software to detect the death of a task  design. He testified that Toyotas watchdog supervisor is incapable of ever detecting the death of a major task. Thats its whole job. It doesnt do it. Instead Toyota designed it to monitor CPU overload and Barr testified it doesnt even do that right. Barr also testified that Toyotas software threw away error codes from the operating system ignoring codes identifying a problem with a task.Some other fun reading   These problems are a result of issues wJapanese office culture that are pretty much common knowledge at this point. Decisions are often maid by managers who are at the top based on seniority not skill. They impose decisions based on antiquated knowledge and are followed blindly by the worker drones. Any semicompetent software engineer at Toyota would have known the throttle ECU was fucked and yet it stale made it into millions of cars.Programming is seen as grunt work that anyone can do. You can find job ads that say Liberal arts majors with no experience are welcome! We will teach you! And theyre paid k per year which is  or  of what a mid level software engineer would make at well known companies in the US. Smart people obviously pick more lucrative careers in Japan because the pay is garbage until you transfer into management in your s due to seniority of course. Mechanicalelectrical engineering are regarded a bit better so the smarter kids tend to do that or a career in law management etc.gtYeah and your little system of paying according to bizarre definitions of skill is working great right?Thats not how it works.

Things to note Finding an internship in Japan is quite hard mainly as the concept of an internship doesnt really exist in Japan and hence very few companies offer them. Id guess your chances would be higher at international companies that know the concept from their home branches.    Also switching from a student visum to a visum allowing you to do an internship is quite tedious and requires tons of paperwork especially also from the company hiring you. If you apply at a place where theyve had interns previously theyre likely familiar with the process and might help you. Otherwise the process might seem too daunting for a company such that they wont bother hiring you. Get the paperwork process started well in advance as it can take a while to get everything together and to also get it processed.    good luck,japan,cs8za3l,5,t5_2qh2u

4730474,0,t3_3fox3l,gt I thought everyone was agreed and there is no end of evidence that the Japanese military was involved in the recruitment!Youre correct that only the most deluded net uyoku would claim that the military had absolutely no involvement in their recruitment.AFAIK Abes position is that the military was not directly involved in the coercive recruitment  of the comfort women in any systematic fashion in other words that soldiers werent kicking down doors and abducting women. The word systematic is important because most Japanese revisionists acknowledge that some women were indeed kidnapped they just dismiss these as criminal acts by individual soldiers rather than being indicative of official policy.Youre absolutely right that the medias reporting on the comfort women issue is abysmal. The problem is that the comfort women system was extraordinarily diverse with the experiences of individual comfort women running from voluntary prostitutes who lived in comfort and made fortunes to those who were kidnapped kept in horrible conditions and ultimately murdered the average comfort womans experiences fell in between these extremes obviously. Unfortunately that kind of complicated narrative doesnt really suit any of the actors involved in the public dialogue over the issue not the media the Japanese revisionists or the Korean nationalists.,japan,ctqtgli,8,t5_2qh2u

You cannot judge people or countries for their actions based on facts that were unknown to them at the time they committed those actions.they were aware of the possibility i guess my biggest gripe is why did truman decide  to leave stalin off the potsdam proclamation on july th at that point some of the cabinet were still trying to use the soviet union as a intermediary. leaving stalin out of that or even stalin staying out of that strung the japanese cabinet along letting them believe that there was still a chance of negotiations via the USSR.i have to wonder how things would have turned out if stalin had signed im pretty sure he didnt because he wanted to suprise invade allover the placealso what is the goal of discussing the neccessity of the bomb? the necessity at the time or the truth of the matter? do we strive to say it was justified? or do we strive to understand that they Thought it was justified and necceseryand that is ok. nothing can change that but the truth of the matter knowing everything is that it was not.,japan,ctuj40g,1,t5_2qh2u

OK heres an office story for yaMost jobs have a probation period. Mine was three months. About two months in there is a farewell party for a senior manager. Friday night Im working late but rock up to the party just as its winding up. Manage to squeeze a beer on the company in before the tab closes. Lots of colleagues are drunk. Now Im pretty new so just chilling and then the CEOs PA who speaks great English comes up  and says hi starts chatting all good. Im new right so Im like ah cool good opportunity to ease into the party. People are staying after and buying their own drinks so as Im easing into my nd beer the PA keeps chatting to me even when I try to talk to other people. She has had a few. And she is kinda cute but Im in a pretty solid relationship so I just be polite. Then she ups the kinetic and things get obvious to the point where other colleagues have to be taking notice. I start to seriously try and back off physically move away and try to talk to other colleagues. But she keeps a coming. Its flattering and all but I dont want other colleagues thinking Im the one initiating this. Anyway I manage to escape and make the rounds and then head home after an hour or so. Phew. In follow up parties or at work at the office these advances were never repeated. And we still often work together without issues. I think it was a test. Knowing our CEO I think he told her to hit on me to figure out what kind of guy I was. As she is totally married and stuff kids etc. Ive thought about asking was it all a test? But I dont think I ever will nor will I ever find out... Anyway thats the best I got hah. Except that one time the printer took aaaaages to print. Craziness. ,japan,ctxq9r0,1,t5_2qh2u

Also its a source of diplomatic tension. Add to that that the current prime minister said his future generations should not have to keep apologizing compare this to Germany which has taken full responsibility for the Nazi actions during WWII and also hes pushed through a bill to remilitarize Japan which brings back memories of these atrocities and imperial Japan. Its a big deal in those countries. Also when Conservative party leaders visit the grave sites of war criminals or try to deny what they did in the past it upsets everyone in the region and it makes the news.

4879873,0,t1_cu9ebpw,Lived in  different apartments in  different cities over the course of  years. Never once did we have any issue getting an apartment. When it comes to jobs Ive spoken to many Japanese people about the lack of foreigners in many Japanese companies and the rationale is simple. Language and culture. Most foreigners can pick up casual Japanese easily but a profound understanding of the language mixed with an understanding of Japanese social cues is rare. Think of who gets promoted in any company in the world most of the time they have a strong command of the language. Culturally most of Japanese hiring takes place directly out of university. Most Universities dont have nonJapanese degrees and most students at them are from the Japanese school system. Therefore the majority of hiring at companies is going to be domestic and any foreigner coming into a nonspecialized position is going to be there by necessity and then lack seniority over peers who have been there since graduation.Combine the two factors and you see where foreigners can have difficulty getting a job. Japan is definitely too rigid when it comes to many cultural practices and the KoreaChinaJapan vitriol definitely becomes quite racist but Westerners are generally treated very well.

In turn he has a lot of muscular friends from a local MMA gym near where he lives.  We all went swimming one time and I felt like a white jelly doughnut among them haha.  Being buff is not as mainstream Id say but its not unheard of by any means.  I go to a public gym and Id say about  of the guys there are decent size I am lucky to be able to go during nonpeak hours so I only get a small sample size at once.  There is a park near my house that has a few things for bodyweight exercise and I do see people making use of it every once in a while but not really for extended periods.  There are more people jogging around the m paved road next to it.  No one looks twice at me exercise there because it has exercise park right in the name.  I dont go there much anymore since I found the public gym Fairly lacking in the machine department but has a solid set of weights for free weight lifting so if you are creative you could make up the difference.  Im by no means a power lifter body builder or anything like that but two each of    kg  kg increment and    kg  kg increment is plenty for me to get a workout in terms of dumbells.  According to my friend a lot of people are intimidated by him but to be fair its probably more the way he presents himself than his actual physique tank top backwards hat excitable personalityAnd as a final comment as others have mentioned the standards of beauty here is for slim guys.  Especially young guys these days.  To me the dreamy guy image in Japan looks almost like a woman.  The figure skating sensation Yuzuru Hanyu is a good example.  Many of my female friends also say they prefer slimmer guys.  So to get buff you really need a driving reason competing in sports that require bulk etc or else you are just doing it for nothing.

5608854,0,t3_3rvn7m,Am I the only one that notices the irony of all these videos that complain about being treated like a foreigner or being spoken to in English is that these vloggers spend most of their time communicating via YouTuberedditjBlogsetc in English to other foreigners?The Japanese know something that these people are not selfaware of foreign residents want it both ways. They want the right to switch into Japanese when they feel like it. To have a Japan experience by communicating with a Japanese person. They are no different from the Japanese person that comes to them looking for an Eikaiwa experience while in Japan.In other words theyre hypocrites.In the st century thanks to modern technology anybody can live quotes intended in a foreign country without really living in it.The Japanese that these people deal with know this they hear the group of four gaijin go into the restaurant speaking English constantly only to switch into Japanese even if its good Japanese to order from the menu then get microaggressed because the waitress heard them speaking English constantly and assumed  correctly  they were more comfortable in English so she tried switching them into English then they switch back to English after they are done ordering.But wait! you say. Because theyre in Japan theyre not really having Japan experiences. Theyre integratedassimilatedimmersed in Japan. Its all Japan experience for these gaijin living in Japan. Therefore they deserved to be treated as if they want to be a participant in real Japanese society!And my argument is they may say that and they may actually believe it themselves but the reality isMOST GAIJIN MEANING NOT A EAST ASIAN CHINESE KOREAN ETC FOREIGN RESIDENT OF JAPAN IN JAPAN REGARDLESS OF THEIR JAPANESE ABILITY SPEND ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE lt OR lt. HOURS PER DAY OF THEIR DAY INTERACTING IN JAPANESE. AND THEY PROBABLY WOULDNT LIKE THEYD GO NUTS LIVING IN JAPAN IF THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO COMMUNICATE IN JAPANESE AND CONSUME PURE JAPANESE TEXT amp VIDEO gt OF THE DAY LIKE AN ASSIMILATED MEMBER OF SOCIETY.Im willing to bet that if you opened the browser history of these people then calculated the time their minds and fingers spent in English talking to foreigners by adding up the time spent reading watching and communicating with English people you would find that the average English nativeESL Japan foreign resident spends in excess of  of their day in the Gaijin Digital Bubble.Ive done this test on other foreigners who lived in Japan. They would deny that they spent so much time In English While In Japan. I would then open up their web browsers promising not to judge them for prn for both work and home look at their email look at their Netflix and video viewing history and look at their mail and message history.The interesting thing about this test is... ones Japanese ability doesnt seem to be connected. There are gaijin in Japan who are from most peoples standards fluent yet they only use their Japanese for one thing to consume Japanese experiences a la carte at their own convenience while in reality living their lives in English in Japan.Out of the six people I have looked at all of them were in IT they spent over  of their waking day  hours of the day in Japan in English mode. They may think theyre living their lives in Japanese in Japan. But thats because theyve never taken the time to be aware of how much of their lives are spent online dont forget to include your smartphone! and how much of that online time is in English.And dont forget for every minute you spend reading or watching or hearing something in English your mind is probably spending ten minutes thinking about that English experience you just had. So even when your ears and ears are not glued to English your head is still thinking about the English you just used long after the moment passed.Like the folks in the Matrix these people spend a huge part of their day in a virtual English world which frankly even though they know its fake is more comfortable for them. Except the folks in the Gaijin Digital Bubble are worse than the Neo and the blue pill folks because the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar spent most of their time in the real worldHis body may physically be in Japan but his mind is in the Gaijin English Bubble. People like this guy get pissed because he thinks the Japanese are using him for English eikaiwa practice time. But hes no different from them hes using them for Japanese practice time. Hes looking for a Japanese language experience to consume... like a cheap fast food chain hamburger... before he returns to watching making his English language YouTube video.He doesnt get to be treated like a Japanese just because he flips into Japanese mode at his convenience. Native Japanese people dont flip into Japanese mode to consume Japanese experiences. They STAY in Japanese mode.Japanese are no dummies they know that after the foreign English resident is done talking to them for a few minutes theyll spend the next hour doing something in English. In Japan. even if its just thinking inside their head.If he wants to be treated like a Japanese person that is being spoken to in Japanese he needs to act like a Japanese person. That means Japanese all the time. Not just when its convenient.,japan,cwsbzla,9,t5_2qh2u

The current PM likes to say how Japan is a rich country and all should learn from it yet the poverty gap increases ever more. He brags how hes leading Japan out of the Lost Two Decades yet the catastrophic snowball hes preparing for the future generations is obnoxious. Our national debt already surpassed  trillion US dollars so to fix that he wants to increase consumption taxes yet lower corporate tax increase the amount a person has to pay for pension yet cuts budget and reallocate it to fund My Number system.A fool would say gaman gaman but when all this shit explodes right in front of his face will he still keep faith on the people he didnt even elect in the first place or will do something about it?Theres a reason why movements like SEALDs exist and why they arent gathering the attention they needed.,japan,cxa3byf,1,t5_2qh2u

6007231,0,t1_cy6skxg,Frankly having just left Japan after a year and quarter of living there I think the stereotypes of Japan of being conformist or sexist or any number of other things are extremely sketchy models. I see my own country the USA as being far more sexist than Japan. In fact even in the safest small towns in the USA women will refuse to walk alone after dark... whereas in Japan women and children are out late at night by themselves in all areas of the city. I found that so refreshing to see. Racism in Japan? Im sure it happens... being a white person I wouldnt have caught the brunt of that as much... but here I am in New Zealand and on the South Island it just shocked me the amount of racism that you see around you even on first glance walking through a grocery store where people of different ethnic backgrounds refuse to look at each other. Meanwhile on the face of it New Zealand has such a progressive electoral system and people always seem to hope that Maori can become a bona fide official second language.The bottom line is that people criticize their own society and those criticisms get a lot of airtime overseas in the foreign language mass media. However the fact a story like that has legs has no bearing on the level of that problem in that country as compared to how it might exhibit itself in other cultural contexts halfway around the world.,japan,cy72usf,5,t5_2qh2u

Youre suspecting that the chicken and egg roughly coincide in their appearance. Im saying that the egg conservative rebound in the mindset of Japanese voters aka s and over segment totally came first and there by set the stage for the chicken Abe to get where he is now.I may have unfairly grouped you in with others who definitely do believe that Japans current conservative rebound is all some machination by Abe et al. and I will apologize about that. I wanna explain my position on Abe Im neither for him nor against him in terms of partisan hackery. However Im just as disgusted by Abe haters who stack up lies about him as I am with ultra nationalists who stack up lies that support their agenda as well.Concerning your list   Abe doesnt deny the existence of comfort women neither does he deny the managing role that the military played in the war time brothel issue.  What he does deny is that IJN soldiers were issued orders to go out on trucks and abduct women at gunpoint across the board theres a massive difference in liability. This is an intellectual matter that is debated in academia  ie. the recent book by Park Yuha Comfort Women of the Empire amongst others. Whether it be about the cold war or WW revisionismaka history denialism doesnt equate to antiintellectualism.  Unilateral remilitarization is another point what unilateral remilitarization? Whether it be the new security law or increasing the military expenditure budget by . still less than  GDP its all done in coordination with the USA and to some extent AustraliaPhillipinesIndia as well as the countries that are invested in the F program.  antidemocratic? Democracy is rule by the majority after the DPJ failure the LDP won by a land slide which is why Abe is able to push laws through the lower and upper houses. The opposition lost badly democratically. You may not like it I personally despise it but this is how democracy works under a representational system. The media portrayed it as though the majority of the people were opposed to the security law which totally debunks the claim that Japanese media is totally under LDP control but in reality the LDP backed politicians have won regional elections and voters polls since then ie. Kochi Prefecture election Fukui Mayorial election.   bad economic policies and coziness with industry  I totally agree with you.

6338084,0,t3_42eovm,Japanese people are very soft feminine reserved type of people. They dont have enough social energy they like to take things slow. I know Im generalising but this is the gist of it. Why else is hikikkomori such a big thing? Why else has the whole interaction of sexes been commodified in Tokyo?You have to understand they are socially different. They dont take energy they give it. If they are empowered enough over time they will slowly change but it also plays into the fact that they are an island. An island my friend isolated for centuries to wander its quite beautiful if you think about it where do you think the inspiration for Mangas like attack on Titan claymore came from? Its the whole insider outsider Ive experienced this in the England. Im born here but my parents are south Asian. So they have a similar experience they have a lot in common the English and Japanese the main difference between the two Id say is that the Japanese have honour and are honourable its one of their traits.Honour is a double edged sword in that it is empowering and galvanizing. But it can lead to social norms such as public shame and humiliation to high degrees. The point is its all linked. And I think you hit the nail on the head its not racism its xenophobia.

6350981,0,t1_czbhv4o,Thats a very interesting point to bring up. I remember watching dramas and tv shows back in    and always wanting to get my hands on a Japanese cell phone. Especially with my Nokio brick of a phone being such a boring disappointment as you mentioned with your phone having those phones that glowed and twinkled and had that fancy camera seemed like top of the line prize.I remember going to a convention in  and seeing Docomo having a booth there showcasing these Japanese cell phones and the talks of potentially bringing them over to the North American market. I really didnt see anything much after that.... Probably because at that point Blackberries were everywhere and Japanese cell phones couldnt be much a rival with Blackberries and iPhones out in the market by that point.I think the problem with the cell phones is that by the time Japanese companies Sony Sharp etc even considered the notion of importing their cell phones Apple had already dickpunched them with the iPhone. Sharp especially is notorious for pulling out of the international market and pretty much staying domestic. Which is a shame because IIRC they were one of the leaders of the Japanese cell phone game and could have made a killing with those fancy phones and through that expansion could have learned and become a decent rivalry. Then again apparently the company was pretty resistant to change or new ideas. Which goes back to the refusal of taking risks.,japan,czbjb54,3,t5_2qh2u

So she reacted by making the narrative the complete opposite of what I was in order to reclaim her crown. She also though I was banging every girl on staff except for her.Thing is Im gay. Ha.

7161331,0,t3_4djx53,Do you find it weird that someone will say my Japanese friend or the things they claim their Japanese friend says?Japan is an enigmatic place to most westerners. Whats more very few Japanese people speak English so what little information westerners get out of them is treasured as canonical Japan. You get a lot of stuff from subculture and counter culture this way since strong English skills in Japanese people are usually associated with Japanese people in subcultures and counter cultures. Basically Yoko Ono types. Some are really interested in introducing traditional Japanese culture to the world but are usually still eccentrics. Plus since we dont see a lot of differing opinions from the few Japanese that are willing to learn English AND talk about Japan we treat this stuff as actual information on Japan. So much so that many people will think every Japanese person knows how to tie an obi or what the proper etiquette for tea ceremony is etc. The reality is that not every individual Japanese person is an authority on Japanese culture especially since very few Japanese persue their culture from an academic or detail oriented standpoint something we in the West love to do. So with no other option we depend on the Japanese friend for everything. Is wearing a kimono while white racist? My Japanese Friend says no. Should you eat nigiri with hands or chopsticks? My Japanese Friend says either is fine. Forget SEALDs member Taro the Yamaguchi based traditional carpenter Kosuke the Taisho era history otaku Megumi the sushi chef Kiyohiko and the former Imperial Palace employee Junichi. We have My Japanese Friend to go by for all of it. ,japan,d1s6acr,2,t5_2qh2u

7263120,0,t1_d23r330,I can only speak from experience in the voice acting industry but in voice acting trade schools basically they give you samplemock scripts which you practice at home then the teacher will ask each student to stand up and recite it in front of the whole class depending on the school class size can vary from  people. In most cases theres not enough class time for everyones turn so there are times when you are literally paying just to sit there. Most of the time the teachers dont give very good feedback i.e. not technical advises andor the points they make are very obvious.Random side note for voice acting nowadays they tend to raise idols rather than the traditional behindthescene actors. Meaning they judge highly on age and physical appearances for both genders. Its a very competitive industry.Continuing my point...A lot of times these schools do not filter the students they accept so you will have classmates who are there just because they are anime fans instead of people who are actually hard working and passionate about their work. For voice acting if youre really serious about pursuing your best bet is to train yourself well and audition for voice acting agencies. If they think youre good enough or you have potential theyll either let you into their training school tuition costs around  yen to  yen a year. This saves you at least two years of tuition with trading schools which imo is really a waste of time and money  not very educational since the teachers are usually just voice actors who cannot make enough money for living solely on voice acting...Once youre in the agency training school youll have to audition again at the end of the year to see if they want you in their agency. If you get accepted as Junior youll again have to pay a similar amount for the years youre there as a junior... if youre lucky you can get some small roles as a junior. Depending on your connectionperformance you may get accepted into their agency.I know people who have been in Aoni and NichiNare for years  years as trainie some juniors and never landing any promising roles. I myself was in a pretty well known agency and it really is honestly a lot nicer and glamourous on the surface. On the other hand I do know a few people who have somehow made it into the industry successfully but they are still struggling some end up failing to continue their dreams.But again I can only speak from my own personal experience. The path is not an easy one but if it is something you really want to do no matter what then there really is no stopping you. You really have to experience it yourself to understand. Besides if you are good enough there is always a chance that you will succeed.Anyway sorry for the long reply. I dont want to sound like the party pooper guy destroying other peoples dreams. Its just Ive met so many people with so much potential have their lives wasted away its not something I would recommend lightly.,japan,d23rkjl,2,t5_2qh2u

They introduced IC card payment recently for price flexibility as the tax will be increased once again and the arcades will make big deficit if they keep charging  coins.You also seem to be interested in crane games and yes you are right its an expensive hobby but soon you will notice a few things some days are better there are certain times when its best to play different staff adjust the machines differently the popularity of the product and its release the type of the game the version of the machine etcIf you have any specific question feel free to ask.

So I guess the relatively strong support from the Japanese already takes the possibility of future failure into account.Whats interesting about this deal is that the support comes from both sides of the political spectrum.  Its not common that LDP supporters and DPJJCPSDP supporters more or less agree on an issue especially if its coming from the Abe administration.I feel that some people on the left side especially those who are influential are slowly changing their stance.  Prof. Park Yuhas book Comfort Women of the Empire was published by Asahi Shimbun Shuppan in Japan and received the AsiaTaiheiyou Shou   award which is run by Mainichi Shimbun.  When the lawsuit and backlash against Park Yuha happened in South Korea last year some Japanese on the left side publicly announced support for her.

Its far more related to the base issue than it is related to Japanese who get married abroad and bring their spouses back to Japan.  If there were no US bases in Okinawa this guy would have almost certainly never come to the country and this would have never happened.If this man had not been deployed to Japan as a marine this crime would have never occurred.  The base is what brought him to Japan his deployment to the base created the opportunity to marry a local and the base is what provided him with a work opportunity to stay in the country.  While the crime is not related to the more narrow issue of the fairness of the SOFA it is directly related to the US base.  ,japan,d3ha5n7,2,t5_2qh2u

In case of Japan the relationship between the government borrower and its citizens renders is like a son borrowing money from his father. If in any way the investors get their pennies sacrificing the fate of the government the only thing happens is that those money will be circulating within the Japanese market because again the majority of those investors are Japanese.As for the Bloomberg video youd better check the currency market more often. After the Bank of Japan decided Quantitative Easing in  Yen did jump from  yen per USD to  yen per USD and then what happened? Had it kept gone to  yen as the videos socalled expert says?

Im currently applying via the embassy route so i probably dont know much more than you but as for emailing professors theres really not much you can do if they dont email back. I only emailed six and four emailed back which seems like luck more than anything. Did you tailor the email specifically for each professor or send out a mass email? And also you can download something like yesware to see if they even open it.    As for the university recommendation my girlfriends dad is a professor at a Japanese university and I might know a little more about that. At his university basically they have a point system and whoever has the most points gets the universitys recommendation. Coming from a partner university is worth a lot of points apparently but its not absolutely required. I have no idea if this is how it works at other universities though.    Also does anyone who has been through this process know what kinds of questions they ask at the interview?

The unstated conclusion is that it should be or that it needs to be or that Japan would be better off if it were. Perhaps instead the question should be how Japan succeeded so remarkably without internationalisation or a proper kind of tertiary education. And by extension how ROK Taiwan and now China have done the same. I guess he does come back to this later when he mentions internationalisationglobalizationso maybe it is the case that more STEM graduates and not internationalised cosmopolitan graduates would be more beneficial to an economy in a globalised world.He mentions a test on intercultural sensitivity as a measure of progress towards internationalisation... Aside I wonder how Trump supporters or those who voted leave would score on that test? He says they did prepost assessment to check for improved intercultural sensitivity but does not go on to compare that result with similar prepost testing of international programs in other countries. The assumption is that Japan is not doing very well but theres no info on other presumably more international countries having scored better on this sensitivity test.As for not being able to transfer from one uni to another thats the whole basis of my schools  program probably an outlier!. Well over  students matriculate every April as third year students who graduate two years later with a degree. Most are Chineseforeign but there are also some jstudents from other juniversities who come in on the same track.Sanseido is the textbook company Shiseido is the cosmetics company.Mention that Juku are necessary Our kids never set foot in a juku and they had friends who did whose scores went down.No mention at all of the recent generous tobitate money thats now available for study abroad.Jobhunting  theres a wellknown job fair every November in Boston where Japanese companies try to recruit Japanese who are studying in north america. Companies DO want bilinguals. US companies who have a jpresence are also there.Just soooo many stereotypes of juniversities tossed out.  Students have zilch input on curriculum  AGREED.Its not until late in the QampA that a questioner brings up the elephant in the room uni in Japan as in US are producing the kind of graduates that companies want.

While we might have many backup plans being translator returning to SG to work in ministry etc the truth is getting into JP Morgan or Google is gonna be very hard regardless. I cant speak for graduate but I know that going to a good undergrad will negate your bad high school. I dropped out from one of the bottom JCs after all and thats pretty damn bad. Graduate is only  years long so its kinda different and Im not sure. ,japan,d4xkvq8,1,t5_2qh2u

Young people can understand English but are shy and are not confident to speak it. People are super helpful and will show you where something is if you are lost. I would recommend staying at a hostel where there are Englishspeaking staff so they can give you maps and recommendations! Theres English on the subway stops as well so you will know where to get off. Costs totally depends... I would say  a day if you stay at hostels and eat cheap meals noodles convenient store food conveyor belt sushi. The biggest costs are accommodation and transportation. Transport between cities is quite expensive by train but you should experience it because it is a huge part of Japanese culture! You can also get the Japan rail pass which pays for itself within two uses pretty much. Buses are also cheap but take much longer.

Earl Kinmouths The Self Made in Meiji Japanese Thought From Samurai to Salary Man is excellent book on it and if you can find it I would highly recommend it as it will introduce you to the history of this thought process and demonstrate its decidedly Western roots. Unfortunately it seems to be out of print so your only chance may be at a university library.Someone here suggested Fukuzawa Yukichi. I would hardly call him a classical philosopher he died in  but he was one of the forerunners of proliferating this kind of thinking and is definitely important figure in trying to contextualize Meiji era Japan and the march towards imperialism. ,japan,d7jebi8,1,t5_2qh2u

Mostly  day hikes in the Kansai region Yakushima Japan Alps.Backcountry activities are a very popular past time there and its not unusual to see groups of grandmas in remote corners summiting a peak. Trails are well maintained and theres usually Japanese signage. Some hikes have overnight staffed huts with hot water sometimes w hot baths! that you can pay to stay at while other ones just have simple designated unmanned free campgrounds.In general for these types of hikes most Japanese fall in the lightultralight backpacking philosophy which is reflected in Japanese gear manufacturers. Perhaps youve heard of Montbell famous for their ultra lightweight down jackets and sleeping bags?You can find backcountry shops in major cities and they carry the full range of things youll need packs stoves gas canisters sleeping bags boots rain shells snow shoes crampons stuff sacks dehydrated food energy bars etc. but probably in brands youre unfamiliar with.

9413200,0,t1_d992wqa,Japan imported and produced massive amounts of cocaine and heroin following WW. Virtually all was forvdistribution in occupied areas throughout SE Asia. They imported hundreds to thousands kilos of pure cocaine from Germany and other European namely Dutch producers in levels magnitudes larger than any possible legitimate domestic medical use.  Additionally Japan imported raw coca directly from South America and produced it in their occupied colonies following the Dutch example in Java and later taking possession of their Dutch plantations when they invaded and took control of the region. At one time Japan had a half dozen major firms refining cocaine including some of the largest industrial firms.   While opium was a consumed in much larger quantities Japans distribution of cocaine throughout SE Asia was on a scale previously unmatched and only surpassed in the s with the global resurgence of cocaine. Heroin too was refined and distributed widely. An often overlooked aspect was that for the first time ever cocaine and heroin were being consumed largely in injectable form. The Japanese Army oversaw injecting stands where customers could pay and be directly injected with the drug of their choice. This was revolutionary in both efficiency and addiction.   Opium was consumed en masse through traditional inefficient smoking something which had been commonplace in SE Asia for generations under colonial rule by the various Europeans namely the British and Dutch. But massive consumption of cocaine heroin and morphine via injection was an entirely new and devastating phenomenon.   Japan was singled out as the primary nation engaged in illicit drug activities by the League of Nations by the early s and during the s most of their activity wasnt officially recognized by the government to avoid international repercussions but they only continued to expand their operations.   Little of this has ever received scrutiny but as Japanese war crimes in WW have been largely ignored and most documentation destroyed combined with Japans postwar hardline policy on drugs that lack of awareness should come as no surprise.   So while generations of opium addiction brought about by the European powers and again from the Japanese is undoubtedly a massive factor in SE Asias cultural attitude towards drugs the lost generation prior to WW was a new modern take on drugs and colonialism.   Cocaine only was used again to systematically undermine social structures while funding armed conflicts in the s with the American crack cocaine boom.,japan,d996t81,5,t5_2qh2u

9531235,0,t3_5b72st,I am doing a PhD in Computational Chemistry in Japan at the moment so I can provide some insight here. To begin with I am studying here with a MEXT scholarship so it covers my tuition and provides a monthly stipend which is slightly larger than my expenses but nothing too much. Before coming to Japan my language ability was nonexistent but Ive been studying it at the universityprovided language courses. It takes some time away from research but at least I can understand people and read some some kanji now. It helps a lot on a daytoday basis but is not necessary for your research. Maybe  of lab mates understand written English  of them are able to speak in English and maybe  are fluent. Personally since everyone is working on their own projects with groups of maybe  people per project it isnt necessary to be able to talk to the others so I dont. I am also quite introverted so I dont seek out conversations anyways. Group meetings are  in English but if someone is giving a talk and havent prepared an English version they let me know so I can then skip it and not waste my time.Working conditions the lab is crowded. There are maybe  people in a lab where you get maybe  m of personal space so it is far from perfect. Also Japanese people dont quite understand the concept of quiet lab and when it gets crowded they will usually start talking and laughing. The critical mass when it gets out of hand and becomes extremely disturbing and annoying is  people. As for the working hours  nobody works more than  hours a week. On weekends the labs are empty. You are free to adjust your schedule to fit your hobbies personal preference and whatever as long as you can make to the group meetings. Ive personally changed my schedule to early morning so I can get to the lab at  and have  hours of nice quiet time to do my stuff. The afternoon time is for mindless and boring things. Ive heard some horrible things about working conditions in public universities especially the topranking ones where the hours are awful and the labs are even more crowded with  students per professor so it varies greatly. I would advise to get in contact with your adviser and find out about all those things before even applying. If you dont know who you would work for it is possible to get assigned an adviser by MEXT itself when you are approved by the university and the ministry I would strongly advise to rethink it. Research It varies a lot depending on your adviser of course. I have met my adviser previously before coming to Japan at a conference so I already knew what to expect. The quality of research is really nice there are a lot of collaboration and competition going on with labs in Europe and the U.S. some other labs in Japan. A lot of Japanese academics have problems with spoken English but if you combine basic English with basic Japanese it is not too difficult to carry out a conversation. All scientific meetings are in Japanese. Same with summer schools so I miss out on those too. There are a lot of Japanese academics in the global scientific community that are well known produce a lot of innovative research and who collaborate with labs worldwide. Also in my case the computational resources are way better out here since we have our own cluster in the basement. No need to do the research proposals to get some computational time and no hard limits on the duration of the jobs. That allows us to do computations that run for months and other groups are unable to do because of all the bureaucracy with regards to computational resources.For me the biggest issue out here is actually the conditions in the lab. During the summer everyone keeps a sweater in the lab and cranks the AC to sub degrees. During the winter the opposite  they heat it up to high s. The lighting everywhere is horrible too. I have not felt my eyes hurting in a workplace like they do now for a long time. Most of their buildings have nohorrible natural light too. Japan is also insanely loud everywhere. There are people who shout at you from their sushi restaurants when walking down the streets the old people shouting at you from each driveway of a construction site even if there is no machinery coming out shop staff shouting at you their welcomes even if you were looking at the same section for few minutes the train stations with their echo and insanely loud announcements every  seconds. It slowly but surely drains your remaining mental energy every night while commuting home after long day in the lab. Right now I am in process of researching which earbudsnoisecancelling headphones to get that are most efficient in drowning out voices.Aside from these drawbacks for me personally it is a wonderful country and most of the people are amazing. The weather outside is lovely and the food is wonderful. So I have mostly positive experience here and after traveling around for a little bit I found the northern part of Japan to be lovely and I wish I could get a permanent position there. So to sum up if you know your future adviser and how strong he is in the field find out about the conditions in the lab and go for it. I think the MEXT application deadlines are in Spring so you have some time to go over the details. It also helps if you have some Japanese hobbies  Ive been playing kendo for some time and I met a lot of very nice people that way out here as well. Oh and if you try to go without the MEXT scholarship the PhD programmes are paid. In my university it is I think  Eur per year for tuition  living expenses so it is totally not worth it when you get paid to do research and get the degree in Europe.,japan,d9nxb9u,3,t5_2qh2u

The same thing that the Android phone makers have done.Except what the Android phone makers havent done is make the two play nice together. A Japanese iPhone  can have credit cards from outside Japan inside Japan and Suica all on the same device. With an Android phone you have to choose international market phone that supports Android Pay or a Japanmarket phone that supports FeliCa payment or swapping phones when you come and go. gtAndroid Pay is more about retailers accepting it. Oh no its very much a device thing. If the NFC chip doesnt support the full set of functions then it cant do Android Pay and the NFCFeliCa chips dont have that. Googles website boils it down even further it says any phone with NFC and Android . or higher should work implying that the phones with higher versions of Android and dont work with Android Pay dont have proper NFC at all.gtApple Pay is Apple Pay in name only in Japan. The backend is being handled by another company.But you can have regular Apple Pay and Japan Apple Pay on the same phone and they do talk to each other. On Flyertalk users report that you can add money to an Apple Pay Suica with a credit card from outside Japan. Cant do that if the two parts dont talk to each other. And more importantly for me I can use the same phone to tap in the States Canada Japan and China. All my cards stored on one phone. Except Ill have to get a separate plastic card again instead of using Mobile Edy on my HTC phonegt It would be like trying to use a iPhone  for Apple Pay and getting mad because it doesnt work.That was a simile. I dont necessarily begrudge my Nexus X for not supporting FeliCa I paid the Project Fi special price for it so I dont expect the world of it. But if youre going to tell me the phone I bought has NFC I expect NFC payments to work.,japan,da6qg85,1,t5_2qh2u

9716203,0,t1_daapytb,I am glad to hear it! Japan experiences these things so often that making a huge deal of it is a waste of time until it becomes an actual largescale disaster. Unfortunate geographic placement to say the least.I am not in Japan at the moment and my Japanese isnt quite good enough to quickly or reliably translate bus schedules or media coverage of public transit.When I was in Kumamoto in April bus schedules continued as normal to my knowledge. Where roadsbridges were damaged or destroyed routes had to be amended or cancelled temporarily the Great Aso Bridge collapsed in its entirety but buses and taxi services continued to operate as normal otherwise. I actually was able to book a taxi drive all the way to Fukuoka so their operations were relatively undisturbed aside from a massive influx in business.As for trains they were shut down all across the prefecture until tracks and tunnels were surveyed and repaired where necessary. The shinkansen was shut down for nearly two weeks before reopening.I do not know how severe the damage is where you are but convenience stores may be seriously emptied out. I gave up almost immediately upon seeing a  person line extending onto the sidewalk when I walked to my local Lawsons for water. Recovering from this is going to involve a lot of waiting on your part! Be patient and it will pass.,japan,daaqe20,2,t5_2qh2u

9730175,0,t1_dacd7dm,There are a few reasons as to why it was banned though the most notable wereJapans awareness of the Spanish conversion in the Philippines. Jesuit Missionaries in the Philippines successfully made a colony through means of their religion and this was something that the new Shogunate felt was a threat to the integrity of Japan. They had a right to be wary of colonialism which was spreading with ridiculous fervour through SouthEast Asia. Similarly Christianity threatened the already brittle stability of the newly emerging Shogunate. Nobunagas fondness for missionaries was previously a state of contention amongst the political sphere during the Sengoku period though some regions particularly in Kysh shared this fondness. The Tokugawa Shogunate felt that the rise of Christianity amongst certain prefectures as well as the rise of the Ikkikki would lead to further political divides and disrupt national unity by sparking a religious excuse for civil war  which was incredibly likely as the Shogunate emerged quite tenuously.edit A Word,japan,dacgg3p,26,t5_2qh2u

But locking themselves away for years and decades isnt going to improve things.Im not sure that mental health treatment is much better elsewhere either.I dont think that there is a solution. It is society that is the root of their problem.However a final solution could possibly be found by resettling them.For example repopulate the villages that are emptying with likeminded hikikomori people. If they are of like minds then perhaps they may reach a mutual understanding within their community. A kind of balance so to speak. With careful planning it may be possible to select a viable breeding population that includes a balance of individuals workers and leaders. Well maybe not leaders it would likely need to be run as a sort of collective.

11501822,0,t1_dfyo05j,Its almost like bodegas and delis in NYC its not somewhere you go to stock up. Yeah you do less of this kind of shopping when you live in a car town. Like Ive only seen one  with a parking lot in Japan and that was in Osaka.  In Tokyo and NYC the population density is so high one or two square blocks could have more residents and workers than a small town in America. So you see way more cleaners and convenience stores at ground level than might make sense. To me I thought of Japanese convenience stores as a giant fridge a place to grab a drink a snack my packed lunch etc. Immediate wants and needs. ,japan,dfzqcb0,2,t5_2qh2u

11642786,0,t3_661ja3,I dont understand who the people that dont understand are  Japanese or foreigners? I believe you mean those living outside of Japan but it is not clear.I would add to the list the full extent of the Japanese Empire. I think most and I am speaking with Americans in mind only recognize Japans involvement in WWII to be limited to Pearl Harbor and varying degrees of invasion in China and Korea. I think that the SE Asia element such as the extent of their presence in the Philippines Vietnam Palau etc. is not often understood. I guess this is a historical thing but a firm handle on the enormity of the ambitions of the Greater East Asia CoProsperity Sphere would help people contextualize Japans postwar interactions with these nations. ,japan,dgfq1yb,1,t5_2qh2u
