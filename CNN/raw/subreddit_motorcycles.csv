4687,0,t1_ceeyqe4,Sure. The guys riding the bikes are not the owners of the bikes. Where me and you drive our bikes daily at least I do they have probably never driven it before. So first run is a feeling run. How does it feel how does it react. Is it a piece of shit thats going to break on me when I push it how do the handles and cables feel. And then theres third. First gear is too short its for getting away. Second gear is for getting up to speed then you have third fourth and fifth. Third is right in the middle. You have both acceleration and you have speed. Fourth and fifth are less powerful because the gear ratio is higher. So if youd do a run from close to idle to max rpm in fourth or fifth most of the times the bike would not even reach max rpm because it just cant handle the power. So unless youve got a beast of a machine with a sprocket setup made for torque instead of high speeds at high rpm fourth or fifth just wont cut it. Thats why third.The bike is a  Zundapp  it has been modded out of the ass just like a lot of people do over here. It has a brand new type of cylinder developed by one of the biggest suppliers in zundapp shit that is still around and the final results were . break horse power at the rear wheel with a nearly stock cylinder. Experts are saying that if youd put an calculated exhaust on it and do something to the porttimings of the cylinder you could easily squeeze around  bhp from it.,motorcycles,ceeyyks,6,t5_2qi6d

I prefer the refined versions of that generation and think that  was the best year for the GSXR. After that you really only see minor aerodynamic changes and slews of electronics which arent for me.There are definitely varying opinions on this but sportbike technology has been at a crawl if you eliminate the addition of things like ABS and stability control.

Gears are fun when youre doing some performance riding it gives a greater involvement in the riding and lets you pick your own revs and power band but in city traffic it becomes a pain in the butt.The same is true for cars a manual transmission in city traffic is a massive pain but when youre on the open road it makes driving more fun. You might consider upgrading the  to a  though for more power. Power is fun and it allows you to scoot out of the way if you see a situation developing.

137855,0,t3_1vnwu2,I have been riding motorcycles since I was   now in my short riding experience I have had  accidents all of which involved bad riding conditions. Age  Piaggio Zip cc wet riding conditions  went under a bus! mph. Age  Honda CBFcc riding on icyslippery roads  it was inevitable... mph . Age  Honda CBFcc mistook the intensity of a curve  straight through a wooden gate and into a field!  mph. Ago  Suzuki Bandit cc SA oil spillage on downhill swerve.. that is never going to end well.. mphI am a confident and safe rider I rarely go over the speed limit I ensure that the road conditions are of a suitable standard before opening the throttle and am constantly on high alert of other road users something you dont really feel the need to do after driving a car for a few years... you are absolutely right that it is a completely different experience than driving a car in my opinion it is so so worth it the feeling of pure freedom and flight has never been beaten and I am quite the adrenaline junkie!It is a well known and obvious fact that other road users find it more difficult to see motorcyclists I tend to keep to the mindset that every other driver  rider is out to kill me and if they decide to do it at that moment then I should be in a position that I could avoid it.Im not sure where youre from but go to a motorcycling school they will normally let you do a free hour ride around their circuit  yard just to see if you like the feel of riding!The thing is if you come off dont be scared as every experience you will learn something from it you may have a bruise you may break your kneecap but if you truly enjoy the experience of riding the bike then nothing will put you off.Buy the best gear you can afford it WILL save your life if you come off at any speed.Just about to jump on a Honda CBR r from the Bandit  test rode it yesterday and it rides beautifully!

139889,0,t1_ceublvb, Depending on the suspension travel and damping. Its likely that the bump was so hard that it maxed the rear suspension travel on the cruiser thus transferring all the impact to the body. On a supermoto this is not an issue since they have plenty of suspension travel. On a sportbike while you may or may not max it out its not a good idea to go over large bumps fast.  yes No if you do it properly. Upshifting is easy to do properly. Downshifting is very hard to do properly to the point where Moto GP guys have auto blippers to take over the task and I would definitely recommend the clutch for downshifting since you are not trying to maximize engine contact with the wheels Yes. On the SRR you have to get an optional package for this on the ZX it comes standard I believe. ,motorcycles,ceud35z,3,t5_2qi6d

Likewise from the bank perspective if your investment the debt held  isnt worth what you loaned it isnt something you can take from the debtor in the event they decide to stop paying. that is also why you can get a better rate from the bank on a car than a motorcycle.plus banks have a hard time collecting debt from dead men so they are not wont to loan them money for something they might die on.,motorcycles,cev2wim,1,t5_2qi6d

161592,0,t1_cewnmr7,Its not spring tension exactly. You get center of mass of the bikerider system up in the air by wheeling.  The mass of the system wants to move as little as possible conservation of momentum so will favor rotating around the center of mass.  If you can rotate it faster than it falls back to the ground due to gravity youll briefly be airborne.  As soon as the rear tire leaves the ground the center of mass starts accelerating due to gravity towards the ground.The rider probably does time his movement to coincide with the expansion of the rear suspension to aid in getting all that mass rotating.  Thats a lot of mass and if I wasnt seeing it I wouldnt think this would be possible.,motorcycles,cewu6qf,3,t5_2qi6d

183848,0,t1_cezcc6i,I know what you mean. Mine is the first bike I ever bought. I originally started on a gifted  Honda CX that maybe put out HP. I was going to buy the SR  but the dealer had a fully upgraded demo bike with km and Id still get a full warranty for half the cost of a new one so I jumped on it. I was initially worried that itd be too much bike for me but as the dealer said he was probably just trying to sell it If you dont want all the power dont open the throttle all the way.It was true enough but learning the feel of the bike was pretty scary at first. It stalls surprisingly easily in first gear if you dont give it enough gas off the line and the throttle is really sensitive.No regrets though. Ive grown accustomed to it and Im pretty sure Ill never need to upgrade to more bike. Plus I love all the attention it gets. If only winter wasnt so long in Canada.,motorcycles,cezdle0,3,t5_2qi6d

In my experience once they start to fail they go downhill pretty quickly.When you get it back from the shop get a feel for the chain when it is properly tensioned.  I tend to just check it with the toe of my boot once a week or so but its more accurate to use your hand and a clean rag even a ruler to make sure its within spec.

We had a long time to talk about life belief you name it and she was very adamant that she be cremated and that we spread her ashes in the places she loved. She was very concerned not to have a super expensive funeral because it wouldnt be for her anyway and thus itd be just a waste of money and real estate. We were shocked to find that some funerals can run into the tens of thousands and looking at the OPs posting Id bet including the value of the bike this one is wayyy up there. Hers cost just about  plus another  for an awesome memorial party. So we did just that. I got to do the honors of dividing up her ashes not as gross as it sounds putting it into individual baggies. I put  that we spread in the Gulf of Mexico about  miles offshore almost  spread in some botanical gardens and then a little bit is still left over for when we go back to the UK. We have pictures where we put her ashes and think of her probably more fondly looking at the pictures or visiting the places than we would have if she had some plot with a huge vault in the earth and a headstone. ,motorcycles,cf3r8lb,2,t5_2qi6d

227094,0,t1_cf49zkc,cc inline . Its a Honda CB. A cult bike. Theyre stupidly rare here in the USA. Its estimated less than  are still on the road in the USA today. I dont notice any issues not having fairings. No noisier than my last faired bike but my helmet is loud anyways. I prefer it this way for a street machine. Much easier to work on and a lot less dollars to be burnt if I drop or wreck it. After having one bike with fairings the only way ill own another with fairings is if its a race only bike in which I can actually utilize the aerodynamic advantage. Id rather not run them on a track bike because theres no competition at track days. I like it because it gives you the feel of an I engine without doing felony speeds in the blink of an eye like a cc will do. Its no slouch either. Gets to  in  seconds in nd gear and can bang out a low  high  quarter mile. Gets to its top speed of about  MPH damn quick. Top speed is more limited by aero. If it had a proper fairing that could cut through the air the engine feels like it has a lot more grunt in it. Handling is excellent of course. About the only things I dont like is its impossible to find parts for. But thats to be expected. So the only fault I can really give the bike is the tiny tank. . gallons including reserve. And with my heavy throttle hand that means Im pulling over every  miles to grab fuel before I hit reserve. ,motorcycles,cf4aart,1,t5_2qi6d

230095,0,t3_1wr2x3,Alright first of all I should clarify that you should take my opinion with a grain of salt because A Im a dirt bike rider by nature and have what is generally agreed to be poor taste in motorcycles and B my first and only street bike is  years old. Youre somewhat right as things get newer and as you switch to fuel injection theres generally more complex systems going on. There are plenty of bikes from the s s and s that are carbureted and thats easier to work on generally speaking. The concepts are still all the same though and assuming you get a new bike well say  years or newer you can do all the standard maintenance yourself provided nothing breaks like an ABS sensor or some shit. Even so buying an old bike can put you in a pit of constant repairs and there are a lot of technical advances like traction control ABS progressive suspension fairings that make modern bikes a lot different and better. ,motorcycles,cf4li9t,8,t5_2qi6d

297271,0,t1_cfbjhwz,gt No point increasing the disc size unless you increase the caliper pad area as well.Not at all. A larger diameter rotor gives you more braking torque. It is one of the reasons why Buell went with their Zero Torsional Load ZTL perimeter floating front disc brake system. The other reason was a weight savings by only needing a single disk due to the significantly better performance and by making the cast wheels lighter. But I agree that it is not the first thing I would do there are plenty of other things to do first. KLR owners who are not known for their propensity to spending heavily are fond of replacing the stock rotor with a larger one. They also replace the caliper but that is due to the fact that the original caliper wont fit over the new rotor without modifications so the caliper might as well be changed at the same time. ,motorcycles,cfbkth6,2,t5_2qi6d

The curves present far more and better information regarding the rideability and usefulness of the bike.Better still is a bunch of riders in controlled conditions all riding different bikes in a double blind test so they dont ride differently and then careful meticulous study of the raw data in order to possibly make a conservative generalized comment about how some very specific input generates a different output and how that subjectively changes things. BUT NO ONE DOES THIS because drama and conflict sell not BORING SCIENTIFIC RATIONAL.PS R and other RR bikes are onetrick ponies in the sense that they are built to get maximum power delivered to the racetrack and are builtdesigned with racing in mind very little consideration to street riding and street performance etc. Dont buy into the bigger is always better propaganda peak HP isnt all that its cracked up to be and as a statistic is almost meaningless especially if you are trying to get an idea of how the damn thing rides. For example you would get a far more meaningful answer for your question which bike is better if someone only discussed the steel used in the frames or the final gearing than trying to use just the peak hptorque to settle the debate. those numbers are such strong draws for people you can pretty much assume two things  theyre manipulatedfabricated and  they are not what you mention if you want people to take you seriously when you compare the bikes.TLDR numbers dont matter when actually riding the damn thing. Most riders cant use  of their bike and engines ability. Get past that and you can get to the point of needing to care about power.

Not that theyve fixed any of the ones Ive written about.A popular myth is that a strong permanent magnet will do the trick. This is complete nonsense since a magnet produces a constant D.C. field and can not change the inductance of the sensor loop nor can it in any way pull the frequency of the sensors oscillator ,motorcycles,cfetddg,2,t5_2qi6d

The other dealer had a heavily modified SRR as the only floor model and had me follow them around a short route.  The clutch was adjusted really odd it engaged less than half an inch from the bar causing me to stall more than once as well as the salesman when he went to put it away.  It also had an aftermarket exhaust not Akrapovic Brocks Performance  louder was the idea.  There were a lot of other mods that I dont recall but I do remember that the DTC and ABS lights were both on as in they were faultynot working.  It wasnt a very good show for the dealer as I didnt walk away knowing how an SRR rides I knew how a modified SRR without the DTC or ABS and with a funky clutch rides.  They were asking k for it which is close to HP territory k base  k comp.  They were asking k over MSRP for the HP though so theres that.

You can get fairly cheap kevlar jeans with knee armor off ebay regular jeans will melt off you like butter if you come off at any appreciable speed. Buy something cheap and underpowered for your first bike there is a good chance you will drop or come off it. Its a lot easier to learn on an underpowered bike it will be more forgiving of any screw ups. After a couple of months you will be craving more power dont give in and buy something powerful wait until you have put in a fair amount of hours on the small bike and are feeling very comfortable with riding. This is just my personal opinion Im a pretty cautious guy and I think taking your time learning on a slower bike is going to decrease your chances of coming unstuck. ,motorcycles,cfj26k9,2,t5_2qi6d

396260,0,t3_1ylh3u,I took a test ride on this bike but I ended up not getting it because im a poor college student.  Aprilia is the most reliable of the Italian bikes and they hold a ton a records.  I really liked the inverted forks on this model.If you have rode for over a year on something smaller I highly recommend this bike. If I remember correctly its a V which feels amazing in the middle of the power band which makes it a lot of fun on the twistys.  I much prefer this model over its competitor the Ducati Monster its more comfortable a little easier to work on and I find it more esthetically pleasing.  It does have less bottom end power though.  As far as questions its a  model and they will want it off the floor. Maybe ask them how low they have had it or if they have sold others like it.  Its not a very popular bike because either people love it or have no real feelings towards it.  Ask them their personal opinion on it.  Also have them give you a list of pros and cons for the bike.  Price isnt very negotiable on new bikes because the dealers actually dont have a ton of excessive mark up.  You may be able to offer  because its an old model but the chances of them taking it are kind of slim.  Instead barter for accessories or gear to sweeten the deal a little.I know everyone is saying this but please do not buy this as your first bike.  You will drop it!  It may not be for a year or two but everyone drops their first bike at some point and you dont want to cry when it happens so go small and used for your first.,motorcycles,cflu6ya,2,t5_2qi6d

446918,0,t3_1z6z0d,Well hate to say thats not a drop  thats a crash. But good that youre fineBlue white smoke probably oil. Some engine designs will allow oil into areas of the head that will leak into the intake when the engine is placed at a notsogood angle. Have you had a look in your intake air box? Commonly the airbox is connected to a breather for the crank case and inversion allows oil from the case or collected vapor to run into the airbox. This sort of thing will cause smoke like that for a little bit but stop after that oils been dealt withDescribe in a bit more detail how the oil is getting lower in the sight glass. Is it at level X when the bike is off then drops once the bike is going  but will return to level X after the engine is stopped and allowed to sit for a while? Or does it not ever return to level X and youre always getting that smoke?,motorcycles,cfr36l5,9,t5_2qi6d

I heard great stories from multiple people about how they couldnt have learned to ride on a better more fun bike.Really?  I know I wasnt one of them thats for sure. The fi is about  hp down from the RR but its still a  hp lightweight machine. Neither are really suitable as first bikes.  Bu dont panic!  You can use it as your first bike but you have to be very respectful of it.  A  will get into bone breaking massive injury could be fatal speed pretty quick. But its not an immediate thing you feel like youre going fast.  The  either of them will get there before you realize it happened. You have to really really really be aware and keep your wrist in check.  Dont fear it but dont ever forget for one nanosecond that you have no fucking clue how to handle a bike at high speed where high speed means too fast for whatever the situation is be it a straight street or twisty mountain road.  I know a couple guys  by which I mean two guys who are a couple  who got RRs as their first bikes.  One of them crashed within three weeks.  He was going much too fast on a four lane urban road without realizing the danger he was in.  It was three months before he could walk unassisted.  Im telling you this not to scare you but so that you know what can happen.  The reason he crashed is he wasnt totally aware what he was doing.  Ive said many times the most important piece of safety gear by far is between your ears.  If you think you can maintain focus concentrate on what you are doing right now all the time youll be fine.    All of what I just said applies to any first bike whether it be a  or  or  or whatever.  of all crashes occur because the rider made a mistake. People crash not because the bike is too fast its because theyre not paying sufficient attention letting their minds wander.

They breathe really well in summer which is a must. The build quality is great no tearing seams or ripped leather and theyve probably got about K miles on them. The knuckle protectors arent intrusive like some gloves Ive owned and they make a nonperforated pair that has knuckle protectors on the fingers too. Never tried those because these are pretty great. Good padding in the palms great fit they breathe and they look pretty good. Some wont like that theyre wristlength gloves but who cares? I love them. And for  theyre absolutely great.

The key is to be smooth in your application.Another thing to consider is adjust your brake levers maybe they bite really hard with a little application so use the adjustor screw that came stock on your bike to get you a little more play before the brakes bite.Lastly practice.,motorcycles,cg2qhrz,2,t5_2qi6d

Its also likely the insurers will want the bike to be taken to an approved garage for the damage to be appraised and from the sounds of it itll be written off.  Theyll then ask if you want to buy it back for a large discount depending on the severity of damage only D and C.  If theres any frame damage it may be a class B which would mean it cant be sold back to you but youll still get the full value it was insured against.,motorcycles,cg4c8ty,1,t5_2qi6d

572127,0,t1_cg5acpz,It is in fact possible to sue a seller and successfully void a contract for cashandcarry sales to a minor in most cases.  Stores can freely choose to sell their goods to minors knowing this is the case and when they have the typical return policies that stores offer to remain competitive the situation is handled as a normal return instead of small claims.  That doesnt change the fact that minors can revoke and rescind cash sales.  That it doesnt happen frequently doesnt affect the law.  This was covered in two law classes I had taught by two different lawyers with decades of contract law experience.If a minor comes home with a  MacBook Pro a parent can march himher right back to the store to get the money back and return it and in the rare case that a store refuses the parent can sue in small claims court and win a judgement.  The store may have a counterclaim for damages that the judge may consider but returning the purchased item in resaleable condition is normally good enough to reverse the purchase.,motorcycles,cg5b0ky,1,t5_2qi6d

Retail stores generally accept returns to some extent or another so retailers would generally take a product back. Private vehicle sales in the US at least are always asis whereis unless the seller specifically promises some sort of guarantee and between two private parties the outcome is nearly universally that the buyer takes the risk. Youd have to be insane to try to rescind a cash motor vehicle sale in court simply because the buyer was .Either way the average private seller of a car or motorcycle knows nothing about this and gives no fucks whether his buyer is  or . While I might think twice on an expensive car the typical k first bike simply isnt worth trying to sue over. For a vehicle the seller has a valid counterclaim for use of the vehicle not just potential damage plus fees to reregister it in his name etc. Anyone who tries to go after a private seller in small claims because the buyer was  is going to have a bad time at least in California.,motorcycles,cg5c37g,1,t5_2qi6d

If the sprocket had major wear to the degree that that all the tips were completely rounded off then whoever did a chain service was highly negligent since that should include inspection of the condition of the sprockets and chain that should identify any wear long before a chain slips.  It also should include chain adjustment and identify any stretch out of specs.However its really the ultimate responsibility of the rider to inspect the sprockets for the signs of wear and the chain tightness within spec.This is part of the MSF TCLOCS Checklist PDF.,motorcycles,cg9htzh,3,t5_2qi6d

610705,0,t3_213z3g,Id say a combination of factors. Harley riders  the typical kind rather than all of them I should say  tend to be dismissive of other bikes and people who ride them and hold the opinion that Harley Davidson bikes are the best. The rest of the riders think that the traditional Harleys are an ancient clunky design with a sad lack of power for the engine volume and air cooling a vtwin mounted in that orientation is technically inferior Harleys have to literally turn the rear cylinder off in traffic in hot climates so it doesnt just melt into a puddle so the condescension is hard to take. And generally Harley riders prefer the traditional bikes ie outmoded technology and crappy performance is a requirement not an issue. You can see some of that in that traditional Harley riders dislike arguably the only modern bike that Harley has ever made the VRod in any of its variants. So since the typical Harley rider holds an unwarranted view of looking down on every other rider with very little except heritage to back it up the rest of the community tends to not be all that fond of the Harley crowd.Me Im a live and let live guy and I have  cubic inches that says my bike is better than all of yours D so Im not that hung up on either attitude but I think thats roughly how it goes anyway.,motorcycles,cg9otzv,1,t5_2qi6d

617955,0,t3_217mzk,Wow  several people posting bad ideas here regarding not using the rear brake at all ever. Having both wheels on the ground and using both brakes will stop you faster than the front alone thats just physics. Hes on a dual sport which are much less front brake biased than a sport bike  yes the front does more but both brakes combine to a greater whole than just the oneOf course there is a challenge to keeping the rear weighted under heavy braking and letting the rear get light also means you need less pressure on the rear brake lever to prevent the rear wheel from locking.OK so how do we do that? Your position on the bike and use of the brakes. If youre far forward in the saddle youve moved the combined center of gravity forward and the bike will have a greater tendency to life the rear. If you slide back in the saddle especially on something as light as an XT you can keep or even force the rear back down .Progressive application of pressure to the brakes vs a pancied grab will also let you keep both wheels down. That panicked grab will pitch things forward and forcing the suspension to work harder than if you can on the brakes progressively but firmly.While im on a soap box  have your suspension set up. Its ot uncommon especially on a smaller bike for people to have springs that a just too soft for them. Incorrectly set up suspension has all sorts of negative impacts on ride quality brake efficacy handling tire wear etc etc.As far as prevention  practice. Go find a lot and practice e stops stopping as quickly as you can manage. As you gain skill you may even experiment with intentionally locking the rear. At first ride it to a stop so you can get a feel for it. But as you gain skill one is able to lock the rear recover and then the wheel go again without inducing a highside. BUT it is important that youve got the bike tracking straight with both wheels again  if youre sideways and let the rear go thats where you highside. If youre able to  I recommend taking cornerspin. its a school done on small dirt bikes in the dirt so you are pushing the very limited traction. It allows you to feel what its like to start slides when the bike gets untidy or even recover a lowside   given enough practice. Skills learned there let me save a mph lowside at the track,motorcycles,cgaigjj,6,t5_2qi6d

You WILL need some kind of razor bladegasket scrapperfine surface prep pad to remove portions of the old gasket. Things to check while there Clutch adjustment would be a quick thing to check this varies by bike sometimes its on the clutch side sometimes its on the pushrodshift lever side or not equipped at all see your factory service manual.

First find a bucket that fits then play with the cheekpads to get that nice snug fit. Edit Heres a good breakdown on how a helmet should fit  EditArai is crazy when it comes to customization. They have a lot of different liners and cheek pads to conform to a lot of different head shapes. See  for more info. Edit Speaking of Arai they have their own fitting video  EditI was fortunate enough to be in a cyclegear when an Arai rep was giving a breakdown on how Arai helmets were customizable and why theyre the best obviously. Now I really want to hear from a Shoei rep on why Shoei helmets are the best because I already have an RF. Edit Another thought Make sure you find one that actually fits not just one you think that fits any helmet not just arai. That is find a couple of stores with people who are trained in helmet sizing if a few stores say that a particular helmet fits you then odds are it does.

682120,0,t1_cghghbl,Theres a reason pretty much every rider on the tux forum has completed and advocates the front sprocket swap.Taller gearing will at some point make the bike feel weaker and make higher gears less useful but the tu comes geared LOW. Moving one tooth up in the front isnt tall gearing its normal gearing.The tu is much MUCH improved by swapping the front sprocket. OP I highly recommend you do it. There is no difference in power that you can actually feel the power band is just moved so that you can stay in st longer and ride at mph with a more reasonable RPM.The only reason I can see for keeping the superlow stock gearing would be if you were very very overweight. My wife and I are probably a combined  with gear and Im happy with the larger sprocket when we ride together. Obviously by myself the bike pulls even better.,motorcycles,cght3ek,5,t5_2qi6d

I had just finished my  hoursth straight day of work. I hadnt eaten anything all day which I believe to be one of many factors in going down. I was mentally drained. Anyways I know it is not a bright idea especially considering Im a new rider I was wearing one headphone and a dark visor at night. As you can see the onramp merge I approached it from the furthest lane and by the time I realized I had to cut in I hadnt prepared myself to lean that much. I squeezed both brakes the rear slid out I hit the curb amp am pretty sure the bike flipped once. I took a couple of rolls with no gear besides gloves and helmet. I came out very lucky injuries include  dislocated fingers fractured hand road rash on ankles and severely bruised shoulderthigh.I was riding a  Yamaha fzr. Unfortunately I never got the bike insured I know I know.. horribly dumb idea. The cop filed a report but said he wouldnt say anything about the insurance thing. Im not sure if the frame is bent pretty sure its just the handlebars also gas tank has den in it and cosmetic damage. So should I just sell asis? Or I have friends who can help restore amp sell it.

710706,0,t3_22a5ke, its not about the exhaust its about the wind noise with every hour of exposure your hearing gets slightly damaged.  At some point down the line you may develop Tinnitus or just have trouble hearing.   there is no way to recoverheal your hearing.  Your only option is hearing aids.   there is no such thing as best earplug.  Everyone likes something different.  Get a variety pack of earplugs and give them a try.  Make sure you roll them up before sticking them in the ear and you get a good seal.  It might feel a bit weird at first but you will get used to it.  In fact its better.  All the random noise is cut out but you still hear the important noises car horns sirens etc.  Additionally it helps tremendously in alleviating exhaustion on long rides.  ,motorcycles,cgl2693,1,t5_2qi6d

732971,0,t3_22k25b,Honestly I dont think you need anywhere near  to get started but thats my opinion.What I would get?  A nice DOT approved helmet.  How much you want to spend is up to you.  Any DOT approved helmet will protect.. what you really pay for is style  comfort.  Do you think youre gonna fall and scratch it up?  Maybe stay under  for your first helmet.  Gonna take really good care of it and want to look smashing?  Pay for that  Shoei or Arai.  Just try to stay away from used stuff unless you know its history and age.Jacket  Get one with armor.  Good textile or leather.  I have a few of each.  If you have allotted  maybe get both as you will definitely feel cooler in the textile.  Ive gotten some great deals on eBay... most recently an all but brand new claimed he wore it twice and I do believe that Fieldsheer blueblackwhite leather jacket that looks great for  dollars   shipping.  Pants  I admit this is the one area Im bad in... I am often found in jeans or even nice khakis when riding to work.  I need to get some of the paddedbiker variety this season.  You have the dough so maybe some nice kevlarreinforced jeans with kneepads?  You can get leather pants that zip to the jacket or a full suit.  I prefer the twopiece because it will allow me to head to the track in the novice class.. Im only there to have a good time.. not race. and I can wear the jacket separately when I feel like it.  Also Im   lbs and finding a one piece suit is a BITCH.Personal advice DO NOT WORRY ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE OR WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED GAUCHETACKYETC.  If you want to wear that suit you will be completely protected and any stupid moron who laughed at you wont be laughing when you both wreck and you walk away.  You will be stinking hot in it though.    As far as safety goes one piece suits will always be the best Im pretty sure.  Also as long as you arent excessively overweight or anything Im pretty sure women will dig the suit.  First night I had my matching jacket and pulled up on my bike girls were all over me... and I had my gf on the back at the time!!My personal recommendation would be to spend  on the gear give or take depending on where and what youre purchasing and maybe buy some nice frontrear stands and tools so you can work on your new Precious.  Maybe bank a little bit of that money for future upgrades once you know what youre doing... new exhaust etc.  Youre new and you WILL want more power later.Hope this helps.  Have a blast!  Do you know what kind of bike youre gonna get?  Ive been riding for a long time but if I were a new rider I think those Ninja s look pretty slick!,motorcycles,cgnlckl,1,t5_2qi6d

775285,0,t3_2316rx,June   Chicago  Beginning this weekend Chicago Parking Meters LLC will start   rolling out free Sunday parking for Chicagos onstreet parking meters. Once the process is completed Sunday parking will be free of charge across all city neighborhoods outside the citys downtown area.On Sunday Chicago Parking Meters CPM will begin work over the next few weeks to complete the changes across the entire freeSunday zone which will eventually include any meters south of Roosevelt Road west of Halsted Street and north of North Avenue.Free Sunday parking is part of an agreement between the City and CPM which was approved by the Chicago City Council on June .This agreement is a positive development for drivers and the City of Chicago and we look forward to continuing to provide motorists with dependable easy and convenient parking said Dennis Pedrelli of Chicago Parking Meters. Under the agreement drivers will enjoy free parking on Sundays and new mobile payment options.The agreement will enable motorists to pay for onstreet parking using their smart phones beginning in May . The City will also save approximately  billion over the life of the parking meter concession by the reduction of an annual payment connected with changes to the Citys parking meter system.Motorists should note that metered parking will be extended Monday through Saturday by one hour  from  p.m. to  p.m. on meters that currently end at  pm. Metered parking will be extended from  pm to midnight in the River North neighborhood bordered by the Chicago River to the south and west and Division Street to the north. Meters that currently end at  p.m. will not be affected.During this transition CPM reminds motorists to carefully read and follow the directions on the meters to determine if changes have taken effect on a particular block. As the transition moves forward motorists are responsible only for paying the posted rate on the meters. Accordingly only the posted rates on each meter will be enforced.Beginning in May  motorists will have a stateoftheart mobile payment option for initial and followon payments to meters. They can simply enter a meter number and amount of time into a smart phone application or use a cell phone. This new technology will offer a number of timesaving conveniences payments will no longer have to be made at a meter printed receipts will no longer need to be placed on dashboards and drivers will no longer have to return to their car to increase their time allotment. Motorists who purchase parking for two hours or more will pay no additional fees. Those paying for less than two hours will pay a cent convenience fee which is comparable to or less than similar fees in other cities.,motorcycles,cgsek9k,1,t5_2qi6d

Thats what I took but I already had my full car license and many years experience so I was familiar with the rules of the road. The course was to get me more comfortable with driving a motorcycle. I imagine if you didnt have a car license already you might be in a bit over your head when you first got your M. So I kind of like the California system better.I dont believe there is a quick path for those that have their full drivers license. I believe there is a quick path to get your full drivers license if you already have your full motorcycle license though.I do remember reading that graduated licensing has helped reduce accidents in youngnew drivers so it seems to be a step in the right direction. It would be interesting if they introduced mandatory periodic testing like every  or  years for everyone. Might just turn into a money grab though.,motorcycles,cgsnr7y,1,t5_2qi6d

807932,0,t1_cgw29s9,Nice post thanks. I was actually looking for something more dashcam oriented. I do want to ask what kind of record time you get with it on a charge. Im using a gopro hd hero st gen and get maybe  hours at p using the standard size wasabi battery Its a little higher capacity than the stock battery but fits under the same cover so no extended housing needed.I would note that for dashcam purposes a helmet cam is better since it always sees what you see but the wide angle is a tradeoff you can see more but its much harder to make out license plates etc unless you get a really good close up view of it. I would be concerned about using a  degree fov camera at only p for reading license plates. When I sue my gopro for this I always shoot it in p mode which is around  degree fov IIRC and Im still not really satisfied that Id reliably catch a plate if there was a hit and run or something.Ive been toying with the idea of rigging up some kind of custom black box camera on the bike itself just so I can have something weather sealed that will run off the bikes power and always record when the bike is running. I dont know what I would do for hardware and controller for this though.,motorcycles,cgw471x,2,t5_2qi6d

839749,0,t1_cgzpha9,Thats a great question! Youll see that on high performance steel rotors as well. heat expansion.  many brake calipers have pistons on one side and the caliper floats on pins side to side as seen from the front of the bike and many high performance calipers are bolted tight with no movement but has pistons on both sides. The loose mounting moves the rotor side to side to compensate for one piston traveling a little faster than the other. Makes for ever so slightly faster brake application.  Carbon ceramic has a couple of benefits like better heat transfer etc. but the cool bit is the loss of the centripetal force that holds the bike upright. There is still a ton of revolving mass with the rims and tire but shaving every little gram has an exponential effect in making the bike more flickable. Unsprung mass this is all of the weight of the bike that isnt supported by the springs. The lighter it is the quicker it moves inside the suspension travel. This makes for a more responsive machine with more feel. Lastly acceleration both forward and coming to a stop every gram in the wheel assembly rotor included that is accelerated is accelerated . times as far and as fast as every gram of the whole machine. Applying the same amount of power a machine will accelerate faster if the revolving mass is decreased. The same is true when coming to a stop. ,motorcycles,cgzqd6e,1,t5_2qi6d

The only thing that will make a motorcycle crash at speed like that is you. Seriously  you could jump off the motorcycle during a violent tank slapper and it will right itself and ride away into the sunset  it doesnt want to crash. If you roll offchop the throttle or hit the brakes you will be loading up the front tire more which will only make the oscillation worse and take longer to work itself out. With that said its much harder to do when you fuck up a wheelie landing and go into  tank slapper as opposed to say a corner exit tank slapper which comes on a bit slower. All mechanical failures aside  a tank slapper is the front tire trying to get back in line with the back tire  just let it happenunless youre heading for a wall or some other obstruction. ,motorcycles,ch0com7,1,t5_2qi6d

850640,0,t3_23vha6,Most of the differences between the two pictures seem to be differences in the model. Swapping a seat can be dangerous if you dont know what youre doing because youll have to weld the matching brackets to the bike to do it properly. If its not right the seat can come loose. The bars look like a straight bar or low rise drag bar. If you want to convert this should be your first swap. There are walkthrus as to how to change them but you may have to buy shorter cables too unless you can find a clean spot to hide them without binding them up. I think motion pro still does custom cables but youre going to end up paying ea. Same goes for hydraulics. Electrical is easy to shorten or tuck depending on what the bike requires but sometimes youll end up damaging old wiring if you bend it too much. Really though your bike doesnt have the styling that matches what you want. If I were in your shoes Id ride what youve got and save the money towards a new bike. Its always nice to have one to ride while the other is torn apart too even if you think you have all the parts for a specific swap the bikes going to throw some kind of curveball halfway thru and then you often have to wait a week for whatever part you need. No harm in finding a set of saddle bags tho those you can always swap over to a new bike. ,motorcycles,ch0z0ar,2,t5_2qi6d

Yamahas XTE is A utterly indestructible humungous fun will just hit a ton with a following wind and incredibly cheap to run.  Starting prices are  and  will get you an absolute peach.  Ive owned two.  Oh and theyre pretty crashresistant too.And the F is good too as slamming says.  Avoid the early ones  they were made in Italy and the quality control and electrics arent up to later standards when they moved production to Germany.You really need someone who knows bikes properly to assess your potential purchase.

886015,0,t1_ch4uqao,Check out Revzilla if you havent already. They have video review for most of their products. Amazing detail very good return policy in case it doesnt fit pretty good prices. For reference I have a Firstgear Kenya jacket and an old Joe Rocket mesh jacket for the really hot weather Revit H gloves Bates motorcycle waterproof boots and Im inbetween overpants at the moment I just bought a pair of Olympia Recon  mesh pants but they were too big. Dont waste your time with kevlar jeans they provide little to no protection over regular jeans. I recommend an armored textile jacket or quality leather WITH ARMOR and a good pair of armored leather gloves. Keep in mind that unless youre riding in beautiful weather itll feel about  deg colder when youre at speed. Layer so you can remove them if you get hot. If youre shivering you cant control the bike.Regarding helmets there isnt really a huge difference in protection between brands assuming the helmets are DOTSnell certified. DOT is minimum but I dont buy unless its Snell. More money generally only buys better features weight ventilation etc not protection. I wear a Shoei RF helmet. It was a bit expensive  but it was the lightest and most comfortable out of everything I tried on for my head. Everyones head is shaped differently and every helmet model is differently shaped. Check out Revzillas sizing guide and helmet reviews. They have what kind of shape each helmet is but even if you buy online go to a shop and try it on for  minutes. It shouldnt have any pressure points but itll feel very snug until you break it in after a week or so of wearing. The best way to figure out which helmet works for you is to go to a shop and try a bunch on. The employees should be able help you out. Wear each finalist for at least  minutes. One final thought on helmets WEAR ONE! And wear a fullface always. Dont get a half or threequarter. . of all impacts on helmets occur to the chin or face. Regarding gloves Id get at least something with some knuckle armor and quality leather. My gloves also have sliders on the pinky and lower palm to help in the case of a slide. Boots Get leather boots. Above the ankle. Made for motorcycling. Anything less will not help you at all in a crash. For the love of god dont wear sneakerssandals. ,motorcycles,ch4zret,2,t5_2qi6d

903489,0,t1_ch6yktr,Everyone makes some mistakes while driving except for googles self driving cars! thats a given.  The small group you spoke of cant exist.  The human brain is incapable of such constant hyperawareness in situations they eventually perceive as routine such as driving.  Hitting another vehicle on the road though and paying so little attention that you didnt even realize it was another vehicle you hit?  Thats another level all together!!  Ive seen rearendings got rearended once even Ive seen fender benders for whatever reason not giving enough stopping distance in bad weather etc.  Ive never seen someone who was paying so little attention they didnt see the vehicle that they hit and drive around like nothing happened.  Thats a whole new level of stupid.  Part of why youre failing to see my logic  may be because youre comparing apples to oranges.  You compare video game violence to shooting someone in war.  Not only is that an awful analogy  there really is not a lot of solid statistical evidence to back it up.  Its awful because a soldier has to see that person.  A soldier also gets shot at.  there are so many other factors that play into a soldiers life that drawing a line to a violent video game is the least of the worries of anyone.  So that analogy is flawed from the get go.  PTSD is a serious thing and I have nothing but the utmost respect for our men amp women in service.  No amount of video games could prepare someone in most normal cases for killing someone.  There are always outliers however.  I get the point youre trying to allude to however this analogy was an awful way of trying to get there.  But I will continue the debate a bit further with your thought process in mind.If you really are interested in the evidence or at least digging into it you can find some of it by starting here  The rest was from various books and things at the university library.If the person didnt even see what they were hitting  how could they possibly associate the same level of concern as if they knew they were hittingkilling a person?  Do you get as upset when you hit a rock on the road as you would hitting a person?  If so you need emotional help  but Im presuming you do not.  Looking back I should have included probably in my first sentence. Although an argument could be made that since he didnt turn himself in stop to help or even bother to tell his parents about the issue  that he had  concern for it.  Which means that yes initially he did not care that he had killed people and my statement is correct as it stands.  Including the word probably in that statement only means that it would continue to potentially stand true even at the current time  should he really feel no remorse.  Whereas if he now shows remorse my statement is no longer true.  Its a small point that really only changes the timeframe during which my statement iswas true.Onto desensitization!  Desensitization doesnt turn someone into a psychopath  I never said it did.  However it can make people think that what they are doing is not as bad as it really is.  It can also make people show zero concern for doing bad things or having bad things happen.  For example  a new cop might puke the first time hes at a murder scene where someone is decapitated.  A veteran cop may no longer feel such urges and be more on point with attending to the investigation from first arrival.  This is desensitization.  Its not that the cop isnt affected by it  but its significantly less after seeing so much of it.  There are other veteran cops who may never adjust to it  everyone is different within certain ranges to which desensitization affects them.Desensitization to various harmful actsideals really is common place these days.  Its a legit thing that happens and is affecting our society in a negative way.  Killing someone should make people feel awful  it shouldnt be seen as a whoops wasnt paying attention there! kind of moment.  Youre right though  the amount of regret doesnt matter that doesnt mean that I dont want him haunted by his actions.  I hope he regrets it forever in the worst way possible.  Maybe next time hell pay more attention and lives will be saved.,motorcycles,ch6zcx6,-5,t5_2qi6d

Nobody here knows you and how much self control you have when first learning Having not ridden the fz myself I cant say for certain but it looks fairly powerful for a new rider but being a twin it wont be as unpredictable as an inline . On the plus side it will have more then enough to keep you entertained for years when some peoplenot all have gotten tired of a cc after a season or two of riding.Just take it easy at first and learn your own comfort zone and do not ride outside of that. ,motorcycles,ch81069,1,t5_2qi6d

I bought my bikes and cars to have for a very long time and I probably wont change them until theyre not considered reliable anymore. Personally I buy things to enjoy them not to look at them.

But on the Drift there is a USB port for charging and a separate dedicated port for microphone.  More importantly you can record on USB power so you dont even need a battery at all!!

I understand how you feel but I think it would be a real shame to let an early mistake lead you to shy away from something that can bring an awful lot of joy into your life. Consider finding a big old parking lot or low traffic area where you can practice and introduce yourself to traffic more slowly. Also more classes or oneonone with more experienced riders can help. In a way it may be that its a good thing this happened. Youre more aware of the reality of how quickly and easily things can go bad. Coming back to it with more paranoia might very well make you a better safer rider. Ive just started riding. I have a lifetime of bike riding under my belt but riding this large metal beast is extremely intimidating. Caution and careful training is most certainly warranted. Carry on safety first.

When your charger says that the battery is fully charged it only means that the voltage is up to the standard  Volts. Your battery can still have lost all of its cranking amps and be unable to crank the vehicle.Heres another way to check if thats the issue. With your bike battery connected to the bike using voltmeter check the voltage across the battery with the bike off should be  volts and then check it while cranking or while pushing the start button. If the voltage drops below  Volts when pushing the start buttoncranking it means your battery lost its cranking amps and needs to be replaced.,motorcycles,chfy3xk,2,t5_2qi6d

In many ways its great to do a job you enjoy and work with things you love. I still enjoy working on cars. But its not a hobby anymore I barely even service my own car because its the last thing I want to do in my spare time. I would recommend you think hard about it it can be fun and rewarding. Most trades people are pretty good to work with too. Its not a high paying job and most customers wont trust you and believe you are a rip off. If you work for a dealership you probably are. On the flip side it can save you money your friends will love you for it and you will always have some skills that will help you enjoy something you love. Also you will learn hand skills useful for so many other things like electrical or building,motorcycles,chj5jq6,7,t5_2qi6d

Their bladders are functional but not as good as Camelbak in my experience.Camelbak is the big name out there in hydro packs and IMO they have the best bladders out there right now.  Their backpacks are pretty good but not always as nice or up to standard as Osprey or Gregory or other backpacking manufacturers.Ive had a Camelbak Lobo for probably  years now.  The backpack itself is very small and only holds bare necessities like a multitool and maybe a sandwich if you dont mind it being a little smashed in two small pockets.  Despite what I said before the thing is durable as hell.  I have highsided lowsided sidesided and crashed on it every which way you can crash on a backpack on every surface you can imagine and theres not a single loose thread on the thing.  Though to be fair I have not done extended slides on pavement with it.  That would definitely destroy any backpack.TLDR If you just want a hydro pack Id recommend a small model Camelbak.  If you want something to carry water and the kitchen sink look at Osprey or other brands.  Though ultimately I doubt you can go wrong.,motorcycles,chnj759,2,t5_2qi6d

In the case of total loss of or loss of use of the left hand the clutch lever must be resited elsewhere. Most commonly this is a matter of transferring the lever to the right handle bar either in tandem with the brake lever or by replacing the brake lever with the clutch lever and putting the brake on a thumb lever. This lever would have to be made by an engineer as we do not have this as a kit yet.Another option is a foot operated clutch although this tends to be less common and would probably require forward controls but can be used in conjunction with a Kliktronic push button gear changer.gtA further option is to opt for one of the automatic machines such as the Honda cc and cc auto models.In the case of reduced mobility or strength in the left hand other options would be an Easy Clutch kit or Hydraulic to cable kit which makes the use of cable operated clutches much lighter or a thumb operated clutch lever.gt. Righthand thumb brake using front brake lever as clutch. Righthand twin levers. Left foot clutch with a push button gear changer on handlebars.

1093494,0,t1_chskb5a,most bikes are electronically limited to a speed set by their manufacturer. size of the engine is not the only factor in determining the power of a bike and subsequently its top speed. liquid cooled bikes can get a lot more power out of the same displacement. look at the harley sportster cc   hp and  ftlbs of torque air cooled Ducati Diavel cc   hp and  ftlbs torque the higher you can rev an engine the more power it will produce. Tuning is different on a touring bike they want a huge fat flat torque band so that at any engine speed you can just roll on the throttle and take off comfortably. while on a full on super sport they dont care about the mid and low end so they focus on maximising the upper end of the RPM range because that is where the power is. If you started the BMW SRR next to the Honda Goldwing in a rolling start at  rpm in th gear. and started a drag race the Goldwing would ruin the bmw untill the beeemer would wind its way up to where it makes power k rpms  because it is so focused on the high end of the RPM band. the goldwing would just woosh off at a stately pace because of the torque and power it has down low.Engine configuration has serious consequences as well twin triple four inline or V flat parallel rotary six  cylinder configurations exist then theres  or  stroke for all of those engines as well. all of them has advantages and drawbacks thats why there are so many different configurations available. the designers have decided that one of those designs meet what they are trying to accomplish  ,motorcycles,chsl1i6,10,t5_2qi6d

We all do things that can attract attention for different reasons.  Somehow youve decided to demonize proper cornering which in my opinion is one of the things least likely to attract law enforcement attention.  Is there proof in the Pace that it attracts more attention?  Id think things like revs noise and speed are bigger impactors.  Youre pointing out whats wrong with cornering like a racer although your second two points dont make much sense.  Hanging off is to increase the amount of traction and lean available and allows you to tighten the turn in the event of an unexpected obstacle.  Look at the two riders feet clearance and see which one has more available. Drag isnt the limiting factor when trying to corner fast.,motorcycles,chtxjgm,1,t5_2qi6d

1108003,0,t3_26sc0z,My Triumph Sprint GT is an excellent commuter.  The triple motors offer a powerband that comes on well below redline which makes it very perky and fun for onroad speedlimit use.  However I can keep up with litrebikes on sport rides it does not lack for power at all.th gear is taller than a lot of other bikes I get a consistent  mpg at  mph.  City mileage is lower but averages  mpg when Im not running late!  Range is huge.  On group rides Im rarely below halftank when my supersport friends absolutely have to refill. Its the most comfortable bike Ive ever been on with ergos that offer an upright seating position.  However footpegs are a bit high which allows for more aggressive canyon carving the sport in sport touring.  You can also go into a full tuck if you enjoy that sort of thing.  The fairing and windshield get the wind up over your helmet so theres minimal buffeting on highways even when sitting straight upright.  I have lower back problems herniated discs and the GT allows me to ride all day with minimal discomfort.The GT is somewhat rare in the US but I believe its still offered in the European markets?  Sprint STs are more common and you can get a good deal on them used.  The main difference Im aware of is that the STs saddlebags are known to allow water penetration in a downpour.  Other minor difference is the lack of availability of ABS on latemodel STs.Its also one of the better bikes for up riding.  It has grab bars around the passenger seat so they have something other than the driver to hold onto and the seat is elevated above the drivers seat... this means theres less helmetknocking when brakes are applied and passengers are more confident because they can see over your helmet to anticipate corners.Ive put over k miles on my GT and am a very satisfied customer.  Good luck finding something that suits your needs!EDIT  to be as fair as possible heres some downsides to the GT.... longer wheelbase that helps soften out bumps also means that your turning radius is much wider than a supersport.  Ive gotten used to this but at first it was vexing.  Its never caused onroad problems just something to get used to when parking and stuff. Its a heavy bike.   pounds dry.  My previous bike was also heavy... its something you either get used to or you dont.  This is another thing that you notice in parking lots and stuff but not onroad.EDIT Another great option would be a latemodel VFR... Honda reliability upright ergonomics and the power to keep things interesting when youre not just commuting.  Others suggesting the Yamaha FZs are definitely offering good advice too... they might not protect you from as much wind at highway speeds but I have only tested one in a parking lot.,motorcycles,chu8k98,3,t5_2qi6d

Doesnt that prove my second point? Your friend is rich enough that it makes absolutely no difference what penalty you levy on him he will continue to do what he pleases. To put what you said in my own words to make sure Im understanding your point your opinion is that acting entitled towards people that act entitled towards you is somehow making your world a better place. I dont know you were separated by two keyboards and miles and miles of fiber optic cable. But I really hope that what your saying is  how you really feel and  posturing because of how the video makes you feel. You cant honestly believe that theres some path to happiness thats paved with do unto others the way those motherfuckers did unto me. Im not adopting a high horse. I have lots of moments where I get hotheaded and say ridiculous shit. But the reality of the situation here is that as far as we know the guy in the video was hit by a car. In this video just like in real life we have absolutely zero idea what was in the mind of the rider and the driver. An off the cuff reactionary stance only perpetuates assholes and we all know that the world needs exactly zero more assholes in it. Maybe the driver was an asshole maybe the driver wasnt and while theyre obviously at fault here maybe theres circumstances that you and I and OP have absolutely no clue of. Maybe OP smacked the shit out of his mirror as he passed him. Maybe OP is the aggressor and the driver is just getting what he deserves to get. Who knows. No one.But I will say that hating a person because they drive a car while you ride a motorcycle or bike or be a pedestrian is just as much of a prejudice as hating someone because theyre black or white or any other defining characteristic. ,motorcycles,chuh3tj,2,t5_2qi6d

1148389,0,t1_chxvo4a,I think you have a few misconceptions about sweat and heat reduction. When sweat evaporates it takes some of the heat away from your body. So when you sweat you want the sweat to evaporate away. The problem comes when the air around you is too hot so that it might even provide some of the heat needed for evaporation. The air actually starts heating you up because its hotter than you. In that case you want to prevent moving air next to your skin to suppress convection. Thats why you want to wrap up in hot conditions. Its not to keep your skin wet. ,motorcycles,chyt1s3,2,t5_2qi6d

1149546,0,t1_chyd780,Thats not the way police work with bikes in this country UK. Heres the sort of scenario where it will be usedOne summer evening two thousand bikers descend on a village with a population of a couple of hundred. There is one policeman present standing with his bike towards the edge of the crowd. Sounds alarming? The bikes are there at the invitation of the village and a collection is held for some local interest usually the primary school. Seven year old girls sell soft drinks from tables outside their front doors. The policeman is chatting with all who come past. Theres a bike on a trailer for a spot the fault competition organised by the police. The Atom will be there as another talking point so that the police can have a conversation.Policing bikes in this country is very non confrontational. Even demos with thousands of bikes will only have  police acting as marshals while notorious troublemakers like the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament will get the full treatment. This is partly because about half the police force are bikers and traditionally they have spent a lot of time doing voluntary training so were familiar with them. Since the relationship exists they use it for soft persuasion in respect of advanced training and road safety aimed at the bulk population rather than chasing individual riders. Obviously its not completely watertight but it does appear to be a very effective use of resources and the safety standards over here are pretty good.,motorcycles,chyxr6c,1,t5_2qi6d

I hired a bike from Kiwi Motorcycle rentals at Leithfield just north of Christchurch FGS and the second visit a Sertao. Highly recommended. Took a heated jacket too and glad of it.

I used to live in San Diego and really even if youre taking the freeway a lot   and  during rush hour youre not going much over  mph anyways even when lane splitting.  I say do it unless you like occasional the red line topped flat out on the highway.  Keep in mind theyre dirtbikes so theyll have shorter service intervals than a sportbike.

1306657,0,t3_291v1u,Yes theres many things one can do to alter the saddle height.Some bikes will have a lower seat available. If theres not one to buy its a pretty common DIY project to shave a seat. The seat cover is just stapled on you one removes the staples and the cover and rescuplt the foam. One of those electric carving knives is great for this if you it if not a long thin blade regular knife will do  like a fillet knifeDepending on the bike the rear height might be adjustable from the factory. IF not most times there will be aftermarket products that allow lowering a fixed or adjustable amount. The forks can be moved up in the triples within reason.Id suggest you look at the seat first as youre not altering the geometry of the bike. Those alterations can be done with no real ill effect but it takes some more care and a touch of knowledge. If done in correctly it can be bad news,motorcycles,cigm64c,2,t5_2qi6d

Its a common FI code problem especially when aftermarket exhausts are added that dont require the servo so its taken out anyway.

One reviewer said that the Tuono has relatively low horsepower for the group and a very flat torque curve making it a more forgiving machine for inexperienced riders.Really? This screaming wheeliehappy monster? The cc trackready supersport with no more than some stripped plastics and a change in handlebars? The one with the rearset center of mass that doesnt seem to want to keep its front wheel down in st or nd gear?

1359325,0,t3_29mrzu,hey i have had a CBSF for about half a year and have done moderate trips on it. longest was about km travelled in one day on a bad tarmac highway with lots of turns and pot holes and again about km on a nearperfect highway.the bike was pretty comfortable. I am a tall guy at . and my knees and back have had absolutely no issues. the seat can be a bit slippery but if you add friction pads or just hold yourself on the bike properly with your knees there is no danger of crushing your balls. It can take moderate twisties well if you keep it revved up and when on better roads it can sit at about kmh forever comfortably and can be strained to go at about kmh if needed. and that is on the  model it is a naked bike unless you find the more rare and in my opinion uglier bol dor version so some people complain it isnt good for touring because of the lack of fairings. I havent had any problems with the air resistance and havent found it tiring on my neck yet. I have also found that at least for me because of my height most fairings are useless anyways. it gets extra noisy in the helmet because of the wind at highway speeds which is why i have a pair of earplugs for any trips.I have come to really love mine.

Now even though i am in theory a powersports market expert  and i worked directly for Suzuki very recently  im not going to try to write it all out. However heres some points to considerSuzuki was thanks to centralized manufacturing and parts distribution one of the hardest companies hit by both the dollar toyen fall and by the tsunami disaster.Suzuki also did not have a huge range of new product queued up like Honda nor was it able to shunt resources to do so like Kawasaki.Suzuki was burning money with the auto division. But even after the BK and restructure Suzuki is still having to eat the damages caused by various car recalls including the huge GM boondoggle lots of Suzuki cars were rebadged GM or Kia or Nissan products.Suzuki twowheel also got hit by its own huge recall the GSXR master cylinder issueNow Suzuki has to play catchup with both new technology search the patents Suzuki has been busy there and with new models theyre trying check out concepts like the Recursion but japanese management is often very conservative with anything newRacing is often a huge money sink even for winners so Suzuki dropped out of MotoGPonly to come back now? Not sure what the plan is here guys but im not sure if they studied the concept of sunk costsSuzuki nailed the new DL but it will need new models to grow the line and they arent coming soon by all accountsOn a global scale Suzuki is doing well in India especially with small cars and is doing okay with small bikes in developing nations. But unlike folks like Kawi and Honda Suzuki has nothing else to fall back on to carry the motorcycle division. Kawi can sell a few extra cargo ships in a year and have capital to spare just like Honda can push a few extra carsplanesgeneratorsetc.Expect a big shift in marketing at least in America from Suzuki soon.

1429604,0,t1_civasd8,Yes they should. Controlled effective braking is a skill that every rider should practice until it becomes second nature. You need to know how your bike is going to react in extreme conditions before those conditions suddenly happen to you.Just as riders should focus on all of the road and traffic hazards around them identify and predict dangers and put themselves on a path that minimizes those dangers. Its much better to avoid the panic stop by not being there in the first place . . .But sometimes shit happens. You get distracted for a moment and a driver does something totally stupid in front of you. Or you let your ego get ahead of your skill and find yourself heading into a corner way too fast. Or you see an upcoming danger and brake only to find that theres crap on the road that limits your braking ability.In a panic situation most riders will either overbrake causing one or both wheels to lock up and thus lengthening their stopping distance and possibly losing control of the motorcycle or they will underbrake because theyre afraid to lock up a wheel thus giving up valuable stopping distance and possibly hitting the thing you were trying to avoid.Its only during these extreme situations where ABS comes into play.If youre the perfect rider and brake absolutely perfectly on a clean dry surface you can maximize your threshold braking and minimize your stopping distance. That would be the same whether you have ABS or not. But if you misjudge either too hard or too soft then youve noticeably extended your braking distance potentially leading to a crash. Or youve simply locked up and slid . . .And that assumes that the tiretosurface contact doesnt change as the bikes weight shifts and you pass over different areas of tarmac with different surfaces and potential contaminants like water oil antifreeze dirt sand gravel wet leaves etc.With ABS you can go fullhard on the brakes and the ABS will only kick in right as the tires are about to skid. Unless youve exceeded that threshold point ABS does nothing at all.So in the best case it does nothing and you stop as quickly as possible. And in the worst it kicks in and allows you to maintain the maximum braking possible under the current conditions and allows you to maintain control over the bikes path.The only real downside to ABS is a bit of extra weight and cost. But the potential upside is avoiding a panicbraking crash altogether. And that far outweighs the small negatives.Every bike I own will have ABS as standard. Just like I will wear a helmet and full gear on every ride. Because sometimes shit happens and youd better be prepared for the worst case scenario.,motorcycles,civh7qp,1,t5_2qi6d

Had that happen on a Morini  I once owned and on a BMW or Guzzi its a nightmare.  But really cost is not an issue when it comes to deciding whether to use a dry or wet multiplate clutch.Theres supposed to be a fractional power advantage with dry  no oil drag. And just about everything else except for the oil seal is the same.EDIT And as for speed wet clutches can be changed as quickly as dry assuming all things are otherwise equal in the accessibility department.

1536456,0,t3_2bquox,The Ninja  is superior in every way to the CBR . Also check out the Ninja  its pretty much the  with  increase in engine performance and an excellent starter bike. To start though the ninja has a higher top speed will get there quicker and is a parallel twin. Depending on rider ability it might match the ninja  but anything after that the ninja has it. Ninja looks bigger which is nice in the entry level class because they tend to be small I am right around your height and I looked big on the Ninja  granted I weight  more pounds than you. In terms of reliability you can not go wrong with either. The ninja is carburated I had mine for three years and didnt have to touch it once.  ninja btw. All I did was the oil change granted the cbr has fuel injection it doesnt make much of a difference in its single cylinder power plant. Do your own research as well. Informing yourself via research is honestly the best way to learn about something IMO. At the end of the day your decision should be educated and your own. ,motorcycles,cj8vcc9,1,t5_2qi6d

For moving my partner and I around the city we have the scooter and for going further afield we have the Rr.The electric kit that I fitted to my bike cost about  another  for the battery and the bike its fitted to was   it doesnt really matter within reason  motorcycle frames are generally way too heavy how heavy the bikes frame is when youre fitting a kilowatt or so of motor to it since thats many times as powerful as any cyclists legs.Since I got it Ive put about  miles on it and its consumed maybe a dollars worth of electricity.  Top speed according to the CycleAnalyst is  mph range is about  miles on the flat or  miles in SF.  And I can pedal it if it runs out of juice.Also cool  unlike a moped I can take this on BART or Caltrain.  Its light enough that I can lift it with one hand and given that its based on a folding bike it still folds up.  And since it has a giant battery I fitted it with a DCDC converter so that I have a  volt socket  watt LED headlight and because awesome turn signals and tail light too.Nifty feature  because of the large battery I have two modules of  watthours each I can run an inverter off the bike for several hours which means that its awesome for a party in the park.

1577677,0,t1_cjdxb8f,Youre right. Brain isnt up to full speed today. That wheel is going to weigh more than a stock wheel and a lot more than an aftermarket wheel. It looks like fairly thick steel. I know its not a solid piece and that the interior is hollow but its going to weigh more than a normal wheel would. A stock wheel is going to be as light as they can make it as long as its inexpensive. You can go lighter by using lighter materials like magnesium. Using plate steel is not going to reduce weight. That will be rotating and eating up power that will go to the road.The extra mass in the wheels will also throw off the suspension. That extra mass is going to be out of the range that spring and shock are made for. The extra mass coming up after hitting a bump is going to compress the spring more and the shock is going to have a harder time dampening the force of the wheel coming up. I know its a prototype and completely an experiment. I would guess they are going to change the suspension out in order to get good feedback during testing. Using that rear wheel on the stock setup would feel like you are on a  year old suspension that sat in a barn for several decades.  ,motorcycles,cje1f75,1,t5_2qi6d

1625167,0,t1_cjk00qr,Ive seen so many people have accidents where they put a hole in their knee or their ankle and openly admitted that they would not have that injury if they wore gear that I have difficulty understanding how its not really obvious that squids drive up medical costs. Wear gear  less extensive injuries  lower costs for everyone. Simple.I think that motorcycling is a dangerous sport. I would expect that some people would judge me saying that I have poor judgement for taking part. I cant say I blame them entirely. I do think there is a difference between taking safety precautions and partaking in a dangerous activity and not. If Im riding with a friend whether its on a bicycle or a motorcycle and they dont want to put a helmet on that is their choice. But I dont want to ride with you because I know that I wouldnt be here if I wasnt wearing a helmet and I dont want to be the one to call your wife to tell them that your brains are splattered across the road. I would say that its bad judgement and it would make me question their judgement in general to the point where I would question whether I want that person in my life. It is extremely difficult to care about someone who truly doesnt care about themselves. Perhaps that makes me a hypocrite but Im ok with it. If you dont like the seatbelt comparison lets compare it to rock climbing without ropes. The climber would be making a conscious decision to not use safety gear making a dangerous activity more dangerous. Ive done it many times when I was a kid it was foolish irresponsible showed a lack of respect for myself my friends and my family and I would expect others to judge that choice harshly and rightly so.

1646508,0,t1_cjkrul2,The police love hypothetical situations and their favorite thing is circumstantial evidence. Their job is to arrest people and the prosecutors job is to put people in jail. The fact that they are allowed to and are encouraged to lie to suspects in order to get them to talk or sign an admission of guilt should tell you whose side they are on. You can believe that the police are there to protect people and property. They arent at all. The police are there to investigate crimes issue citations and make arrests. If they just happen to deter crime by being in a certain area its a plus but that isnt their first job and it hasnt been for a long time. I would love to be able to trust the police to be a force that is there to enforce laws and protect the people and their property. How many people have been arrested injured and killed when they were not committing any crimes? Just walking down the street in some places is enough for the police to handcuff you and search your person. They are giving their officers military weapons and armor and their departments are getting armored mine resistant vehicles. I would bet a paycheck that what I wrote in my previous comment has happened at some time in the past  years exactly as I wrote it up. There are way too many situations where the decisions are at the officers discretion. That should never happen. An officers opinion of if a law was broken shouldnt matter. Either a crime happened but it didnt. They are given discretion to decide. If you tell an officer to get his hands off of you that is resisting arrest. If one wants to put you in jail they will put you there. It doesnt matter if you have ever committed a crime or not. The system is broken all to hell. ,motorcycles,cjmpfb0,1,t5_2qi6d

1671810,0,t1_cjpcvrk,Norton Ariel Matchless and BSA all are English manufacturers. So are Vincent Brough Triumph and a dozen others. The thing is they were not mass produced for export although rich connoisseurs did individually ship them internationally. In the prewar era there were also a lot of French and Italian companies that didnt last past WWII and most of those did spread out locally. Brands like Terrot DS F.N. and Peugot were pretty big in those days and often a lot more affordable then the English bikes.You should also keep in mind that motorcycles back in those days were a lot less mass produced then they are now. A fair number of them were customized either by the manufacturer or afterwards to meet the individual clients wishes and as a result there was hardly an universal look per type. The abundance of brands also meant there were a lot of parts that were sourced and used on other bikes. It is therefore not unlikely that you would find a Raleigh with for instance a different replacement Triumph tank.,motorcycles,cjpw6br,1,t5_2qi6d

1675935,0,t1_cjqelx5,I was not. However after figuring out how it happened a couple nights ago Im not sure boots would make a difference the extent of my injury was ankle dislocation shattered fibula broken tibia and torn ligaments likely result of the extreme dislocation. I was sliding off of a  bank on a trail while avoiding water. Throttled to try and recover couldnt and put my foot out to try to bail. There is a metal bar just before my passenger foot pegs in which a heel can just nestle comfortably Im considering talking to Yamaha about this I cant fathom what purpose they serve. I believe that when my toes hit the bank this bar caught my heel and the forward momentum did the rest. Once I could no longer hold my weight on that foot I believe the swingarm did the actual breaking portion. Had I had a boot on I MAY have been spared the fractures but just as easily it could have transferred the force higher up resulting in a different type of break or a torn ACLMCLPCL or maybe none of the above. I dont think I would have gotten away from the dislocation no matter what I was wearing though. When Im riding again I will definitely always wear boots and prior to this always had. It was just the one time I didnt but I dont think they would have made much of a difference in this case.,motorcycles,cjqewqi,1,t5_2qi6d

1683193,0,t1_cjqt5ts,Gas bias? Nah its more like price bias.The cheapest Zero out there is almost k the average ones range around k with the most expensive one at k. For k I can get a new  CBR. Means Ive got k  k for maintenance and gas. Lets leave k for maintenance. It leaves us with k for gas. Im going to assume  mpg on the CBR and combined values from Zero webpage. And  per gallon. For k Id be able to get  gallons. For k   gallons. Theyd enable me to get anywhere from  to  miles. This equates to  Zero charge cycles. Of course the gas bike requires more maintenance  oil clutch cables and so on  but less upfront cost. Besides you still need to replace brake pads fluids seals grips on your Zero...Also according to the Zero page an estimated cost of one recharge is still . which means  additional cost in order to make as many miles. If you want to go further than average of  miles  get a power tank its only  if you want to recharge quicker  get a quick charger for just  or CHAdeMO for . How long is the battery going to last? They say over k kilometers until they have  of their original capacity I find that hard to believe. And God help you if you encounter any failure  especially if its something like controller or motor. As long as its covered by the warranty youre fine but I dont dare ask how much do they cost separately after the warranty expires. Also I can see issues like errors in the firmware or an unrelated sensor or something causing the entire system to flip out yeah I keep reading up on them. So summing up  its not that the gas bias is strong  when youll be able to get a new Zero for k you can expect an abundance of them on the roads. However as long as theyre  times more expensive than the usual starter new cc bike well its not gonna happen any time soon. ,motorcycles,cjrbva3,1,t5_2qi6d

I dont really see the point in this bike. Its certainly less capable off road than the big GS and doesnt have much wind protection. It has more HP. Ok. BMW sells sporttourers obviously but why this? Is the Multistrada really selling so many bikes that it needs to compete with it? This doesnt appear to accomplish what the regular sized Kbikes used to accomplish. The FGT comes in just smaller than this with a lot less power but is probably just as capable in all other respects. The GS and RT have less top end power but do the touring thing better and the offroad thing better. The big KGT does all the same just heavier faster and more comfortable.

1718929,0,t1_cjv5050,gt...because Im still breaking it in and dont want to redline it yet. Protip when you buy a brand new vehicle drive the absolute snot out of it for the first  miles.Your cylinders wear in as you ride the pistons wears a slight land or depression into the cylinder walls. If you take it easy during this break in period youre gonna cause problems.When youre going all out redlining it the pistons travel just slightly higher in the cylinders than when youre taking it easy. If you break the cylinders in by taking it easy then the cylinder lands will only go as high as the pistons did during that time. Now next time you redline it your pistons are gonna be smacking into the area just above that land where the cylinder was not worn properly.If you ride the snot out of it for the first  miles those lands will wear in correctly to accommodate redline performance. Not doing this obviously isnt going to cause catastrophic failure but it will cause unnecessary wear and tear in your cylinders and pistons later in life. This advice also does not apply to secondhand bikes as those have already been worn in by the previous owner. Just ride it and hope it got broken in well. ,motorcycles,cjvu17x,1,t5_2qi6d

You should call and get a quote before you buy a bike if your trying to avoid a high premium.Ergos on the RC feel similar to my friends  Panagale and a little more aggressive than a current generation R in my opinion.Have you considered an FZ Z or CBR? They are inline but are tuned more for the street. Torque will be on the linear side like a vtwin and insurance companies usually dont categorize these bikes as supersports.That said your SV is a great bike for the riding you do and will be hard to beat unless your doing some serious spiritedaggressive street riding and cloverleaf racing.

So if someone goes down they radio it in and wave a yellow flag. If the rider is OK and there is nothing in the track the session will continue. If the rider is seriously injured or their is oil or a bike in the track the will let the head person know via radio and that person will decide if they should throw a red flag.

I dont know about you but my bike is always optimistic by about mph at those speeds so Id imagine his was that way as well since inaccurate speedos are very common on bikes.  But even if he was going mph the report said the driver had  seconds to see him...   seconds and the car driver somehow didnt see him and hit him? Idk sometimes people get zoned out when driving and blow through red lights completely miss stop signs or in this case not look before making a left turn.  You can see the driver made no attempt to stop or anything even when the biker was right feet away from impact.  Im guessing this is because the driver wasnt looking at all.  So  mph or  mph the driver wouldnt have seen the biker because he didnt appear to be looking in the first place.  Obviously the biker was in the wrong for speeding but the negligence of the driver outweighs the carelessness of the rider in this case.,motorcycles,ckbl2fn,2,t5_2qi6d

This would be much more useful. Maybe you can consider that. I was thinking of using a portable compressor to build up pressure then every so often you would release the air through small outlets located across the top of the visor pointed down to push water droplets away. That might be more usable to a wide range of riders.,motorcycles,ckhaxhv,1,t5_2qi6d

Like the R and RR are spec sheet bikes.  To get sales they have to outspecsheet the competition. So on paper Ducati sometimes doesnt look all that great  until you actually ride one. Everything about them is centered around the rider and the riding experience. Its hard to quantify. So depending on why you ride the Ducati can be a great fit.  If I was chasing a clubracetitle Id choose an R but I ride to smile and Ducatis really provide a lot of giddy giggles when you ride them.Another way to think of it is like this. Ducati is an entirely handmade product from an ittybitty company. So its kinda like bakery bread vs. storebought bread.  Ones not necessarily better than the other.

I am not bashing Harley they make some very nice motorcycles however budget and experience wise in your case you can get the same or more for less when going with the Suzuki model I mentioned in my first sentence or any of the others I have also mentioned. Since someone mentioned hp the Suzuki C clocks in at . hp.  Am I biased to it? Absolutely. My first bike the shaft drive made chain maintenace extinct and it was a joy to ride that bike.

Once I got used to it I found I was able to ride for hours without issue. The centre of gravity is very low making it dead simple to manoeuvre around tighter corners uturns etc. It is a wider bike so lane splittingfiltering is a little more difficult. Fuel economy is amazing Im getting under Lkm around MPG around town although this is countered slightly by the smaller fuel tank. No centre stand as stock which makes chain maintenance a bit tough unless you get a rear stand for it. The engine doesnt rev high but it pulls along great across most of the range. Its also surprisingly quiet definitely not an ideal bike for the loud pipes folks but I have no issue with it.

Ive witnessed a number people making stupid overtaking manoeuvres despite going the limit due to the plate. They see and immediately want to get around you. It was only the other day some massive jeep overtook me coming up to a roundabout. Hes lucky a car didnt plough into him coming off it. Im lucky too because I might have been taken down in the carnage. Worse now once you pass the test you have to wear an N plate N for novice for two years. Failure to wear your plated vest results in points  fine. The fine is the real reason I think you have to wear it because I challenge anyone to provide some statistics that show that there are less accidents when the driver behind you is aware you have passed your test within two years. High vis vests on there own are ok they dont turn you into a target. It should be a choice whether you want to wear it though. I mean where are the stats to show that those who wear them are crashed into less?  Recently he EU wanted to take things too far and wanted to ban any motorbike clothing that wasnt completely high vis. That would mean you would have to throw away perfectly good and expensive bike clothes you could have spent thousands on and buy only their approved clothing which might be less safe. MAIDS Report noted that  out of  of motorcycle collisions occurred from near straightahead from the motorcyclists perspective. Often a high vis vest is obscured by the fender so what is the benefit?

Id much rather it break when using factory specs because I would rather it mess up under my garage than out and about.If you use a torque wrenchratchet and dont look up what torque you need then youll break it MUCH easier than if you were using a regular wrench or socket... You just have too much mechanical advantage with normal torque wrenches to go at it blindly.  Also I dont see a crush washer on it.  You should still be able to torque it to exactly spec but they help by adding the torque slower instead of no torque to max torque in a th turn.Also Im sure you already know youll need to replace that.  Even the smallest hairlines will be catastrophic when you add heat....and then rain...and of course the vibration and anything else you may encounter.

2066700,0,t3_2iih7l,So anything you see as unsafe shouldnt be allowed on this sub? Whats your definition of excessive speeding? Do you think its unsafe to wheelie on a flat country road with little or no traffic? This sub was never about safe riding it was about motorcycles and enjoying riding. It encouraged safe riding especially for new riders but there was never any rule against people riding fast or trying wheelies or practicing stunting. Those are aspects of riding and it would be ridiculous to ban them from the main motorcycling subreddit. If something is posted that is just stupid on every level racing through a school zone or drink driving for example it is still down voted and gets negative comments but personally I am glad to see this sub loosening up and becoming more focused on enjoying bikes rather than being so conservative and judgmental of people who ride quickly and dont do ATGATT.

Thanks for the info on timing belts  in my brief googling I saw stuff about those right away... The rear fender looks like part is snapped off somehow  it also has some other damage a weird gouge in the tank and cracked speedo...could be from stuff being stored onaround it or some other kind of abuse. Im certain that it needs much more than a battery but perhaps Ill bring one along and use that as a way of illustrating to this person that the bike needs probably  in work to begin with. Either that or I could let it sit on CL for a while and see if I toss a little money at them when theyre desperate if theyll let it go for much less.

Same goes with a uni. Parking is a premium. Usually motorcycle spots are pretty darn close to the campus but not in every lot.

Its one day and you can still get your license from it saying that you wont or might not acquire new information isnt always true. It really depends on your coaches.Our job is to constantly observe and critique riders. We know very quickly who has been riding and who hasnt. The main point is if you ask questions that are a higher skill level than the course youre taking and you show that you know what youre talking about a good coach will provide the answers youre looking for. Just keep in mind that its better to privately talk to the coach about it during a break or a relevant exercise. We dont want impatient beginners who really arent ready for it to try and get ahead of themselves.TLDR  If you have really good RiderCoaches youll still learn something from the BRC.,motorcycles,clc0657,2,t5_2qi6d

If they werent capped you would occasionally have oil dripping down and maybe spraying onto your rear wheel. Most bikes today have clear tubes so you can see if there is anything in it. Edit Ive had a  CBR and there will be one puke tube on that bike. I only had a few drops out of mine in the year I had it. Nothing to worry about but good to be aware of.

From that point you can have the tank prepped and painted...this can be done yourself or you can just drop it off at any paint shop and they will do it usually for like  or so.Rust is like cancer.

The problem with NYC is that the road and construction crews are incompetent and the unions that do the repairs use cheap matierials so that there is a renewed contract every year.

2347983,0,t1_cm1rls7,Two parts to that comment  gt Only use the front brake while the bike is moving in a dead straight lineDisagree. Two or three brakes are better than one. A more level bike is better than one heavy on the front with a compressed front suspension especially so in poor conditions.  Try  front braking on grass. You may as well throw the bike down right away. Now replace grass for wet oily asphalt.  But I agree its the application thats key like you said brake progressively. Progressive braking easing up when youre on road markings is key.  gt Using it while cornering or turning is asking for trouble even in the dry  Hang on. For a beginning rider sure. But as you gain confidence skills and generally become more comfortable on the bike trailbraking for example is a very useful skill that can help you keep the bike more settled in a turn.  Remember what happens when you press the rear it unloads some of the weight of the front and transfer it to the rear. Instead of being heavy on the front and the bike dipping youve got a more level bike which in turn makes for a smoother turn and a smoother gear change out of the corner.,motorcycles,cm1x7d4,2,t5_2qi6d

Keep your focus on the path way way down the road and dont focus on not hitting mirrors next to you concept of target fixation may come into play. Youll notice the farther you focus while scanning for hazardspotential lane crossers the easier to keep the bike pointed in the the center of the path. Pretty much what we learned in MSF keep your head up. When youre creeping between cars at low speed use the rear brake only. Its more stable at low speeds than the front.Also if you ride everyday you will be ready to commute within weeks not  months but its up to you and your comfort level. ,motorcycles,cmb76co,2,t5_2qi6d
2423904,0,t1_cmb9z8l,Well yeah but if you do too much engine braking in midcorner you can wipe out just like you can using too much rear brake.You have to radically back down the speed braking plus downshift before the corner and then come off the brakes through the corner to maintain close to  weight distribution through the tightest part of the lean OR give it a little bit of gas to transfer weight to the wider rear tire if you have one.Braking transfers weight and therefore traction from the rear to the front.  Gassing it does the opposite.  This is universal regardless of whether youre going uphill downhill or flat.  Downhill just means you have to be more careful controlling your entrance speed and your arc through the corner has to be more precise downhill.  Downhill is the stress test  your whole game has to be tight.,motorcycles,cmbawf8,3,t5_2qi6d

2477531,0,t1_cmhqdhn,Theres no reason to get a new bike.  You can get a used bike with very little miles for over a  discount off of new. You are very likely to drop your first bike and if you get a new one youll feel very silly when you do.Remember that these commuter bikes are nothing new. You are not getting anything new from a  FZr compared to a similar bike from  years earlier. The suspension used on these bikes is from the s and the brakes are bottom of the line. If they made these bikes to perform any better it would cut into their sales for their race bikes which have higher profit margins. Theres no reason not to get a bike with over k miles that someone else has already broken in. So long as you can verify that they did their oil change and other basic maintenance youre good to go. You can use all the extra money that you saved to REALLY upgrade your bike later on.,motorcycles,cmhy8bb,1,t5_2qi6d

2479645,0,t1_cmhlw6w,On my trip home from work there is a set of lights where two lanes become one about  meters after the lights. The number of times Ive been in the right hand lane and some idiot in one of those troop carrier type  wheel drives honestly they must weigh  tons some of those things pulls up in the left hand lane and proceeds to rocket off at maximum revs just to get in front of a motorbike.I just take a few calming breaths and proceed at my normal rate. A majority of Brisbane drivers seem to suffer from some sort of inferiority complex where they feel they have to beat everyone all the time.I understand we Brisbane are getting lane splitting next Feb. Im in two minds about this. As I said Brisbane drivers are ultra competitive and will move over to stop you filtering. Guarantee it.

This thing is old news and given that not a peep was heard about it in the intervening year it was probably vaporware.At  horsepower its not a supersport so they have to target the middleweight segment.

2488688,0,t3_2o2f0b,I see a lot of answers but I dont see anyone referring to the dammed exhaust butterfly. It actually restricts exhaust flow and if theres anything wrong with it it can delay its opening.  I have similar issues has you and Ive narrowed it to that little SOB. My current issue with it is that the lube in it is getting low and I can hear it creaking on start up.Your case may also be lack of high temperature lube probably due to the more humid environment but you should also check the cables and see if they are in spec and in one piece.  Alternately you can also disable it with TuneECU. Thats what Ill do the next time the EXUP acts up again.,motorcycles,cmjergo,2,t5_2qi6d

2514429,0,t1_cmmkrvn,gt. Bottom line if he couldnt brake or maneuver to avoid that he was going too fast for the situationExactly. Also the lanes werent stopped or crawling either they were kind of moving along fast enough not to justify splitting in this instance.,motorcycles,cmmrvrh,17,t5_2qi6d
2514971,0,t1_cmmswmv,gt Choosing the left side was in retrospect probably what made him crash.Lane splitting at high speeds with a buddy is probably what made him choose weaving instead of braking.  Avoid any semblance of peer pressure when splitting.  Rider your own ride is never more important.  If someone is riding your ass pull fully into a lane at the first safe opportunity and let them pass.  You dont have the attention budget to spare checking your mirrors frequently or even to wonder whether or not you have enough room behind you when you need to brake hard....and it goes without saying that you shouldnt ride someones ass when splitting either.,motorcycles,cmmuf83,3,t5_2qi6d

I think  was y and then it was K from  onwards up to  K. From  K the model was significantly different the engine gained tweaks and an oil cooler not to mention fuel injection hurrah!. The styling of the models changed to being more angual and the chassis was also changed to have a more angular design. A bit mroe detail...the K model is famed for having hot cams compared to other models and these cams are often sought after when seeking some performance improvments for later K onwards engines. The seat subframe was also designed in such a way that the seat height was higher. From  K the engine was further refined featuring twinspark plug heads so a total of  spark plugs  per cylinder.

There is also more than just ambulances going through you can have dick heads trying to run across  lanes of traffic while the light is red and it changes to green while they are just starting to cross. Morons who are in a lane that must go one way but ignore those arrows on the road and go wherever they want.

2696824,0,t1_cnahdue,Wish I had more photos for you but it mounts so simply. You just need  strong points to mount the base straps to on the bike. For me that was under the pillion seat to the subframe and tail rack. Neither of those get used so it works well. There are four straps that poke out from wherever you mount them with loops. Then there are four adjustable straps that attach to the bag via plastic clips. Those have aluminum hooks on them that slide through the loops attached to the bike. You cinch it down on all four points and you go. Pretty much everything Ive described is visible in these photosIt will flop around if you dont secure the straps to the small plastic catches that are there to secure any slack straps. Alternatively you could remove the four straps attached to the bag and toss them in the outside zipper compartment. I suggest you look at Revzillas video review of the bag. Its beautifully thought out.As for your uh size problem no it will not likely fit in the US or much else either unless you get big hard case panniers. I didnt even know such large laptops were made.

2738019,0,t3_2rf0p5,Ive worked for a couple of dealerships. Setup fees are typically pretty important to a dealer surviving. Motorcycle mechanics need to get paid somehow and even though the bike looks pretty set up in that photo some bikes sill require a fair bit of attention before it makes it to the showroom floor.  Bikes dont ship with the battery installed so the battery needs to be prepped and charged. Some bikes require a fair bit of disassembly just to install the battery among other things.  A good shop will inspect the bike closely take care of any TSBs or any warranty work fix any scratches or damage etc... This is all just to put the bike on the showroom floor.On the other hand you can spot a shady dealer by looking at Doc Fees  Any shop that charges more than  for a doc fee is a big red flag.  Thats pure profit and depending on what state you are in you can refuse to pay the doc fee and go register the bike yourself.Also be careful of any creative financing  if the shop has an unusually high docfee go obtain financing on your own.  Motorcycle shops arent as regulated as car dealerships so there are lots of legal loopholes than can get you screwed like them adding an extra year to your loan with a higher interest rate  so your payment is the same but they pocket the bump in interest.  I could go on... But bike setup is pretty important actually...,motorcycles,cnfauhx,28,t5_2qi6d

That said this feeling is not limited to Triumphs... other bikes have soul as well.c my industry experience has conditioned me to realize that the majority of the motorcycle riding population has barely enough functional knowledge to stay upright and running. Given the thousands of bikes Ive inspected... im amazed more people arent dead. I dont qualify a single one of those people to really speak to the feel or soul of a bike when they ignorantly ride around on psi. Some people might be noobs others may be fools... thats not my problemdI should have been more clear in statement... its not about the engine alone. While the inital statement was simply about the engine the difference IMO extends far into the chassis dynamics and control feel.e Yes Im pretentious... but I try to stick to shit I know. You dont think certain things are better than others?edit I feel silly for arguing on the internet but isnt that what its for? Seriously though... the FZ is as little as HALF the price of some bikes Im comparing it to. As I said before its a phenomenal bike at an INCREDIBLE value.

And OK so we have higher taxation rates and our VAT sales tax is  across the board  except for zero or specially lowrated things.  But our insurance rates seem to be amazingly cheap even by US standards never mind Canadian.  Thats partly because we have a very competitive market partly because our accident fatality rate is about half the USAs yes it is! and partly because if you are injured in a bike crash you wont have to pay to be patched up but still.I mean in much of Canada you can only ride for six months of the year.  I can only conclude that the things a racket.My annual insurance premium  about  fully comprehensive for eleven motorcycles in Greater London.

Cant say anything about the GSCSDakar and even newer models as i have seldom rode these but they feel pretty much the same with the inconveniences and advantages of modern technology and the almost indistinguishable advantage of bigger shocks and  wheel for the Dakar.The F is much much simpler amazingly so anyone can fix just about anything with the right tools and a bit of digging around mostly on faq.f.com. It can also be lowered you can find details in the forum mentioned but ive seen it mounted by several  individuals so i dont think there should be a problem for you. Oh did i mention that it doesnt even hiccup in under C? And that it could handle an MX course albeit a rather beginner level one without blowing out at the seams?

Usually theyll be on vintage vespaslambrettas or some japanese plastic body bike.The other group isnt riding because they love riding but because its their only way to get around. This group is not going to wave back mostly because they have no idea there is even a community built around bikes for them its strictly an embarrassing way to get around.Obviously this isnt  as with all things in life but depending on where you live youll see a lot more of one group or the other.Source road captain for a scooter club with  active members who throw two full rallies each year,motorcycles,cnyb2ys,4,t5_2qi6d

2945921,0,t3_2tu4va,Was wearing a HJC CLMAX  modular.  Just last week switched to a Shoei Qwest full face.  Not really a fair comparison as the quality difference is fully in the favor of the CLMAX .  However...This is quality related but the reason I switched was because my chin bar wasnt closing all the way it became warped.  Im sure on higher quality modular helmets this is likely a nonissue.My original replacement was to be a Lazer Monaco Carbon modular helmet.  I returned it because I couldnt close the chin bar on their largest model.  While I was anxiously awaiting the helmet I looked at the SHARP rating it listed that the chin bar only stayed closed  of the time in their tests it might have been a different number but was definitely in the s range of percentage.I considered dropping the bank on a Shoei modular or remortgaging the house on a Schubert. I spent some time thinking about what I liked about the modular and why I was going for it again and it was mainly because it was so glasses friendly.  I dont eat with my helmet on I dont smoke with my helmet on.

2950196,0,t1_co3g4bv,i guess i dont consider kg its kg but i dunno if thats wet to be a big bike. its all about how its distributed which on the HCs is unfavorably top heavy. it does weigh the same as a cc Sportster so take that as you will.all i know is that triumph sold them with optional restrictor plates but only on the throttle play not in the plenum or elsewhere so OP could buy it with the plates get his Ltags or whatever and then pull the plate to ride with full power when heshe felt ready.i know i didnt say that i but i figured that if OP was at all duplicitous heshe would pick up on what i was laying down if you catch my drift.as for your experience with doing similar on a ZXR in my defense that kawasaki is an I and the HC is a triple so they have different torque curves and different throttle feel. personally ive never felt an I come alive before  throttle. most Is need to be revd to get anywhere smoothly but these triples from Triumph are so smooth i can do with throttle alone at the bottom of any low gear what most bikes need the clutch and throttle and rear brake.sure he wouldnt be blasting off the line everywhere and he wouldnt really be riding the bike properly not reving an HC over rpm should be a sin but he would have a solid reliable bike that would be one bolt away from nonrestricted.,motorcycles,co3g8wa,1,t5_2qi6d

You wont do that though because you have excellent selfcontrol.  You know what you dont have?  The instinct and muscle memory to roll off the throttle when grabbing a fistful of brake when SomethingExcitingtm happens on the road in front of you.  The net effect is that your front wheel stops turning while your engine spools up to deliver maximum power until it overrides your rear brake and launches you straight up the ass of whatevers right in front of you.

3020533,0,t1_cob2crv,The bike lane is going straight and has the right of way. The motorcycle turning right yields to the traffic going straight before turning. This is a bad situation for everyone which is why most places that care now have the rightturn lane cross the bike lane before the stop light. That way the bikes are to the left of the rightturn lane and the turning vehicles have one less stream of traffic to yield to now only pedestrians. Another option common in my town has the bike lane dissolve before intersections  usually merging the bike lane and the right turn lane into one Right turn only except bicycles lane. This puts bikes and the turning traffic into one stream that easily branches between going straight bikes and right bikes and other traffic. Again this eliminates the need to merge to bikes before turning right. ,motorcycles,cob2qgr,1,t5_2qi6d

3053574,0,t3_2v4g9s,In terms of horsepower or bike weight?  Nope.  Not at all.BUT the suspension on those is kinda spindly...not all that stable.  The tendency for it to shake a bit when pushed hard is liable to give a new pilot the creeps.Its also hard to put a fork brace on those which is usually a good way to help stabilize vintage bikes.I would recommend instead finding a twin ccc made after  and the switchover to electronic ignition.  The Honda CB or CM series twins are perfect.  Avoid the Yamaha XS avoid the Suzuki GS but if you spot a Kawasaki KZ or  snap it up those are sweet too with an awesome motor although they need more suspension help than the Honda twins.Another retro looking bike that newbies ought to consider is the Yamaha Virago .  hp so same power range as what youre already looking at.  A bit cruiserish but can be converted to a more retro look with lower bars taller seat and other minor mods.  Lots of em made tough easy to work on lightweight.,motorcycles,coei1lx,6,t5_2qi6d

3071403,0,t3_2v9fhf, it doesnt matter if you were right when youre the one laying in the hospital.  Defensive riding is the most important aspect of riding.  By all means feel free to push it when you want for fun but also pick your spots. Just because someone has been riding for  years or rails around a corner doesnt mean that they know much about riding.  Theres plenty of old and plenty of pretty fast riders on the street that know jack shit about riding fundamentals and if you ask them for advice they might be pushing you down an incorrect path.   riding is a skill not a passfail test.  You learn to ride in  days at MSF but it take you years of quality practice and feedback to get good.  Personally I was disappointed by how long it took me to get decently fast.  But at the same time I never had any big accidents either.   riding skills also get rusty.  This is personally disappointing to me.  I do not think I can ride as well as I did  years ago.  I havent practiced I havent challenged myself.   one day you will recall fondly your first riding successes and failures and people you meet things you see.

It has a shorter stroke and larger bore than the others which is also something HD doesnt normally do which is super evident because none of the other models make their power quite as well as it does.As far as Im concerned the other models HD makes are just sub par and the VRod is a great bike but the price tag for a new one is just pants on head retarded.,motorcycles,cokezm1,-6,t5_2qi6d

If those check out and the ohmmeter reading from all three wires to the negative battery post is infinity the stator is almost certainly good. You also can measure the resistance from each of the three wires to each other but those readings are very low you need to subtract out the resistance of the meters own leads first.

3208898,0,t1_coul0ev,Not a dumb question.The meter usually has a rotary knob that allows it to select various measuring functions. Resistance DC Volts AC Volts and DC Amps. There may also be different jacks to connect the leads to depending on the measurement function you choose.When measuring resistance unit of measurement is Ohms the meter forces a amount of voltage into a circuit and measures the resulting current or vice versa and calculates the resistance.Set your meter on the lowest resistance  Ohms on the HF meter I link to measuring scale. Touch the two leads together and observe the meter reading. This will be some small value like    Ohms. Youll need to subtract this measurement from the raw measurement you get when measuring your stator wires. The stator itself doesnt have very much more resistance than the meters own leads so you need to subtract out the leads resistance reading in order to measure the stators resistance with any degree of accuracy.There is three combinations of the three leads AB BC and AC. All three resistance measurements should be roughly the same. If any one is markedly different from the others it indicates a problem.The other resistance check is to determine if there is any connection between the three stator wires and the engine. There should be no connection. To take this measurement you set the meter to the highest resistance measuring range. Measure between each stator wire and a bare metal piece of the engine. There should be an infinite resistance no connection between those two points.After verifying there are no faults in the DC resistance measurements you can do the AC voltage measurement tests.Set the meter to measure AC volts V range. With all the stator wires disconnected start the bike and measure the AC voltage AB AC and BC. They should all be similar again differences are bad. Take another set of measurements at higher speed  to  rpm. The voltage reading should go up.All this may be over your head if you have no knowledge of electricity. I dont have the time to teach all that but if you follow the directions its possible to make the measurements without understanding how it all works.Go to Harbor Freight and get one of their cheapy meters for free with a coupon from the back of a bike magazine. Or pay full price like . One of those meters will be perfectly fine for doing these measurements. Again go to electrosport and find the troubleshooting guide PDF I referred you to earlier.

3240594,0,t1_coxvtsg,Haha okay buddy. I have indepth knowledge of these things but it really seems like you cant imagine something working in anything other than the most basic absolute that you learned it from an electronics course.Take a look at this video You can see a clear pulse in one direction as they move the magnet in. Would you call that AC? I wouldnt its not oscillating its a single unidirectional pulse. Not an AC pulse in fact what one would call a DC pulse. When they move the magnet away it forms another pulse in the opposite direction. The reason for your ridiculous all induced current is AC notion is because if youre going to be inducing continuous current in a coil its going to have to be AC because its nearly impossible to have the continuously increasing magnetic flux which would be necessary for continued DC current production. You can try it yourself with a DC voltmeter a coil and a magnet. As the magnet moves toward the coil it produces dc current in one direction. Nothing about this is off the wall or unrelated to whats going on...Seriously take some midlevel physics courses at your local community college they can be fun ,motorcycles,coxw7v8,2,t5_2qi6d

This usually doesnt take more than a couple of minutes.Starting up and just going immediately is a good way to quickly wear out your engine since oil hasnt had a chance to heat up and start circulating properly. This is true even in warmer climates  since engines run better while warm to a certain extent.Revving engines for  minutes... Thats just bogus. Idle should be fine.,motorcycles,coy2uxx,0,t5_2qi6d

Especially on bikes with slipper clutches.. throttle off  clutch in  shift  throttle blip  clutch out method provides rev matching allowing you to clutch out faster without skidding the rear wheel. This can also be combined with braking once mastered without braking.. throttle steady  clutch in  shift  clutch out method good for getting the bike up in rpm so that when you back off the throttle you have lots of engine braking. Also good when combined with braking and coming into a corner as you can keep the rpms up for the exit. This is more of a track technique and takes practice to make it smooth.On the street all of your shifting and braking should be done before leaning into the turn.,motorcycles,coz1qk3,1,t5_2qi6d

Great eatery to look for in that area is the East Bay Deli. I preferred soft luggage myself. Easy on  off not as secure as hard side bags like some of the Givi ones though.

3317106,0,t3_2y4wls,Cant believe noone has mentioned this  dragging the back brake can give you a little extra stability  heres a paragraph from a website that I got with a quick google that explains it better The third technique is the proper use of the rear or controlling brake. With the motorcycle in the friction zone keep your foot on the rear brake and feather it as the bike starts to move. By doing this you are making the motorcycle think its going faster than it is. When you apply power and keep your foot on the rear brake it keeps the motorcycle from falling over at low speeds which is where most people have a problem. Ive never heard of anyone having problems balancing their motorcycle at  or mph. If you dont use these techniques at  or mph the motorcycle feels clumsy and wants to fall over on its side. AVOID using the front brake at all costs when riding at parking lot speeds as applying the front brake at  or mph with the handle bars turned even slightly will pull you to the ground like a magnet. Of course once above parking lot speeds you must use the front brake as well as the rear brake as  of your braking power comes from the front brake.Also  on the front brake thing  I do use it at low speed occasionally  most things that are never are really only in really specific circumstances so Ill say never because you can get by without it,motorcycles,cp6dmi6,9,t5_2qi6d

If there are multiple lanes try going over alongside something else that will shield you from the wind.Dont hold the bars too tightly that way if a gust starts to move you sideways it is easier to react and correct.  You will learn with experience to correct the bike by leaning slightly in to the wind as when cornering rather than turning the bars.Additionally the worst luggage to have in a high cross wind is a tank bag.

3382946,0,t1_cpdlrtt,Sorry but youre wrong about that. Drive chains dont stretch they wear a wee bit at each roller so the chain gradually becomes longera different pitch ie theres more distance between each link due to the wear. The sprockets dont wear that way and if the chain gets too long the load imposed on the sprocket is applied to only the last few teeth instead of the entire sprocketchain engagement. This is why sprockets get hooked teeth when the chain gets old.If the chain is relatively new it still has the same exact pitch as the sprocket is engages and pulling the chain away from the sprocket results in little or no movement. If the chain is getting tired all those added clearances in its rollers and bushings make the chain pitch distance between links grow a bit enough so pulling on the chain can move noticeably away from the sprocket. If half a tooth shows with this method its time to shop for a new chainset. ,motorcycles,cpdvr71,1,t5_2qi6d

3387060,0,t3_2yxarb,Other posters have said being able to walk away but you will get a better price on the bike itself if you you get accessories with it. See if you can look up the dealership invoice price and try to get something close to that then say Hey Im going to get the knick knacks and the paddy wacks for this bike but I need a deal on the motorcycle to make it happen. They may also pull out the old  square and breeze through to the part where they try to come up with a payment per month you are comfortable with while ignoring the actual price of the bike. Feel free to revisit any box on the chart at any time in the process. Once they hand you off to financing is a good time to start fucking with them because they can smell blood in the water and they want this thing done. Finance Jockey will call the salesmonkey over and he will ask you what you need to get this done. The next thing you do is hem and haw a bit on the price and say hey I really need to get this into a better term monthly payment whatever so I think insert price you want would work better over term you want and APR you want Hell say he needs to go talk to the sales manger get coffee and bullshit with coworkers then hell come back with something. If it works for you great if it doesnt tell him you need to think about it for a little while and go get lunch maybe you come back maybe you dont. If you come back he needs to give a bit more and you can take the bike otherwise take the deal they worked for you and call up his competitor and say Hey Salesmonkey over at Motorcycle Monkeys just offered me X for X you have one shot to beat it go.Also remember you get more leverage the longer you drag out the process these guys are probably commissioned based so make sure you string them along to the point just before they call the big bad sales manager over to give you the soft next.

Heres what serenity was talking aboutYoull need to scroll down a bit to find the carb section but its chock full of information.If you want to give this a whirl drain the fuel tank and put in a can of Seafoam and some gasoline. When you start it itll be running off the fuel in the carb bowls and the Seafoam will soon follow. You will need to work the throttle as the SF gets through the carbs because it doesnt combust as well as gasoline hence the some gas part.Run it a long time while enjoying the billowy white smoke that has filled up your garage.If that seems to help put some more fresh gas in it take the bike out and run it hard. Loosen up the gunk. If that helps more keep at it add some SF to your fuel and ride ride ride.None of that may work at all but if it does it cost you  and you didnt have to take the carbs apart. Worth a shot if you ask me.Edit If youre getting smoke from one pipe but not the other one of your carb diaphragms might be shot. If its got a hole in it the vacuum wont pull the needle up to allow fuel to flow. That would mean that one of your cylinders is running really lean.,motorcycles,cpkm0zt,2,t5_2qi6d

Talk to them about safety etcTell them when to get on and once on to not take their feet off the pegs until you say its ok. Tell them not to lean with or against turns just sit level on the bike when the bike leans they will to  without having to try. Never put their feet down even at lights and dont shift their weight if your going under mph. Then just have them get on and take it slow through some EMPTY neighborhoods until you get a feel for it once moving its not too different its just the slow in traffic and parking lot speed stuff thats challenging.

Theres no getting around the poor heat distribution you find under nearly every minivans hood because theyre trying to maximize interior space for the passengers.  Getting at anything on the back of the engine is nothing short of awful if you have a V.  Roadside repairs are next to impossible due to engine clearance.  They shit transmissions at frequent intervals and this part is in no way limited to the Mopar offerings even what I consider the best minivans produced to date the Honda Odyssey has trouble with this one.  Nobody offers them with a  or speed manual that could alleviate the transmission trouble or with a big enough trans oil cooler or trans temp gauge that could help with transmission longevity.You want reliability you just dont buy a minivan.  You want to tow anything ever part of what I consider practicality buying a minivan is a terrible idea.If minivans could get close to the reliability and expense of repair that other vehicles achieve I might change my mind until then I would not own one for the same reason I dont particularly want an old Ducati Ive got shit to do and I cant do it if Im broke down on the side of the road or constantly tinkering with my vehicle.,motorcycles,cprpnbo,2,t5_2qi6d

All of this is quite difficult without the appropriate tools and equipment and I have no idea if you have a full garage with a lift or if your some schmuck with a set of wrenches.

Do you accept the very real possibility that can happen to you? The only way you should ever get on a bike aside from maybe some putting around in a parking lot or in an MSF class is if you accept these risks. Its too late to go back once youve been in an accident. Ive ridden on the street for  years and on dirt  before that. Ive injured myself once on the dirt an crashed twice on the street. The first time gave me horrible road rash due to wearing jeans. The second I was uninjured aside from my testicles smashing the tank. All those times I got back on the bike. Why? Because I love riding and I accepted the risks before I even started.Lots of people will have a small scare early on in their riding life and will stop riding because of it. This is because they didnt really accept the risks involved. ,motorcycles,cq6g9o4,6,t5_2qi6d

Theyre very light  lbs and are typically big single cylinders though there are a couple twins out there too. The Japanese bikes are heavier with much less performance but very reliable.

They often have advanced electronics VFX Multistrada and come with fancy things like fuel gauges fourway blinkers and heated grips. They have great luggage options and may come with hard luggage right out of the factory. You will also hear the term adventure bike getting tossed around.

3757337,0,t1_cqkjzeq,Again youre failing to differentiate between the physical action of countersteering and the riding technique of countersteering.No my logic is since they dont realise they are using some other means of rationalising it to themselves the bike is countersteering no matter what because thats how motorbikes turn. When youre running do you think about how you have to lean forward to counterbalance the a force your feet are applying? When youre balancing on one foot do you think about how you move your other foot in and out to maintain balance? Theres no other way to do those things either and you can steer a motorbike in exactly that way. Rather than thinking I want to turn right I will push on the right bar or something to that effect they look through the bend and lean to the right leaning their shoulders to the right generally results in turning the wheel towards the left and the bike turns right. Or like I said they do it unconsciously simply by maintaining balance and looking through the corner.These things clearly work to steer the bike though not ideal because at some stage they are applying a countersteering force whether they know it or not. The fact they dont know thats what they are doing is very important because if they panic they are then likely to do the opposite i.e. steer where they want to go when conscious thought takes over and the bike will turn the wrong waytip over.Finally MSF courses are at low speeds where the necessity of countersteering isnt so apparent it would be easy for a rider to forget about it and default to doing it unconsciously especially since many riders find it easier to turn by looking at first.,motorcycles,cqkkbip,2,t5_2qi6d

Then go to the DMV and take the written test for the permit.With a permit you are licensed to ride a bike in Illinois Not on the interstate During the day Without passengers Accompanied by an adult who has a motorcycle licenseThat last one doesnt specify whether the accompanying adult has to be on a motorcycle or not. Could you get in trouble if you get pulled over by yourself while on a permit? Could yes but having a current permit is much better than having no license at all.When I got my permit at the Plano DMV the lady at the counter was very clear that when it came time for me to do the driving part of the test they did not care how I got there. Meaning Were not going to ding you if you ride up by yourself with your permit. And they didnt. Their aim was to get riders licensed.

3796550,0,t1_cqoljw0,I mean yea because you dont want your spare being half flat when its in contact with the ground so you increase the PSI rating. My point was that in order to deal with cooling problems with a larger percentage of the tire heating up every rotation thinner tires have to be made of harder compounds that have less friction since they deform to the ground less well ie. what creates traction. This is hinted at in the fact that most car companies limit you to  mph for  minutes on spares. Thats because for those  minutes there is alot of heat going into the tires from contact with the road and from deformation which is a significant factor in rolling resistance btw and they can only make them so hard before they become ineffective for driving.,motorcycles,cqp1c7r,1,t5_2qi6d

3807708,0,t1_cqq94jb,Basically as the piston sucks in air from the carb the vaccum created by the moving air causes the fuel to be drawn through the jets. Idle jet is for the fuel being drawn up when the bike is idling and throttle is closed. The pilot screw is a fine tune for this it either controls the fuel or the air turning it adds or removes it causing the bike to run richer or leaner. The main jet is for when the throttle is wide open the max air is flowing into the carb. The needle jet controls the in between mixture. The needle is a tapered valve essentially the more you open it the larger the hole gets. You can move it up or down to make the mid throttle richer or leaner. ,motorcycles,cqqb4u8,1,t5_2qi6d

Valve cover is simple removing the valve cover picking up the old making sure the surface is clean then replacing it. Head gasket assuming you know how to remove the head is more difficult because its almost always baked onto the head. Make sure that you get ALL of the old gasket off. I was replacing the head gasket for my kz once and didnt clean the mating surfaces well enough and still had some old gasket on there. Was enough to leak all the compression from one cylinder.

3842497,0,t1_cqu1fp4,I checked the stats.  In America there are  million horses owned by about  million people.  If its correct that  million people ride a horse each year Id make an assumption that most horse riders rarely ride if they dont own their own horse.  Ive also lived in a few different rural areas where horses are common.  Very few horse owners actually ride their horses more than once or twice a year if even that.  Most ranchers have switched to ATVs and pickups for daily chores but keep horses for traditional reasons.  On a nice day I see a LOT more motorcycles riders than horse riders.I checked  stats and found that about  horse riders went to the ER for riding related injuries.  In  crash reporting statistics there were about  motorcycle riders injured in crashes but its unknown how many of those had injuries significant enough to actually go to the ER.  From the stats and my own personal experiences I would completely agree with the statements and stats that say horse riding is more dangerous than motorcycle riding when you look at it in terms of equal saddle time hours or per mile injury rates.Finally I enjoy the fact that my motorcycle doesnt try to kick me bite me stomp on me or poop on me when I do maintenance.

Sometimes ill pull up to a stop light and instead of the bike going into first itll go into neutral I have to repeatedly try and down shift until it clicks into first gear once I had to shift into second and take off in second gear I almost stalled which would have been awful.

3910842,0,t3_358jl0,Worked at dealers for a number of years. Yes I have seen the customers insurance pay for the repairs on bikes that were dropped on test rides. They had to pay their deductible and took the hit on their insurance. In all cases the check we got came straight from their insurance company.For the dealer its a calculated risk. More often than not all goes well but once in a great while it bites you.As a note IF there was no disclosurewaiver signed by her for the test ride she could walk away as she is not contractually bound to pay for any damage. The dealer could then choose to suck it up or take it to small claims court. Had this happen at a dealership I was at dealership took it to court and lost because there was no writen or verbal disclosure given.Also being that it is a bike that has been out for some time the dealer may have some take off parts like exhaust that people have swapped out on previous bikes they have sold. Still new and doesnt cost the dealer anything. To be fair these parts sometimes get forgotten about tucked away in storage.Were it me If the Vulcan S is what she likes for fit and ride better. Id be getting the Vulcan S she wont be happy on the C just due to the history. I also think the Vulcan S has a better power plant for long term ownership. Seen  too many cam chain failures on the C and it isnt a cheap repair. If the insurance deductible isnt too bad Id run it and on insurance and take the hit.,motorcycles,cr22ku8,7,t5_2qi6d

4007250,0,t1_crcy4kc,In an emergency braking situation where you need to stop as quickly as possible the rear brake essentially becomes worthless. If youre properly executing a stop in the minimum possible distance the rear wheel is nearly weightless  all of the weight is on the front wheel already. This is simple physics and should be intuitive to anyone that rides. Continue braking beyond this point and youll loop the bike like the rider in the video. Brake less than this eg to keep more weight on the rear wheel and you just increase your stopping distance  which obviously results in a more forceful collision.,motorcycles,crd227c,3,t5_2qi6d

Ive been through like  mopeds since and now am incredibly familiar with Puchs and the like and mph doesnt really do it for me anymore but man....my first ride on that Honda bouncing around corners with that monoshock bouncing me around feeling what it felt like to be on  wheels and not have to pedal anything it was the best.

4053963,0,t3_36w9ba,Tryin not to write a book here but a little background may help you to understand my perspective. I love anything on  wheels. Ive owned bikes from Kawasaki Honda and Yamaha fairly long term. Ive owned quite a few project bikes that I flipped.I had a KLR and old GL Gold Wing and a Puch moped. Decided to sell the bikes I didnt ride often. Sold the Puch. Sold the Gold Wing.Decided to get something smaller lighter and better offroad than the KLR sold it and ended up with a Road King!As soon as I had sold the KLR my wife said I was hoping that you would get something bigger that we could ride twoup. Started looking at Shadows Harleys Vulcans etc.. Even looked at the Spyder. No matter what we looked at my wife liked the Harley better. Found a super deal on the Road King. We bought it I tease that it is her bike and that Im getting a DRZ.The Road King is the best bike Ive ever had by far. but remember most of my other bikes have been projects. Fit and finish on HDs is great. There are several small things on which HD has everyone beat. The turn signals actually selfcancel properly and are well thought out for example.I expected the Road King to ride similarly to my old GL but it was night and day different. Someone said  Harleys dont want to turn Id say Harleys want to go straight and stay upright. That is far less tiring on long trips. This thing truly is a well named Road King. Even with the very good deal I got I could have spent less and gotten a nice Shadow or Vulcan. I believe Shadows and Vulcans are every bit as reliable as an HD.Harleys are nicer in some very subtle ways.Harleys are the favorite bike of many people who dont actually own or ride motorcycles. They get a lot of attention and start a lot of conversation. There certainly is a HD brotherhood. I had a plumber over. He noticed the Road King told me all about his Harley and gave me a very good deal on the work he did.A lot of the guys who talk shit about Harleys are actually envious and cant afford one. It is the sour grapes thing.A very obnoxious minority of HD owners are snobs who look down on other bikes but most owners are pretty cool.Ive only had my Road King for a few months and have only put a couple thousand miles on it but Ive been around motorcycles all my life. The reputation that Harleys are unreliable came from the AMF years. Even those bikes were not all bad as some people believe. AMF ramped up production faster than quality control could keep up. There was nothing wrong with most of the bikes AMF produced but there was a high percentage of lemons.If the HD is the bike that you like best I believe that it is the bike you should get.    ,motorcycles,crids5y,5,t5_2qi6d

4065983,0,t3_374l8c,When people think of a quickshifter they mean upshifting without the clutch.On any sequential transmissions like the ones on motorcycles you can upshift without the clutch but just letting off the throttle very lightly and banging it up a gear.A quickshifter allows you to upshift without blipping the throttle or using the clutch via a sensor on the shifter rod.  The system will generally cut spark for a momentary power loss which mimics what you were already doing with the throttle.Quick shifters are nice because they allow for less input put in to the handlebars.,motorcycles,crjr17g,5,t5_2qi6d

4067363,0,t3_375mqq,I ride in a country where we ride on the left so we nod instead but honestly on nice days when everyone is out on their bikes I just cant be bothered nodding to everyone I see. It may be different in the US when I was over there it was prime riding weather and I only saw at most  riders a day but if I nodded to everyone all the time I would be going down the road like a bobble head because there are way more bikes here. Im riding either to either get where Im going or to enjoy myself and I dont enjoy spending my entire time watching the other lane so I can nod to every rider that passes so I dont.I also dont really buy into that brotherhood thing though Ive met plenty of people I dont like that ride and I dont think that just because they have chosen the same form of transportation as me that they are somehow suddenly a friend that I should wave to whenever I see them. I mean Ill look out for other riders as much as I can and talk bikes and everything but the whole riding family thing seems a little silly to me when literally any jackass can go buy themselves a bike. ,motorcycles,crjwoz2,2,t5_2qi6d

4102390,0,t1_crnvoqx,just thinking about this more. So for me not that Im an ideal biker but Ive been at it a while Im almost a passenger for the actual corner. I sit up on the bike and get the positioning and break as hard as I like on the way in to the bend then I countersteer crank it right over and hang off as much as I like and get the throttle back on. This seats the bike the bike squats down and the back tyre sort of grabs. Im not really pushing on the bars much at all. Ive noticed that I wear the paint off the corners of the tank with my knees so I suppose Im hanging off the thing from there. I keep very soft hands on the bars throughout not steering really at all. All my work is done at the very start of the corner the bike just knows what to do from then on if that makes any sense. Sometimes pegs will touch down sometimes the back wheel will spin up in the rain for example sometimes the road goes to shit and bumps all over the place. I just... kind of let the bike figure it all out. I say all this because you seem very active on the bends like youre doing things and pushing the bike around during the corner. I personally dont drive like this at all. Although I know very good guys who are more pro active than me trail breaking all that jazz Im just not like that I suppose.,motorcycles,crnwbq7,1,t5_2qi6d

Anything under  mph though or filtering at lower speeds I will generally just use the rear brake. If you grab the front brake at low speeds you will lose balance and probably fall off.

Another option would be to hitch a trailer behind the van so you can actually use the moving van to put your stuff. I wouldnt risk putting my bike in there with a bunch of stuff rolling around.

My judgement told me the slowdown was mild enough to use mostly rear brake with some front. It was obviously to my surprise when the rear kicked out as I started to apply it I stayed on it maybe it all occurred too fast for me to possibly make a mistake and lift offwho knows WHAT I would have done given enough time and chance until I came to a complete stop.

In a particular nasty collision the foam might take some of the damage but the rest of the energy will transfer to the upper vertebrae which will probably kill you anyway but at least you can have an open coffin and thats a good enough reason to wear one i suppose,motorcycles,crw6lnm,1,t5_2qi6d

If I understood the second paragraph correctly it sounds like what is causing instability is before you negotiate a curve or turn you might be waiting too late to shift.In other words if you are about to make a turn shift into whatever gear is appropriate and reposition your feet  before leaning. Also you should be able to add a lot of stability by squeezing harder on the tank with your knees I can make midcurve adjustments without upsetting the bike this way regardless of foot position.,motorcycles,crw9nn5,3,t5_2qi6d

As your lean angle increases then you decrease the brakes more.

4226073,0,t1_cs1rour,How would you know did you actually do the course?I cant compare directly as I got my license in the Netherlands but as far as I know the German license is very similar. My experience is that the teachers focused mainly on riding safely and passing the test. That meant riding in the right position looking in the right directions to see any danger based upon what the official say was on where you should ride and how and when you should look. That is mainly to pass the test of course but theyre also mostly concerned with you not dying after you get your license. Riding technique like getting your damn knee to the ground almost does not enter the picture at all except for the basic handling course and test that I had to pass before I even got to the real course and test. That first course and test was on a parking lot and was mainly concerned with basic cornering emergency braking evading obstacles and low speed maneuvering. I guess this is somewhat comparable to the MSF course in the USA.,motorcycles,cs1y705,2,t5_2qi6d

Ive done a lot of the standard maintenance and really havent had any problems.  The bike is pretty selfserviceable.  It is also super comfortable.   mile days and I dont feel like I need a medic afterwards.Probably not the worst bike because I still own it is my  Nighthawk.  I am fairly certain I could shoot the engine a few times and it would still run exactly the same.  But it does vibrate and I like long rides.  Longest I did on this was Connecticut to DC in a day.  I was toast afterwards.The worst bike Ive ever put my leg over was a Ducati Monster.  I hated riding it and it was absolutely the most finicky and bitchy bike ever.  And if you arent a dealer it wont let you work on it because your hands havent been anointed.  At  and not svelte I was uncomfortable during the whole ride on the bike.

Unlike cars this doesnt really help especially when you only have two wheels instead of four. You just need to get that initial bite on the brakes then progress harder but not to the point of locking them. If you lock the front obviously release it immediately and then reapply the brake but besides that always keep pressure on the brake and increase the amount youre using after the initial bite. ,motorcycles,csbjhxp,1,t5_2qi6d

After seeing how much I enjoy mine and getting confident on the back shes shown interest in getting her license so Im helping her through the long winded UK licensing Im very nervous though. As much as I have confidence in my own abilities bikes are very dangerous and I now understand the worry other people feel for me. If she was ever hurt riding a bike and Id pushed her into it I could never forgive myself. If she genuinely wants to ride though shes a big girl and the risk is her choice to make. If your SO genuinely wants to ride I would  recommend you not offer to teach her in a car park. Get some professional training. That way its more her thing than it is you sharing your thing. You may be a good teacher but its VERY difficult to not come across condescending when teaching someone close to you and its easy to fall out.

As I said earlier you only need space for the speakers. Everything else is mounted on the outside of the helmet.,motorcycles,csel7ta,1,t5_2qi6d

4339379,0,t1_csekrmq,Youre nowhere near mph air velocity with a motorcycle cooling fan.  A stock fan will push  cfm which gets you  mph at best for this size.Also this velocity only affects about  of your radiator surface area.  So even a mph wind would be vastly superior to any fan because it affects the entire radiator.  And remember  once your relative wind speed exceeds the fan output speed the fan is now reducing your total air flow velocity by causing drag.   Ever seen a windmill?  That is what your fan is doing past about mph.Theres nothing wrong with the guys bike.  He just rode it a little past its limits.  People are telling him to buy highperformance coolant or a new fan.  If this happened on the flat amp level at  rpm yes he may have a problem.  But under the conditions stated k rpm mph uphill sustained those solutions completely miss the point.  Thats what this discussion is about address the root cause rather than just telling him to buy more parts.  You dont need rpm that high because there is no torque benefit on this bike.  Ride the bike the way it was designed for at lower rpm amp generate less heat.  Problem solved.,motorcycles,cses0lw,1,t5_2qi6d

The FJR uses the rear ABS trigger unit which is a variable reluctance trigger coil very similar to an ignition trigger coil. It consists of a permanent magnet with a coil of wire wrapped around it. As the teeth of the ABS wheel pass by the tip of the magnet the magnetic flux through the coil changes generating a pulse. ,motorcycles,cseyd0r,1,t5_2qi6d

4348289,1,t3_3athaa,You create your own destiny. You dont have to crash if you . Properly learn the correct techniques. Ride responsibly as much as possible. Follow the laws as well as you can while remaining safe. Practice as much visibility as possible. Take it seriously every timeIf you take a look at the crash threads maybe you will notice a pattern. In my opinion they usually follow these patterns . Inattentive car drivers. Bad car drivers. Bad riding technique. Treating the roads like a race track. Bad judgement calls. Reckless behavior. Trying to keep up or riding above your abilityThe last one includes possessing a bike and lacking the skill for it. If you dont do these things its very hard for you to crash. But the more of these things you do say you only do  or  now but in the future or on a ride you end up doing  or   your chance of crashing rises dramatically ,motorcycles,csfs8m6,2,t5_2qi6d

Its also quite capable in the dirt so itll open up quite few offroad options.At the end of the day im getting the big bike for a deal.

If you feel you have the best method for cleaning your chain and like a nice shiny chain then go for it. Im just trying to bring out a point that I didnt know at first and that some people might also not know. Mainly that between the rollers there is lubrication from the factory which the seals are meant to keep in. If you constantly are messing around those seals with hard brushes and solvents sorry english inst my native language so my phrasing might be a little unclear eventually you might do yourself a disservice and shorten the life of your chain. Im not saying it will blow up and you get cancer from it or that you are a bad person for using a different method. This is just my experience and I have done some reading up on it and others peoples experience confirms this also. That you dont have to get the chain OCD clean for it to work properly or in fear that its life is shortened. Phew that escalated quickly...,motorcycles,csm966t,1,t5_2qi6d

I am highly against government intrusion in our lives and given the fact that many motorcyclists are killed in single vehicle accidents or that theyre killed in accidents caused by the drivers is the cats that hit them I fail to see how more regulation will help.

4477329,0,t1_csv0mlq,Yeah number  is about ideal. Maybe over the tank a little more. It sounds like youre using body position but instead of just shifting your weight you need to get your butt off the seat. The big thing that helps with this is repositioning your inside foot. Get your toe on the peg then rotate your heel up and into the bike. This locks your heel and toe into the bike and gets your inside leg into a more flexible position. Then slide over while the bike is still upright so you only have half your butt on the seat and your outside arm is straight. Also imagine youre giving your mirror a kiss. Get your whole body out. Butt shoulders and head.Youll know youre doing it right if you ride in a straight line with that body position because you and the bike will make a V shape with your body and bike angle. From there on out you hold the position countersteer in hold the line countersteer and power out and then once the bike is straight up and down go back to a neutral poisition.It sounds like a lot to think about but it becomes second nature really fast and makes corners way faster more stable and safer.Edit its really not about getting your knee down at all. Thats more for extreme lean angles and sensing where the ground isEdit  Heres the foot position yellow boot. see how his heel is locked in. All of his weight is on the inside peg. Mid corner he could take his outside leg off and flap it in the wind and nothing would happen to his body position.,motorcycles,csv1bzn,2,t5_2qi6d

4511948,0,t1_csza76g,gtWell Ive been a cardriver for  years and a motorcyclist for  weeks so its not like Im completely without perspective. Sorry. I didnt mean to sound like you have no idea what its like to drive a car. I just mean that this forum is not one to have an evenhanded discussion about a topic like this so at the risk of torpedoing my precious internet points I thought Id throw in my  pennies.gt Do motorcyclists need to speed past cars at mph without warning? No.But some do surely we can agree on that.gt Do cars need to intentionally block off gaps so that no motorcyclists can pass? No.Agreed this is shitty and childish although I think its usually more likely that the driver is just bored in traffic and trying to look down the lane rather than at the back of the car in front of them. It could also be that the driver is trying to make it such that motorcyclists dont feel like its worth the hassle to split lanes but even for a driver that feels that way I think this is a dangerous and stupid way to make it happen.You left out the part where its a bad idea PR wise to piss everyone off by revving your engine when everyone doesnt clear you a path immediately.What I would like to see is a some kind of warning system in the car that tells the driver where you are. Cars are getting smarter maybe well get there someday.I agree with everything in the last paragraph other than it being harmless for reasons I mentioned earlier. Increased awareness would definitely benefit everyone but knowing when a motorcycle is coming is not easy. You are sitting in slow moving traffic. Its frustrating. The radio is on. You are watching the car in front of you and trying to move along. Most people are not constantly checking their mirrors. As a motorcyclist you can go from too far behind me to be visible to right next to me in a few seconds depending on how big your bike is how many SUVs are around etc. Meanwhile people are sticking the arms out the window to feel the breeze some are opening doors to litter assholes! some are going left to right in their lanes because goddamnthisissoboring etc.My argument is that perfectly reasonable motorcyclists suddenly throw any notion of defensive driving out the window once they start getting impatient in traffic. You even call out the people in front of you who driving in a way you dont think is a great idea so thats already one or two cases of this. Then you join them! And the video is only  minutes long!

4512533,0,t1_cszcgsm,I had a similar situation.  No riding skills but also not a single friend who rode.  This made it pretty much impossible for me to buy a bike from a private party without a massive amount of fear that I was going to get ripped off.  So I decided it was worth the couple extra hundred for my piece of mind and I went through the used inventory at dealers.  The one advantage there is that there are usually lots of guys hanging around who will definitely tell you their opinions about the used bikes there.  As for me I decided just to buy a Grom because it was utterly non intimidating for me.  Most of the roads here are  Mph so Im not missing anything.  Ill ride it around until Im comfortable with my skills and then Ill sell it or not and get a real bike.

If you are considering one of them why not also consider the s Honda Nighthawk  and the later s Honda  Nighthawks. Those later Hondas are much better.

4601292,0,t1_ct9uenp,I went through several stages before doing my motorcycle safety course. I wanted a bike but just like you I was so afraid of all these videos you see people getting jacked up on their bikes. I almost didnt go through with it when I started to get anxiety about it all.  Plus there are the stories you hear from your family and friends about the guy they knew who was hurt or killed on a bike back in . We had a local car guy die last year when he was hit by a drunk driver while riding his bike at am during a week day on the busiest street in the city. There is a car show in his name every year now. It was a pretty big deal. That was weighing heavy in my mind when I was thinking about getting my licence. Its like this man. Do the course get your licence and then see what you think of it then. I bought my supermoto a week before I did the course. I even posted in this subreddit about how I was afraid of crashing. Now that I have my permit and I have been out there riding around I feel better about it. You just gotta be careful. Assume no one sees you. When I stop at lights behind another car I kind of keep to one side of the lane so I can ditch out of there if I need to because I  am constantly watching my mirrors to see what the car behind me is doing and if they are stopping. Being rear ended is my main concern. That plus left turning cars but at least I can see them coming and slow down or avoid them. I LOVE my supermoto now. It is amazing fun and I am glad I did the course and got my licence. Just keep your eyes open your speed reasonable and just be smart about how you ride and you will be just fine.,motorcycles,ctaky0u,5,t5_2qi6d

Then buy an MV attach it to the bleeding nipple on a caliper use the tool to draw vaccum while topping off the reservoir on each of the bleeding nipples in turn then the MS bleeding nipple. Then top of the reservoir if needed put the wheel on squeeze the lever untill it feels hard then zip tie it in the squeezed position to the handlebar and leave it overnight. If you still have  a spongy feeling you can bleed the brake nipples with the lever once more just remember to close the nipple before you release the lever. If the pistons are having a hard time going back in you probably need to rebuild your calipers and replace the seals. ,motorcycles,ctaxa9c,2,t5_2qi6d

4606929,0,t3_3e356h,For the street the correct way to brake is to run the bike through the gears as you slow down. The main reason is safety if the bike is in gear and the clutch is out you can accelerate if the situation demands it. If youre in top gear with the clutch in youre stuck.For example If the driver behind you doesnt notice the light you can avoid being rear ended by accelerating out of the lane. Much easier to do in the correct gear.I dont generally advise heavy engine braking. While it is unlikely to hurt your bike the brakes are simply easier to modulate. Heavy engine braking is more likely to lock up the wheel due to misshift or abrupt clutch release.On a bike like yours Id let the revs dip to  or so then downshift to the next gear. Let the brakes do the brunt of the work.,motorcycles,ctbadck,1,t5_2qi6d

It seems like the idea of Nakeds  The Best is gaining a lot of traction for some very good reasons but he doesnt discuss any of the market or community factors that have caused this recent swing in the U.S. in particular.  The article or blog is brief ignorant judgmental and provides zero useful information.

4626656,0,t3_3e9t0g,I just bought an  last week and I am loving it so far. The power is not too over the top to scare one away from getting on the throttle from time to time but as others have said the suspension and brakes are a bit mushy. Luckily the previous owner had put steel braided lines on the front brakes and I will be doing the same soon for the rear brakes. If youre looking at it being your only mode of transportation then the vtwin is a powerhouse down low and midrange. It definitely runs out of steam up top but thats just not what those bikes are built for. Mine has k miles on it but I was happy paying  for mine as it had a few nice upgrades include Dale Walker exhausttune the braided lines frame sliders...that type of stuff. Plus the previous owner had kept ALL documents from all purchases and work done previously so I know it was ridden a lot but well cared for.All in all its been a wonderful bike so far.

Greatly reduces the risks of these kind of close calls happening though it exacerbates it when someone doesnt respect the rule and undertakes you because a car passing from the right is completely unexpected.That said glad you made it unharmed and ride safe ! ,motorcycles,ctegkz2,1,t5_2qi6d

4645503,0,t3_3eku8e,Im sorry about this. Driver was absolutely absurd there. Also I think the new Yamah FZs look like awesome bikes so sad to see one was crashed especially over this.You did get on the brake towards the end thats pretty obvious. I did notice a few things.The van did seem to be turning right most of the time but then changed to left with about two seconds before impact. The video isnt clear enough to tell if there was enough fishy behavior before that point. If there was you may have been able to know that you need to take that turn a little slower before getting on the throttle. I am extremely analytical and if I see anything fishy even if I dont like the way the car looks Ill slow down and be more cautious. The number one reliable way Ive found is to look at the wheels and the orientation of the chassis. From that you can usually tell if someone is turning with or without their signals sometimes well in advance. Here I think she decided to make the left turn a bit after the fact and it wasnt planned from the beginning but I may be wrong. If that was the case its much harder to predict.I think it might have been avoidable but I likely may have been in an accident as well. Best bet would have been to swerve right which would be tricky and I dont know how flickable those FZs are.Also I dont think you were signalling left. Were you? Not that it would have mattered here.,motorcycles,ctg4p48,1,t5_2qi6d

4662052,0,t1_cthsa82,Do you know what wholesaledealer costs are on bikes? Im looking at our wholesale cost now on a particular bike. Lets say a Triumph Bonneville.  model.  is the profit. Out of that  the dealer has to pay interest for flooring and the salesperson their commission. On this sale just on profit from the bike on the front end the dealer made a whopping . Just because the bike costs  doesnt mean the dealer made thousands. Motorcycles arent keystoned for retail. Also many manufacturers set a MAP minimum advertised price andor set a floor for just how low a bike can be sold especially in areas where there are multiple dealers for the same line. This prevents dealer A from undercutting dealer B on straight up price of the bike.PDI incurs labor costs most dealers wont erase that.

I know you say you dont care but you have to care at some point unless you are retired or something.Anyway I read this based on reviews of your typical motorcycle mechanic schools. A lot of students graduate and are disappointed in their job options. An alternative could be to independently flip bikes on CL or offer mechanic services. There is some money in that but perhaps not enough to quit a current job for. I see occasional people post ads offering their mechanical services. A guy on the NYC CL is a traveling mechanic and will either fix certain models or teach you how to fix whatever you have.I find most people just arent willing to pay a fair price for mechanical work and dont understand why it is so expensive. My girlfriend is a classicallytrained professional musician advertising on CL and runs into this a lot. People complain that  an hour is too much but my gf went through tens of thousands of dollars of schooling even more in instrument costs over  hours of practicing etc. FWIW I was a highend bicycle mechanic for a few years and couldnt pay my rent on the hour they paid me.

4690015,0,t1_ctlpcvw,I havent had the pleasure of sitting on an RR yet but I do believe the foot pegs are a little further back. On the Fi theys almost straight down. As for my opinion on the Fi as a starter  its a shit load of power and a very sensitive throttle. The power can be intimidating Im used to driving a V with a stick so being able to accelerate from mph to  really fast while still in th gear was surprising. It was the first motorcycle I had ever ridden so getting used to the throttle was my main obstacle. Silly things like changing my bodys lean angle to a more upright position would cause me to roll onto the throttle because I hadnt learned to isolate my wrist during body movements. Or taking my hand off then putting it back on while at speed I would sometimes grab too much throttle and accelerate when I didnt mean to. Much like everyone else says its really up to how responsible you are. If you do get the Fi first just be sure to be careful it will bite you if you let it. ,motorcycles,ctlpwpr,4,t5_2qi6d

I have  years of experience on  wheels the last  of which was harescramble racing in a series and I still get told to start on a  street bike. I turn  in two months which Im sure has a little to do with it.The  Honda CBRR has hp and weighs  pounds without ABS. My  Honda CRFr dirt bike weighs about  pounds and has close to hp possibly even more.  The power to weight ratio on my dirtbike is  higher than that of the  street bike and its basically an extension of my body. Riding anything without all of that power to spare not being able to accelerate out of a sticky situation if need be or not being able to just put the bike in the exact position I want it to be in as quickly as thinking about it makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and I absolutely hated the ninja  I rode as my first street bike.I dont know if anybody else feels this way but at least you understand that the dirt experience counts for something haha,motorcycles,ctmxva0,1,t5_2qi6d

4727796,0,t1_ctqbwb7,I was just making a generic statement in relation to the discussion not necessarily directed at either person. Safety is a huge topic in my life as it heavily relates to my job and there are many discussions about safety. For example I work in construction. Per OSHA you have to wear a safety harness when you are above  feet in height but some places can make it more strict. In some plants weve had to wear them at . The problem is this does nothing since the harness has a bungee effect which doesnt even happen until around  feet thus this negates the entire purpose of the harness. We are constantly telling supervisors and safety inspectors that this does nothing and in some cases increases our risk for accidents as the lanyards have a habit of hooking on to exposed piping and could be the cause of us losing our balance. I was trying to make the point that the study says its a safer option and while that may be true even at the  decreased risk for splitters its going to be listed as safer and some people will take that to mean its just a safe option.,motorcycles,ctqh9be,1,t5_2qi6d

In bigger cities over here it sometimes looks like total anarchy. Cyclists dont care about traffic rules and theyre a protected species on the road. For example if youre on your motorbike and you accidentaly hit a cyclist who is riding on the wrong side of the road without lights and  turning without indicating then youre still in the wrong because he is weaker.I see this stuff on a daily basis and usually I have to evade idiotic cyclist with a fuck the world mentality who risk their lives just to get home  minutes sooner.

They are waterproof durable maps made by motorcyclists for motorcyclists.  There are two main types you might be interested in the road maps which highlight the best rides in a given state color coded by awesomeness basically and what they call the BDR or Backcountry Discovery Routes which highlight dualsport routes through a state.  Each state theyve done on the BDR series has a single route that traverses the entire state that minimizes pavement driving in favor of more dualsport routes not technical offroad routes usually.  Your good fortune is that Butler has finished the Washington Oregon and Utah BDR series.  Colorados BDR is done as well but you may experience some colder temps up in the Rockies in the lateSept.earlyOctober timeframe and Im not sure if all the mountain passes on the CO BDR will still be open.  Still they have normal route maps onroad I mean for most of the western states and no matter which route you choose Id definitely suggest you check those maps for the best riding in the states you are passing through.If youre looking for a purely BDRstyle ride across the US check out the TAT ,motorcycles,cu52ui0,2,t5_2qi6d

4903110,0,t3_3i0fm4,Yo right here. Got a  Zero S . which is about to roll past  miles. The  S has more range better suspension better brakes and is cheaper if you leave out the Power Tank. For maintenance Ive only had to change the rear tire. I havent needed to change the brake pads yet as I keep the regen settings fairly aggressive. My only real problems with the bike was that there was a problem with the motor shaft  covered under warranty and the plastics have faded as I dont have covered parking at work.As many believe it is nice in the city. Even though my  may not be the greatest I get ahead from every traffic light due to the nature of instant torque. As good as it is in the city it is BETTER on the highway! I never have to downshift to get into my power band because Im always in it. Couple that with how light the bike is and California lane splitting I slice through rush hour traffic with ease!Acceleration comes on instantly. Ive drivenridden high performance gas vehicles with amazing throttle reasonse but none could ever hope to be instant like electric. Whenever I get back into an ICE vehicle I start to notice the lag between the motor and the clutch. Add to that the time it takes to get into the power band when you want or need it and that disconnect between you and the road seems frustratingly noticeable. Also I cant constantly go hard on the throttle of an ICE vehicle without worrying about its service interval being shortened. On electric Ill roll throttle on hard every time and it will take it as if it were nothing and Ill never hear about it from the neighbors. To be fair the motor could overheat if the temperature outside is  and you cruise at  for a few miles.As far as range goes thats a personal decision. Keep in mind that you start each day with a full charge so long as you take the  second out of your life to plug it in at night. This bike is NOT for those who dont plan all their rides. But if you do then why would you ever run out of range unless youve made an error? I get around  miles of highway riding on a full charge. That range does go down if youre crossing  or  yes it will cruise at  just fine dont ask. Riding under  Im sure I could reach the stated range on the website. I just never committed a full day of city riding to find out. A full charge takes about  hours on v outlet. I typically only need half that but there are options to beef up the charge of desired.So now... The cost. Yes you may break even... eventually. I try to avoid diving deep into this point because its pretty weak and honestly its not really what I think about when I think about the bike. I believe I have provided some pretty compelling reasons why I think the bike is worth what its worth. The biggest valid complaints I hear are either range charging or lack of exhaust noise. If you have a problem living with these then Id say move along. Otherwise show me a better every day bike.,motorcycles,cuckpkt,8,t5_2qi6d

4906902,0,t3_3i3vew,I have ridden the Streetfighter  and I own a Speed Triple I also used to have a  R.So  The Speed Triple is tame when you want it to be and a hooligan when you twist the loud handle. Its got a smooth engine being a three cylinder its somewhere between a twin and a inline   as youd expect.The   to me  felt like it hated being below rpm the heat shield on the right side exhaust seemed to push my heel out and left me feeling uncomfortable after a short time with the balls of my feet on the pegs.That being said it was a fun ride too. Neither is really conducive to city riding as both have a fairly heavy clutch and the Ducati  Streetfighter doesnt like low RPM as stated.Cornering on both is different as your arms are further apart and higher up it is in my opinion harder to get a comfortable high speed turn out of it and so far for me has taken some figuring out. Im no wonderkid at riding I might add so keep that in mind.You will find them more comfortable even the Ducati than the R. Over long rides it makes a hell of a difference. I did a  hour ride on the R and wanted to die I did  hours my first day on the Triple Riding it home km and felt alright when I got home.If I were a competent rider and wanted something absolutely visceral to ride I would get the  Super Duke.The  is nice but I feel a little tame for me. The FZ with a suspension upgrade is the bargain of the bunch for sure. I wouldnt bother with a Monster its a Streetfighter with less charisma IMO.All these bikes produce a good amount of torque though and riding at speed feels MUCH faster than on a supersport. kmh on an R I thought morekmh on my Speed is about enough which is good.,motorcycles,cud1vhg,2,t5_2qi6d

That theyre lighter is even more gravy.As a quick and dirty as to why spokes are stronger spokes work on tension theyre being pulled on not pushed on a bit counter intuitive I realize so in order to taco a wheel youre not trying to push the spoke in youre trying to pull it apart enough to stretch it.  Now look at those wheels again all the spokes are in groups of four so youve gotta pull all  of em apart...For an idea how strong spoked wheels can be  check out this video of a Tour de France type bike being used for stunt riding.  Several of the jumps he takes in that video are easily  feet and landing on one wheel with a presumably mm tire.  At aprox  you can see how sparsely spoked those wheels are too  that thing was built to be within a gram of the UCI legal minimum  and rotational mass counts for a lot more than mass on the frame.  Another demonstration would be this guy putting a car on a bicycle wheel.  No impacts here like the jumps from the previous video but obviously a much much higher static load.,motorcycles,cui0q2i,1,t5_2qi6d

4976578,0,t3_3j0poj,My own humbling wake up call type of moment was half a decade ago shortly after I got my license. My bike being in the shop for a few days for a minor overhaul I was offered a nice discount on a rental  which I happily accepted only to immediately take it on a spin.Now my own bike was a tiny Suzuki LS while the rental was a Kawasaki ERN which obviously made for a very different riding experience and a vast difference in engine power.So here I was waiting for the light to turn green before taking a left turn checking out the three girls approaching on the opposite side of the street. The pedestrian light turned red they stopped giving me about five seconds to fully appreciate their assets before my light turned green.And there I went half excited about the nice bike half wanting to impress the female audience cranking the hell out of the gas and completely ignoring the fact that the road was still slightly wet from the shower that had passed over the area a few minutes ago. Cue my first drift ever almost sliding into the petrified girls too.What impressed me the most about the whole situation aside from my idiocy was how violent the shaking was when my rear wheel caught traction again. It felt literally like the bike was trying to throw me off. Not once but two or three times. The forces on the handlebars were so high I couldnt counter them.

So the clutch is TOO engaged It could be that the plates are stuck together. Its pretty easy to take out the basket and see whats going on in there. Just remember the order in which you took pulled the plates out Ive messed up on that before. Edit Or the clutch cable could just not be adjusted correctly.

So if you plan on riding in all weather then get the more adaptable helmet. If you are gonna be checking weather reports then you can just buy a tinted visor.Personally I use a mirrored visor on a helmet with an internal sunshield. My commute is into the sun and the internal shield doesnt cut it for miles each way plus the mirrored finish looks badass. One of the hidden pros of the internal shield is that when it is hot as fuck and you are in traffic you pop the outer up internal down and you have some eye protection and wind on your face.,motorcycles,cuw1825,1,t5_2qi6d

What part of your head is going to hit the ground first?Statistics show that the majority of accidents result in the chin or front of the face hitting the pavement. That helmet will do absolutely jack shit if you go down.I mountain bike often and wear better helmets on trails.You need a fullface helmet period. I know you dont like the look of them but sorry that doesnt matter. You need to get over it and buy a fullfact helmet or a motocrosstype and wear heavyduty eye protection.A halfdome helmet is to be completely honest stupid. Its taking the barest idea of a helmet and is basically an excuse. Cosmetic preferences take a back seat to your protection when it comes to your head.This. is. your. head. Youre looking at at least  for a helmet no way around it. Look at the HJC CL. That probably the best inexpensive deal.gtI would fully intend on getting a much nicer helmet once I begin riding for real.As soon as you start riding a motorcycle or scooter you begin riding for real.

The rider behind watches this transformed human and sees right through the leathers to the tender skin as it looked while sleep was upon it.  In one flash the rider sees how laughably easy it would be for something to happen.  It is that pernicious distance between them that does the trick a few yards is an unbridgeable gap.

New riders especially get caught up in BUT I WAS RIGHT AND THAT CAGER DID SOMETHING CRAZY I DIDNT SEE COMING usually standing over their broken bike or sitting with broken bones.Lets look at each of the points here. People cutting across lanes of traffic  okay that happens though. Its always going to happen so what are you the rider going to do to stay shiny side up? Theres no useful advice in how to spot these people and give them space which is the only useful commentary for riders on this point.. Give us space  okay again youre trying to turn back the tide. Instead maybe some pointers about either accelerating and giving yourself space or moving over and letting the person go past you?. Put your phone down  yea again this is just bitching about something cagers almost universally do. Maybe talk about spotting recognizing and avoiding these drivers?. Dont break the formation  nah this isnt a rule. Unless youre riding with  and want to set somebody straight yourself fine. Otherwise you get to share the road like everyone else. That means breaking your formation for other vehicles when necessary. . Allow us to lanesplit  lane splitting is a nice little privilege for riders and we get to cut right through rush hour traffic and go to the front of stop lights. Its not a right you have. If you can safely make it through great if not wait. Youre not special. I wave to cars who give me space but you cant expect cars to give you space when theyre allowed full use of the lane just like everybody else. This is pretty standard newish rider bitching. Yes people in cars dont see you. We all know that. Staying alive is on you though and riding is a choice you made. It doesnt matter whos right it matters who gets home at the end of the day so take some ownership of your riding and stop complaining about stuff you cant change.,motorcycles,cv3378g,2,t5_2qi6d

5173200,0,t1_cv95ebh,That Berkeley study is a lesson in how to misrepresent data.  Read my comment history if youre curious to all the ways its becoming something I comment on a lot.  I will refute one point that seems to keep popping up thoughThey compare injury rates from ALL accidents from tbones drunk drivers crossing center left turners etc. to injury of rates while splitting.  They then notsosurprisingly find out that lane splitting accidents that have less injury.  This has zero relevance.   This is like saying If only Bob had been lanesplitting when that drunk driver crossed center on that two lane road hed be alive today.  They make no mention if a lane split was even a viable option in the other collisions.The only relevant statistic would be to compare the injuries rates and severity of injuryies due to lane splitting vs injury rates and severity of injuries that happened because the motorcyclist wasnt lane splitting.  This would be the only way to prove its safer.  The only apples to apples comparison in the entire study showed lane splitters increased their odds of rear ending someone else by  while decreasing their odds of being rear ended by .  How does Berkeley represent this pretty serious increase in accidents? Berkeley plays it off by saying that lane splitters are significantly less likely to be rear ended while they were just more likely to rear end someone else.  Not sure how significant that  reduction is compared to the  increase.,motorcycles,cv9k71p,-5,t5_2qi6d

Are you worried about fumes? or fire?  if its fumes dont worry about it.  Youll more likely get the smell of metal grease and rubber and not fuel unless you have a leak.  If its a fire you are worried about just keep it away from open flame and spark.  ,motorcycles,cvj7kvw,1,t5_2qi6d

Look into the sxr its a bit taller than the sr but still a sporty bike.a lot of people will tell you to not get a liter bike I dunno if theyre right I started on a cc fgs and Ive never felt that liter bikes are scary and uncontrollable...the only thing I will say is that if you do dump or crash those bikes youll be paying a lot more to fix them and youll be paying a lot more on just insuring them. I dropped my f numerous times although usually on dirt roads and such but keep that in mind.

5318911,0,t1_cvrh3g6,I feel sad for not shelling out the extra  euros for a fuel injected bike. But Ive grown to love my first bike I wouldnt sell it to anyone but my family.I absolutely love it if motorcyclists acknowledge me so far theyve all found me not worth even looking at. They just speed past me I had one stand next to me at a traffic light once I thought that was rather nice but he didnt even look at me. Didnt help that the traffic light was notorious for going to red and taking  seconds to go back to green.Yeah push the thing down to shift up. I often screw it up because my foot slips off the pedal but when it goes right it feels quite nice. I also have this pedal on the back so I dont have to use my toes to shift back its a bit iffy to get it right though. When Im in th gear I can push the pedal down to disengage the clutch when releasing it the bike just goes back to th gear only when standing still can I shift forward straight into neutral.Oh I do love the cops here I feel like Im very lucky where I live. Cops are very laid back here.My friend doesnt seem to care much about money though bought an Aprilia RS something  for  euros which he crashed in his first month totaled. He had to shell out another  to get a limited edition one or something he told me.  euros doesnt seem to be much of a problem for him. Hes not allowed on a higher cc bike yet though but I can see him getting his license and buying another one of those immediately. Most of the kids here with the pretty shiftygear bikes all seem to be very keen on breaking the law in the most ways possible. I just use my bike to get around and have fun while doing it but they like to do everything with their bike including stunting being dangerous I heard a story about some kid riding on the highway on his scooter as well. Absolute madness.I have a motorcycle jacket gloves and a helmet right now my top half seems to be the most important. Since I wont be doing much high speed riding I didnt find it very practical to put on pants and boots it would be impossible to carry normal clothes with me and itd take a lot of time from the already limited time that I have to get on time everywhere.It seems like nobody really loves the country they were born in while I can be proud of the Netherlands sometimes its just a hellhole of tokkies douchebags and what not. If I look at what I meet in Austria when Im on vacation there every day it just makes me jump with excitement for living there once.I always look up to anyone in a Nordic or German speaking country they just seem to be from a much nicer country.Weed seems like one of those things that humanity will get used to after a while just like smoking. Im just waiting on them to legalize it and give it a little more headroom. I havent touched alcohol or drugs in my life and Im not planning on it but Im all for letting people do what they want as long as they dont endanger others. Smoking is a little on the edge for me especially because I have to walk through a bunch of smokers every day and it just fucks with my cough.Im free of drugs and other things that fuck up my body but Im honestly interested in trying out some of that chewing weed once if I feel Im ready for it. I just hope I dont get addicted in some way thats my biggest fear with anything like alcohol and the likes. But if its really like what Ive always heard it seems like its one of the best experiences. I sometimes have those evenings where I just feel really relaxed and easy as if nothing can bother me and if its anything like that Id really love to try it out once.I wish our gas were cheaper when visiting German or Austria we always make sure to pack a few jerrycans to fill up in Germany. Its a world of difference having to pay  euros less for a full tank in Germany vs the Netherlands. Even your Mehrwertsteuer is less Amazon loves to add another  on my order and my orders are usually computer parts worth around  euros so that adds quite a bit to it.,motorcycles,cvrjx77,2,t5_2qi6d

Things might not really be as bad as they seem people with problems are louder than happy owners online but since it  was to be my daily commuter I needed something I could count on being bulletproof.Also general consensus is that the gearing is terrible for city riding and the heavy clutch will tire out your hand quickly.

Also when you drop your bike you wont cry as hard as if it were a new bike. Clean your bike thoroughly when you first bring it home. Clean it after every ride to keep it looking good. You dont have to clean thoroughly but to there point you are satisfied with. Heres a little tip my dad told me and his dad told him the cleaning never stops.Get two sponges and two drying rags. A dirty sponge for cleaning the engine tires etc. A clean sponge for washing the windshield chrome and painted areas. A dirty rag for drying the engine area. A clean rag for drying painted areas etc.An example of a dirty rag would be an old shirt  rugged and tough material but flexible.

5509123,0,t3_3qj7hh,Imho it all depends on how agressive the throttle response is. Some bikes are super twitchy like my honda and require really really careful handling of the throttle. Load changes are quite hard.Generaly speaking s tend to give you a harder time compared to  cylinder engines. My first bike was a super agressive superbike i only bought because it was dirt cheap. I did not really like the effort and self control it took to not screw up even after geting used to it. And never being able to fully open the trottle without either having the rear slip in the lower gears or hitting about two times the speed limit really fast in the higher gears. I now ride a cruiser very agressively and have much more fun than riding a superbike very tamely.TLDR dont get a superbike or supersport unless thats what you really really really want.

They were actually only going ...You will also encounter crazy drivers for who  mph in the socalled fast lane just isnt fast enough so they will get out of that lane and work their way over to the right lane and pass a bunch of trucks on the right and work their way back to the left lane cutting off a lot of drivers and if you just stay in the fast lane or the third lane you can see these guys havent gained a quarter of a mile from their previous position in the line of fast lane drivers.

5543456,0,t1_cwk4on1,Hey a heads up. We have the same tires for  plus free  day shipping at Rocky Mountain ATVMC. I would personally recommend the PR for an extra . They have better wet performance and about  more miles than the PR. The PR is more sport and the PR is more commuting and touring. You would have to bump your front up to a  or a  to fit but you wont have issues. The  will give you a more sturdy handling with a little but less flicking around. It will feel more like a  sport bike. But if you want to stick with the  go with the recommended pair above. Here are some forum posts that might help you make your mind. Some people bash And others absolutely love a bigger tire. ,motorcycles,cwk7tel,3,t5_2qi6d

5552175,0,t1_cwl70e8,I liked the rc it was the bike that made me want to go test ride the R at my local dealership. After spending time on the FZ I was considering an FZ purchase but riding the little  class bike affirmed my desire to get something this size. The rc is a great bike but ultimately the R edged it out for my purchase. The rc is extremely slim which I loved. I havent ridden it since riding my R but from what I remember it had a little more torque in the low end which was nice. I wasnt crazy about the more aggressive riding position Im a taller guy so I felt some pressure on my wrists. It also heats up quickly and you can really feel it between your legs. This was an odd sensation and really sucks for when its hot but would probably be an odd benefit in colder weather. The fan on it is really loud though once it starts to heat up. Not a huge deal but definitely a bit annoying. I liked that it had ABS and it felt really good in the corners. Definitely a nimble and quick bike. The biggest drawback for me was the price. MSRP is  which is only about  more than the R. However I was able to get my R for  OTD brand new whereas the rc would have been between  OTD as my only local KTM dealer was not willing to negotiate at all. The minor boost in power and slim form factor was not worth  in extra cost especially since I felt more comfortable physically on the R. Definitely a fantastic bike and if you ever have a chance to ride one I would go for it. My buddy owns one and I am hoping to hop on his again so I can get a better comparison against the R. ,motorcycles,cwlaqnn,2,t5_2qi6d

5559106,0,t1_cwm3vhn,gt PSA Go ahead and let them ride off with YOUR plate when the police show up to YOUR house and show you footage of stolen bikes being chased around with your plate you can deal with the hassle.Yeah I know all about buyers who dont bother to register vehicles in their name. Its happened to me too but Ive not been unlucky enough to have to deal with the cops over it. Just administrative bullshit.Despite all that in Minnesota the plates belong to the vehicle. Not to you. The exception is if you have a personalized plate you have the option of keeping that plate but AFAIK its not even the default action on those unless you pay an extra fee. Normal plates that arent personalized stay on the vehicle when its transferred to the new owner. Which is why now I always insist on going to the DMV with the buyer and I dont let the title out of my hands until I am sure it is getting transferred into his name. Our titles have a detachable section that has the new buyers drivers license number address DOB etc. which I also copy from their DL. You take that section and mail it in or go to the DMV website and fill in a report of sale. If the buyer goes out and robs a bank you can prove you had legally sold it.Do I like this? No. But its the way it is here,motorcycles,cwm5p6j,3,t5_2qi6d
5559169,0,t3_3r8tav, miles on mine this year. Not a hiccup to be had. I expect that I will find my stator is suffering this winter when I check in on it. They are  dollars from RicksBeyond that I found rust from clean steel spring washers on front fender and some rust coming out of a shifting peg. Silly Italians cant believe someone would ride in the rain apparently. I have seen signs of a leak in the display as well. I think that I may need to seal that up better. I would recommend this bike to anyone who rides it and likes it. It has soul. The sounds it makes no matter what its doing are fantastic and primal. Drop a tooth on the front sprocket for better gearing off the line and on the highway. Open the exhaust valve for a throaty sound on fire up. Ride in Sport Mode for daily riding. Eases the throttle response both on and off. They should be inexpensive right now. The new models came out and prices for the old ones jumped off a cliff. Heres one for k out the door with Washington Sales tax and all. Its pretty hard to beat the value of the gadgetry and power that comes with the Tuono. If only it had cruise control. You can get that in the Bimmer but then you have to look at that face. Good luck with your choice. Edit AFracing.com is a good source of parts if you dont have a dealer. Parts arent expensive either.

5623350,0,t1_cwtuol1,Yes sir. So the XL kinda an interesting story I wasnt expecting. Friend took a  mile trip to his familys house. On the way wheel weights fell off the bike. Strange enough he took it into the dealer when he came back the next day the bike wouldnt run properly. The clutch had apparently completely given out on the bike in the dealers care wasnt expecting that. He said the worst part about the whole ordeal is him having to hire a lawyer because Harley wouldnt fix his clutch even while he was covered under warranty. He eventually won the case paid off the bike and promptly sold it.The  his description was I felt like I was buying the name which is what a lot of new Harley riders end up saying. He said the suspension sucked severely underpowered and incredibly uncomfortable. Now thats just soso opinions but the problems with it ended up being a electrical system issue. He said he still to this day never got an understandable answer on what was wrong probably his fault but they had to pretty much redo the electrics. He didnt have a warranty at this point so it kinda sucked for him.Concluding everything a purchase is a risk no matter the make or model. You could end up with a Harley thats phenomenal or gives you no issues for k miles. Or you could end up with a Bolt that gives you issues at k miles. The only difference is statistically speaking youre much more likely to run into the major problems on a Harley than a bolt. ,motorcycles,cwu4p0z,1,t5_2qi6d

5660592,0,t1_cwyr17a,We left the pass and wound our way up Fildalgo island. Up past the two big refineries through quaint downtown Anacortes. Its a neat place almost like the bastard love child of Spanaway and Port Angeles. We rolled through town anxious to make our reservations for the ferry to Friday Harbor. We paid our fare at the terminal and pulled to the front of the line. Washington State Ferries WSF allows motorcycles to cut to the front of the line and are usually first loaded onto the boat therefore the first off too.The ride to Friday Harbor on San Juan Island takes over an hour. We didnt see them but there are pods of resident orcas that live up there. The Sun was brilliant on the cold blue waters and everywhere you look is another island Some like Orcas Island are really big others are so small that they literally have just one house on them. I found myself wondering what on earth people who own a home on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere must do for a living.We arrived just after noon in Friday Harbor. Its the end of the line and we intended to hop from there back. The town is scenic and very touristy We quickly got onto the highway and before long we were on the most beautiful winding roads over rolling emeraldgreen hills. Farm houses and livestock dotted the land. The island isnt huge and we soon arrived at our lunch destination Roche Harbor.Roche Harbor is a strange little town that is dominated by a resort. Actually the town is owned by the resort. Odd right? We looked at the ruins of the centuryold lime kilns and ate burgers on the dock overlooking the customs office. Up in this area my phone switched to Rogers giving me a cool  Welcome to Canada! message. Too bad I was still in the US.After lunch we got back on the road to finish touring the island. On the south side there is a nice stretch where you cruise along the coast and can see across the straits back to the mainland. My sisinlaw was so struck by the beauty of that place that she said she wanted to get married there one day. We couldnt stay too long as we had another boat to catch. Up there you are beholden to the ferry schedule unless you have your own boat. There are no bridges between islands.We grabbed a few items at the local hardware store in Friday Harbor and ate ice cream from the shop at the dock next to the ferry terminal. We boarded and sailed to our next stop Orcas Island. Orcas is big and wild. Its larger than San Juan but has far less people. I think the biggest town on it is Eastsound and its less than four thousand people. Anyway we landed at the island as night approached. We hauled it up the winding roads to Eastsound to get food before everything shuts down at . We found the coop grocery store was open until . We got hot food from the deli and some wine and a lambic beer. I asked our cashier who looks about my age early s what there is to do on Orcas afterhours. Basically drink and play board games.,motorcycles,cwyr1gx,2,t5_2qi6d

Most bikes and cars arent really designed to take off from a stop with only releasing the clutch with no power. You need a lot of low end torque for that which sport bikes dont really have.For the down shifting what do you mean by saying it feels like its in th gear? The position of the shifter doesnt change based on what gear youre in. You should be able to just pull in the clutch and downshift through all the gears making sure you let the shift pedal return to the top position before downshifting to the next gear.

My general rule of thumb is on FI bikes to wait until the idle drops on warm up. And give it about another four after that. On my carbed bikes I give it until I can drop the choke and it idles normally plus another  minutes. It might be over kill but especially in that sort of cold it doesnt it wont hurt the engine idling a little longer. And black ice isnt all that bad. You realm just have to treat it like youre riding in an inch or two of snow. Take it slow.

Are you saying that they all need a safety course because they dont know what theyre doing?And a chain on a classic may not be worn it may just be aged old and brittle. If its his bike he should know that but we dont know that its his bike. Maybe he borrowed a friends and it looked fine.You dont know. You didnt ask. You just handed down judgement. Unless youre truly omniscient youre being a tool. If you are omniscient youre a tool for not revealing the cure to cancer diabetes world hunger etc.So which is it?

Like I am the first one to tell my friends to stop being stupid but I was there behind him for all  accidents...I saw them and even Im like damn...thats fucked up I dont see how any of that could have been improved upon One minute hes up the other his back wheel lights up in a cloud of smoke and hes down...the other I watched his rear tire hop a little awkwardly on a rock he put his leg out to keep the bike up and I only realized how badly that hurt him when he was stopped a few seconds later cursing...the last well DEER! Bam there it goes into the side of his bike and over and off into the woods. I try to explain to his wife that he is one of the best riders I know and she thinks that well if hes that good of a rider than motorcycles are just deadly for everyone. Its no consolation.

You can opt to go paperless but sometimes the company will still send promotions or whatever to your addresses on file. If youre really worried about it get a post office box at the Post Office where only you have a key. Do not allow your parents access to any of the accounts. If you are  they have no legal right to your information. That being said tell your parents you have a motorcycle. Show them that you have the gear are paying the bills and took the safety course.

The truck then proceeded to drive down the road about mph below the limit. My buddie decided to pass the driver so changed lanes and accelerated past. For whatever reason the truck driver got pissed and chased after trying to ram my buddies car.   At one point he ended up going into the dirt on the side of the road to avoid a collision but instead of stopping he dropped a couple gears and left the truck in his dust  he drove a subaru and was not afraid to go offroading.Anyhow a few miles up he stopped at a red light camera light fuck AZ and the truck came up behind him.  The driver exited the truck carrying some kind of night stick so my buddie pulled his Styer M out of his jacket CCWP gotta love AZ. He instructed the driver to drop the stick get back in his truck and leave.  The driver did so running the red light and getting a lovely ticket in the mail I assume.   My buddie filed a report with the cops and delivered the stick to the station. They eventually caught the guy and booked him for DWI.

5845679,0,t1_cxlsxya,gt Wax it is!Since I always replace sprockets and chains as a set I drew the opposite conclusion. Plus I have actually used a ScottOiler and know that it works very well. Look at what a drip oiler gets you the lowest possible chain wear hence the frequency of adjustments is lowest and chain life is longest. If the sprockets become so worn as to start affecting the chain life I would replace the whole set.I managed to get k miles out of the original D.I.D. chain on my SVS using a ScottOiler. Even if I could somehow eke a longer total life of chainsprockets using a waxbased lubricant the convenience factor of not having to frequently apply lube manually vs. letting the ScottOiler do it and very infrequent adjustments plus you never have to clean the chain because the oil drip does it for you makes it a nobrainer.,motorcycles,cxlw9y3,3,t5_2qi6d

5863523,0,t3_3vig15,Heres my obligatory Saturday cutandpasteThere are two basic problems that face owners of carbureted motorcycles.The first problem is the fuel they are forced to burn gasohol which consists of  gasoline and  alcohol and is therefore called E.E separates into gasoline and water after it has set in the gas tank for a month or so and it also evaporates from the carburetor float bowls leaving a reddish brown substance that blocks the tiny idle jets ports and passages that the engine is so dependant upon for starting quick warm up and throttle response.The crap plugs up the critical area around the idle mixture screw and the owner ignorant of other facets of carburetor construction will turn the idle speed knob up without ever adjusting the idle mixture screw to match.Another facet of this whole mess is that factory technicians set the idle mixture screws too lean for quick starting fast warm up and throttle response.The factory technicians priority was to get the engine to pass the carbon monoxide emissions tests at idle RPM then they concealed the idle mixture plugs behind pressed in EPA antitamper plugs.Carbs with these lean idle mixture settings will still work fine when the throttle is opened unless the idle mixture ports are clogged up.Then the engine will bog down when the throttle is opened or may even stall.Further complication has to do with the pattern of three bypass ports just downstream of the throttle butterflies and controlled by them.The bypass ports are NOT supposed to be uncovered at idle RPM the engine is supposed to get enough fuel from the single idle mixture screw further down the carburetor bore.But if the engine has been idling rough or too slow and the owner has adjusted the idle speed knob without adjusting the idle mixture screw or better yet cleaned out the carburetors! the bypass ports are uncovered prematurely and they making the starting mixture too rich.Owners also do not understand the nature of the choke which is not a flat plate type choke like old carbureted cars once had.The bypass enrichener is a little air valve that opens a port bypassing the throttle butterflies.The resulting air flow causes the enrichener to suck fuel directly out of the float bowls like a kid sucking milk through a strawThe fuelair mixture coming from the bypass can be as rich as  and the carburetor really does not need the extra fuel from the bypass ports!!!If the engine does start with such a rich mixture the idle RPM will run away and the owner will have to constantly adjust the choke knob or lever to keep the cold engine from revving too high and possibly damaging itself.So knowing that there are problems with gum and varnish forming in the carburetors and that the idle mixture screws are set too lean from the factory what does the owner need to do?First off he can keep the gum and varnish from forming by adding  or  ounces of clear carburetor cleaner like Berryman B GumOut or STP to a full tank of gas every three months.A quicker cleanup of the carbs involves opening the float bowl drain screws to drain out any old gasohol closing the drain screws and disconnecting the fuel hose.The carburetors can then be filled with carburetor cleaner and the fuel hose reconnected. Then the carb cleaner is allowed to work for an hour before starting the engine outdoors to avoid having the alcohol fumes sting your eyes!.There is also a small brass pilot air jet in the mouth of most carbs and you can squirt carb cleaner directly into that jet to clean out the idle mixture system.But what about those pesky idle screws that are set too lean at the factory?Knowledgeable tuners have been drilling the EPA plugs out for decades now.The method involves carefully drilling a pilot hole in the plug with a small drill you dont want to drill too deep and hit the idle mixture screws! then screwing a sheet metal screw into the plug and pulling the screw and plug out with a pair of pliers.Then you can set the idle mixture screws to about . turns out on most carburetor and thumb your nose at the meddling EPA that caused so many riders so many problems for decades.                  ,motorcycles,cxo8l03,2,t5_2qi6d

Its true they do get finicky in cold weather and will behave like a dead battery but the chemistry of the battery simply requires that it be warmed up before cranking. This can be done by running the lights for a few minutes or simply cranking the bike several times. The battery will actually get stronger with each crank rather than weaker. The trouble is that many owners get frustrated with the apparent loss in cranking power as temps drop and dont like dealing with the warmup procedure. If youre riding in sub degree temps the last thing you want is a bike that doesnt fire up right away so we dont recommend them for cold weather riders at all.,motorcycles,cxsfw1w,2,t5_2qi6d

6108776,0,t1_cyjn2ph,The least common of the  stroke sports bikes of the late searly s. Kawasaki had the KRS Yamaha had the TZR Suzuki had the RGV and Honda had the NSR. Arranged in order of commonality. The RGV was then reborn as a Aprilia RS in the late searly s using a very similar engine design same gaskets and bottom end.Honda Yamaha and Suzuki were probably the best. Aprilia benefited from improved suspension the Suzuki RGV did have USDs too. There was a surprising amount of technology in these bikes. For the Honda it has a cassette transmission racing type on all models dry clutch on many models and programmable ignition using a card system like a Snes with maps from HRC only on the MC.Unfortunately there isnt much to keeps these bikes going. Hopefully people who started producing replacement parts for the old CBsvntage bikes will look at the  strokes. Honda especially seems to be relatively disinterested in supplying many critical parts to keep these bikes doing such as rubber intakes and chain sliders and main engine bearings can cost over x the cost for bearings of similar sizing.,motorcycles,cyk07bl,3,t5_2qi6d

That can remove the ridge thats painful. but dont press too hard. youre compressing the EPS lining minimally...My only complaint is the top two air vents are near useless for actual airflow unless on a sport bike due to your head position on some bikes. so all they do is aid in not fogging your visor.the chin vent is FANTASTIC. but leaks air a bit.The venturi vents in the back are awesome however.The chin flap is awesome. but can pop out really easy.My only complaint with it?

6186535,0,t3_40a0jg,Situational dependent. And also my gut.Once I was on a lonely stretch of road in northern BC and passed a bike with car parked behind it. Two people were standing by the bike and I figured hey help has arrived and everything is ok. But my gut said otherwise so I turned around and stopped. Turned out the guy had just bought the bike and was on his way home and it was his girlfriend in the car. I had tools and supplies and he said that all he needed was oil. It made no sense to me but I gave him oil the bike started right up and he was soon on his way. Another time I was taking an early spring ride through the neighboring hills when I rode through a small farmstead. I saw a man laying on his stomach near the barn door and I assumed that he was crouching down to look at something. But again my gut said no and I went back. This time it was an old man who had slipped on the ice and hit his head. He was unable to stand up by himself so my husband ran to find his family in the nearby farmhouse while I tried to reassure him. Most of the time I will slow down for a stopped motorcyclist and give them a thumbs upthumbs down signal waiting to see how they respond. For the times that Ive been the one on the side of the road I didnt do anything special with my helmet but I must have looked distressed because someone always stopped.,motorcycles,cysueov,2,t5_2qi6d

But I can do long days on the Daytona but you need to build up a bit of core strength and get used to the riding position to be able to do long rides on it.My point is for you if you have trouble getting out of the saddle to lean avoid a super sport type bike.

6195915,0,t1_cytscpm,Youre mistaking two very different things. Timing of compression waves is important during the intake stroke the idea is you want to use the available momentum of high velocity air to push more fresh charge into the cylinder so you close the intake valve while youre in the compression stroke. BUT there is also compression waves bouncing back and forth in the intake manifold so there is a time when that compression wave hits the intake port into the cylinder during the compression stroke where that short burst of air density outweighs the remaining available momentum in the flow. Thats the point where you want to snap shut the intake valve.For the exhaust stroke as soon as you open the valve the pressure inside the cylinder is much higher than the external outside pressure. So everything naturally wants to get the hell out you emphasize this by opening the valves during the ending of the expansion stroke. Part of the reason exhaust valves are smaller than intakes the other is incoming charge air through the intake ports actually has a speed limit but I digress. Now here is where it all comes together valve overlap back pressure causes a higher pressure in the exhaust manifold so it forces inert burned mixture back into the intake manifold where it gets sucked back into the engine and acts as a heat sink. It causes lower engine efficiency but acts as a natural emissions control. So what the hell why does removing your exhaust kill your power. Turns out you need to completely retune your engine to run open like that. When you pull off the exhaust your pressure isnt from inert exhaust gasses its from fresh oxidizer. So oxidizer starts flowing into through your cylinder and into your intake manifold leaning out the fresh charge mixture which cause the mixture to burn hot part of the reason why you can damage valves. All of a sudden that careful tuning we talked about before goes out the window. TLDR Taking off your exhaust fucks with your engine and makes everyone around you want to pistol whip you.  ,motorcycles,cytwrbl,2,t5_2qi6d
6196090,0,t1_cyttn2f,You want to ask uelkster.But here goes. The early CB four was not the best engine Honda ever made.  it was undersquare unusual even in those days and didnt take kindly to being overrevved.  Early racers found them blowing up.  To be fair it was developed into a tougher engine.It also had two camchains  an idea that Honda also tried on the contemporaneous CB and CBX.  The exhaust cam was driven from the engine and a second chain linked it to the inlet cam !.  The success of this engineering can be judged by the fact that Honda has never used it since....Then they decided to fit a completely superfluous highlow ratio gearbox which added weight and complexity.  As the C was also shaft drive with a significant weight penalty this meant that it was as heavy as depleted uranium.The cruiserstyle chassis and geometry was useless  adapting a sports bike to be a cruiser is rarely a good idea  and the handling and steering were considered lousy even for the era.  The original CB was always thirsty and the extra weight and inferior aerodynamics of the C made it even thirstier.So you wound up with a pigugly bike that weighed a ton didnt go very fast wasnt the most reliable thing out there drank fuel and which also was lethal at speed in anything other than a straight line.,motorcycles,cytxh0r,1,t5_2qi6d

Just pay attention to the material and you really cannot lose.The practical skills is where things get a little more complicated. I have ADHD and anxiety so paying attention was very difficult although I think my coach did a poor job of describing our exercises as well. Not being the first or last person in the line gave me something to focus on.If youre familiar with driving a vehicle with manual transmission you should have a better time with translating those skills to different parts of your body. Your left foot on a car being used for the clutch right foot for gas and brake. well your left hand is for the clutch left foot is for the shifter right foot for the rear brake right hand for the throttle and front brake. It becomes super easy once youre on the bike for  minutes and learn how the bike behaves. Later on when you get a bike youll have to practice to break yourself of some panicsituation reactions like stabbing brakes or staring at something you fear and end up going wide and hitting it as a result.Theyll have you put into practice some things that you covered in the written portion. One of them being FINEC. Fuel ignition neutral engine choke... or some shit like that. You can see the myriad acronyms here Once I got on the bike and my hands were accustomed to the shitty clutch and throttle response I was golden. The bikes they pick inspire a metric ton of confidenceRebel s and kawasaki eliminator s.

I agree that motorcycling in an area like Los Angeles is different than in most of the United States but not that much. The thing is you and I would agree that the majority of motorcyclists are good and safe riders who take the sport or hobby or whatever you want to call it very seriously but there absolutely is a reason that people think poorly of bikers and its those same something hooligans youre thinking about. The truth is they represent a statistically larger portion of our group than the fast car drivers do of all car drivers again because of selfselection. You are absolutely correct that in Southern California there are more utilitarian and commuter riders than in most of the United States but how different really do you think the demographics are? I would wonder if there wasnt a larger portion of young writers in SoCal just based on the areas make up and diversity of age groups. Since Cali actually has the largest proportion of  year olds at  of the overall population click on the  arrow who are I think we agree here most likely to be total jackasses on the road. How many times have you seen a comment on here to the effect of this is why everyone thinks that motorcyclists are dick heads. Etc?Also as to your assertion that fully onethird of motorcycles registered in the United States are in California firstly that number is simply not correct secondly when you adjust it by per capita California actually not that high on the list since you know California has between  and  of the United States population a handy pie chart Californias at about th and th on bikes per capita. The top states? The Midwest. For context Cali has  people per bike according to my calculation though thats with old registrations vs new population the ranking site I linked has Cali at  which is probably correct with that years population I couldnt be buggered. numbers used are here for population and the bar graph I linked before for bike registrations.

So definitely a Hayabusa and a ZZR a ninja HR while were at it.Probably have a GSXR  because well theyre the quintessential litre bike to me.Oh and a ducati monster that sound is phenomenal.Oh a victory gunner would be in there for sure as would an Indian chief classic and probably something like a Harley XL.An old Ural WD for sure  I want to take a Ural accross russia and down the road of bones eventually.Then maybe another adventure bike a GS I just want one ok theyre not the best selling adventure bike for nothing. And a KTM  adventure.Then probably a KTM  Enduro R gotta have a good off roader.Id also want a few project bikes just cheaper and interesting stuff. Id keep the bandit of course.Oh and a grom.And thats just if I had to narrow it down I mean seriously I want ALL the bikes. ALL OF THE BIKES.Except the Honda Deauville.

6305577,0,t1_cz5zf80,Motocross racer here so not a road rider. The correct answer for us is always to grab an ass load of throttle and get loose on the bars. Hold tight with your legs dont tense up and dont panic. Some arent savable and grabbing a hand full of throttle when you think you are going to die is very hard to do but it was the best choice for us  of the time and Im  confident its the best choice for road riders as well. That being said this guy is at a pretty steep lean with it starts to slap because of those rumble things so it might not have been savable. ,motorcycles,cz6dg2t,2,t5_2qi6d

Both of the robbers have very lose helmets so a quick stop would really fuck them up. The riders goes over his head or face and screws up his vision the passengers goes into the back of the rider.                   On top of that the passenger isnt really holding on so quick brake would either smash him into the rider or make him fall off and most likely cause the bike to lay down.Im kinda lost at what the guy in the video was trying to do. The robbers were on his left and slightly behind so his planned action of fake exiting then hard left would just put him in the same situation.

6378474,0,t3_4302q0,Me and a mate did a  day ride in the Moroccan deserts years ago as guests of KTM for the KTM EXC launch it was great beautiful scenery and the people were great.The only reason l have not been back is the riding and scenery is very similar to what we do in the deserts of Central Australia so for us it was not challenging but we were invited because of our competitive dirt bike racing back grounds .We did  days in the Atlas mountains which was fantastic and my favorite bit as we had already done a heap of desert ridingracing here in OZ.Heres a video that shows a good mix of the country and riding IMO get in some fitness training before you go so you can enjoy it more and buy a good quality Camel Back set up and get use to using ittake loose fitting cotton clothing with you for after ride wear like Australia it is the best for the climate.Make sure all your riding gear is ventilated and cool and properly broken in before you go and dont skimp on anything you will be a long way from proper medical care.Sections will be very rocky and a lot of time is spent on the pegs so make sure your boots are up to ittrips like these will really improve your riding and l dont know why more people dont do them enjoy you will have a ball.PS I received a couple of PMs asking about the music in the video its from this and just happens to be one of my favorite background music for doing paperwork etc so is why l picked it. And l was asked about the food in Moroccoit was great and nothing to worry about in fact it hooked me on BBQ Goat and l had never really worried about Dates before the trip but after it l often  grab some of both when l come across good quality ones in markets etc. We mostly as a group ate lambgoat and chicken although on the final night l had some of the best stuffed pigeon Squab l have ever had l am a hunter so have eaten a lot of dovespigeons etc around the world and it made me regret not looking for it earlier in the trip.What l was surprised about was the locals love for grilled sardines etcl always like to try different things while traveling and as we eat a lot of lambbeef and seafood in Australia l usually try ordering different local dishes in other countries.Over all food was very good so you dont even have to worry about that part of it.As long as you do a bit of research on the tour companies rep and they run good gear l would go for it even if it is only basic accommodation etc.I have done a bit of riding around the world and with off road riding l find as long as you can get clean have a feed and put your head down for a decent sleep its all you really need as most times you will be that worn out from the riding its all you needwe actually said on this trip it would have been good to spend a night camping out in the desert rather than in a town.  ,motorcycles,czenwa5,3,t5_2qi6d

Not too shabby on noise. Havent used it in at least a year prolly get rid of it soon.Also have an HJC. Pretty loose but salesperson was a pretty girl.

Presses a bit on the forehead and Ive lost several of the plastic bits on the air holes. Fairly quiet and the pinlock kinda works but not as well as Id hoped. Nice to find a XL helmet that isnt black though  White   redampblack highlights sweet. Firm fit no shaking even at kph mph despite bluetooth headset and gopro.Just ordered a Schuberth C. I tried a Schuberth S before and didnt fit so the nearperfect fit of the C in the store was surprising to say the least. Plus also available as XL in colors. Eager to see how it holds up on the bike.

Equipment Sponge  labeled as dirty sponge or DS Sponge  labeled as clean sponge or CS Softbristled toothbrush labeled as TB Drying rag  dirty rag DR made from old Tshirt Drying rag  clean rag CR made from old boxers or other soft material Chrome polish Very dirty rag or VDR used only for chrome polish  gallon bucket Washwax solution best if multipurpose Warm water    Procedure Fill bucket with warm water  full. Squirtdrop in some washwax soap  tablespoons Use CS to stir watersoap mix. Use CS EXCLUSIVELY on the following areas helmet windshield paint headlightturn signals and chrome. Go slowly with the CS to avoid dry water spots. Dry immediately with CR used EXCLUSIVELY on the areas mentioned above. Washdry each area one at a time. Use DS EXCLUSIVELY on the following areas engine tireswheels under the bike. Use DS roughly at first and finish slowly so as to avoid dry water spots. Dry immediately with DR used EXCLUSIVELY on the areas mentioned above. Washdry each area one at a time. As needed use the TB to clean the wheelstires or other tough spots.    Rules for chrome polish DONT use chrome polish on plastic chrome parts.Now ask yourself the following questions Have I ridden through a puddle today? Was I caught in a mild drizzle or other varying precipitation? Did the neighbors sprinkler system become possessed and spray the bike? Was the bike parked outside and morning dew formed or there was fog?If you answered yes to any of these polish the damn chrome. Use the VDR to polish.    Estimated time to completion  minutes   hour  minutes depending on how dirty the bike is If you have chrome to polish  hours total depends on how much chrome your bike has    Resultsgt And thats how you get an  Suzuki GSG to look like it came right off the assembly line.

6519033,0,t3_44pf1r,This is actually a great bike for the price IMO. You see them all over China and Asia and they serve people just fine. It is a workhorse. Ive ridden nearclones before and theyre great for darting through heavy traffic and muscling into really tight parking spots. Super lightweight and with plenty of space for three adults on the seat. But the electrics throughout the bike tend to have faulty contacts just to name a single issue. There are others where that came from too. The savings are not worth the repair headaches IMO especially when you consider that the tank only holds about two gallons and the engine cant keep up with freeway traffic moving at speed. At least not in the US where Chinese bikes are super rare parts will take ages to arrive and labor is expensive and choosy.There are good Chinese bike manufacturers out there who make quality products different enough from Japanese offerings to be interesting to firstworlders at least as a second or third bike just for fun however even those are designed with the Asian service and riding environment first and foremost.

By increasing the surface area while keeping the normal force constant you decrease the pressure per unit of area thus friction is only proportional to the normal force and the coefficient of friction for a Newtonian object.

Go to the Alps and wherever you want in springsummerautumn and to Spain in winter if you wish to do a winter trip.,motorcycles,d01zfvf,1,t5_2qi6d

Sos live rock music.  Ever meet a musician with hearing loss?  I bet they spent less time on stage than you do on your bike.   decibel is also louder than a power mower see many professional gardeners who dont wear ear plugs?.  For reference  decibel is more than twice as loud as the value above which regular sustained listening causes hearing loss.The trouble with hearing loss is you dont notice until its too late.  I already have slight hearing loss after riding for just a few years.  Most people dont notice until theyre already firmly in hearing aid territory my moms husband is still adamant he doesnt need them even though he cant carry a conversation unless youre right next to him.  You might want to ask your doctor about a hearing test the next time you see him I think youll be surprised with your results.If youre worried about not being able to hear your sena I can tell you that I have one too and can actually hear it better.

You need compression when you crank the engine over.You need a source of ignition a spark. Sometimes the ignition system doesnt work right but thats rare.Sometimes things change like you dont get the air coming into the engine because the air filter is plugged up or the pistons dont compress the air because the valves arent closing completely because they havent been adjusted in a long time or the piston rings are stuck.But the most common thing that goes wrong with engines equipped with carburetors is that the carburetors get plugged up with gum and varnish from evaporated gasohol.You wrote that you smelled something like burning gas and like I said before the mixture might be so lean that it doesnt burn in the cylinders it burns in the exhaust pipe instead.You can disconnect the spark plugs and check for a strong purplish blue spark and you can check the valve clearances but I would still be willing to bet BigHatNoCattles herd that the carburetors are plugged up.,motorcycles,d07gj18,1,t5_2qi6d

You have to either let the clutch out smoothly all the way or have it in. You do not hold it part of the way out. I have been riding since I was nine and have always a rode my clutch when I needed to. In the end they told me that the way I ride is not normal operating conditions for the bike so it is bound to not work right at that time. Is that true?

6767961,0,t1_d0jefqu,If you have a leak from the top of the bowl You almost certainly have a tear in the gasket. You have either a sticky float valve or a poorly adjusted float.  If your bowls are filling to the point of leaking from the tops of the bowl... pull the spark plug from that cylinder when you notice it morning or after its been sitting for a while... can you smell raw fuel? due to the leak I am going to suggest that youa disassemble and clean the carbs but reassemble using good quality rebuild kits containing jets rubber float valves etc making NO CHANGES to the jetting size needle jet or needle clip. b do a FULL TUNE UP according to and in the order specified by the procedure as set out in the Clymer Manual for your bike. Buy a good old fashioned paper copy of it and keep it with the bike at all times. Put it in a ziploc bag and store it in your saddlebag.Once all that has been done IF YOU STILL HAVE ISSUES do a google search for  plug chop test.Essentially its a diagnostic test to see if the jetting in your carbs is correct but its useless without all other components air filter ignition system from points to plugs being correct. YOu buy a bunch of new plugs gap them correctly ride somewhere quiet preferably on a slow rising hill that gives you a good solid  km run. Install new plugs hop on start the bike and jam through the gears as quickly as possible under wide open throttle until in top gear your RPM are in the high numbers. This gets the engine sucking fuel through the MAIN JET. Then once youve kept it in this range for a couple km you pull the clutch lever kill the engine with the kill switch and coast to a stop Without letting the RPM drop before killing the engine.Get off the bike chill for a bit to let the engine cool... then pull the plugs and use them as a diagnostic tool. You can find good resources on line for this. The colour of the porcelain will indicate if youre too rich too much fuel or too little air or lean too little fuel or too much air the colour change on the strap indicates timing being advanced or retarded. The colour of the ringfiring tip will indicate richlean at idle when the time comes to check thatThe chop test is for the main jet size. Once the main jet is correct. Then you work on mid range... which is controlled by your needle clip. Then your idle gets checked. Which can be done with a shop tachometer.Then your carbs get syncd. Which can be ballparked when assembling them but for best performance requires a Sync Tool.All this will make sense as you learn. But for now? Buy a CLymer Manual sign up for forums dont get overwhelmed and be methodical and organized. Also know when to tap out and find help.Also BUY THE RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE JOB. If you plan on wrenching on your own bike its going to cost you some cash at the start.Old bikes are tons of fun but they can be frustrating. Having to wrench when everyone is riding can suck but... knowing how to fix anything that goes wrong with your bike is the ultimate freedom and you never need to worry about where you are or whether or not you have cell reception to call a tow truck.Plus nothing in the motorcycle world compares to riding a bike that only runs because YOU made it run.,motorcycles,d0jffrm,3,t5_2qi6d

The judge took the officers word even after the officer said he never saw me he only heard me and it sounded faster than the posted mph. I argued that I was at a stop went from first to second within  yards and wasnt going that speed because I had to turn.

6779254,0,t1_d0kfaz2,Good information here. Id sort of counter the argument for sport bikes vs. standards Triumphs from experience in other busier cities of the world. I found the standard layout works best in lane splitting and also maneuvering because of bike geometry. They have shorter turn radius and more flickability at low speeds. Additionally the newer triumphs have good amount of torque which is what one needs much more than HP which serves city riding better. Check out Royal Jordanian and hell attribute his best lane splitter to be the Nuda because of the truck loads of Torque it hasBut yes Ive also seen far more sportbikes on the streets than anything else although the  bikes that live on and around my block in Manhattan are everything BUT a sportbike.

I overshot my turn and put the front tire off the pavement. Lucky I was able to come to a full stop as soon as I did but I was so panicked I forgot to put my feet down. Needless to say the bike a  Suzuki Intruder  started to tip over. I threw my feet down and pulled with all my might to lift that beast back upright before it hit the ground.

Be thorough with your cleaning dont take shortcuts. If you can get carb dip use it. The spray can cant compete to a proper dipping. Hope you dont have the same luck as me.

6851930,0,t3_49ls3g,I recently bought a bike and started commuting. I work in a law firm so its full suit and a tie each day. Crucially for me I can take the train to work if its raining so that makes things really simple.My set up is as follows Ties  I have some ties at work and some at home. If Im on the bike I have a tie waiting for me when I arrive if Im on the train I wear a tie from home. Suits  I own multiple suits. One Suit  stays at home and I leave the jacket from the other Suit  on a coat hanger at work. If I take my bike I wear the pants from Suit  under my motorbike pants. If its raining Im on the train in Suit . Shoes  I have a backpack that can fit my motorbike boots or work shoes in it. When Im on the bike the work shoes are in the bag on my back and I change over when I get the the office. The bag and boots sits under my desk. Motorbike Jacket and Pants  I bought a waterproof motorbike jacket and waterproof pants that go over my work shirt and suit pants when Im on my bike.I try and swap the suits around every so often swap Suit  in place of Suit  shift Suit  to Suit  etc so that Im not in the same suit every day. Thats important if you have a couple of weeks of good weather and youre on your bike every day. Im in the southern hemisphere so we are just getting out of summer but even in midFeb I found I wasnt getting too sweaty in a shirt and motorbike jacket in the mornings.

6858278,0,t3_49p28m,I live in Denver which is actually a pretty diverse city when it comes to motorcycles.  A lot of cruiser people come out when the weather warms up but I see a lot of adventure bikes a lot of sport bikes and a lot of standard bikes too.  My general observation from talking with motorcyclists subject only to my own perception is that cruiser people are not interested in discussing the motorcycle market at large.  I still meet a lot of guys on cruisers who are surprised to learn that traction control is even a thing on two wheeled vehicles.  They just arent paying attention to anything outside of their little world.  There are exceptions to this of course and I dont mean this as a slander Im just a poseur on a fake adventure bike after all.  But to the question of why dont cruiser people participate on a forum concerned with the entire motorcycle market I give the answer cruiser people are not interested in the entire motorcycle market.,motorcycles,d0tp0q1,1,t5_2qi6d

6874946,0,t3_49uylw,Ok.  I dont exactly know the situation.  But I do understand countryhilly roads and the nature of the yellow divider lines.Whoever is doing the riding is a gd squid.  I dont care if this style of riding is sanctioned by the group or not.  If he gets plastered by oncoming traffic I would not in the least bit concerned for him.  This is totally unsafe and we should never ever be advocating this!If this were an unsuspecting group of Harley riders or any other group and one took to overtake the entire group in this fashion I see multiple problems. While Im watchful for other riders behind me they surprise me  of the time whether Im in a cage or on  wheels.  This causes me to react.  I hope its for me to pull to a safer position for them to pass but thats not always the case.  Involuntary reactions are involuntary for a reason. Traffic engineers in rural areas are conservative in their placement of yellow line traffic markings for a reason likely because visibility is obscured for inlane or opposing traffic.  Both parties must be considered. At one point this squid was traveling well beyond a safe speed likely close to mph to pass a group of riders on a doubleline broken opposed or brokenrightside travel lanes.  Sure it was mostly straight but with enough visual obstructions that a fatal mishap could have  occurred. OP or Original Recorder I hope that you understand what a hazard you became to traffic.

Tboned by a car desperately initiating a protected left turn even though I had the right of way and was holding the horn  seconds before impact. Moto cop saw the whole thing too. Young adults with vans trying to get of L.A. after a Clippers game have no patience and also bump you off your bike while you are lane splitting all while performing very erratic and frequent lane changes.Conclusion be visible. ,motorcycles,d0zuvir,1,t5_2qi6d

Youre not so important that you get to ram cars out of the way just because getting out of a space properly is too much time.

South Downs New Forest Stonehenge is on the A and if you fancy it Devon amp Cornwall are popular with domestic tourists for a reason. take  days to get to Bristol if you do. Then cross into wales on the M Severn Crossing. Head north from anywhere here you cant go wrong! South Wales is really great for biking especially the small back roads youll want at least  days to get up towards ManchesterLiverpool. Dont skip Snowdonia.From here if you have time Slog it up the M to Penrith a good stretch of scenic motorway  and come back down through the Lakes and Yorkshire Dales to York. if not head straight across.Do York and then Slog it down the A or if you have time do the Peak District on your way back to London.Doing it this way round means you can slog out the boring ride if you run out of time.,motorcycles,d12bg95,3,t5_2qi6d

Im not going to stop doing things big or small to either help people or make their day a little brighter just because someone on the Internet thinks its selfserving and hopeless. I still think you have a shitty outlook on being nice. I work hard bust my ass and dont ask for shit from anyone either help or praise i just know people need help or a small gesture from time to time. I do  small things for people i dont know to show that there is some good out there. If you believe in what Im telling you or not thats on you not on me.

This setup is probably ideal If you go the tubing route its  ID stretch the opening if necessary. Sometimes I heat it up a little dont burn it and shove a screwdriver or something in it to flare the end.Just remember to close the valve before removing the tubing dont over tighten it either!

Dude wouldnt give my shit back saying he had the right to hold it until the traffic stop was done and I really didnt want to escalate as my job requires me to be responsible for up to  million dollars of merchandise at one time. An arrest can really fuck that up. Basically from here on out Ill have everything paper copy and never surrender my phone again. Btw you sound like the rational cop that takes their job seriously and I appreciate that and appreciate everything you do. Just one question while I have you here.

Because of my misshapen noggin the helmet Im looking at is the Arai SignetQ ProTour which at  is a bit out of your price range.

I had a quick flick through the video and at several points the rider dunno if its you is just revving at people for no real reason. Clearly theyre not expecting vehicles to be cutting down the middle of stationery traffic and this is how you make car drivers hate motorcyclists. When filtering look ahead and plan. Obviously cars will be moving about thats what they do. Yes people will be out of their cars if its at a standstill but you spot it back off let them go and hell  even give people a wave if they move to help you out. Making out that car drivers should be prioritising you at all times isnt the way to get them on side.

Also when you cant see the fog line or road the road markers in this case giant yellow arrows and the white poles can help paint a picture of the corners radius and elevations change.

7118543,0,t1_d1n8wuz,Bikes also usually obviously classics dont have a tipover sensor so theyll kill their own ignition if they go down. Its usually a gravity switch so lean in corners doesnt affect it because the bike is leant with the cornering force so local down is still from head to tyre. Newer cars also have them of course  its a very cheap fitment especially in a relatively size and weight unconstrained car and anything that reduces postcrash fire risk is a Very Good Thing indeed. The killswitch is there for a couple of reasons for one it lets you shut the engine down without taking either hand off the bars which may be necessary if for instance you get a stuck throttle at speed or just convenient clutch in thumb off key off clutch out is arguably the safest way to turn a bike off while leaving it in gear for antitheft and roll reasons. In the EU and possibly the US its a legal requirement on new bikes which is why its always red always those symbols and always right thumb. On top of that cars will have an ignition kill when any of their impact sensors are tripped  if the airbags deploy then the ignition and fuel pump are practically guaranteed to get shut down and often in midspeed crashes where the airbags dont go off but the sensors still log a crash theyll also trip the internal killswitch. Depending on car this might be an off and on and itll start up or a oneanddone permanent shutdown until you take it to a mechanic. ,motorcycles,d1nahrp,2,t5_2qi6d

7136201,0,t3_4db0ib,Another point that I didnt see mentioned you can also lose water by getting too high voltage at the battery from the charging system and overcharging the battery. Id get water back in the current battery charge it up off of the bike and then check the voltage while the bike is running and make sure it is within spec usually . volts at k rpm but check a manual to make sure.Also a dead battery can kill your charging system depending on the bike. Some barely put out enough amperage to run the lights and recharge the battery at idle a dead battery is a decent load on the charging system which can result in other failures rotor breaking down from heat for example.,motorcycles,d1pb3do,5,t5_2qi6d

7145362,0,t3_4dex4q,Without seat time its gonna be hard to really be ready for it.  You seem committed to this getting a bike now an option at all?  I would also drive the car more man If any of my car accidents happened to me on a bike I wouldnt be here.  You need to be  comfortable with the rules of the road and know how to predict other drivers intentions.  Being predictable and confident with your action on the road is easily the most important driving quality to have.  As well as read other drivers especially on a bike where people WILL do things that are extremely stupid and irrational just cause they didnt see you.   Your statement on the need for markers is another reason you really should at least get much more road time.  Do you have access to a manual car?  I had been driving stick for a year prior to motorcycling and I found the use of a bike clutch basically effortless comparatively.  Good luck and remember you clearly have all the skills to operate the bike because as you said you were doing it fine in the open area.  Its just when things become unfamiliar and unpredictable you dont trust your instincts because you havent driven long enough to hone them.    ,motorcycles,d1qcp7r,9,t5_2qi6d
7145687,0,t3_4dex4q,Without a motorcycle to practice I would ride a bicycle to practice. Mainly low speed manoeuvring. Basically what GrayMountainRider said.Also I would ride a bicycle in a parking lot with other cars parked to get comfortable.Also watching many different Motovlog and see how they ride corner handling at low speed.If it does becomes too overwhelming and start to worry again in  days.Minimize the amount of things you need to do then build up on it. For example cruise around in first gear and only focus on the handling clutch friction point  throttle and rear breaking then once youre fully confidence with nearby cars and who ever else then build up to adding front braking then Shifting.The last paragraph could be really bad advice but if you start to worry last thing you would want is to be overwhelmed.Edit.

7148078,0,t3_4df9kl,Its simple.You thought the turn was much wider than it was.  That embankment on the left was hiding much of it from you.You accelerated at the worst possible time just as the turn tightened up.You then realized the turn was much tighter but you were sitting upright not ready to lean the bike mover more to make that turn.You panicked a bit since you werent comfortable leaning the bike over more.  You braked this stood the bike upright you probably target fixated a bit too then you went off.Good job on keeping it up and slowing gradually and not slamming on the brakes.Look through the corner.  Find the exit.  THEN you estimate the correct speed how much lean you will need whether you will need to hang off a bit.Slow in fast out.Also approach turns in the opposing part of the lane.For this turn you should have been almost touching the white line on the edge of the road.  For a right turn you should be almost touching the yellow divider.This gives you extra visibility through the corner to see the exit as well as any danger like a stopped tractor.  Once you see the exit you can accelerate touch the other side of the road the apex and thats how you get your biker grin.,motorcycles,d1qnvlr,8,t5_2qi6d

7203161,0,t3_4e2ukh,ClymerChiltonHaynes will typically make a repair manual for your bike. Get one of those. It will help you if you need to do any more intensive repairs. Pick up a torque wrench after getting the manual as you will be able to look up the torque ranges and get the appropriate wrench.You might also want to pick up a screw driver set and a metric hex key set.Finally you might want to get some tire spoons and some tubes and learn to replace the tube in the tire.

The small inchpounds and large footpounds torque wrenches are also a very good idea.  Also recommend a multimeter for dealing with electrical stuffs.Other than that it looks like everything that is needed for most maintenance  and even some major stuff  is already shown.Oh a Thandle hex andor torx wrench set is often needed when you start taking off side covers and valve covers and sometimes fairings though if youre trying to keep your kit small get a good set of driver bits and the snake extender thing for weird places that are hard to get to... like valve covers.But again on a lot of bikes you can get a lot of miles before those are necessary.,motorcycles,d1xacfi,3,t5_2qi6d

7210227,0,t1_d1x9cgx,Any issues with the clutch levermechanism should be easy enough to fix unless you have to replace the clutch plates or something. Its possible that the chain or sprocket is too worn but that isnt a particularly hard problem to fix though might cost a bit of money. Figure about US for a decent chain and about as much if not a bit more for new sprockets.Bike sounding bad could be a number of things and is hard to diagnose. Worst case scenario you might have to do some engine work which might take some learning but the hardest part is getting the engine in and out of the frame. You should probably try to find a repair manual for your model year that you can reference when doing any more serious repairs.What do you think about how it runs? Any issues starting the bike idling or accelerating? While it can be hard to capture with a microphone maybe you could post a clip of the engine running? Also you should post a picture of the other side and a close up of the chainampsprocketspull the cover off to expose the front sprocket first.,motorcycles,d1xqvsf,1,t5_2qi6d

Something that you also need to develop to ride a bike at low speeds is working with the friction zone of the clutch.  With a wet clutch like a motorcycle clutch you can let it slip some in order to make the riding smoother and more controllable.  Thats something else to practice.,motorcycles,d1xvi62,8,t5_2qi6d

Multiples of most wrenches sockets ratchets extensions etc. Vice grips channel locks pliers. Screw drivers of every type with sets of various bits. Electric cordless and pneumatic power tools. Punches bars hammers chisels. Nice to have a chain rivet tool too if you plan to replace your own chains. My one tool that I use more than absolutely anything else is my Milwaukee v impact. Along with a set of impact rated bits and adapters for  and  sockets. I would recommend one of these to anyone who owns a bike.

A motorcycle is coming up from behind and begins to overtake us. Right as he is m in front of us a deer sprints out from the side of the road just like in this video hitting the motorcycle rider in the front. It was a small Suzuki Supermoto.We were at about kmh. He wobbeled two times to the left and right then fell and rolled over a bunch of times. We stopped called an ambulance and tried to help him but he died pretty much immediately.I really hate thinking back to this. I was a fresh volunteer fire fighter so I had some basic first aid skills. But I absolutely froze up had no idea what to do. Fortunately some other passerbys came soon and helped too. But in the end there was nothing we could do.The police questioned us at the scene we told them everything in all the detail we could. Then we went home and never head anything of this again.

THATs the shit right there. That perspective is going to teach you more than overanalyzing your wrecks ever will.MSF courses are a great idea if for no other reason than we go so little lowspeed experience on a bike... a couple parking lots maybe a residential area... but all that detailed shit you learn at low speed in a parking lot around cones under the watchful eye of an MSF instructor is GOOD STUFF. And it translates to higher speed riding as well.Stupid little bit of bragging from me... I moved back to the USA after almost  years away. I immediately bought a bike a  BMW Rrs and had to get recertified because my US drivers license had expired.So I took the MSF Experienced Riders Course FIVE DAYS after buying my new bike.After the course the teachers told me that I was an amazing rider and I had clearly been riding my bike for a long time. My bike and I moved like one thing in harmony.I then told them this was my th day owning the bike and their eyes popped out. Dude. You wanna teach this course?

So the best we can do is concentrate our focus on situations that warrant more attention. Like intersections parking your bike and merging.In most cases like this the rider has a lapse in judgment at the unfortunate but opportunistic time for a collision to occur. This was an intersection and warranted more attention. To a degree I would argue that this is only the kind of thing you can learn from through experience.You might think youd have better wits about these things but youre going to fall. Im going to fall and when it happens should it end up on footage thousands of riders will watch it and tell us everything that we could have done differently.Hindsight is .

A bit of a deeper look showed that the bike had been hastily repaired to look good. I could see frame damage hidden behind paint and fairings.Walked away after that.

Just tossing in a few notesThe grom looks like serious fun Ive seen a few riding around my neighborhood and I drool every time but thats partially because of the heavy media attention the grom got in the start and partially because its such a small likeable machine. I cant help but think that it would be fun to toss around because its so small and light that it would be easy to control in virtually any situation.In the real world however I fear that the novelty will wear off pretty quickly. cc pretty heavily limits what roads you can ride on and the bikes design amp equipment means that its not the best suited thing to offroad riding either.   As ucortechthrowaway said something like the TW is going to be much more durable and capable offroad while simultaneously having enough power to manage short highway rides if necessary.

Didnt say anything about not being tuned right snapping the throttle plates closed does some physics black magic that creates a temporary lean condition too lean to ignite in the cylinder  which then causes an ignition inside the exhaust where the conditions are more optimal.F cars have done it basically forever  especially in the naturally aspirated eras  and GP bikes noticeably do it.   Nothing improper about their tunes at those levels.  TVR also used to do it in purpose by leaning them out when you snapped the throttle shut  and I want to say Pagani does as well. ,motorcycles,d2ins8d,1,t5_2qi6d

Putting risers on without extending the cables...opps...not doing proper TCLOCS before a ride and waving bye bye to the nut that held my clutch in as it flew over my shoulder as I pulled into the parking lot at work...oopsAs for you and your height. I cant speak for you on that but I will proudly declare because I am damn near a foot shorter than you Ive had to have both my bikes lowered. Best bet is to sit on that particular bike youre interested in. If it doesnt work meh its a Shadow. Go to a dealer and see if it fits you.

Still... super rare to get a wave.It was always my theory that the stereotypical demographic for sport bike riders were too busy squidding and less concerned about being a part of the friendly motorcycle club.  I now know different after reading here... but still I dont see too many waves.Side note its always SUPER fun to take a new person for a ride and tell them watch this and start waving to bikes and seeing them wave back.

7515693,0,t3_4iahlc,Carbon fiber is also something thats not a specific item but general term used to describe what its made with. One company that creates a carbon fiber fairing might use cheap carbon fiber with a very low thread count weave and polyester resin while another will use top of the line carbon reinforced with kevlar and epoxy resin. The difference in these two is comparing apples to oranges its not only strength and weight but the cost is considerably higher as well. BEWARE of companies that use fiberglass and carbon they are making a fiberglass fairing and overlaying the outside with cheap carbon fiber for that carbon fiber look and charging you for carbon fiber. The result is a fairing thats worse for an everyday bike than ABS but cost more ...  some are even using carbon graphics on ABS and charging you more. ,motorcycles,d2whwdo,1,t5_2qi6d

7554923,0,t3_4iqvh2,You hit a major point when you said ...only riders will understand.  However you were only partially correct on that.  That feeling is called passion.

The guy who collects stamps and stares everyday at a picture of a  emergency war stamp until he can get one that lady who smiles every time that one particular shade of red convertible sports car drives by for us its that rumble of an engine and watching a guy lean in to whip around a turn.Where Im going with this is that because most people have a passion this is the angle to approach your parents with.  Be humble explain that you went through the pain and while you cant imagine what they went through you still feel it and thats it not just a desire its a passion its in your blood.  Theres going to be pain probably anger and a variety of not so pleasant emotions as the moment replays through everyones head again.  Explain it again gently you remember waking up in the hospital explain the pain you felt at the pain they went through and that you cant shake it its a passion.  Explain your plan to keep it safer out of the congestion of the city prepare to shoulder more heaps of anger and remembered pain.  It will pass.  Eventually.Great story and thanks for sharing.

I ended up with cervical spinal cord damage at my C amp C vertebra. The neuropathynerve damage associated affects my arms and hands terribly. Not to mention the chronic neck pain and migraines.Also developed chronic pain syndrome as a result of the brain damage or overwhelming damage to my central nervous system. So many things can lurk and not show up till later. My lower spinal cord damage was a result of a pars damage which went undiagnosed eventually letting my spine slip off my S. Im just getting started to..... People just dont understand even completely geared up there is just no defence against impacts. I even had a spine vest under my jacket that also has spine armor.My point is these can be life altering accidents and some injuries appear later on. Please get checked out.

7599132,0,t1_d35z1vo,Shells Rotella oils are intended for diesels that class of oil is commonly referred to as HDEOs heavy duty engine oils. I know it seems odd to use it in bikes but theyve worked great for me so far and they are quite cheap. The thing is that most motorbikes those with oil shared between the engine clutch and gearbox are very hard on oil. The transmission is constantly chewing up the oil and causing it to break down shear and lose viscosity much faster than say a cars engine oil that does not see the inside of a transmission. These heavy duty oils are designed to be more resistant to shearing than your typical car oil and sadly enough a lot of oil targeted at motorcyclists.Ive been riding and wrenching on bikes for over  years now and it is my opinion that the most effective preventative maintenance anyone can do is change their oil before its worn out sheared used up additives being depositedburned off or acidified. The cheapest way to do that is diesel oil hands down.Oddly enough some of Shells Rotella diesel oils meet the JASOMA specification which is for stroke motorbikes.,motorcycles,d35zeo0,2,t5_2qi6d

RPM.Say a  ive never ridden one this is my best guess. can do about  kph max in first gear this will require about .RPM thats the redline for a CBR  i think?. If u go to  kph in second then shift down you will mechanically overrev that engine past the redline.Hence why I as a nonmechanic.

County route  in Franklin county is great but can be sandy and is residential. Past that it goes to great tarmac with few driveways not residential mostly fishinghiking entrances. The problem becomes too many idiots thinking they dont need to stay in their lane. After that you can take a left and hit Old Meacham Rd. which leads to route . Ive never taken the whole thing but apparently its a great route which seemed to be confirmed by how many bikes I saw on it Saturday.

Because gloves amp helmets are the two things I will ALWAYS buy in person if Im unsure about which make model and size to go with.  Having just bought new gloves amp helmets a month ago myself I ended up buying different makes models AND sizes of each than I had originally intended on buying when I walked into the store.  I walked in planning on buying a medium Arai Vector  and medium RevIt Jerez gloves... walked out with a small Arai RXQ and Held Phantom IIs in a size  smaller size than my previous Held Phantom gloves. I was very glad I went in and tried the stuff on they also cut me a better deal than I would have gotten from RevzillaIf anyones in the area this was at Seacoast Sport Cycle in Derry NH.

7780566,0,t1_d3qkf0w,gt Im not talking about trail braking to the apex here. Just delaying the brake release until the bike is turned is still beneficial.Read what I said again im not saying its not beneficial Im just saying that it doesnt outweigh the added complexity of doing  things at once which can be critical for beginners. If you learn to brake straight up turn the bike then accelerate out you are doing one thing at a time which is a lot safer for inexperienced people to manage. I trail brake all the time and I teach it on the track but I dont teach it to new people. If someone just wants to cruise back roads without going fast its better to brake straight up for the above reason. Same as body position  want to go fast? You better learn it. If you dont care about going fast through corners you dont really have to hang off. gt If you are releasing the front brake fully before turning then you are initiating your turn on a light front tire as the suspension rebounds.Actually its the opposite. If the tire is rebounding its pushing the  bike up and by the equal reaction force the tire is being forced into the ground by the inertia of the bike. So you get more traction. But again that effect is only significant on the track. On the street it really is minor. ,motorcycles,d3ql3kx,1,t5_2qi6d

They were probably looking for papers and I figured it was a opportunity attempt. Went back to my garage daily to check on it and found the cover for it disturbed more than once talk to the police the company that rented me the spot in the garage but since nothing more was touched they wouldnt do anything. One day I came there and the bike was on its side mirror busted up ignition screwdrived to hell and lots of scrapes and bruises.

I cant tell you how many questions I get asked a day at work that can be answered by reading the owners manual. I know people that buy a new lawn mower they read that book cover to cover. They bring it with them to the store when buying filters and plugs. They can tell you model numbers and tolerances. The next day they come into the store asking for a part for their car and they have no clue what motor is in it what plugs or oil it uses type of light bulbs or they come in asking what a light on the dash means. All of this shit is in your owners manual. Next time you go to a Pick and Save salvage yard take a peep into glove boxes I will bet you that many if not most will have the owners manual in pristine condition.

7930405,0,t1_d47dtwp,gt Is something like this even worth reporting? I have the tags from the full resolution video. I go round and round with this question about my videos too.  My personal conclusion is this I want their insurance company to know about this more than the the police.  In my experience unless someone was hurt the police have far more important things to do than track down a motorist to issue a ticket in hopes of correcting their stupidity. But their insurer does have a vested interest and would definitely like to know the driver they are covering is a liability.  Imagine the surprise of the driver when their insurance company sends them a letter stating that they are no longer covered because another motorist showed the company a video of the driver doing something illegal and putting others at serious risk. IMO that has a higher chance of getting drivers to wake up than the police issuing a warning and at best a ticket.  Unfortunately I know of no way to find the vehicle insurer from the license plate number.  Too bad because I have dozens of videos like this from my cages dash cam.,motorcycles,d47gajw,108,t5_2qi6d

Add in the additional maintenance you might have on a bike depending on the bike and insurance which may be higher on a bike than a car for a college student again depending on the bike and location and it may not be that cheaper.I was reading a guys comments here a while ago and he figured out that his F was cheaper per mile traveled to drive than his cc super sport.,motorcycles,d4fmay9,1,t5_2qi6d

8005179,0,t1_d4ft5vo,gt Even on my  you need to be in th gear doing k rpm to get to . But does that matter? My bike only does about  rpm at mph but its redline is below  so where does that leave mine on the highstrung scale at highway speeds?I do think my hp bike is a bit underpowered when were talking upgear and going uphill thats when you want double that power because hp just isnt cutting it. My bike cheats and just downshifts by itself so I have it easier than most and I can get by with less power because its easier to exploit but hp is still not enough for those kind of circumstances. That said in all the time Ive used my underpowered bike I can honestly count  or  of these situations where I really just needed more power. At any other time even at mph or up in hilly terrain I may have wanted more power but I didnt actually need it.So TLDR hp is definitely enough its enough to comfortably train your neck muscles with a mph windblast so passing at mph is an afterthought and uphill grades dont really exist. gt What I need to find is a advtouringstandard type non  cylinder bike with around cc.How about the new Honda Africa Twin? cc twin with about hp.

It is a tight technical course that lends itself to the smaller bikes... but even at a bigger course where engine power plays a later role... that guy would have schooled anyone in intermediates on any turn.So the tldr version  a  css class bike can be fast as hell when ridden well.

Just take a second to consider that youve spent good money improving the sound of a not so cheap new bike only to ensure that you can only here a comfortable amount of the noise you paid a premium for.

8118302,0,t3_4qd4m1,Dang man.. you got it started once! I would hate to see you spend  on what might be an afternoons tinkering. Motorcycles dont break themselves and thats a good thing. Let me give you a VERY basic understanding of what makes the thing run. Compression For now think of it as the inside of your engine being in working order FuelAir mix coming from your carburetor Spark from your spark plug. Electricity  Things.. When I work on a bike I am constantly running those three things through my head to clues.Now for my diagnosis. You said it ran a month ago. This implies to me that you have compression working engine and that your electrical system makes electricity based on that you need spark for an engine to run. I think you need to do two things that will cost you less than  dollars total. A new spark plug. Do this first and nothing else. Youre gonna have to look up the right spark plug for your bike and buy it. You may need to look up videos for how to change it if you dont know but it is very easy. Try to kick it a few times and see what happens. My guess is that it will start up and sputter out pretty quickly.At this point you are gonna need to give your carburetor a cleaning using carb cleaner you can get all wallmart or any auto store. You will need to look up videos to understand how the carb works and how to clean it. This is a bit harder but my  year old self did it on my own and it all turned out fine.Feel free to message me if youre having trouble. I wont tell you how to do anything but ill point you in the right direction. Good Luck!,motorcycles,d4skj3s,2,t5_2qi6d

Were talking about breaking someones mirror because they wronged you. That has nothing to do with defense. Dont downvote me because you dont like that I disagree with you. Its petty.

8131233,0,t3_4qlyr9,? Wow thats depending on the rim size a really flat ratio...Another key difference between your  and the Fi is likely the bikes lengthwheel base. While it wont be an epic amount  versions of bikes are typically longer than their  relatives.Of course this is a bit apples and oranges or Suzuki and Honda if you will since were not comparing a same year Gixer  and  or a same year CBRRR to a CBRRR.But as a general rule a  will be longer.But a wider tire fit to the correct rim for it will give you a larger contact patch. The superwides like s yeah  those are for looks. But for the modern  sport bikes running s or even  its not so much a show thing.

8131780,0,t3_4qmasp,Did it have a switch before? Does it now? If not gotta add one.The easiest method is likely via a pressure switch banjo bolt. You remove the existing banjo bolt at your front brake master replace with said switch and bleed the system of the air you just introduced.A mechanical switch would need a mount and way to toggle it. But with something like the DRZ you should be able to track down any of the parts off a road going version that youd need to implement a mech switch  Which might be the master lever and switch  but might really only be the switch and whatever screws as its cheaper to make one master and lever that more bikes share,motorcycles,d4u32xh,3,t5_2qi6d

Only it wasnt charcoal just a motorcyclist giving lightning the lowest impedance path to ground for its final  feet.Like uSlidePanda says the protection you get from a car isnt there on a bike.  The metal cage of the car gives lighting a really good path to ground down to the last six inches or so.  Likewise your body is a much better conductor of electricity than air is.  So if a lightning strike is unfortunately close to your head it will go through your head and body with much higher probability than through the air.  And thats when you get cooked.tldr if lightning is nearby when youre out on the bike you should think about seeking shelter or ride next to someone or something taller.,motorcycles,d4xz0bj,1,t5_2qi6d

8176712,0,t1_d4zkndp,Perfect explanation. What most people dont realize is that theyre already doing it  its practically subliminal. On bicycles especially.But on a heavier motorcycle its more pronounced. You have to either consciously actively counter steer or just ride long enough that you do it equally strongly without thinking.You have to do it to turn you literally cant turn without it. But for easy turns the countersteer required to make the turn is so small and subtle that you may not realize you are doing it.But in order to do a hard tight turn the countersteer required is much more pronounced and requires a conscious effort for most everyone.However if you have ridden for long enough and never knew about what countersteering was your brain probably learned to countersteer harder without thinking about it and thats where you find the people that claim that they dont need no fancy countersteering.This is actually what happened to me. Although to be honest I have barely ridden motorcycles myself. I am using my experience riding tandem or loaded cargo bikes to compare though. At first I had trouble turning because they were so heavy but over time I got better at it. After reading all this and going for a quick spin on my bike it all clicked. What made me get better at turning heavy bikes was that I had figured out countersteering without actually realizing it.TlDr youre already countersteering dumbshit,motorcycles,d4zn0b1,0,t5_2qi6d

8180096,0,t1_d4zkeca,Now youre just trolling. You are arguing about completely vague terminologies.I contest that the relative crosswind experienced by the bike is not the same thing as the ambient crosswind... I am not convinced that you even have enough understanding of this subject to debate my statements.I agree with your crosswind comment which is why I was surprised to see you talking about trig when discussing crosswind. Its clear to me now that the crosswind your talking about is aerodynamic lift which is a function of angle of attack forward velocity etc. Crosswind has a very specific meaning in fluid dynamics and youre using it incorrectly. Crosswind is an ambient phenomenon lift is specific to the object. Its confusing to me why youve used them interchangeably. Specifically im talking aboutThose people need to learn trigonometry! Of course the speed of the bike affects the relative velocity and strength of the crosswinds. Imagine you are sitting on your bike not driving pointing North and a  mph wind is blowing to the East the wind is facing you at . Now if you drive  mph North the crosswind will now face you at  with a relative wind speed of  mph. If you increase your speed to  mph the wind will face you at . approximately with a wind speed of . mph.The  mph is the crosswind. Any increase in lateral force due to an increase in forward velocity has not increased your crosswind youve added aerodynamic lift to the ambient crosswind so now you have two forces occuring. Both are upsetting forces but theyre not the same. Only one of those scales with forward velocity.I dont care how harsh or not that you might consider your statements... Ive spent enough time with Internet discussions that I really dont care what the heck you think.If you have nothing useful to say... say nothing at all.I must disagree with you on the facts because these are factsThe relative velocity of a crosswind around a moving vehicle is influenced directly by the velocity of the vehicle.Only if your crosswind is aerodynamic lift.The faster the vehicle is moving the lower the angle of attack produced by the crosswind.Again lift.The strength of aerodynamic forces tend to increase by speed squared so doubling the relative speed can double the side force even if the angle of attack is divided in half.Yes.Motorcycles are not fully faired because in addition to the obvious practicality issues fully faired bikes are less aerodynamically stable.Aerodynamic stability has a very specific meaning in this context. To say that fully faired bikes would be unstable is just....weird and wrong.Racing motorcycles could not benefit at high speeds from full enclosure because aerodynamic instability would impair their handling and reduce the speeds possible in curves.Bullshit. If the design space is wide open then ailerons spoilers etc are all fair game.,motorcycles,d5027xo,1,t5_2qi6d

Less about the actual lever travel because that will change based on available traction and more just the feedbackfeel through the lever bike tires etc.  A lockup or nearing the limit feels similar whether its at half brake power or full brake power.  And if youre able to practice in a handful of different conditions you have more experience to draw from when in the real world.  If youve never practiced it at all then youve probably got little to no idea and if your tires lock or ABS engages you may just panic from the unfamiliar feeling.,motorcycles,d52yqwz,0,t5_2qi6d

8219854,0,t1_d550tje,This is a pretty open ended question  how far is the longest journey you plan to take with it?  Most proper sport bikes are pretty uncomfortable for journeys gt  miles.When you say price isnt a problem are you looking for brand new?  Used?   Do you have any experience in dirtbikes previously?Im a big fan of a fuel injected Suzuki SV as a first proper sports bike for a newbie.   Reliable as a dump truck lots of power and does well on the race track should you decide thats your thing along with being inexpensive to maintain.It has more than enough power to not be boring but not enough to get you into heaps of trouble unless youre looking for it.They were made from  onward and are still in production and come in both s sports version with a fairing and lower clipon handlebars for a very sporty riding position and n naked version with no fairing and upright tubular handlebars for a very comfortable ride in town on back roads and on longer journeysDont fall into the trap of thinking you need a  horsepower monster as your first bike.

My favorite roads are  Tight narrow technically challenging mph undulating and elevation changing mountain roads then next I like smooth medium speed flowing canyons mph ndrd gear where you can relax more and just find a nice groove Then the slightly faster same type of roads but with the hard braking zones separating the straights from medium speed long corners and lastly my also favourite road is southern californias fastest mountain. Ive got a good run on video I posted where you can reach maximum speed and the corners are all highspeed mph and a few very intense hard braking zones. Its also almost traffic free which is great. When I ride it though I take with me a spotter and our way radios and use my ear piece so she can tell me if there happens to be any cars coming from the other direction.

Also Im  lbs so Im looking for something that fits my body. I had to do a decent amount of work to the DR to fit my body and even then its a little cramped.Ive been thinking a standard or street fighter type bike.

Hopefully they arent getting any ideas for stoppie control though. If I had to guess the only reason they dont do stoppies as much as they back into corners is because you have nearly no ability to turn while in a stoppie whereas when you back in you not only have both wheels on the ground but you also come into the corner turned already. Also you presumable have more control over a slide than a stoppie if you need to change direction.,motorcycles,d5vfzy0,2,t5_2qi6d

8455497,0,t3_4vhs99,Mate it sounds like your bike needs a bit of a service in general not just the oil. Since most  stroke motorcycles combine transmissiongearbox oil and engine oil your engine oil could be affecting shifting and the idle problems. But they could be coming from else where. Idle problems could be fuel delivery air delivery could be as simple as a new air filter or spark plugs. Or the oil as stated before.Shifting could be the gearbox giving up thats rare though unless the bike has had a very rough life. Or the clutch needing replacement. Either way Id start with the oil its easy enough to do and cheap. Intervals are bike dependent and best to check your manual. Every .k miles seems fairly standard practice though or once a year if you dont ride that much.,motorcycles,d5yh0af,7,t5_2qi6d

If youre not doing long rides on I in the rain youll be OK. If you do mile rides in the sideways rain like me youre gonna get soaked.I cannot overemphasize how great heated grips are. Worth every penny.Get good tires. I have Metzlers that have rainfriendly tread patterns. Its noticeable!Have a good tall windshield? I recommend getting one. Helps a lot.Long underwear. Get a good pair or two absolutely necessary when its much below .If its going to dip below freezing just dont ride if theres even the slightest hint of precipitation or fog. I got it in the fog one morning. Leaving work after night shift it was clear and . Came around the big bend on  and right into freezing fog. It was pretty harrowing and I almost had it too. I went down on ice literally in front of my house.Stay off the bike if its going to be windy.  mph winds dont sound bad until theyre throwing you into oncoming traffic.TLDRYou can ride yearround here but you mustGet good gear get a few good accessories for your bike pay really close attention to the weather stay in if its windy or freezing and accept being wet.Good luck!,motorcycles,d60qewo,3,t5_2qi6d

I did try some etching primer without pretreating and can peel paint off my side covers and it looks terrible.I see the PO pulled your brake master cylinder.  You may want to rebuild your front calipers before you take it out of neutral.  The pistons are steel and will pit allowing for your fluid to seep past the rubber seals.  Based on the NY plate you have water in your lines and the pistons may be siezed in the calipers.

I know in Michigan you can ride up to a cc scooter that goes less than mph with just a drivers license. I just had to buy a sticker for  that is good for  years and slap it on. A moped will give you the idea and balance and road experience of a motorcycle without the abundance of power. It should be a good starting point..

Which basically implied they would race from cafe to cafe and it was kind of a place to socialize and meet up with friends and like minded individuals. Also I think the cafe racers bikes were modified in such a way that it made them more sport oriented for example youll notice that many cafe racer bikes have handle bars that make the rider sit in an uncomfortable crouching position much like you would see on an old track bike for racing. Many of the cafe racers favored the CB series. Today it is kind of a hipster fad to fix old cbs and turn them into cafe racers. Never been on one personally but a lot of them look really nice and very uncomfortable to ride. I hope that covers everything .,motorcycles,d6gonw6,3,t5_2qi6d

What is so special about nitromethane as a propellant? Gasoline is a regular old hydrocarbon requiring oxygen to properly react and combust. Nitromethane on the other hand has two oxygen atoms within its own structure that it can use to react. This allows the nitromethane to produce MUCH more energy and allows the engine to intake less air for combustion to actually take place despite nitromethane having less energy density than regular old gasoline. In essence top fuel dragsters which if memory serves me correctly are limited to .L of displacement and are allowed forced induction make  HP typically. A similar gasoline burning engine would have to be around  LITERS of displacement to be able to compete. And then obviously the size of the engine would negate any of the benefits. There is a channel on YouTube called Engineering Explained that goes into this subject in much more detail if you are interested. Oh and methanol is also added to the nitromethane in the fuel. The max ratio of Nitromethane to methanol is  and can vary based on tuning and whatnot.,motorcycles,d6md7go,3,t5_2qi6d

8775182,0,t1_d72b42i,gt It is not lean but countersteering that makes the bike turn. Thats not right. I dont think you can countersteer without leaning. Although to be technical leaning is what makes a bike turn. Countersteering is just the first thing you need to do to get there. The leaning part is a result of countersteering. Simple physics will tell you that leaning is what makes a bike turn.Without lean a bike will not turn when going faster than about mph.Edit Im speaking of bike lean. The video you posted shows the rider trying to lean himself. That is clearly not how to turn a motorcycle. I think most people associate countersteering with bike lean and vice versa.However at slower speeds you can lean off the motorcycle to get a smaller radius turn without adding lean angle. My road was recently patched up. They filled in a lot of the cracks. Leaning around the turns on my street feels incredibly sketchy going over the slick filled in cracks so instead of normal bike lean I stick my own body out and keep the bike upright which causes the bike to want to turn to whatever side I am leaning on while having a reduced lean angle.,motorcycles,d72kcmi,1,t5_2qi6d

Lettting me know your intentions is all I ask for on the road. But one thing I despise is when someone impedes my travel by pulling out in front of me when there is no one behind me and another second or two would not have affected my forward motion whatsoever. Lane changers cause this same issue once in a while...pulling into my lane for no apparent reason forcing me to change lanes or slow down when if they had waited I would have been past them in a second or two and no action would have been necessary on my part. In this case even if there was no real need to change lanes on your part I would not have flipped you off because you signaled. This guy apparently felt different.

There are short articles on exif about planning your build in a visual sense. After that for a beginner all you really need to do is go to a cafe racer online retailer to purchase aftermarket parts youll install on your bike. To save money maybe go to wreckers or look online for old parts. You could also do most of the work yourself and get a custom shop to do the hard stuff.I will say that being comfortable turning a wrench is important. Learn to do basic maintenance.

So I just did a oil change and I put  quarts of oil in my Vulcan  and I dont have a dip stick I have a glass peep hole I guess you would call it and when its turned on and idle the oil level in the peep glass goes down to low and when the bike is off it shows its full so what Im asking is should It show it is full while its idling? heres an album of what Im talking about  also when I shift down to first at a stop sign or whatever reason to stop it sometimes stalls  out? Is this something to do with the oil? Thanks in advance. ,motorcycles,d7alnq6,1,t5_2qi6d

8867522,0,t1_d7dqtwh,Having been on a  supersport for a little over a year and a little over K miles now I can say that a naked middleweight is probably a better option. FZ or something similar. Really the only major difference is that supersports are less comfortable and more built for high speed. You can tell yourself all day that youll be safe and responsible and youd go the same speed on a naked sport as you would on a supersport but when youre in the full tuck and mph pulls start to feel normal youll realize you should probably get a slower bike. Thats why Im looking to downsize either to get the Bandit  basket case I have in running condition or get a  supermoto. Having access to that much power all the time just gets you in trouble. Any reasonable person who has ridden a supersport for a while will tell you the same. Im not even a squidly person but the bike just brings it out in everyone.,motorcycles,d7dr2no,3,t5_2qi6d

They will fit best and if they dont take them back for a remake! protect more be more sanitary nonporous silicone as opposed to opencell foam and cost less over time. Look for an audiologist or industrial hygienist in your area that does custom hearing protection. You can get solid silicone or filtered ones. Filtered come in a range of protection levels and will have more of a flat cut so they wont change how things sound just reduce the volume overall often referred to as musicians plugs. I wear solid silicone personally as I also use them when using firearms. Filtered plugs will be more expensive. You can also have plugs molded around your favorite pair of ear buds of you listen to music while riding. If you cant afford plugs typically start at around  then SINGLE USE foam will do fine if inserted correctly. But... like any piece of protective gear invest in the best!Under kmh wind noise is typically not an issue. If you are doing any sustained riding over that speed though you should be wearing protection. The wind noise above kmh is typically into damaging noise levels across several studies including with a fullface helmet.You will be surprised just how much more alert and less tired you will be after a long ride wearing plugs.

Most people are perpetually dehydrated and that really doesnt help in this class. . You are one with the bike. The bike only does what you dont want it to when you fail to give it instructions. . Lean opposite to the direction youre turning for tight turns lean with the bike for gradual turns. . Most of my learning happened in the nd day of riding. One the first day I couldnt even reliably find neutral for the first hour and a half but I ended up finishing the course withought a hiccup on the test. . When going in to a turn regulate your speed so that you dont have to brake. Dont touch the brakes while in the turn. Period. Try to have fun! Theres nothing at stake during practice exercises. Its ok if you mess up. Focus more on having fun and learning than simply not messing up. Dont be afraid to watch everyone else so you know exactly what to do. ,motorcycles,d7hntnj,2,t5_2qi6d

8934159,0,t1_d7lq1nn,Not all slippery slope arguments are fallacies.  Take the literal slippery slope argument  If you start sliding down that waterslide you wont be able to stop until you reach the bottom.A slippery slope argument if A then inevitably B is a fallacy when A does not inevitably lead to B.  If you allow gay marriage then youll have to allow bestiality next.  Thats a fallacy.  If you allow gay marriage then the probestiality activists will be encouraged to fight for bestiality legalization.  Thats not a fallacy.In other words if you give an inch theyll take a mile is a fallacy.  If you give an inch they may ask for a mile is not.The health cost argument as commonly stated is itself flawed reasoning.  Health care is expensive to society.  X causes health care expenditures.  Ban X.  The problem is that after you ban X health care is still expensive.  Furthermore there is a false valuation going on.  It is easy to put a dollar amount on health care.  It is hard to put a dollar amount on fun.  This argument then treats fun as worth nothing because it is hard to value and its my fun vs. your dollars.If you use symptom A to justify solution B when solution B will not remove symptom A then symptom A remains a justification for any future solution C D E etc. with the same validity.The health care cost argument is not always flawed reasoning!  However to be valid it must properly value the activity it seeks to restrict and not simply handwave it away as  because its hard to value or you personally place little subjective value on it.,motorcycles,d7lr5ax,1,t5_2qi6d

8950949,0,t3_52vx21,Helmets.  You can safe helmets for reasonably cheap. When you start going more expensive youre not buying safety but comfort weight noise etc.  Sharp ratings in the UK are a guideline but not perfectly accurate as the tests arent the best. And some helmets are actually designed to get high scores there rather than the real world...Jeans.  Denim will last .s in a slide and then youre going to burn through flesh.  There are plenty of articles out there showing what happens to your flesh in that event. Its not pretty.  You can get kevlararamid lined denim though but the coverage is important there too.  So get those or get proper textileleather pants.Jacket.  They dont need to be all singing all dancing. Make sure its got armour in the shoulders elbows and  if possible  the back.  Your options are leather best textile or mesh. Mesh is only for the warmer climes... Textile is more likely to be waterproof.Gloves.  Most are fine. Best if they have armour in the palm and the knuckles flying stone chips hurt. Palm armour is because youll stick your hands out to brace your impact instinctively.  Fit is the important part. Badly fitted gloves will make your clutch and throttle work terrible.Boots.  Ankle support is important. Shin armour is good too. If possible you want something thatll prevent the wrong movement of your foot if you land wrong in an accident.As mentioned elsewhere  EARPLUGS.  Tinnitus sucks big time. Dont think that ringing will be fine itll go away soon. Eventually it doesnt.Costs? Aside from gloves look at  each minimum.

8958571,0,t3_52zngs, people will give you  completely different answers. For me Id probably go with versatility. I want a bike that I can ride for long periods of time but is also maneuverable enough to be easily handled in tight spaces like downtown. I also want it to be able to have some amount of off road capability but also be a really decent street bike. I want to  be able to have lots of aftermarket part support and be able to hold lots of luggage. I also want it to have a very capable and powerful engine. So with all of my desires in a bike out there Ive found that the Suzuki VStrom  ABS is a perfect fit. The only downside to the bike is that its not necessarily the best looking bike but its versatility and capability is what really nails it home for me.

Most bikes requires a new crush washer which  of the time people choose to ignore and reuse the old one and torquing the bolt with proper equipment and to factory spec almost always gets the blame if it leaks. For some mystic reasons hand tight everything seems to be the magical solution and applying random amp inconsistent torque force by Jedi mind trick became the meta method of ArmChair mechanics. I dont get it. I am no pro mechanic and none of the mechanics I know will just hand tight stuff believing it is better than using a proper torque wrench and following factory specs.If you try to use a mouse upside down and it doesnt work it is not really the moused fault.

And then to compensate for the blue filtering the filaments are driven a bit harder to achieve even that lousy luminosity so theyre dimmer and have a shorter life.Ironically despite Sylvania being a brand under the Osram umbrella the Osram Silver Stars are brighter and arent that same blue tinted shit.

The TCS functions both as traction control and wheelie control.  The XSR has a mode that allows wheelies while still preventing rear wheel spin.. No but Ive only taken the bike up to mph like twice  I have no desire to go that fast frequently.  I have done extended highway riding at mph and never experienced it..

9408642,0,t3_59huck,Welcome to the wonderful world of commuting!Things you may expereince on your journey There are alot of really pissed off people on the road. If you lane split especially where its illegal you will experience their ire via their disagreement call horn and various movement of their digits and flailing. On occasion one will attempt to attack you by blocking your way but you will outsmart them by using nimbleness and small stature. You will become aware just how scary driving society is. Youll be able to spot the real dangerous ones typically driving a mini van a suburban or a high end luxury SUV. Youll get quite familiar with bumper stickers and those little stick figure families that seem to be everywhere. Do you enjoy the smell of carbon monoxide? You will. Get ready to enjoy that one vehicle in front of you that brings the joy of that sulfer scent.  Getting out the door quickly hahahahaha. Put on helmet jacket gloves boots. Go out to start the bike up and let it warm. Go back inside realize you need to drink some coffee take off helmet. Put helmet back on realize you didnt put ear plugs in helmet off then on. Get on your bike realize you didnt use your chin strap take gloves off so you can manipulate your chin strap. And off you go! Of course this is worst case scenario. Is it  degrees outside? not for you it isnt. Wind chill factor mother fucker. Man driving with a clutch in traffic really sucks. wax on wax off repeat add nauseum. No need to clean your face mask the guy in front of you will be spraying windsheild wiping fluid in your direction shortly. Your likely going to be smelling a lot of weed.  For some reason people love to smoke weed and drive. Also cigarette butts will fly your way. Indented sewer covers and man eating pot holes. Its kind of like a minefield. Step carefully. Do you have an office job? Get ready to get all your gear off again! Time to go home! Put all of your gear back on. Realize its not longer cold from the morning now your sweating your ass off.And you will do it all again tomorrow bc riding is awesome! Although their will be days that you will take the car and you will appreciate it so much more. But the riding addiction will come back eventually and youll need a taste.,motorcycles,d98m0oh,23,t5_2qi6d
9408819,0,t1_d97z0sv,Was the FZ totaled by insurance?  This all varies GREATLY state to state.  In Ohio when a vehicle it totaled it is issued a salvage title.  You cant register drive insure a salvage title.  When the vehicle is fixed you take to the State Police for an inspection and once it passes you are issued a rebuilt salvage title.  You can plate license insure a rebuilt salvage title like any other vehicle.  Once it is rebuilt the title can never be clean again it will always be rebuilt.A salvage title affects value but not enormously in Ohio.Other states handle this differently so do you own research.,motorcycles,d98mtqw,2,t5_2qi6d

Generic WD isnt.Soak it let it sit for a while like over night with a couple light does and then again about  minutes before you have at it.Next up  heat and impact toolsThen we start getting destructive with items like EZouts and grinders. Youd have to cut off that nut and then you have a chance with getting the bolt out. If the nut is cut off you might be able to drive the bolt out if the clamping bits arent threaded.If they are then try turning the bolt out again penetrating oil on the threads. If its head is stripped  time to drill. Id suggest you run down some lefthanded drill bits. Common bits are right handed  flutes cut when spun clockwise. Lefties flutes are set counterclockwise. So if youre trying to remove a bolt and need to drill lefty bits wont further drive intighten the bolt.

Under mph you wont have enough inertia so you just steer in the direction you want to go.Just jump on the highway and pullpush a little bit as if you were turning.

If your trickle charger has a cold weather setting now is the time to use it. Because of the cold temperatures effecting your battery it may be that your charger isnt sustaining a currentcharge level high enough  to be as effective as it would normally during warm weather. That or your battery is old and needs replacing.Use a voltmeter to get a better idea of the state of your battery and find out whether you need to replace it buy a differentmore capable charger or remove the battery from the equation entirely and look at the possibly gummed up fuel linesfuel filter.,motorcycles,d9xxnmc,1,t5_2qi6d

Most apartments I live in use weight sensors. You can tell because there will be a large rectangle spanning the width of the lane. Sometimes it is hidden. Either way find at which point a car opens up the gate and use where its front wheels were to find the weight sensor. Then move your bike sideways over that sensor. With  wheel your bike wont be heavy enough to trip the sensor but with the weight of the whole bike it should open. Hopefully this helps.,motorcycles,da11bjm,3,t5_2qi6d

But looking through the specs this V RR has carbon fiber wheels better acceleration faster braking overall weight savings which are known to be fairly brittle.

9659508,0,t3_5dd8sl,So if he says it ran.. try starting it. bring a fresh battery and some new gas. Also fwiw you dont need the clutch to get it in gear. just push down on the shifter as you roll it fwd. itll click right into gear. If you really want to check compression buy a  gauge with multiple adapters for different sparkplugs autozone sells them cheap and bring that tool a battery thats charged and a charger and some oil. Now pull the spark plugs and test the compression. Put a teaspoon of oil in each cyl. and retest read about the differences between leakdown and comp tests the oil trick is good to test the rings but thats it. Anyway could be a great score if you have a little mechanical exp. and arent too retarded.

The goal is to get maximum drive out of corners so to do that a slight driftslide is ideal. Not enough and you lose potential exit speed too much and you slide too far losing forward drive.

9819407,0,t1_danf2ca,Heres fact for ya. Its been  years since the UK initiated the gun ban and another  since they began working on it. Not only did your homicide rates go way way up after the ban... nearly  by ... But even after cramming your country with over  new cops in  your homicide rate still took about  to  years to only drop back to just about where it started in the s. So it made shit worse and then eventually levelled back down to the same if not still worse PLUS youre now stuck with a Fuckload of cops. ,motorcycles,danhju8,1,t5_2qi6d

9844020,0,t1_daqeo3s,The battery on a bike is small and requires a significant amount of its total power to start. Your bike is not as fast at charging the battery as a car and requires you to ride around at speed in order to replace the power used to start it. Now for the water condensation forms inside your bike all the time. Its not a problem because when you go on extended rides it gets hot enough to evaporate. If you are only starting your bike in the winter than shutting it off you are pulling all of that moisture deeper into the fuelling system as it cannot evaporate. This is why people always tell you never to just start and idle your bike in the winter. ,motorcycles,daqp64k,2,t5_2qi6d

9861868,0,t3_5gk1nr,Well if it was me I always try to think of gifts that a person would keep a life time.    So bike mods... well... good chance this bike wont be around all that long.    Its kinda hard to shop for a biker now that I think of it... So here are my three ideas    . Custom fit Earbuds or Earplugs.  Its widely accepted that motorcycle riding is quite loud even with a full helmet to the point hearing loss can be an issue over time.  I for one wear IEM style headphones which both blot out a ton of nose and of course gives me tunes to jam too.  Yes there are common earbuds out there but you could get him custom made ones that are molded to fit perfectly in his ears. I personally love mine I could try and help you pick some out if you like the idea.      . less personal but nice to have is a front wheel bike stand    I have a three myself you just set it on the ground and ride the bike right inout and it holds the bike upright perfectly.         . Having a reliable battery tender is a life saver. Bike batteries are priceyfor what they are and dont last more than a season or two. Pluging the bike into the battery tendercharger at the end of the day keeps the battery stronger for much longer Ive gained atleast  or more seasons out of my current battery which normally are shot after less than two.    . a tender isnt that expensive so you could also get him a disk brake lock which help prevent theft.   ,motorcycles,dat0vz1,2,t5_2qi6d

So i did the best I could to convince him we went dirt riding just to show him i can handle riding on two wheels and am proficient with the controls. Then I took the MSF and passed and got my license. Then I scoured craigslist for a small bike that would be cheap to insure and nothing overly powerful for a new rider. Keep in mind actions speak louder than words and I think it definitely helped me in the long run when my dad saw me pay for my own MSF insurance and first bike as well as gear.

10105596,0,t1_dboqn7g,From what I understand most manufactures thin out the protective foam in order to fit the visor into the helmet. This reduces the protection level and SNELL wont even test helmets with internal visors. A couple of exceptions  SHOEI with GTAIR bumps out the shell of the helmet in order to fit the internal visor and keep the protective foam the same thickness. Most likely it would pass a snell test just like their other helmets IF snell actually tested that helmet but they dont so no SNELL rating.,motorcycles,dborrc0,1,t5_2qi6d

10112708,0,t3_5kmfxg,What I already ride  a Triumph Rocket III Touring. Why? Because its a blast to ride whether touring or not especially after you derestrict it and get it to  hp and have the endless amounts of torque it has on tap as well. The panniers are on the smaller side but weather proof and I supplement with a motorcyclespecific bag in my case from Kuryakyn on the luggage rack. It also looks like a proper cruiser metal and chrome and the large windshield helps with keeping fatigue at bay. It also has allday comfort big seat and comfortable seating position. It lacks some farkles but you can retrofit proper electronic cruise control onto it and heated grips of course. Also putting a TPMS on her and already have power outlets for the Phone on the handlebars for GPS duties. Of course for ultimate luxury cruising nothing beats a Gold Wing. And if youre going off the beaten path and need off road creds  probably the new Africa Twin. Decent on the road quite capable off road. Although if the offroad part means just tame gravel roads the KTM Super Adventure might be more exciting. The BMW GS is another contender but Id get one of the other two personally. ,motorcycles,dbpp18k,1,t5_2qi6d

10144458,0,t1_dbtozhv,Just sitting on it it almost feels the same. If you could go through corners blindfolded I think they would also handle about the same.  The big difference between the two are how they feel in town versus on the highway. Around town the  always felt gutless to me. The  has a ton of torque and you have to be careful not to accidentally wheelie. If youre doing a lot of stop and go the  is way more easy.However if you do lots of highway riding the  is better. It has a lot of wind protection and a lot more top end. It almost feels like a sport touring bike. I always felt like nothing with less than  hp could ever try to screw around with me because I could just blast away. The  gets a ton of wind. I dont think I could do long interstate trips on it until i get a windshield. It has plenty of power up to  mph but it feels like it falls off quick above that. It probably has a similar  to  as the  but thats where the  is just getting warmed up.

My commute is a little over  miles  minutes by moto  minutes by bicycle  mins. hours by car before parkingand you wont normally find any onstreet within a reasonable time. Driving during the day especially sucks and the vast majority of people take public transit. Most riding is local streets and highways are not particularly fast. Lane splitting is a must to get anywhere but it is not legal. The NYPD is very unpredictable in their enforcement of it. Most do not seem to care but some will use you to fill their quotas. Overall law enforcement attitude towards motorcyclists is negative however. Traffic can be so bad at times that even lane splitting is difficult.Youre better off with something narrow and light with good handling braking and acceleration. Top speed is irrelevant here.Electric bikes with like  MPH are probably better considering the lack of insurance and ability to park on sidewalks without issue use bike paths or store inside at home depending. Lighter weight and smaller form factor. The line is blurring and I want lighter narrower motorcycles for inner city travel.

10187385,0,t1_dbyow6o,No its a case of too much rear brake for the amount of front brake theyre using. On a bike like the CBR where itll lift the back wheel before the front lets go in good conditions if you want to stop quickly and your rear wheel starts sliding you use less rear brake. You dont ease off the front thats basically reducing your rate of deceleration just so your much weaker rear brake is slightly more effective. On a sport bike the fastest you can possibly decelerate is when all the weight is on the front wheel and your back wheel is just skipping across the ground without enough traction to do any actual stopping. In other words  front brake  rear brake. In an emergency stop thats what you should be aiming for not some other less than ideal ratio between front and rear brake assuming you have the traction to get all of the weight on the front wheel of course.,motorcycles,dbysoj5,5,t5_2qi6d

10223063,0,t3_5madq1,Hornets have notoriously sticky caliper pistons  on my old  Hornet the fronts used to get jammed up. You need to remove the caliper piston by taking the pads out and pumping the brake until it comes out note this is a messy job get a towel around the caliper and expect lots of fluid to come out. Then remove all the brake fluid from the system best way to do this is to soak up the excess from the reservoir using a paper towel then let the line bleed dry into a bowl or container using gravity. Then remove and inspect the caliper piston  it should be smooth and shiny if it has any corrosion realistically having low brake pads will have caused areas to oxidise that normally wouldnt so be VERY mindful of this in your case you need to replace it. This includes any pitting holes or dents or any sharp edges caused by rust or oxidation. Then wipe entire area clean check seals by removing them with a plastic tool and wiping clean  any nicks or tears and they will need to be replaced. Then put all back together again and use the bleed valve to rebleed the brake system you will need some new fluid to put in. Video to help is here Note its for a front but the same process applies for the rear. ,motorcycles,dc2uak7,2,t5_2qi6d

This should be obviously not a bike that fits any other need like daily commute a trip halfway around the world or anything like that. It feel to me it was specifically made for a very specific purpose and would fail miserably at anything other than that. I do ride my bike to work but also the trip last  times longer than driving my car  which I also enjoy. Not the same thing. I would suggest seeing it like this before disliking it for not fulfilling any particular purpose that while important for you personally it was not in the mind of the customizer.

There were plenty of DMV employees who told me that as well  even the one who tried to stop me from taking the test. The womans manager had to explain to her how it worked and why she was wrong. There will always be those people at the DMV amp on forums. I took the observation test in San Francisco because I never had a C class license. The DMV employee who usually jumps in the car with you just told me to go around the block and if I came back in one piece then I got my license.

10472750,0,t1_dcv17rv,Anyone who gets all pissey about chicken strips probably have huge chicken strips haha. But yeah its all in good fun and anyway the most fun you can have is after youre chicken strips are gone and you start getting into sliding and ripping up the rubber and laying darkies. So encouragingshaming sportbikes owners that are not new riders about chicken strips is something thats never going away. Its a good learning tool also for when youre new and still unsure of the lean angle limits. Just look at your tyres. Keep leaning more and more until you use all the rubber and there you go. Now youre very close to the total mechanical tyre lean angle limit. TYRE MANUFACTURERS put lean angle gauges on the rubber. So seriously  nobody should be acting all bitchy about getting roasted for having chicken strips. The real trick is to get the perfect suspension setup and geometry and use all of BOTH your tyres to the edge AND having them all torn up with perfect seashoresandy pattern where youre pushing the front coming into corners and on the rear from accelerating out of corners with bits of balled up rubber right at the edge that gets scraped off and deposited. Not hot or cold tearing though so it takes some time and experience to get all areas correct and have the skill to push the bike hard enough to get the tyres out of line So anyway... OP looks like a very round profile tyre if you want sharper turn in then a  section is much better then a  section. Over the last  years OEM fitment on sportbikes have gone from smaller flatter tyres to wider more pointy tyres. The effect is you fall in to the turns better and have more rubber at high lean angles. For your  try a nice  multi compound tyre. But no as it is now youre fine. PS If you want to learn more about what to look for in tyres and suspension setup Dave Moss is a guru in that area and there some good videos floating around of him identifying issues and giving informative talks so check those out if youre so inclined. ,motorcycles,dcv701q,1,t5_2qi6d

Right in the downtown area.gt It would suck to be rear ended because I cant split. The facts show that being rear ended is a greater risk when not splitting than being run over while splitting. Again you base your argument on pure fantasy.So sit in the middle of the lane like I suggested its the same thing youll be doing if you split and come down to a stoplight the only difference is youre not cutting in line and making others annoyed.,motorcycles,dcvf9fl,-1,t5_2qi6d

We here choose to follow the admin recommended  rule. So no more than  of a users actions may be self promoting. For us this almost exclusively effects vlogers. For every post someone makes to their own vlog they require  comments or posts anywhere on Reddit that arent about self promotion. This is incredibly easy to do for anyone spending more than  minutes a day on Reddit.This also doesnt affect most content producers on Reddit because most are active sitewide and never run into this issue. In reality the only people this effects are those who literally do nothing on Reddit except post links to their YT channel.If this rule can be improved upon and we can find a way of allowing this content while also curtailing genuine spammers then we are all ears.Remember this only applies to links submitted where OP stands to financially gain somehow.

Up here in the Pacific Northwest the police dont really bother us. We are respectful to the cars around us and I even have a picture of officers giving us thumbs up in their car as my buddy does a wheelie next to them. I would be lying if I said I havent ran before. Riding in big groups is the key though. Once you get good enough you can avoid them at any time really. It depends on how persistent the officer wants to be and how clever cunning and skilled you are as a rider. But you are taking a risk on the streets. If you want your risk to go down ride in a huge group but I have friends in SoCal and run from the cops every day. Honestly its not that big of a worry just stay vigilant and know when to wheelie or not.,motorcycles,dd6bdgo,2,t5_2qi6d

In a chase the guy trying to get away from someone chasing him is likely to cause an accident and endanger others lives and his own and the passengers not only that but also the guy chasing can be a hazard. If you really have to chase a helicopter would be best though even then the same principles can apply where chasing someone can put more lives in danger.   This is why it seems every country has different approaches some like in the UK will stop the chase and others in US will chase them forever with  helis or just blow them up sky high with a tank if you get enough wanted levelsstars. ,motorcycles,dd9ig4w,3,t5_2qi6d

You will need a certain number of hours before being able to graduate to a less restricted permit.Here is the important part though according to the Department of Revenues website in order to operate a motorcycle on a public road in Kansas you need to have a valid drivers license. Now I do not know  if that is true but many other states are like that. As a result I would recommend that you go for a full drivers license first.

10847765,0,t3_5v1ssz,Id love to see some.I think it could work too just unlike car commercials where they advertise a particular car the motorcycle commercial would have to either be a local commercial advertising a dealership or for a more widespread commercial advertise the very concept of riding and recommend their brand as a way to do it.  Theyd need to have a network of dealers willing to guide people through signing up for MSF and getting their endorsements or at least a website that shows people how to do it.  I think this could be successful though.  Riding carries the sort of freedom a lot of people could really enjoy and the right kind of commercial could bring that across.  That and talk about safety improvements ABS traction control better gear better training... mention how with those things riding is now safer than ever or something like that.  That and there are also practical benefits lower total cost of ownership than a car easier parking etc...,motorcycles,ddyvcup,6,t5_2qi6d

Cant get hurt if you dont fall down. This isnt an acceptable summary of what Im saying. Im saying that we as humans are poor at judging risk and consequence when it relates to ourselves.  This is a proven cognitive bias based on scientific research its an interesting and quick read And because of this we should be extra alert as to what we think the chances of crashing are as well as how much crashing actually would suck.gtI personally choose to help negate that risk by eliminating accidents via my riding abilities.

You dont start feeling it on skin but tongue can sure feel v until  to  volts depending on the person and humidity. If the motor is a zero motor then this is probably in the v range. Youd definitely feel it potentially really feel it but probably not too big of a deal. Some systems use closer to  or more volts and from hand to hand definitely has the potential to kill you current close to heart or even break bones from the muscles spasming. But they most likely have fuses at each cell if not one for each module. So even if you laid it down on a metal road plate or something it shouldnt be able to go into thermal runaway instead blowing the fuses.

11033898,0,t1_deinlq1,Eh the only time a sportsbike flips is if you grab a handful of front brake and squeeze. Most bikes will lock the tire and then skid. Proper braking and motorcycle control in general is all about moderation and being aware of your weight transfer. Start easy with a light touch and slowly increase pressure until you are stopped. Before I take a bike onto the road I like to feather the brakes a little at low speed to figure out where they really bite. Use your front and your rear during normal riding. Just realize that unless you specifically train for it under emergency conditions unless you have ABS you are probably going to lock one or both wheels up just from panic reflexes.,motorcycles,deio17f,7,t5_2qi6d

11163921,0,t3_5ze8os,So if youre in th or th braking with the clutch engaged and dont decide to downshift until you stop the bike is going to get jerky or stall as it starts going really slow. If you disengaged the clutch and downshifted after you came to a stop that would be ok but it would still be better to do the downshifting while youre moving because bikes shift easier while theyre moving. Doing it that way will just make you brake slower because the engine and transmission arent doing any of the braking. Once you get used to matching RPMs you will most likely brake and downshift through each gear as you need to skipping the downshift to first most of the time. ,motorcycles,dexf2xz,1,t5_2qi6d

The reason you crashed is that you failed to anticipate the potential danger for which you would have slowed down and that you didnt know how to panic brake.

However know that its completely possible to avoid . of what you see in videos where people get taken out.

It was this plastic container with no topside access as it was under my frame and was about  full with this yellowish liquid.The fluid in that plastic tank is engine coolant.When the coolant in your radiator reaches a certain temperature it expands and goes into that plastic expansion tank.When the engine cools off the vacuum breaker radiator cap opens up and sucks some of the coolant back into the radiator.gtgtHave not touched the idle screws yet as I havent had a full day to try that remedy. Im also pretty scared of rendering my bike inoperable. Like I said before the learning curve on motorcycle mechanics is very steep and thats why a lot of newbies are afraid to work on their motorcycles.If you look up under the carburetors with a mirror and you see a slot headed brass screw next to the float bowl on each carburetor all you will need is a very short slot screwdriver.I bought an assortment of screwdriver tips that fit into a  inch socket so I use the slot ended tip which is about an inch long to get up under the carburetors.,motorcycles,df21z1s,2,t5_2qi6d
11205395,0,t1_df0yvdj,gt  Its pretty tame under k RPMOK say youve never ridden anything before. On a little  or  you need to whip your way up the gears before youre going at an appreciable speed and all that effort serves as a good indicator of hey Im going at a good clip gotta be careful about what I do. Now imagine if you jumped onto the cc inline  with no prior knowledge. You sit in first gear and rev it up to the redline and it just seems trivially easy and the bike handles it without issue. So surely thats just the normal way to ride it right?Or in other words the limits of a small bike are reasonably close to the limits of what you can and should be doing on the road. The limits of a cc supersport are way up in the stratosphere. If youve ridden something smaller and gotten used to its performance envelope you can keep the cc within that same envelope and ride just fine. But if you jump straight onto the cc you have no clue what those limits are or even that they exist to remain inside. You can very easily put yourself into a situation where you do not have the skill to get yourself out of. ,motorcycles,df248gm,3,t5_2qi6d

There has been a trend for a few years now to take regular old motorcycles and make them seem more offroadcapable by adding things like the big knobbie tires.  This older BMW model was intended for street use and came with smoother tires and bigger fenders etc.  Its kind of in line with zombie apocalypse survival trend  building Mad Max machines for imaginary battles.  I like the look and the bikes have a stripped down simplicity to them.  the reason why people have negative responses is the reality is a once practical bike is now perhaps more visually appealing is in reality pretty moronic.  No front fender but dirt tires?  thats a face full of mud in the real world.  also no rear suspension on something with dirt aspirations is just spine damage.  plus still a heavy street machine but now with half of the traction thanks to the dirt tires.  The hipsters love to do this and while it looks cool the reality is the end result is nice to look at but now a bad motorcycle for dirt or street.,motorcycles,dfqdlnl,37,t5_2qi6d

11443074,0,t3_637wty,When I was  years old my bothers and I started to ride a Honda SL for the first time. This was on a dirt trail near the Oakland estuary. We started out about  feet from the corner of the first turn. When it was my turn to ride my older brother rides up and gets off the bike while still holding the clutch in. I proceed to get on the bike and give it the gas. He says here you go and lets out the clutch as Im cranking the gas. The bike takes off I miss the corner and crash over the rocks into the water.  Lucky it was low tide. I received stitches in my hand and shoulder from broken glass in the mud. Scared the shit out of me. I never rode that bike again. When I turned  I used to go past a Kawasaki dealer everyday on the way to work. One day I went in to look and I was hooked. I bought a bike later that year a  specter sporty version of an LTD. Traded in bikes over the years gsxrs rc now Aprilia tuono .  I have had my share of near misses and one bad accident where I broke my leg in three places. Even after not riding for some time after my accident not my choice exwife Im back on the horse. Once you ride you will always want that freedom.

11520577,0,t3_64fwq9,Craigslist.org is your first stop to see what bikes are available in your area for your cost considerations if its a cash deal you want to pursue.Be aware that the good deals likely have to have a bit work done carbs messed up engine not running transmission not shifting... the list is varied and long.If youre talking a down payment on a new one at a motorcycle dealership... just gonna have to go shopping.  You can do that online of course but the dealers going to make the deal at the end of the day... or not.So saying this bike costs this isnt going to be helpful IMO.  Just going to have to be looking.Your parents should not be a consideration in regards to size.  Matter of fact its my opinion that too small a bike is not a good thing especially on the roads.  You do need some power to get out of situations mind and if the bike isnt capable of comfortably cruising at the speeds of the traffic around you you are now in a gonna be bad situation much like a bicyclist on a freeway.  In that regard I would say a cc class isnt a bad idea.  One should be able to master and control any size bike.  There isnt any good beginner one frankly because you can mess up just as easily on a  as you can on a  or bigger a Grom or a Gold Wing... they still go boom.  MPH crash is still a MPH crash and its gonna hurt.  So be in control.  Be confident not cocky! be aware and be safe and any bike is a good starter.  Mine was CC and covered in plastic.

Anything less and you might as well not Id say.  My opinion others will chime in on it Im sure.One things for sure  If you dont have the power the command the confidence to be on a freeway on a motorcycle or on a busy highway in traffic... then you dont need a motorcycle.  Dont suppose youve looked into insurance... might want to do that before you buy anything.  It might be the reason you wait until youre older.   is not considered a safe insurance bet by and large even in a car and theyre going to hammer you for it.Also financing a bike is a big thing.  Which is where that insurance smack gets  times worse.  Full Coverage.  You will need it.  You might want to keep saving up.  Nothing like being upside down on a brand new bike and then... something... happens.  You still owe and you cant fix it cause no money to give to it.  That sucks.Not that itll happen of course... just saying.  Something to consider.  It happens to be best of us. see the above re me and Im SO not the best.Im guessing you want your parents to cosign.  Hence the small bike.  I would ask them to reconsider.  Id also ask you to.  Get a throw away for the  even if you have to fix it so as to build up the see I can do this. factor and make it more logical if there is such a thing is some peoples mind re motorcycles and then youve not spent so much on something you likely will just toss away for the next bigger one later.  And fixing a motorcycle makes you strongah more powerful... or at least a bit more accomplished and ready to deal with things should it break down on the road.Finally... because I dont know your situation... sure you know how to ride.  But do you know how?  Take the Basic Riders Course.  Its worth every penny if youve not.  I highly recommend it.  Which reminds me... I should get the Advanced one done someday soon...If that helps.

Humidity temperature oil quality engine size etc. Oil changes only help a little particularly if the engine isnt hot when the oils changed.

You need to call around until you find a plan that fits your budget.  When I shop for insurance i usually call between  companies before I decide on a provider.There is a trick though  find an insurance broker.  They will basically do that job for you and since they know the industry better they know how to manipulate the insurance companies to fight for your business. In the end you usually end up with a lower price and you are supporting a local business as well.My insurance adjuster has me with Allstate and i get a fantastic rate all things considered.,motorcycles,dg85pic,2,t5_2qi6d

11611949,0,t1_dgc7a83,The original SS was its own bike completely so you are correct. If I remember correctly the STs were derivative of the original SS but I could be wrong. The new SS shares the same purpose as the original and has the same market aims but quite honestly they feel nothing alike when it comes to handling comfort and ease of use. Manufacturers are now trying to spread the love when it comes to models and share various components when it makes sense. In this case the headtube and trellis portion of the Monster can be linked to the new SS. There are some changes but if Im remembering the tech presentation correctly the geometry of the front end is the same. That said the two bikes dont feel the same at all and offer completely different experiences. For example the Hyper  uses the same cc engine in the SS but due to different mapping and throttle bodies the engine is WAY more user friendly. The Hyper behaves like a Hyper while the SS does what an SS should do. I think as we move forward were going to see more companies sharing components between models to a much higher degree than before. Brands have always done that and most bikes from the same manufacturer share odd bits like footpegs levers mirrors etc. ,motorcycles,dgc836g,2,t5_2qi6d

We had no rider training in those days. You got bike licence and then learned by sometimes hard experience.  If I knew then what I know now I never would have had that accident. I was riding out of a setting sun with no light on assuming that the driver would obey the law. Anyone see any flaws in that? So having said that on certain perfectly pleasant days I do wear an open face helmet and make damn sure to look out for my own safety.My son has taken up riding and here the Govt forces you to do a day safety course before you get your L plates.

With this the wind cannot blow hard from right and even with gale force from the left worst case is the bike lifts a couple inches and then the wall prevent it from coming over. Ive been parking in an alley this way for two years and three hurricanes havent moved it. Also be sure to get some cable locks for the bottom of the cover. I originally parked without a cover and people were stealing my barends. Then I put a cover on it and they stole the cover.
