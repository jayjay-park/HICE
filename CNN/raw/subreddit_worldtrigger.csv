7611413,0,t1_d371m1w,Yes you are completely right! Some people really dont know what they are talking about. Fire arms Gunner Trigger act more like an addition to Shooter Trigger like Asteroid. No more no less. Fire arms like the gun or assaultrifle increase the precision and speed because they dont have to adjust their bullets in power speed and range. Thats the reason why many people in Border uses them. They are easier to handle. Whether its a Shooter or Gunner Typ has nothing do to which bullets you can use. So Asteroid with Lead Bullet is entirely possible. Just as Hound and Viper with Lead Bullet. And to back me up here some chapterpages Karasuma explains the difference between Shooter and Gunner Chapter   Page  and Chapter   Page Karasuma explains Lead Bullet and why Osamu shouldnt use them. But he could if he wanted to as a Shooter Chapter   Page  And as some extra but debatable Yuma uses some sort of Lead Bullet against Miwa at their first fight.

This round purpose was to show off Osamu and Chikas improvement and we saw it we also saw that even through the have gotten better they still have a long way to go. Osamu dictated how the hole battle would go with his wires and using Chikas cannon proficiently and his improvement when it come to the combat was also clear in the way he kept his distance and baited Katori Unit until the right moment to strike even through he got taken out in the end  kills and  assists is not bad not bad at all. Chika was shooting hers Lead Bullets like nobody bussines not only supoting her teamates but also applying pressure in the enemys.

Hard to know he is an afto soldier afterall but as far as we know the invasion may have been one of the first or even the very first mission he had i dont read anything but the manga so maybe there is some extra material that talks about it or i missed it in the manga aswell but i do think hyuse wouldnt be as OP as Yuma without lampyris and his horns his battle power could be normal to low we saw him using scorpion but he already knew about it by watching some of the rank battles still quite impressive to use a trigger just knowing a bit of theory about it and about your theory of either Osamu or Hyuse becoming an operator i totally disagree it would be dumb to build on Osamus improvement just to pull him out of the battle field and Hyuse is a character with such potential in the rank battles that to put him as an operator would be equally wrong there is  stages they still need i believe first is to become the b team then to challenge an A rank team to become A rank and then to become one of the first teams on the away missions choosing list so we still have some time to see them meet a more suitable operator wich i really really dont think will be either hyuse or Osamu,worldtrigger,d47ituc,1,t5_2xrqd

Tamakoma has met squads capable of competing with them without overpowering them completely mor eimportantly they have shown to be able to defeat the third and fourth most powerful units in Brank.The two main highlights of this chapter are Yumas Bailing Out and Ikoma tieing with Ouji. It was high time for the first and Tamakoma has finally experienced what it means should Yuma bail out before Chika all she can do is forfeit which unless they have a higher score will be a problem.I see the final score as a demonstration of the advantage of having  fighters in your unit instead of . Ikoma Unit has capable agents but they have barely used any strategies at all. Yet with the survival points granted by the additional member they managed to tie for second place and lose by only  despite taking out only one opponent. Im still bothered by the limited number of squads that choose to have  fighters instead of  as it is extremely advantageous in rank wars.,worldtrigger,d7nlf0v,10,t5_2xrqd
8956711,0,t1_d7nafqp,This isnt actually my point. My main point is Nino being the best SH in Border and at least Top solo agents with normal triggers meant that Id be worried for Border if an inexperienced dude arrived and won against him. Kuga was already deemed to be way above  by Kazama at the time he fought Midorikawa so this example doesnt quite work with what I was arguing. He also shattered all the records with an AT trigger so Ashiharasensei actually hyped up Yuma a lot so things arent the same with Hyuse just yet. I believe with time if Ashiharasensei decides to give Hyuse loads of hype moments with Border triggers then Itd ease my worries for Border.I think I missed it say Katori couldnt break through a pt barrier?

The model Im using for damage calculation is meant to replicate a diminishing return on more bullets hitting the same targetarea which is why there is  per extra bullet.

11273154,0,t3_60ul6r,I think at that point the best solution would be to bail out voluntarily as you said. Aside from being slowed down by a burden on an area that cannot be cut off obviously the head is an extremity of the body so you would lose your balance at the slightest movement meaning there is no way you can fight effectively. It may matter less to  Gunners and Shooters but they remain sitting ducks and in general they lack the offensive power to take someone out in one blow. Still I wonder if it is posible to use Senkuu Kogetsu to cut off parts of the burdens we know Kogetsu alone is not enough like Viza did with Organon. Probably not though.Additionally if the burden covers one or both eyes it will become impossible for someone to see as you have suggested. Shooting by using the Radar is extremely difficult considering all you see is a bidimensional dot you have no idea what part of the opponent you are shooting at and whether they are running crawling or jumping down a building. All of the shots taken by using Radar with any Trigger so far have failed with the exception of Azumas but he knew what floor Mikumo was on thanks to Koarai and Okudera. Im talking about shooting because it seems impossible to fight with an Attacker Trigger without seeing. urazerxs makes a very good point about sharing senses with your teammates. It would definitely be possible to see through the eyes of one of your comrades however I think it would be so hard to coordinate that bailing out on your own may be the best option. You could stand your ground with Hound but thats as far as you would go and scoring would be pretty hard.,worldtrigger,df9snfu,3,t5_2xrqd

As you can easily see by looking at how the ranking barely changed over time aside from Tamakoma Second everyone remains pretty much in the same position. Ouji Unit for example has complained they always end up fighting the same opponent so they dont even need to strategize anymore.But you face them in different combinations in different maps they could change up their fighting style andor triggers you could experiment with fighting styles and triggers and there are most likely going to be teams moving in and out of your tier.And the Rank Wars are not the fullest extent of the agents training. They still have defense duty can mock fight in training can seek advice and training from higher ranking members and have training classes.gt The same could apply for one of more teams the next rank wars so their promotion is again deferred. If everyone starts with the same number of points anyone could fight anyone and the teams who are easily defeated would soon find themselves at the bottom of the ranking. If there were only a handful of rounds then yes this system would be impractical but there are  so some of them could indeed be expended to get a sense of what makes the strong well strongBut their promotion is dependent on how they compare to others. If there are teams that have also gotten better and still cant move up because of that then they should rightfully stay where they are.Anyone fighting anyone is the problem. Weaker teams would have to fight against teams that are completely out of their league. And much like Kitoras opinion on the Kazama v. Osamu fight the weak will only learn to win by actually trying to win. If they arent even given a chance to win then there is nothing to learn from fighting those who clearly outclass you other than Damn theyre fast! and Man Im weak!The weak teams should move up at their own pace fighting those that are similar in skill level to better learn how they can get better and get to work on testing and developing their skills.
