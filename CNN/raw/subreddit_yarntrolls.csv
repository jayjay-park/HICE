3593490,0,t1_cq1sa1c,Since my bitching my recipient has posted that she got and really liked her yarn and yesterday afternoon reddit gifts sent me an email that my yarn has been shipped.  So sometimes complaining does work ha ha.Theres hope for you too.  Maybe shes just a procrastinater and hasnt gotten around to taking a picture and posting it yet.  It is Easter week.  She could be on vacation or something.  Although I never found out if my Christmas secret santa liked his gift so there are some people who just dont play along which is frustrating.   If you arent willing to play your part why do people sign up for the exchanges? As for yarn you still might get some.  If nothing else some of us are signed up for rematches.  So you might get something on goround .  Ive never rematched before this is only my secind ever exchange but Im looking forward to getting something for someone who got skipped. But I totally get the most disappointing thing is not getting feedback on the thing you chose and sent.  That really is worse than not getting yarn.  Its like taking  bucks and throwing it off a bridge  someone might enjoy it but it would be nice to know for sure.,yarntrolls,cq1vv5o,1,t5_3658w

That and while i technically have the perfect machine to do what i want it hates me and needs parts companies who claim to sell wont respond with whether they would ship to me.. And it needs cheap ass parts but without its just a  mahoosive pile of junk! Argh. stitches isnt so bad. I think my double knit blanket is ... Which is by hand!
