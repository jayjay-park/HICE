2371428,0,t1_cm4rpyd,The beginning of a tier is really exciting because I can plot out a slightly different strategy each time. Is building the furnace my priority? Discovering titanium? Beginning to accumulate oil? Etc. The cash requirement is usually the one I end up waiting on long after the others have been met. Theres no strategy or planning just waiting. The city has helped diversify things though which has been fun. I have zero ideas but a little more expanding there could be fun. I also like the idea of having to craft items like the TNT to discover the other ores. Maybe not just jewelry like in Diamond Hunt but items that are needed for buildings in the city in addition to the smelted ores.,GoldRushGame,cm4tezb,1,t5_32sla

2454477,0,t3_2nmtbc,Hey! Thanks for your suggestions and no worries about your English it is just fine.Increases value of items sold by  is referring to the the Gas Station Ill absolutely need to make this more clear. Ill have to see about making the prestige system consistent there are many benefits to having an objectoriented code base and some very limited consequences that make this difficult.There is something very big coming down the pipeline but I will be focusing much more on earlygame content for the next few updates. The City will be getting some love in future updates for sure!,GoldRushGame,cmf2qqu,1,t5_32sla
4587341,0,t1_ct8sqrd,Ive written a fix. Ill be pushing the patch live shortly.I guess Im also going to need to make a game administration tool so I can revert those coins as well..,GoldRushGame,ct8tza1,2,t5_32sla
