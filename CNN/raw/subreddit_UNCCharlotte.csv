1323104,0,t1_ci1ow43,This sounds eerily like my first  months of college here! Granted I also made little to no effort to be social. I hated the people who lived on my hall I tried to hang out with a couple of the student organizations but they were really poorly organized and I didnt really identify with the people I met. The friends I have made have been my classmates and coworkers and I have made some good connections that way. It just took some time.,UNCCharlotte,ciigser,2,t5_2s6va

3062056,0,t1_cof3ak3,Feel free to come out to the UNCC Beach Volleyball club. It will be on Fridays starting mid March. Good times with food and drinks over at  place. Or if video games are more your style go hang out in the union in the room off of the little half floor. There are always people in there and its a very accepting place. Its never too late to make friends and I hope to see you around! ,UNCCharlotte,cofdnre,2,t5_2s6va

9393808,0,t3_599lw2,My advice would be to check out State. If youre already coming to UNCC its not awful but some of the teachers are kind of rough. If you are forced to take a class taught by Professor Ilson understand he is teaching some of the most important lessons and will also be totally useless to you. A lot of this curriculum will be selftaught. Make sure you get active in the extracurricular crowd like with Game Jams and Stars and stuff. Also become friends with Professor Jugan. Even if you dont take the game design focus he is one of the most relatable helpful professors in that college.All that being said if you still have the option check out state. UNCC is really improving their engineering school and their bio labs and theater majors are both strong too but they really need to improve their ITCS major. If you go for that self teach a lot grab some internships and make the most out of it!,UNCCharlotte,d96qcgx,7,t5_2s6va

11642675,0,t3_6653p1,gt In order for license plate recognition enforcement to be effective the system must be able to scan a vehicles stateissued license plate number. If your vehicle is registered in a state which provides both front and rear plates you may continue to back in to a parking space so long as the front license plate is able to be clearly scanned by the LPR system.  gt If your vehicle is registered in a state which does not provide a front license plate you would either pull in to a parking space ensuring that the rear license plate is able to be clearly scanned by the LPR system or purchase a custom front license plate from PaTS proper display the plate on the front of your vehicle would then allow you to continue to back in to your parking space.  gt Additional information regarding the purchase of a custom front license plate is available by contacting PaTS at  or emailing patsuncc.edu subject line Custom Front License Plate Information Request.    WTF is a custom front plate? Alumni here backing into a parking space should not be penalized because their new system requires it or requires a custom front plate.,UNCCharlotte,dgfplmg,13,t5_2s6va
