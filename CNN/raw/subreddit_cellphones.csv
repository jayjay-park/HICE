98,0,t1_ceedwav,Im not positive what my data usage would be since I havent used a smartphone before. Minutes could be at a minimum but dont most places offer unlimited texts with limited talk minutes? I do text often so either a high number or unlimited would be necessary. So what providers are you thinking of? Also a big factor would be coverage like connection. Though I live in a pretty populated part of Ohio Ive heard data coverage is slim in some places I go to. Also other providers in my area are Sprint Virgin Mobile TMobile and ATampT. I had extreme issues with ATampT internet so Im not sure I trust their cell phone company ,cellphones,ceeg7h5,1,t5_2qvf1

I would also look up the CEOs email and number and foward all this to Him or her as well. The problem with calling the call centers is they have no real power to help you.
