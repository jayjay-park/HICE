4020121,0,t1_creijkp,That would be considered a bustier not a corset. A corset is typically laced in the back with the intention of slimming the waist. A bustier is designed to emphasize the bust as the name implies by tightening the upper midriff.,corsets,creivxn,4,t5_2rf9x

4692957,1,t1_ctm33jn,youre absolutely right I meant that to be a response to miasimia.  my apologies. People who have plenty of time for callouts but no time to actually educate someone themselves annoy the shit out of me.  Especially after she was too busy to educate me when I asked a question but has plenty of time to shit all over me on reddit.,corsets,ctm37k5,0,t5_2rf9x

6323765,0,t3_423d0q,This happened to me when I bought a corset that was a bit too large for my waist measurement I was  inches and bought a  corset. You might just have a smaller frame and need to go down  more inches for your next corset. Other than that it might be due to how you are tightening it. Perhaps post a photo of the back? Best of luck! ,corsets,cz8fys5,2,t5_2rf9x

6492514,0,t1_czqti7t,Sorry Im not quite sure I understand. From what I understood about waist training in general is that you buy a corset and gradually tighten it to desired size?,corsets,czqvhpp,3,t5_2rf9x

6946074,0,t1_d13n2rb,It was a mistake. Ive lost almost  pounds since the first time I tried on the dress ordered what we thought would be the right size and the sales lady had us looking at the wrong measurement chart. All I need is to lose  inches by June and it can be let out. I can do it. Thank you internet stranger for giving me added fuel. Think Ill head to the gym now.,corsets,d13o25f,1,t5_2rf9x

10812692,0,t1_ddkj6b8,Sleeping in corset is necessary if it cannot be worn during the day for about  hours. It may take a week or so to get used to it. If you wear corset regularly during day then sleeping in it is unnecessary.,corsets,ddv947e,1,t5_2rf9x
