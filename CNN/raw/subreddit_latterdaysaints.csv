God has many times inspired his children to break mans law in order to further his plans Nephi beheading someone to get the brass plates for example.I trust that current Church policy is inspired and in keeping with the Lords will and that if anything it would be a case by case scenario if judgement needed to be made.But I also believe that as US citizens grow weaker in faith and increasingly immoral and unrighteous that the Lord is bringing a more spiritual people into the promised land a people that will serve him and have faith in him.  As I served in Latin america on my mission I was amazed at the level of faith and belief in God the typcial Mexican national had compared to a typical American.  Which brings me to verse  of that same chaptergtWherefore this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring remember from verse  that none come that are not brought by the Lord. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given it shall be a land of liberty unto them wherefore they shall never be brought down into captivity if so it shall be because of iniquity for if iniquity shall abound ccursed shall be the land for their sakes but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.,latterdaysaints,ceij292,2,t5_2uas2

It has been doubted by Mormon prophets and even intentionally left out of the History of the Church C. I am pretty sure there are more quotes by modern prophets and apostles saying God is eternal as opposed to haveing become God on anotherplanet and D. top Mormon philsophers examining Mormon doctrine conclude the same thing.So if you are going to play the disingenuousstrawmaning card dont hypocritically do it yourself.Also I find it ammusing that you said in other commentsgt  We have a prophet today...

But you then go on to dismiss someone we sustain as a prophet seer and revelator by sayinggt That Elder Anderson quotation itself seems like possibly an obscure paragraph of one talk. Perhaps it is not doctrine about how to determine what is doctrine.which shows all your are really doing in this thread is cherrypicking manuals that support your personal opinons while dismissing direct quotes that contridict them while you then proceed to go around and accuse others of being disengenuos.So next time you make yourself out to be  the champion of correct doctrine as taught by prophets recognise you are cherrypicky what to accept and reject from their words while strawmaning the words of others as much as anyone. ,latterdaysaints,cf1sul6,2,t5_2uas2

Like you he came out insisting I am perverting the teachings of modern prophets who say there was no death before the fall. Like you he quoted manuals but unlike you also quoted supporting scripture.Also like this situation I reminded him of the complexity of the issue citing both prophets and Mormon scholars who disagreed. But like you he seemed to deny any complexity and acted like the only true Mormon doctrine is that there is no death before  years ago. gt  Im sick of seeing members take some of our weirder doctrines and twist them to look less weirdLike you R. Gary was also sick that Mormons twisted doctrines to make them look less wierd against science. .gt I have yet to see anything contradicting what Ive said.Like you after I had shown the history is complex on the issue after I showed prophets who disagreed after I showed Mormon scholars that disagreed he too acted like I had not presented one shred of evidence that anything dies before  years ago.Look there are statments throughout LDS history in manuals and even the Bible Dictionary that suggest there was no death before the fall.  Like the R. Gary incident I didnt deny this nor ever suggest I couldnt be wrong. There was only one side that refused to admit the potential of being wrong and in both cases that has been myselfHowever like R. Gary it would do yourself well to study the history of the KFD. Study the fact that like the no death before the fall doctrine it is complex no matter how many manuals you quote. There have been prophets who disagreeon these issues. There are Mormon scholars who disagree on these issues.  Thus your inability to admit to the complex state of these doctrines really speaks less about my insistance in false doctrine and your own inability to appricate the nuances of the Mormon faith.The no death before the fall doctrines discussed repeadly by prophets and manuals is a complex issue.

298260,0,t3_1ximhr,About the flood I have said this before Its only an opinion but for reasons below I think it is an important considerationI like what the Apostle John A Widsoe said repeated in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism which is considered an semioffical publication with some weight as its editing was overseen by several modern Apsotles and is even referenced on lds.org topics like this onegt The Old Testament records a flood that was just over fifteen cubits sometimes assumed to be about twentysix feet deep and covered the entire landscape And all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered Gen. . Scientifically this account leaves many questions unanswered especially how a measurable depth could cover mountains. Elder John A. Widtsoe writing in  offered this perspective The fact remains that the exact nature of the flood is not known. We set up assumptions based upon our best knowledge but can go no further. We should remember that when inspired writers deal with historical incidents they relate that which they have seen or that which may have been told them unless indeed the past is opened to them by revelation. gt The details in the story of the flood are undoubtedly drawn from the experiences of the writer. Under a downpour of rain likened to the opening of the heavens a destructive torrent twentysix feet deep or deeper would easily be formed. The writer of Genesis made a faithful report of the facts known to him concerning the flood. In other localities the depth of the water might have been more or less. In fact the details of the flood are not known to usIf an Apostle can be skeptical along these lines with other modern Apostles acting as editor allowing this quote to stand as the quote of choice regarding the flood in the EoM so can I.Also I think its interesting when they wrote the Encyclopedia or Mormonism this of all quotes was their goto quote for the flood. Its as if they wanted to note there are reasons from the Biblical text itself only  feet deep!!! to question if Noah realized how subjective his account might be. And how what Noah honestly believed was global might have been local. Again....  feet!,latterdaysaints,cfboigd,17,t5_2uas2
298283,0,t3_1ximhr,The four major civilisations of the Ancient World  Egyptians Assyrians Hurrians Hittites  were hydraulic civilisations. This means that they believed that water was the source of life. They had gods of water who were typically gods of wrath and chaos. One of these made it into the Old Testament Leviathan. The Greek god Poseidon is an evolved form of these gods and then the Romans ripped him off and called him Neptune and now Neptune has his own planet so the pagan worship continues unabashed after all this time. Even better Jupiter was an evolved form of Baal who is generally considered to be the Satan of ancient civilisation. So the biggest planet in our solar system is named after the devil. The more you know..The reason for these beliefs is best explained by the fact that they lived in flood plains and were dependent on floods for life. Think of Egypt and the Nile even though Babylon and the Euphrates is no less significant just less famous. These flood rivers typically flood to catastrophic effect once or twice a century. This makes a devastating flood something your grandfather would have seen or otherwise affected someone you knew. So there is this early understandingbelief that there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. God giveth and taketh away by the very same means. Hold that thought.This is a pretty interesting geological fact Details are disputed but the general idea which I read about a few years ago was that glacial melting just before the Holocene caused the Mediterranean Sea level to rise significantly. The rsult was that it flowed into the Black Sea forming what is now known as the Bosphorus or Bosporus depending on spelling. This river its more like a freaking sea its so big another name for it is the Istanbul Strait runs through the middle of Istanbul in Turkey. So before the flood circa  BC by latest research the Bosphorus was a dry valley and probably enjoyed its share of life.My personal view is the following. Noah was probably real but I base that on revelations which say that Noah was Gabriel. ...and Noah is also my favourite biblical hero so I kind of want him to be real . God probably commanded him to build an ark to save his family  . The flood was a localised event which was catastrophic in every sense of the word and wiped out life  . Noahs ark couldnt have run aground on Mount Ararat that would imply a freakish level of flooding  . Noahs story would have been preserved through cultures and languages because it served a cautionary tale to hydraulic civilisations that the god of water could wipe you out if he got mad hence why the bible states that God wiped people out out of love or whatever. He didnt. He might have saved Noah but the flood wasnt a global baptism which cleansed the world of all the wicked  . The bells and whistles attached to the story were retroconversions made by other cultures until we end up with something like what we have in GenesisThere are other theories including the idea that the Euphrates and and the Tigris both burst their banks due to the land in southern Babylon being raised as a result of silt build up effectively damming up the rivers where they tried to empty into the Persian Gulf and devastated Babylon and that lends to the idea that Noah was Babylonian and not a Hittite. He even has a Bablyonian name Atrahasis. The Hittite case is a bit tentative but its possible had he lived in western Chaldea. But that basis his location on geological evidence and assumes that he was affected by that flood. So its like walking backwards to get the result.But was the flood a global event? Not a cat in hells or even a floods chance.,latterdaysaints,cfbolj3,31,t5_2uas2

309398,0,t1_cfcsz7m,First rather than addressing the flaws in Mark Regneruss study you offer up a defense by his dissertation chair. I would assume he is a tad biased as Regnerus is his intellectual progeny. No professor wants to be responsible for a black sheep graduate student.Second the oped admits that that Regneruss research is imperfect but rather than addressing them pointforpoint there is hand waving that all articles are prone to error.Third have you actually read the Regneruss article? He was comparing children in stable families with two parents with children who had one parent admitting to some sort of same sex relationship. There is absolutely zero consideration given to the length of time the romantic relationship lasted whether or not the child was raised by a gay couple or by a single parent and perhaps most notably no consideration of other factors in the childs life family drug abuse closeted affairs stepparents divorce etc..If you are not willing to control for mitigating factors why bother to do research at all? Again what happens when you compare the children of straight married couples versus the children of a married gay couples as in the  Australian study?

These choices can either be good or bad not necessarily sinful these actions by other people can influence us to either sin... Or not.Evil exists because some people seek another path rather than Our Fathers path.  This leads them to all manner of actions both good and bad.  When a choice is bad enough to hurt either ourselves or others we refer to them as evil.  But it is not necessary to have Satan for evil to exist. ,latterdaysaints,cfj0kpg,1,t5_2uas2

I had been actively working on preparing for  months already.I was very distraught frustrated  and quaked whether I wanted to go on a Mixon  or get married.  I asked for a blessing from a close family friend  and before the blessing  he gave me some great wisdomFamilies are essential to getting into The Celestial Kingdom.  A mission is not.

783511,0,t1_cgtadn9,Elder Brown actually addresses your market failure issue in the full talkgtOne of the most important things in the world is freedom of the mind from this all other freedoms spring. Such freedom is necessarily dangerous for one cannot think right without running the risk of thinking wrong but generally more thinking is the antidote for the evils that spring from wrong thinking. gtGod himself refuses to trammel free agency even though its exercise sometimes teaches painful lessons.Since I think there are so many golden passages in this talk here are some statements from it that  clarify his meaning behind the metaphor and  add perspective.Statements that clarify his meaning behind this metaphor Both creative science and revealed religion find their fullest and truest expression in the climate of freedom. Neither fear of consequence or any kind of coercion should ever be used to secure uniformity of thought in the church. People should express their problems and opinions and be unafraid to think without fear of ill consequences. Tolerance and truth demand that all be heard and that competing ideas be tested against each other so that the best which might not always be our own can prevail. Knowledge is the most complete and dependable when all points of view are heard. Statements that add further perspective Scientists and teachers of religion disagree among themselves on theological and other subjects. Even in our own church men and women take issue with one another and contend for their own interpretations. This free exchange of ideas is not to be deplored as long as men and women remain humble and teachable. There is not enough of the attitude of the sincere investigator among us. ... We should be scientific  that is openminded approaching new problems without prejudice deferring a decision until all the facts are in. ... We should all be interested in academic research. We must go out on the research front and continue to explore the vast unknown  if his market of ideas was compared to a consumer market this would solve the problem just as being a conscious and wellinformed consumer would lead to finding the better product ie. finding the truth and believing it. There are altogether too many people in the world who are willing to accept as true whatever is printed in a book or delivered from a pulpit. Their faith never goes below the surface soil of authority.  if we compared his market of ideas to a consumer market this could be considered the cause of not picking the right product ie. not believing the correct thing.I think there is immense value in maintaining such a climate of freedom of thought that is intensified by an environment of sparrring contending and dissenting but always with wisdom humility and intelligence as he says in the talk. Its not a market failure that people do not always choose to acknowledge the truth on the market of ideas and its not a market failure that people do not always choose the better product. Its the shadow side of having agency and the reason its such a big responsibility to go out there and find out for oneself. ,latterdaysaints,cgtc7qi,2,t5_2uas2

Japanese is changing just like all languages but not more quickly than we would expect.From the little Ive heard the early translations of the Japanese BoM were into a very archaic style understood by those with the equivalent of a classical education. Only more recently have they moved away from this style possibly upsetting people used to the old translation who isnt afraid of change really? and contrasting a much older form of the language not in everyday use with the more modern usage.Chronologically before that though Japan ended its selfimposed isolation  and there have been a lot more loanwords since then but the actual grammar hasnt changed more rapidly than anyone would expect. A native speaker who lived through all the borrowing might perceive the new words as indicative of some huge change but thats just a perception and has little bearing on a translation of a text with little need for words like camera and bus.,latterdaysaints,ch00cjf,1,t5_2uas2

904580,0,t3_24h228,And good riddance.Are generations in this dispensation special? Sure. But I wouldnt say in a superior than prior generations kind of way. I do believe that God doesnt just randomly throw spirits into the world so He has reasons for us to be here where we are now. So in that sense its fair to say we have some special qualities that set us apart for this day.But the good riddance side of my statement is when people go from a special generation to the special generation in a general allencompasing sense. I havent done an exhaustive analysis of every grammatical way it was phrased by all church authorities but Id welcome getting rid of the one true generation meme. This time were living in is absolutely amazing. As a whole we live longer healthier safer more educated lives. We travel farther and faster we communicate near instantaneously across the planet and mankind is discovering things all over every corner of the earth throughout the solar system and peering back to the dawn of time.Heres where I draw my inspiration for this both the awe of the discoveries opportunities we have today as well as the reservationgt DampC gt  For there is a time appointed for every man according as his works shall be.gt  God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit yea by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost that has not been revealed since the world was until nowgt  Which our forefathers have awaited with anxious expectation to be revealed in the last times which their minds were pointed to by the angels as held in reserve for the fulness of their glorygt  A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld whether there be one God or many gods they shall be manifest.gt  All thrones and dominions principalities and powers shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ.gt  And also if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas or to the dry land or to the sun moon or starsgt  All the times of their revolutions all the appointed days months and years and all the days of their days months and years and all their glories laws and set times shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of timesgt  According to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other gods before this world was that should be reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof when every man shall enter into his eternal presence and into his immortal rest.So yeah were pretty special I prefer the word blessed to be living today. But I dont think we need to get selfmessianic about it e.g. here The next generation will come well hand the torch off to them and they will be special for their time too as we head into the hope and promise of the millennium at a time nobody knows.EDIT This is also why my eyebrows raise at people who get a little too much into LDS Youth Trek activities. Yes  the generations of early saints deserve our deep respect since they carried the bulk of the work of the restoration on their backs.

Bonus you may make some new friends with a healthy perspective of friendship while filtering out the weirdies who consider friendship an assignment.I suggest this method only because it worked well for me when I was younger. My dad and I visited a family where the wife was not ever going to come to church and the nevermormon husband would purposefully light up cigarettes and drink beers to try and make us uncomfortable. We knew the situation going in. Within a short amount of time we were all friends. We continued to visit with this guy even after the death of his wife. Why?

1140844,1,t1_chxwk2v,To me this demonstrates a misunderstanding on Einsteins part of the nature of God more than anything else. Unfortunately its a very common misunderstanding which probably accounts for a lot of peoples difficulty in relating to and believing in God. It is essential that we have a proper understanding of the nature of God and our relationship with Him if we are to have faith sufficient to salvation or be saved but that all depends on how we try to define God. If we limit the definition of God to some unknowable Being who arbitrarily hands down rules rewards and punishment then heck I guess I dont believe in God either!Instead we may consider that the universe is governed by certain Laws by which all order is maintained and all power is exerted such as physical laws like those governing thermodynamics or powers or forces such as gravity for instance. These laws dictate the consequences of all actions reactions and interactions in the universe indeed it would be proper to say that the universe only exists and operates according to those laws and could not do so in contravention of them. You simply cant break the laws of Physics. When something appears to do so its because we have a flawed understanding of those laws. Consider then that God is a being who oversees and exercises supreme power over all existence by virtue of His having a perfect understanding of those universal laws. He then acts in such a way that the consequences of His actions result in His enjoying the type of existence He does eternal life and exaltation. Or in other words God is God because He abides by the universal immutable laws of existence which result in His being God. If not God would cease to be God.Our current inability to scientifically observe measure and analyze certain phenomena in the universe means that most of our understanding of how the universe works is limited to physical laws. However it is easily possible that there exist spiritual laws upon which the principles of justice mercy faith priesthood power and righteousness are founded and upon which the blessings or rewards of happiness peace and eternal life or the punishments of misery discord and condemnation are predicated. Theyre the natural consequences of certain actions just like there are natural consequences to sticking your hand on a hot stove. In both cases universal laws are in force producing inevitable results. It is no more by some whim of Gods that we suffer the spiritual damage of sin than it is that we burn ourselves by placing our hand on a highly conductive and thermally energetic heating coil. Those are just the laws of the universe in action.God then is not the dispenser of rewards and punishment but the proclaimer of those immutable laws which govern existence. In particular He concerns Himself with those aspects of existence which are simultaneously most difficult for us to deduce on our own given our limited mortal perception and which are most relevant to our happiness. He bothers to do this because we are His children and He loves us.,latterdaysaints,chxyf37,0,t5_2uas2

1219422,0,t1_ci6m4hi,I was speaking with a Hindu friend of mine and she spoke of the next life with very similar terminology I use speaking of the next life. Obviously she meant the next life in the long chain of next lives and I meant the next and final life.A funny story though. Apparently in Hindu culture if a wife is upset with her husband she will say See if I find you in the next life! Ill pretend I never knew you! And of course with the related Ill be sure to find you in the next life so we can be married again and live forever together which is a common theme for love stories in cultures that believe in reincarnation.Compare that with Joseph Smiths advice to a young husband that he should act in a way where his wife will want to spend eternity with him.So while we disagree with the Hindus on some things in many ways we are very very similar!I even spoke a bit about the gods and she explained to me that really they were all once mortal people who rose to become immortal through their heroic deeds. I asked about Vishnu and she began talking about him in very similar terms to how we would talk about Heavenly Father. Vishnu is even married! It lead me to conclude that there are many MANY similarities between our perception of heaven and theirs. They even have a savior God that comes to earth to save people from evil.There is a passage of scripture in the DampC promising that one day we will know whether there is one God or many gods. I have often wondered What if it turns out there are many gods and we need to know about them and how they interact together? What if polytheism is really closer to the truth than monotheism? Its an interesting if not heretical consideration and thought. But it would explain why so many cultures are polytheistic and not monotheistic. ,latterdaysaints,ci6sxfo,2,t5_2uas2

It was once. I had punched my brother. I am still ashamed about this. He had a perfect record of never laying a hand on any of us and then that once.

Now he is embarrassed that we even have it somewhere in the house. I have watched as he constantly suggests calling women into callings for which they are more than qualified but gets refused each time. He still suggests them and will probably do it until he gets them on the committee or gets released.He taught me to care about politics even though the general feeling here is politicians are always up to no good at all times and there seems little point in voting.

1239828,0,t3_28ae93,Youre likely to get some variance on some of these questions  but here is my take Many mormons take everything the prophet says as literal scripture.  Personally I believe that in studying things out and apply the  James   test to every piece of new information that I get before I call it scripture.  That being said though I havent really found anything that I completely disagree with the prophet over. No.  The Book of Mormon and the Bible are both considered scripture and are both valued the same. Do you mean the couplet  As man is now God once was and as God is now man may become?  In that case not believing in the first part of the couplet  that God was a mortal being like us at one point in His existence is not a critical belief and wont be a dealbreaker if you do decide to become a mormon.  The latter part that we have the potential to become like God is more universal in the church. Many people die without even knowing about God or Jesus.  It would be unjust if they werent given some sort of chance to make it back to Him.  We believe that baptism for the dead is one way in which we can assist them.  Tattoos are generally frowned upon but some members do have them.  Some people may be judgmental to you about it but many others will not care. Personal opinion  I dont get what the hullabaloo over faith vs works really is all about.  My view is that good works are just an outward manifestation of faith and faith or choosing to believe without a perfect knowledge when you think about is actually a work because you have to choose and that is an action.  So when you think about it faith and works are kind of the same thing right?  Regardless  yes you need both works and faith to get into heaven but above all that you need the grace of God because without Him we wouldnt even have the opportunity. I dont think anyone really has the faintest idea of what it means to become like God.  But should we prove faithful we will participate in doing His work whatever that might entail.  Creating your own planet?  I dont know maybe.  Who knows? I think that hell will be the regret we might feel in knowing that we failed to reach our full potential or that an action we might have done caused someone else lasting harm.  But we believe that God will give everyone some form of glory when we die with maybe a handful of exceptions.,latterdaysaints,ci93hv6,2,t5_2uas2

Of course the church gets to decide who is allowed in and who must leave but the exact parameters of what constitutes an excommunicable offense seem fuzzy and in flux right now so some fair portion of the membership does not know where the line is.

1297844,1,t1_cife4g7,Equality for equalitys sake is just hypersensitivity and blindness. Men and women are different. Everyone admits that in at least some contexts.Mormons believe that God made us as coequal beings that must become united each bringing his or her unique and special contribution to fulfill all righteousness. Biology reflects this essential union well and stands as an homage to this ideal pattern programmed into the most fundamental and rudimentary aspects of life by the Great Creator.If a person does not believe this heshe has chosen secular sophistries as hisher preferred god believing these things to be smoother when in actuality they lead to actual hell and utter discord and that person doesnt really belong in the Church anymore anyway.My hope is that Kate Kellys excommunication allows us to reclaim some of the women that she led away and that those women can learn the true doctrine and begin to see beauty in Gods creations instead of taking offense and rebelling. The nowpredominant social plan is crafted very carefully to lead all men and women to hell and is a lie of the Devil. That we can have women so badly misled and disoriented that they fall for any of Kellys sophistries is an embarrassment to the Church.We need to bring things back in line.,latterdaysaints,cifmhg5,-1,t5_2uas2

1320738,0,t1_cii6lee,gt Ill freely admit that religious arguments were used when DOMA was first passed. But the fact of the matter is the debate was new. Our institutions and gut told us that this would have deleterious consequences for society as a whole. That we werent able to articulate precisely why then in secular terms doesnt mean that we cant do so now after nearly two more decades of evolution and thought on the subject. gtgtBasically your implication is If you made a religious argument for legislation in the past all your secular arguments now are illegitimate and without import. What? Really? So weve improved our reasoning but that counts against us because once upon a time our reasoning was less well developed?I am too lazy to try to find campaign material from  regarding Amendment  but I think it is a safe bet that people were voting due to this religious beliefs andor animusgt The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints LDS church though not officially endorsing the amendment publicized a statement in July endorsing constitutional amendments that define marriage. On October  just  days before Utahns voted on the amendment the LDS church officially stated that Any other sexual relations including those between persons of the same gender undermine the divinely created institution of the family. The Church accordingly favors measures that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman and that do not confer legal status on any other sexual relationship. Supporters of the amendment asserted the second statement showed specific LDS support for Amendment . Others including moderately conservative Latterday Saint KSL radio talk show host Doug Wright believed that since the new statement applied only to sexual relations it highlighted precisely how Amendment  went too far.Do I know what the voters were thinking in ? Of course not but I can assure you that they were not thinking of the ex poste rationales offered by Girgis Anderson and George.gt But after  more years of conversation and debate the tables have turned. The arguments are better. More people are persuaded to oppose abortion as a matter of public policy than almost ever before. The Supreme Court has even loosened some of its standards.Again when were Roe and Casey overturned without me noticing? As far as I can tell there is still a majority of Americans  who wish to keep abortions legal if restricted.gt Philosophical and legal debates need to allow breathing room for both sides to develop grow and mature  particular when the subject is new and we have been faced with defending intuitions we never before expected to have to defend and thus had not before invested a lot of thought into.I think this is where we are getting our conversation is getting lost in communication.

1351353,0,t3_29jooj,My personal opinion on some of your questions  What makes you so sure that this is the right religion when there are so many out there?  feeling that it is doesnt suffice as an answer to me please expand Im not sure how to best answer this question.  I dont think that the allornothing were right youre wrong mentality is the best way to think about religion.  I believe that gospel truths exist in many religions today but that some of the teachings in each tradition have been corrupted by the understanding of men.  We have a habit of trying to fit the things of God into our own culture and worldview and things always get lost in translation.  What makes Mormonism work for me is that I feel that I am a better person when I try to follow the teachings in the Book of Mormon.  I feel that the religion as a whole is bringing me closer to God  at least when I put forth an effort.  That is the ultimate question I suppose. What are the core beliefs? Some of the basics are  we believe that God the Father and Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are three separate beings.   We believe that the Bible and Book of Mormon are both holy scripture.   We believe in baptism and that faithworks are required of us to obtain salvation.   We believe in prophets  and that a prophet leads the church today.   We believe in temples  which provide saving ordinances for both the living and the dead.   We believe in tithing and service. Is it okay to not be entirely sure or okay with a certain doctrine or new information that arises in the church? Of course.  Some doctrines are more important than others though and belief in the core doctrines are required for baptism. What is going to happen to the earth during Jesuss second coming? During Christs nd coming there will peace on the earth for a long time.  Earth will be like paradise and there will be no wickedness. Do you believe in Armagedon? Hell? Paradise on earth? Armaggedon  Yes.  There will be a time of wickedness preceding the nd coming.  Hell  Yes but we believe in it differently than perhaps other Christian religions.  After we are judged nearly everybody will be placed in some sort of glory according to the type of people we were on the earth. A handful of people but not many those that were completely utterly wicked to the core  not an ounce of good will go to a place called outer darkness which is the Mormon version of hell. Ive also heard about becoming your own god? We believe that we can continue to progress even after we die and that at some point in the future perhaps millions of years after we die we have the potential to become even as god is.  What that means exactly is hard to comprehend. You also asked what is a testimonyA testimony is a spiritual witness that a certain principle or gospel message is true.  This can be a peaceful feeling a feeling that your soul is enlarged or a burning in the bosom.  Basically it is a communication from God.,latterdaysaints,cilom9y,3,t5_2uas2

It could be that the topic of getting out of debt has been a constant topic since  and maybe Im seeing a pattern that doesnt exist.

1399719,1,t1_cirpktn,gt I think that the catalyst theory is the only one that has any possibility of standing up.Not exactly.  Those facsimiles are common scenes.  Authors commonly adapted them to fit whatever story they were telling.  They were metaphorical by design.  The problem is that many people look at the surface transliteration of the scenes and say A ha Joseph Smith is wrong.  But the transliteration of a common scene is rather pointless.  Its like looking at the phrase cut it out and suggesting This translates to the saying a person wanted to physically excise the item out of its surroundings.  No cut it out isnt meant to be taken literally you have to understand what the person meant when they said it.  But the meaning or interpretation of the scenes needs to be explained elsewhere by the author to know why they are there.  The problem is that  The extant scrolls we do have tell a story not related to the facsimiles and  commonly these scenes were placed on one scroll and the story on another scroll.  Now let me try to explain what Im getting at here.  Im simply saying that logically its very hard to rule out the theory that these scenes represented Abraham when we dont have any extant writing from the author of these scenes on what these scenes were supposed to represent.

1616056,0,t1_cjiscgv,How so?  If one has a strong testimony that a temple marriage and covenant are of the most important things attainable in this life then ones choices in who they date and marry will differ from someone who does not place the same value on a temple marriage.  Someone who is set on a temple marriage likely realizes that marrying an affirmed atheist likely will eliminate the possibility of a temple marriage in this life as well as having a spouse to grow and develop spiritually with.  Someone who does not have a testimony that reflects such importance on attaining that new and everlasting covenant with their spouse will see little wrong with marrying said atheist.Testimonyfaithbelief on the church and its doctrine are not the only factors that will play into life choices but they certainly are major factors for those who hold the church to be true which is an assumption held by this subreddit per its rules and who wish to make their life a part of it.But there are of course always exceptions and other factors which is why I said depends a lot rather than only depends on or depends completely on.   ,latterdaysaints,cjivcnu,0,t5_2uas2
1618795,0,t1_cjj2is3,The church is very adaptable. I just had a conversation with my wife about this.In the s or whenever Correlation started the church was developing from a relatively small Western US church to a global church. It needed a level of consistency in order to grow quickly and Correlation allowed that. Now the church is in most countries the internet allows us access to more information faster and the church needs more flexibility. Since  or so with the change of the Missionary program it started to build flexibility back into its system. Theres push back as people adjust to thinking the church was one way and now learning that its more flexible than they thought but that should provide individual growth opportunity and allow the church to mature into its next phase.While my ideas as stated are not common in the church Ive shared them with people in the church all over the world and there is no backlash. Theyre consistent with most peoples beliefs. In fact the most aggressive push back that Ive encountered has been with exmormons who insist that the ideas are inconsistent with the church.

1635735,0,t3_2d24g4,Heck ya! uPapatank mentions prayerful study and the scripture study from the bible and everything else. Thats great and all but I would suggest that you go even more basic than that at first. Where do you start? on Page  of the book of mormon. Youll love that the Book of Mormon which we believe is also scripture like the books int he bible isnt nearly so dry and boring yet you can feel how it enriches your life by reading pondering on whatever comes to mind as you read and then applying those things to your life. Go for it! You dont need any formal introduction to mormonism!  Though I am curious. You believe in God do you believe in Jesus Christ? If you didnt already know WE DO! D We believe that it is mans destiny to be brought back to God who we departed from when we came to earth at birth and we believe that Jesus is what makes that happen. I would randomly guess that if you arent religious that praying sounds fairly strange. How can the great being of the universe hear your thoughts and feelings as you pray? How would he respond back to you? This is something that I spent a LONNNG time thinking about. For me I realized that if he really created earth and even our human bodies he has GOT to know how to read my thoughts as I pour out my soul to him. For me I typically will get a response through thoughts that I can tell didnt originate from me. Things that I wouldnt normally think and such. When you meet the missionaries they have a little pamphlet about praying but it is pretty simple. You can pray silently in your mind or out loud typically in a private setting. Just address God something like Dear Heavenly Father tell him somethings that you are grateful for somethings that you might want his help on like learning more about this church and gaining a witness of its truthfulness and whenever you are done close in the name of Jesus Christ amen. I would be happy to explain more about the format if you are interested. Have fun! ,latterdaysaints,cjlcl3m,4,t5_2uas2

My only concern would be that you used the word challenged.    What do you mean by that?  I think its wonderful for the EQ instructor to use challenging questions and encourage members to do whatever they can do find truth but I generally dont think EQ is the place for an instructor to make a case against church doctrine or policy.  For example if you were giving a talk on the witnesses to the BOM plates I think it would certainly be appropriate to ask probing questions related to bias and evidence but I think it would be inappropriate to make a case that Martin Harris was loony or that the witnesses had conflicts of interest.

1868906,0,t1_ckedyw6,The question of what is meant by the one true and living church is not so much a complicated issue in my opinion as it is one that is emotionally and politically charged and fraught with great potential for misunderstanding. I think Mormon culture has lost the spirit of Josephs generous embrace of truth from diverse sources. There was little ambiguity in his many statements go out and find truth bring it home to Zion. The Catholics have more truth than all the rest. Take everything you can from the Presbyterians get all the good you can from others then come out a pure Mormon etc etc. In the God Who Weeps we focus on our vision of the Five Fundamentals of Mormonism then show how each and every one continued to be taught by inspired men and women  throughout time. So what is unique about Mormonism and in what sense is it the true church. Principally because the keys to perform sealing ordinances were committed to the prophet. And secondarily because and this was esp. true in  less so now only in the LDS church were those five truths that are at the heart of understanding the divine and the human assembled under one institutional house.  So the invisible church the church of the Lamb of God is transcultural transhistorical transinstitutional. But the portal eventually through which all must and will pass is the temple. And to the prophet are committed those keys. So Mormons dont have a monopoly on truth. Or on holiness. But like the Sadducees they have been designated the custodians of the temple and its ordinances for the benefit of the entire human family.,latterdaysaints,ckeeagi,10,t5_2uas2

To categorize teachings is to find justification as you just did in saying policy is not the will of God.  Prioritizing and applying principles and truths requires individual adaptation under the guidance of the Holy Ghost thus making all doctrine and all policy a matter of Gods will inasmuch as we adhere to his divine guidance.

1999567,0,t3_2hmsf8,Making new friends can be difficult for new members and lifelong members and it is often just as difficult or even more so outside the Church too and most people go with whatever the default easy option is such as not introducing oneself or staying home and watching Netflix with their family.There are six onehour new member discussions taught at your home by ward missionaries and I believe there is a Gospel Principles class for new members that you should attend for the first year. Also talk to your ward leaders to make sure you get hometeachers two males one might be a teenager and visiting teachers two sisters they should visit once a month but remember just like you know you should eat healthy but sometimes dont your homevisiting teachers generally know they should visit but may not feel motivated to exert the effort. Its not expected of you but theres no reason you cant call or meet up with them at Church to set an appointment for them to come visit you.Ask some of the relief society leaders what couples and sisters in the ward are similar age to you or have similar interests and invite them over to dinner with you and your husband or game night or something.As for why you havent been feeling the Spirit as much as you were I cant really answer that for you. Id just encourage you to keep trying to improve and be better every day. Pray more sincerely study the scriptures more intently. You really are so lucky theres so much new stuff in the Gospel for you to learn. There are so many excellent classic books that you get to read for the first time! Jesus the Christ by Talmage audiobook freely available online institute manuals the portions of the scriptures that you havent read yet Lucy Mack Smiths book on Joseph Smith is excellent so is Grant Hardys Understanding the Book of Mormon.Also there is tons of great LDS music that you get to experience for the first time and can bring the Spirit into your homelife.Best wishes.edit also if you like walking or need to get some exercise at the beginning of Relief Society when they are doing announcements you can ask for a moment stand up and introduce yourself as a new member and say you are looking for a walking buddy and if anyone is interested they can come up to you afterwards. Recognize that it might not work but you might find yourself with a nice little group of new friends. Substitute running or weightlifting if thats your thing.Also note that the Church is more than just your ward and if theres no one in your age then you can always ask sisters who they know your age from other wards in the stake and try to make friends with them!Also tonight is General Womens Meeting. Its kind of late Im not sure if theres some way you can use that to meet some new people or get to know some people you already know better. Depending on time zone perhaps you could invite some sisters from your ward over for some games or something afterward. Or you could ask a sister you think youd get along with if she wants to come with you so you have someone to sit with. Failing that get there  minutes early and be on the lookout for sisters your age and sit with one of them and introduce yourself as a new member and you know chat with them a bit and see what happens.,latterdaysaints,cku5bhp,6,t5_2uas2

2065353,0,t1_cl29212,I dont just know.  I read the science.  Sometimes I read it via textbooks sometimes I read it via other sources sometimes I read the actual scientific papers.  There is huge overwhelming evidence that the earth is around . billion years old that life on earth is almost as old and that the universe is around . billion years old.  Its not a question of whether my brain doesnt make mistakes its a simple question of solid evidence.  There is no rational evidence that the earth is only  years old or anything even close to it.  Every now and then the people behind creation science or intelligent design come up with some new piece of evidence and every time that evidence has a foundation of sand.  The vast majority of the justifications for a young earth all boil down to either The Bible is literally true so there! or to some explanation that betrays a horrible misunderstanding of science data evidence deduction and logic.I wonder what you think science is.  In my experience too many people hear science and they think that the process that leads to scientific discoveries is somehow similar to the process that leads to spiritual belief.  They dont understand that before a scientific paper is published scientists have spent countless hours analyzing whatever it is they analyze whether its rocks or bacteria or trees or the Krebs cycle or the microwave echo of the Big Bang or whatever it is.  They then spend countless more hours crunching the data looking at it from all sides trying to understand every possible conclusion that the data could be leading to using statistical and other analysis to narrow things down.  They then work very hard to draft a paper that explains what they did how they did it what their conclusion was and why that conclusion is valid but which boils down all of their work into  pages.  Then they send that paper off for other people to tear it apart looking for any possible place where they might have screwed up or made some silly mistake or made a bad assumption or some such.  It doesnt get published until after its survived a great deal of scrutiny and if its in an area thats at all relevant to other areas of science it will continue to be carefully scrutinised well after its publication.  And if someone discovers something new that mandates the revision or even the full dismissal of that papers conclusion that result will also be carefully scrutinised and so on and so forth.Im concerned that not only your remarks but the tone with which you deliver them suggests that you dont have a lot of respect for the scientific process.  I would encourage you to learn more about it.,latterdaysaints,cl2cobh,6,t5_2uas2

2085201,0,t3_2irsci,I think the membership of the church is at a critical stage where quite a few members are deciding whether or not they can accept what the leaders of the church say wholeheartedly. The best example although beaten to death is gay marriage. The church is against it and even fought against it politically. However many members cant rationalize a ban on gay marriage and support it. This creates a wedge between the members and the leaders. Members who believe that gay marriage should be legal despite vehement warnings to the the contrary are saying I believe that the leaders of the church are inspired by God except for this one thing. I know that they have spoken as and made policy as men in the past and based on my own personal morals and what I feel from the spirit this is one of those times.This is a lack of trust beginning between members and the leadership of the Church. There are other examples of this. I believe the lack of trust is caused by the lack of definitive doctrine. Right now on this sub active members can argue about what is doctrine and what is not because its become so unclear in the past decades. The best standard for doctrine the Church has is the Standard Works but those havent technically been added to since . What is usually pointed to doctrine since then such as the Revelation on the Priesthood and the family proclamation lack the scriptural authority you find in the Doctrine and Covenants and the other Standard Works. That is to say they lack an actual statements from God.I really genuinely feel that if the Church is true the most important thing it needs right now is verbatim revelation from God. Nothing else is really going to start patching doctrinal problems and healing spiritual wounds. Thats because every controversial conference talk or divisive church policy more members will wonder Is this really God speaking through the Prophet and Apostles or are they just speaking as men? Because I dont agree with what they are saying.This post might get deleted and I hope it doesnt because this at heart is actually faith positive. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints is built on a principle of continued revelation from God. There is no reason to justify a lack of that revelation. Everything I ever learned or taught in the Church runs contrary to it. If God is up there which most here believe and He loves His people which most here believe just as much as he did in the nineteenth century and the members of the Church are just as faithful I would argue even more so then He likely has something to say. So likely right now more than ever the Saints should be asking the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Where is the new scripture and revelation from God?,latterdaysaints,cl4vi2i,48,t5_2uas2

2190877,0,t3_2k5guz,I cant explain anything but I would like to chime in. People often act like Joseph was supposed to be perfect. But this is nonsense in my opinion. Only Jesus was meant to be perfect because hes part of the Godhead. We see countless evil people who are very much part of the Church. Think The Good Theif on Jesus right at the Crucifixion or Oliver Cowdrey or even Judas. Think if Judas had not been driven by greed and hate the fullness of Atonement may have never come to pass. And without the Crucifixion no Resurrection no visiting to America no fullness of the Gospel. And Jesus still chose this man specifically for that very reason.Or the guy in  Nephi who had the plates also driven by greed. Had Nephi not gone back to get his possessions there would be no record.What Im trying to say is that not all of the people in Gods plan are perfect. Some may even be perceived as downright evil. But God called them to fulfill his glory all the same.One last note we find in the Articles Of Faith. Many of our stories are wrapped in history forgotten by generations. But we profess and have been promised that God has revealed does now reveal and will yet reveal many things pertaining to the Kingdom.So have faith and take heart that the Missionaries of Christ did not explicitly mislead you. Perhaps they were simply not informed or there human condition got in the way of the Spirit. Or even that it was part of our Heavenly Fathers plan as a way to invite you into deeper study and a closer relationship with the one Jesus called Abba!

I do believe there is purpose to everything even if that purpose is nothing more than to pick out what we can learn.On a side note I may have a lesssignificant physical parallel to your dilemma. Before my mission I had a back fusion. Prior to leaving my doctor strongly suggested that I not be on a bike. The nerve! What missionary doesnt ride a bike? So I didnt tell my mission president this info and my first area was on a bike. My back wasnt prepared for that by any means. My companion wasnt sympathetic in the least pushing me hard. Dont get me wrong I like to push myself beyond my limits but I finally confessed that my doc recommended against it when it just got too much for me. I was removed from the area and was labeled a hypochondriac and lazy by my mission president and other missionaries. Dang. I know some missionaries use it as excuses but I was pretty dang sincere and embarrassed to have to admit it. I never did get along with my first mission president and it caused a lot of struggle on my mission. I should have just told him from the start. I had all the back up I needed. My second mission president was an orthopedic surgeon and had my back. It made things much easier for me to deal with the mental struggles of it. I think I see your moral is to be completely open and honest about any physical or mental conditions that may impact where you go and how you serve. It will save some heartache but not all from the judgmental.,latterdaysaints,clttp5l,0,t5_2uas2

I buy food from restaurants that sell alcohol. So technically Im supporting and affiliating with groups whose practices are contrary to the teachings of the church. What about a member who works at a film studio that produces Rrated films? Is that over the line? Heck one of my previous Bishops was a bartender. A quick google search of Harry Reids voting record will tell you hes about as prolife as democratic representatives get. But the fact that he runs for election with a D next to his name means he doesnt take his faith seriously? Maybe he does and maybe he doesnt but regardless this author seems too blinded by politics to be concerned with faith. I mean is he going to ask that in temple interviews?

2395532,0,t1_cm7r97d,gt The Church also will provide you with necessary tax papers for charitable donations if itemize your taxes. This gives you a chance to clear that up as well. Agreed. I believe the actual printout for taxes that summarizes your annual donations is given in January but squaring up the donations at the end of the year in a tithing settlement allows you and the church to be confident in the accuracy of that January printout. Some people may be wondering  why wouldnt donation records be accurate?  I believe the biggest reason is a duplicate record in the computer. For example some donations might be recorded as given by zombiedbaseIV others being recorded as given by ZdbaseIV and so on. Under that scenario the printout for zombiedbaseIV is lower than it should be. This problem gets discovered in a good tithing settlement. Most clerks do a really good job of avoiding this problem throughout the year but its common for people to be inconsistent when they write their name on their donation slips so this problem will probably never go away completely. ,latterdaysaints,cm7sna9,4,t5_2uas2

I simply dont define scripture as you do.  I am okay with scripture being a giant mess and yet doing exactly what it was designed to.... to bring us to Christ.  I do understand and appreciate that but often wonder is  defense of the current church leaves you just as susceptible to pushingsupporting nonsense as it leaves me.

3152105,0,t1_coojik6,gt focusing on love and understanding instead of how to fix people.I agree with you however I dont think those two things are exclusive to each other. Often times when we go out to fix someone it is out of love and its doesnt necessarily mean we dont understand them.Also I would say that there are probably a little bit of arrogance on both sides. Its arrogant to think you have all the answers sure. But its also quite arrogant to think that other people cant and shouldnt help you.  Were not on this planet alone. Were here to help each other out. Its also a bit arrogant to think you have no responsibility to help those around you avoid potentially dangerous or damaging behavior.However whether its arrogant or not it certainly comes off as arrogant to those you are trying to help.  Sometimes as members I think we forget that everyone has a unique path.  And While I personally believe that all paths will eventually lead back to a point where Christ has to be accepted or rejected whether thats in this life or the next. Clearly for some people their path in this temporal stage doesnt involve the church.  ,latterdaysaints,cooposx,4,t5_2uas2

Theres nothing wrong with taking some time to get yourself together but I promise it will happen much more easily if you set a goal first.  For example say I will serve a mission in  months. Between now and then I have to get a testimony. Im going to fast and pray and do everything I can to get it. Between now and then if you want to spend some time in the military go for it. You decide what your priorities are and youll get it. You are in control of your life.  If you want to know God in a way you have never imagined you can have it.

3451450,0,t1_cplh8jq,I think that I understand what youre saying. The difference between natural and supernatural seems nonexistent in a religion where all spirit is matter. But I do think that the word supernatural has a meaning and that God and the priesthood qualify. Supernatural things by definition are things that arent strictly materialistic. Theyre things that science cant explain. Just because there are spiritual laws out there for it doesnt not make it supernatural. I also identify as an atheist. I assume that OP has a similar view to mine. I dont believe in anything other than the laws of nature as we currently understand them. That leaves no room for God parting the red sea or Jesus healing lepers. It certainly gives us no room for Jesus coming back to life after his body decomposed for  days. Or for Joseph Smith actually seeing God or Jesus.OP has said that they think that atheism is a dumb world. So maybe she has different beliefs than me.This whole conversation is really interesting.,latterdaysaints,cploxfi,2,t5_2uas2

She entertains audiences with powerful inspirational videos without compromising her standards.  Ive seen her Im a Mormon video and Ive come to the belief that her choices are largely rooted in gratitude a form of worship.Its awesome how gratitude works.  We express our love for someone and in every case God not expecting payment back from them and God gives us blessings in return.  They may not be what we once wanted but they are always better.If we were compelled in all things from DampC  then we would be incapable of gratitude.  We could not feel a fullness of love.

3786680,0,t1_cqnogun,Although the spirit does speak to me on an emotional level sometimes this is one of the ways I know the spirit speaks to me.Since having to teach the scriptures I have come across passages many times that I just didnt understand.  Sometimes I have found things that appeared contradictory.  In addition to thinking about them and seeking out understanding in conventional social ways I pray for understanding when this happens.Without fail Ive gotten understanding from doing this in the past year and a half.  I believe that part of the reason Ive so consistently been able to get answers is because of my need to understand as a teacher called to serve in that capacity.  I also think a core component to that is where my heart is.  God knows that I have a sincere desire to understand and so he blesses me.I have a pretty good sense of myself by now Im .  Im a smart guy but where I work at a research lab Im usually not the smartest guy in the room so my intellect does have limits.  Im not really any smarter now than I was in my s and back then Id read the scriptures and not understand stuff in exactly the same ways.  The only thing thats changed are the calling and my desire to draw closer to God.  Theres no intellectual reason for me to be able to so consistently figure out things that cause me so much confusion and yet it happens on a nearly weekly basis where I go from not understanding to having it all just come together.Usually there is no burning in my bosom or emotional accompanying feeling when this comes.  It feels like any other time when Im learning something from an intellectual perspective which is to say theres no emotional aspect to it.

I dont understand how somebody can make solemn vows to love another for the rest of their lives or in your case forever and then think it is okay to threaten divorce when disagreements come up. Its not rational. When my wife first mentioned that she wanted a temple sealing I countered that if God exists and if he wants us to be together for all eternity then he is powerful enough to make that happen temple ritual or not but she was not interested in theological arguments she just wanted conformity with what she grew up believing. She and I really are incompatible in a lot of ways and probably should never have married in the first place but being rejected still hurts especially when I thought her religiosity and insistence on no sex before marriage meant that she would take the vows super seriously.

4060899,0,t3_372erl,The OP of that article relevantlife is known for reposting stories out of a deep hatred for the LDS church.  This leads him to lie in his headlines.

And Mormons arent popular here so relevantlife continues to repost the same dishonesty and gets rewarded for it.  The ends apparently justify the means.The LDS church has always lobbied.  But they rarely get involved.  As the article again states he was only approached twice.  Twice?  So much for complete control.  But admittedly when they do they do have a strong lobby.

4093132,0,t1_crms1pd,It isnt anathema. Protestants simply do not focus on the rewards of Heaven as heavily as Mormons do. In fact Mormonisms concept of exaltation which Bruce R. McConkie said is the only salvation that the Saints seek is basically the highest reward of Heaven. Mormonism seeks to define classify and rank the various rewards of Heaven in a hierarchical manner. What is definitely anathema in Protestant thought is the idea that these rewards in Heaven should be defined in the way that Mormonism defines them both currently and especially historically. If both Mormonism and mainstream Christianity supports the idea of rewards in Heaven based upon our works and they do the primary difference is how those rewards will be received experienced and enjoyed in relation to the rewards of the other inhabitants of Heaven. In Mormonism mere Heaven is not the goal. Exaltation the highest reward is the goal. In Mormonism these rewards are ranked hierarchically and the higher the reward the greater the privileges enjoyed. In Christianity the rewards are not the goal. Heaven is the goal. And all are equal in Heaven. Rewards will be meted out but the Bible does not describe these rewards. All we have is Christ admonishing us to lay up treasures for ourselves in Heaven but he does so in the context of righteous works acts of love and charity. And Paul says in Galatians  we should examine our own work and then we will be able to boast but not in relation to anyone else only in ourselves. I believe that our rewards in Heaven are NOT eternal increase and thrones kingdoms principalities and powers dominions all heights and depths. I believe our rewards are crafted here in mortality through the love and the goodness that we put out into the world. This is what comes back to us in Heaven. The more charity we show here and charity never seeks her own the more of it will come back. And thus rightfully does Paul say that well have something to boast of but only in ourselves not in relation to anyone else  charity is not puffed up.In a hierarchically structured afterlife those higher up will be constantly reminded by those lower on the totem pole that they did a better job in this life. In Mormonism those not exalted will be ministering servants to those who are exalted. Mormon Heaven will have a caste system. ,latterdaysaints,crmubyh,1,t5_2uas2
4093912,0,t1_crmlo3k,Their narrative was built on the crux that Joseph Smith was a conman and Martin Harris was a gullible fool.This cant possibly be true.  Martin Harris claimed to see and handle the golden plates.  With this information the only viable options left are to believe that Martin Harris was complicit in the con or that there actually were golden plates.Once we know that Martin Harris claimed to see those plates and kept that statement through his whole life even after having been kicked out of the church and receiving no benefit from the lie it wrecks the narrative that he was a dummy and Joseph Smith was using all these crazy methods of including him without actually showing him the plates.Of course the truth didnt service the joke Matt and Trey were trying to tell so they conveniently ended the story before they got to that part.,latterdaysaints,crmxje7,1,t5_2uas2
4102702,0,t3_37m6lv,In my opinion Joseph did a sufficiently Prophetic job in creating a work in English which accurately communicated the teachings of Christ found in the Book of Mormon.I believe that Joseph Smith was  correct in stating that he was called by God to produce it and that abiding by its precepts will bring us closer to God than any other book.All of that leaves quite a lot of room for Joseph Mormon Moroni Nephi and any of the other authors to make statements which are factually inaccurate out of context awkwardly constructed or colored by unseen bias.For example  Nephi is narrated as though Nephi is writing in his journal every night.  Maybe he didor maybe he wrote it years later after Laman and Lemuel had gone to war with his people.  That would color his depiction of Lehis family in their younger years.  That might be one reason why Laman and Lemuel arent given much context or nuance.  Theyre pretty much just the bad guys.  Nephi obviously loves them but he doesnt respect them or their choices which means that we dont get to hear their side of things.So if Laman were reading the record he might have some objections and he might not be wrong!  But at the same time Nephi is communicating true principles of faith and behavior even if he tends to be very black and white about moral issues.When reading the book I see other examples of this kind of thing the blatant racism of the Nephites and the kindasortamaybe racism of Jacob in condemning it the despair and fatigue of Mormon as he sees his people screwing up over and over again the loneliness of Moroni in what is for him a postapocalyptic world the overweening and perhaps overcompensating zeal that Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah bring to their missionary labors the quiet almost elegaic sense of loss felt all through the Book of Ether.For me those little pieces of human imperfection dont shake my belief in the truth of the book.  Just the opposite!  All of these things confirm to me that these were all real people.  There really was a Nephi and an Ammon and a Moroni.

I suspect its because hes saying You dont acknowledge that what happened was a miracle you just want a full belly.  Labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed.  Then said they unto him What shall we do that we might work the works of God?  Jesus answered and said unto them This is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  They said therefore unto him What sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work?  Our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written He gave them bread from heaven to eat.  Then Jesus said unto them Verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.  For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world.  Then said they unto him Lord evermore give us this bread.  And Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.  But I said unto you That ye also have seen me and believe not.  All that the Father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.  For I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me.  And this is the Fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day.  And this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day.  The Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven.  And they said Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith I came down from heaven?  Jesus therefore answered and said unto them Murmur not among yourselves.  No man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day.  It is written in the prophets And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh unto me.  Not that any man hath seen the Father save he which is of God he hath seen the Father.  Verily verily I say unto you He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.  I am that bread of life.  Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead.  This is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die.  I am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world.  The Jews therefore strove among themselves saying How can this man give us his flesh to eat?  Then Jesus said unto them Verily verily I say unto you Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you.  Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day.  For my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed.  He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him.  As the living Father hath sent me and I live by the Father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me.  This is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.  These things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.  Many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said This is an hard saying who can hear it?  When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them Doth this offend you?  What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?  It is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life.  But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him.  And he said Therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my Father.  From that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.Long right?So the people having been fed on loaves and fishes the night before follow Christ and beg him over and over again to give them miraculous food. They dont care about his message they dont care about him they dont care to listen. They dont even consider the providing of the bread as a miracle. They recognize a possible way to get out of the daily toil of living. Christ responds by saying essentially look bread is great but it isnt going to save you. It is literally meaningless. But follow me and youll have something better. That bread I gave you was just a symbol of the real possibilites.Nobody cared. Of course we cant guarantee the same thing would happen today but I tend to think human nature is the same today. We want the blessings without needing to change how we live. This isnt to say that healings and miracles dont happen. They do. All the time. Im a personal witness of incredible healings that have no scientific explanation. But Ive never seen one convert anybody nor cause somebody to remain in the church. Have you? No instead we tend to forget or minimize or find alternate explanations when its time to walk away. Like those who were fed we dont recognize the miracles even as we reap the benefits.God is concerned with conversion and that kind of miracle just doesnt do it.,latterdaysaints,csavpui,12,t5_2uas2

4322595,0,t3_3aghdp,I think sometimes people dont realize that our feeling of doubt can be the result of God telling us that we need correction.gt We turn to God for help when our foundations are shaking only to learn that it is God shaking them.gt Charles WestI remember this from DampC gt But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong therefore you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.I think often times people mischaracterize the feelings that come along with a faith crisis. They often think These doubts are evil. They are from Satan. I just need to power through this. expecting that the correct resolution is to come out where you started. Ive found that interpreting doubts through the lens of DampC  leads me to ask God why Im feeling a doubtful stupor of thought. And when I do Ive found that God is trying to communicate to me notions and faith that are better and more robust than what I was holding on to which necessitate doubts in my previously held incorrectincomplete notions. So I let go of the previous place on the rod that I was holding on to take a few steps forward grab hold of my new spot on the rod and my view of the Tree gets that much clearer.That previous place on the rod served its purpose. But the point isnt the rod its the Tree So we have to let go of one spot and move on to another in order to advance. I and think doubts can be part of the process. IMO doubts are what we feel when God is telling us that we need better models of faith.Remember what Joseph Smith felt before the first vision? He felt the constant weight of doubt. But rather than recoiling he saw the need for more faith more light and more knowledge to resolve the doubts. Doubt gives way to the light of revelation and the process can forever change us in ways more beautiful than we never imagined.,latterdaysaints,cscvvsj,10,t5_2uas2

4961692,0,t1_cujvodx,gtCould you elaborate on what you mean by this? Im not familiar with it.Sure thing. First Christs death. The Jewish court the Sanhedrin by law was not allowed to originate charges yet most biblical scholars agree that it was the Judges themselves who brought charges of blasphemy against Jesus without any prior testimonies by witnesses. Because they were either incapable or unwilling to kill him they changed their charges from blasphemy to treason a Roman crime so that the Romans would be responsible for carrying out the punishment. A capital sentence under Jewish law would have meant being stoned to death. Crucifixion was the capital punishment under Roman law. Since Christ was crucified and not stoned we can conclude that Jesus was condemned as a violator of Roman law even though Pilate himself found no fault in him. As far as I know He was not even pronounced guilty of treason. Now for the church. In  the Governor of Missouri Lilburn Boggs issued an executive order which he referred to as the Extermination Order. In the order he says that The Mormons must be treated as enemies and must be exterminated or driven from the state... Although the order was largely forgotten over the next decade or so it remained in effect until  when it was rescinded by Governor Bond.EDIT Whoa I just realized that Joseph Smith was initially brought to Carthage under the charge of disorderly conduct but posted bail. Before he could leave town his accusers changed the charge to treason a charge for which you cannot post bail. The Governor of Illinois Governor Ford came to Carthage and eventually met with Joseph and promised to bring him to Nauvoo the next day presumably to seek a fair trial. But when the morning came Governor Ford left town without Joseph. Instead he took most of the neutral troops with him and left the Carthage Greys a group who have publicly announced their intent to kill the Prophet in charge of the jail.Seems to me that like Pilate Governor Ford feared the crowd more than he valued truth justice or life itself. ,latterdaysaints,cujykrf,6,t5_2uas2

4976975,0,t3_3j0rwz,I was a bartender right before my mission.Working at one of your family dining establishments as I worked my way up to manager I had to learn all the insandouts of the restaurant. That included bartending.  The way things worked out my schedule put me in the service bar almost every Sunday. The service bar was a little tiny room in the kitchen where drinks were mixed since at that time in Utah drinks could not be mixed or poured in front of guests in a restaurant. So the bartender up front took all the orders and I would make all the drinks.To this day I am still a master of milkshakes and all manner of blended nonalcoholic desert drinks of the sort you might find at your neighborhood bar and grill. ,latterdaysaints,culvv8q,2,t5_2uas2

I just want to say that very few of us are  certain that God exists thats what faith is all about... but I dont think you should join the Church if you dont believe or have faith in God. We claim that it is His one and only true church. If you dont believe in Him why not just apply the teachings of the Church that you feel will benefit you and keep working on your faith?Just to be clear I believe that you should eventually get baptized but not before you begin to believe in God as a real Father who loves you. I believe that He is real that Jesus Christ is real and that they did really appear to Joseph Smith and restore their church. He is very aware of your needs and imperfections and God will answer your prayers if you take these concerns to Him and try to live as youre being taught by the missionaries.,latterdaysaints,cunbhfu,1,t5_2uas2

4993586,0,t3_3jbcse,I grew up in a moderately active Catholic family. I have nothing against the Catholic Church but I realized it just wasnt for me. Lots of the doctrine didnt make sense to me and I couldnt get adequate answers to my questions. When I moved away for my first year of college I went to a few different Protestant churches but none really appealed to me. Back when I was in high school a classmate had given me a copy of the BoM. I decided to read it and read the whole thing in about two months. I wasnt sure what to expect when I started but I liked that it preaches the same positive message that the Bible does. I was able to get the phone number for the sister missionaries in my area and told them I wanted to talk about what I had just read. My family didnt react well initially. They were concerned I wanted to join some sort of cult. My maternal grandparents are very devout Catholics who grew up being taught in school by nuns in Brooklyn. My grandmother insisted that I was following the work of a lustful man and that she was deeply concerned about the eternal wellbeing of my soul. After about a year or so I felt like everyone in my family got over it though. They still dont agree with Mormonism but there is no contention in my family. My college friends seemed a bit weirded out by my conversion at first but like my family once they realized that I was still the same person they got over it. Now I just get the occasional Mormon joke.,latterdaysaints,cunww2e,8,t5_2uas2

5307927,0,t3_3nnsb8,First of all that is not at all a ridiculous question.I have been a member of the church since I was  years old but I havent really practiced my faith for my whole life.  Ive spent significant chunks of my life including a  year break away from any sort of church activity.I always watched anything I wanted to.  I generally have always preferred movies that are rated R.On of the most wonderful thing about Christs pattern of teaching is that he allows us to embrace principles when we are ready.  You can watch rated R movies as a member of the church.  Leadership will not ask you about that as a matter of worthiness.Having said that the content in rated R movies does affect us in ways that are sometimes hard to admit.  Counsel given to us from church members is consistent that we should stay away from this content and they sometimes even explicitly say rated R movies.  Because of this some church members will inappropriately try to pressure  you into embracing the principle using tactics of shame.  This is NOT Christs way.  Allowing them to sin however is his way and we have to accept that the people we attend church with are all learning and growing in different ways.Currently I mostly stay away from TV and movies entirely because I recognize that the type of entertainment I enjoy has a negative impact on my ability to grow closer to my heavenly Father.  I would like to be able to enjoy appropriate movies but I just dont find them entertaining.  So Im learning to find other avenues of entertainment that dont involve watching TV or movies.At any rate if you feel like giving up movies and TV you like isnt something you want to do shift your focus to the things you like about the gospel.

His visits may be more frequent than in times past and His influence more strongly felt but I dont know that its going to be a constant thing. I think that those who are resurrected will not necessarily dwell on earth. Life will look much the same and when our time is up we will be resurrected but that will end our sojourn on earth.

For example it may be that Adam and Eve were the first who could be called humans or that they were the first who could house spirits that could be celestialized. Or that Adam was the first to hold the Priesthood. It seems like every time we as people say it must be this way we turn out to be wrong. Think of the Jews saying if Jesus is the Messiah then he must overthrow Roman rule. They were looking at the scriptures that refer to the Messiah in a very narrow way and discarding all other possibilities. Or Christians who say we have a bible so there is no more revelation. If your church says there is it must be false. Again an unfortunate misunderstanding of the scriptures revelation etc. There are lots of ways that both the scriptures and evolution can be true you just have to not shut out possibilities before youve even heard them.As for what other informed LDS people believe it might at least give you pause to consider that maybe just maybe youve been a bit hasty in declaring that evolution and the gospel are in all ways completely incompatible.

Repentance in a samesex relationship can only be preceded by divorcesplitting. In  a way the church is just as much protecting children from making covenants they will not be encouraged to keep.

Certainly not ruling out assignment software yet.Yes Im aware. However as you seem to have not bothered to read the  above explanations given by three apostles one at the time a Seventy as to how the decisions are made lets recap one more time from Elder Rasband gt After assigning a few missionaries Elder Eyring turned to me as he pondered one particular missionary and said So Brother Rasband where do you think this missionary should go? I was startled! I quietly suggested to Elder Eyring that I did not know and that I did not know I could know! He looked at me directly and simply said Brother Rasband pay closer attention and you too can know! With that I pulled my chair a little closer to Elder Eyring and the computer screen and I did pay much closer attention!gt A couple of other times as the process moved along Elder Eyring would turn to me and say Well Brother Rasband where do you feel this missionary should go? I would name a particular mission and Elder Eyring would look at me thoughtfully and say No thats not it! He would then continue to assign the missionaries where he had felt prompted.gt As we were nearing the completion of that assignment meeting a picture of a certain missionary appeared on the screen. I had the strongest prompting that the missionary we had before us was to be assigned to Japan. I did not know that Elder Eyring was going to ask me on this one but amazingly he did. I rather tentatively and humbly said to him Japan? Elder Eyring responded immediately Yes lets go there. And up on the computer screen the missions of Japan appeared. I instantly knew that the missionary was to go to the Japan Sapporo Mission.gt Elder Eyring did not ask me the exact name of the mission but he did assign that missionary to the Japan Sapporo Mission.gt The most likely scenario is that assignments are autopopulated and the apostles review any that are borderline assignments or otherwise need additional attention.That would be most likely if they were working from your knowledge. Clearly they are not. We dont have to speculate about a most likely scenario because the apostles have already told us thats not how they do it.Unless like I said before theyre just lying.

6127519,0,t3_3zh98d,LDS theology is Subordinationist meaning that the Son is subordinate to the Father. The traditional Christian view is that this was only during Christs mortal ministry but according to his prayer in Gethsemane he would be glorified again with the same glory that he shared with the Father in the beginning. Some members of the church may dispute this saying that Christ is indeed fully God. But in the preexistence he bore none of the defining characteristics of God in the Mormon sense he had no wife no physical body and no saving ordinances. So Christ at the very least started out in a subordinate position. I would go so far as to say that he remains in a subordinate position because in the next life when we are divided up into degrees of glory Christ reigns over a lesser kingdom than the Father. He is over the Terrestrial Kingdom and those who receive this kingdom do so because they cannot abide the presence of the Father.

6620968,1,t1_d042qqw,Statism isnt a fuzzy term. The state is a form of compulsory government where the government maintains a monopoly on violence and asserts the right to compel obedience to its edicts through a variety of terror tactics including but not limited to assault seizure of property being locked in a rape cage and even death. If your concern is despotism any form of state including our own is despotic. As such I fail to see how the possibility of despotism under anarchy is worse than the actuality of it now. Not that the assertion that anarchy ends in despotism is correct because it is notThe Lord endorsed the Constitution in the s. Id be happy to make a return to that level of government. Compared to today government would be practically nonexistent. It would be a great first step. I would celebrate it. But I wouldnt want to freeze there I would like to think our society more capable of liberty than they might have been in the mids in slaveholding America.And the scriptures do say God instituted governments but peskily the scriptures never say which ones God instituted and I doubt you would say that Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany are just as inspired by God as the Constitution. So not ALL governments are instituted of God. In any case I know of only one form of government for certain instituted by Him Selfgovernment a right and power given to every person by the blood of Christ.

We have some of the papyrus. We have translated it and it does not begin to match the Book of Abraham.

6697782,0,t1_d0c0bln,Yeah I remember when I got my patriarchal blessing the patriarch made the comment that all he does is he lives in such a manner to have the Spirit with him. When hes giving the blessing he has feelings and he tries to put those feelings into words and those words become the blessing. He brought this up to make the point that he doesnt literally have the words pop into his head so with patriarchal blessings his advice was to occasionally focus on the feeling rather than a literal wordforword when reading the blessing.That experience taught me that the scriptures are essentially written by people. The Spirit takes their words and uses that to teach us hence why there are many times where what you read is not what was written on the page.And I didnt know that detail about the baptismal prayer. Thats actually kind of interesting. I imagine some people might make a deal out of the fact that its not right but as I once explained to someone the Spirit is flexible.

If you dont know what to write just start writing about your day and how you feel about it.  Ive had so many testimony building experiences in writing a journal I cant count them. Scripture study... I know Standard Answer .... but if you have some struggle with this get a good companion guide.  Try Grant Hardys Understanding the Book of Mormon e.g. Pray vocally.  The DampC advises this.  Try it sometimes.  Seemed to help me...something changes when you speak out loud. Find an act of genuine service that makes you happy... something that lies inside your natural talentsskills.   It is impossible to maintain a testimony without this.Lastly when in doubt doubledown on your faith.  Tell the Lord you doubt and need help.

6919675,0,t3_4afh3y,Unfortunately the essays on church history that Elder Ballard is talking about are causing a lot of pain that I think could be avoided. For example in seminary last month one of the kids was asking questions about the different versions of the first vision that had been outlined in one of the essays. This turned what could have been a spiritual experience about how the prophet had been inspired by the Lord into a messy discussion about how there are many things we just dont understand and that the prophets understanding of things could have changed over time as he gained a greater knowledge.Dredging up the different versions of the first vision in no way helps build faith. It only serves to detract from the core message and create confusion.It would be one thing if some antiMormon history book talked about how the recountings of the first visions changed over time but putting this kind of messy historical information in church sanctioned sources sows doubt.,latterdaysaints,d10o30y,-2,t5_2uas2

If it really is a bad thing than what can you call it that will not shame people and still recognize it as a bad thing? I understand that we need to love people who struggle with a sinno matter what the sinbut can we call it something other than what it is? Give me some alternatives. Im open for suggestions.I personally know someone that has had mental health problems from being exposed to pornography long before they could even understand what it really was. The people that exposed him to it had no shame about it whatsoever. It messed up my friends mind and they didnt even know how they should look at people. It became stressful for them to even be around people because of the way they would look at them. It really bothered them and they even contemplated suicide several times. This was before they had heard people like Elder Holland speak about pornography. That person told me how grateful they are for people like Elder Holland. They said that the teachings of the Church allowed them to see pornography through the eyes of someone who did not have it ingrained into their minds. That perspective has given them hope not shame.All that being said I know some people who found out about my friends past and shamed him for it. I will strongly advocate against that. That is a terrible tendency in the Church. However pornography is a disease and we should recognize it as such. People that have a problem with it should seek help and recognizing that it is a disease is the first step in that process. I dont think that Elder Holland is the problem. I think pornography is the problem with pornography.,latterdaysaints,d12velo,1,t5_2uas2

7072836,0,t3_4cdlch,When I was growing up a teacher told a story about how he as a bishop came to conclude that a young couple being interviewed to be sealed was lying.  He didnt explain how he determined that but as he interviewed them they insisted they were worthy.   He excused himself and called the stake president.  The president asked Do they continue to  cling to the lie even after multiple questions about their worthiness? and the bishop said yes they do.   Then the president said then the sin will be on their heads... you may allow them to sign their recommends asserting that they are worthy and it becomes their issue to resolve after that.   I dont think this is the case for every situation but that was the counsel in this one.  We are ultimately responsible for our own worthiness.  Incidentally the endowment includes a warning about worthiness and I think that would be really hard to sit through if you were truly not worthy.  Its hard for me to sit through even when I know Im worthy.Now for another story  My parents were full blown alcoholics up to within weeks of attending the temple to be endowed and sealed.   We as their children had serious doubts about whether they should attend.   But they stopped drinking and we never found alcohol in the house after they had gone to the temple.  Now there were some other circumstances behind this that I think reinforced their desire to change but I will say that in some circumstances the finality of the temple is the event that seals the repentance process.  It certainly was for them.   And Im profoundly grateful for it.,latterdaysaints,d1i2i2b,5,t5_2uas2

Soon after they were gone for the day and I was alone in the building. No one told me they were all gone and no one bothered to secure the entrance doors. A bit later there were about several uniformed police that showed up at my office door with guns pulled and aimed. Nearly crapped in my pants at that moment.Turns out they got a  call on an armed robbery from this location. I told them that I have and the other clerks office and Bishop offices had the only phones and I made no such call. After they searched me and after the other officers came over and said the building was clear di they put their weapons away. They did a check on my ID and after showing them I am the ward clerk via computer. They called the operator. She said the line was still open.She also said it was a young girl. Well I said it couldnt be my line as it was hung up. I went in to our Bishops office. Nope good there. Took the officers over to the other wards side. Yep their door was unlocked and phone was off the hook still connected to  operator.Needless to say that afternoon I gave a chewing out to the Clerk in the other ward and the Primary presidency on letting the kids run around unsupervised in the Church and not securing the building nor inform me of any such leaving..,latterdaysaints,d1s4hdk,1,t5_2uas2

7372314,0,t3_4gb5je,Interesting article but I have a couple of nitpicks with it.  For one I disagree with the ranking of the law of chasity next to murder.  I know... I know that there was a period of time where the Alma  reference was explicitly taught to refer to going after the harlot.  However the text and the later verses specifically verse  alludes to the great sin being forsaking the ministry and so leading others astray.  That could be a whole post in itself.  Commence the stone throwing outrageAlso the writer neglects the sin that God has placed above all except for denying the holy ghost denying forgiveness.  Dont believe me?  Go ahead read DampC  it clearly says that  regardless of the sin if you dont forgive the trespasser you have an even greater sin.  Ultimately I disagree with the authors conclusions.  I dont think its wrong to see a hierarchy of sin.  In fact I would argue that not seeing a hierarchy of sin is just ludicrous.  We cant hold swearing on the same level as committing violent crimes thats just dumb.  I do however agree that the intent of the article is to focus more on ourselves and our personal growth than other peoples problems.  I like the whole mote and beam principle in the sermon on the mount.  Ultimately our sphere of influence is greatest when we consider ourselves.  Our influence over others is for the most part tangential.  ,latterdaysaints,d2g6j9s,5,t5_2uas2

I feel weak and get some pretty good headaches but at the same time I can feel a sense of peace and purpose when I do fast.Think about it this way how your body feels when it doesnt get food is probably how your spirit feels when it doesnt get spiritual nourishment.  Fasting can be a great opportunity for your spirit to grow and be nourished like a spiritual Thanksgiving feast.  I have always felt that fasting is a great spiritual booster and can help us receive revelation or comfort for the challenges we face.Fasting is also a reminder that you can discipline yourself and do hard things.  Much of the gospel is focused on controlling our natural man our instincts and gluttony is one of them.  By fasting you are proving to yourself that you are in control of your body not the other way around.And of course fasting is also an opportunity to give to others.  Fast offerings used to be actual food items like wheat and potatoes.  Now were asked to give money and to do so generously.  By fasting you are helping those who dont have the food they need.In short its all about the attitude you have going into it and the same could be said for any other commandment or direction that the Lord gives us.

And it also doesnt mean that the church should not be able to give a comment on the subject either especially when it means clarifying positions or topics. Im less concerned about the initial report that opened up the discussion on the BYU Honor Code. That needed to happen. The article I referenced was not about BYU though. It was a hack job that used BYU tangentially to pick a fight. Even the headline doesnt reference BYU. If someone only read the headline theyd have every bias confirmed that the church is outdated promotes rape culture etc. The article itself quotes the handbook and then proceeds to demonstrate how the church does exactly the opposite. The bias is pretty clear in that article and many others that have been published by the Trib.Even worse than that which might be understandable and even forgivable in the interest of independent and open journalism the proponents of each side are vitriolic when it comes to who is in the right. Read the comments of Deseret News or Tribune articles. Its sickening how hateful the people are to each other on either side of any article. Religion is polarizing. Especially one like Mormonism. Bias is going to be inevitable I suppose. But that doesnt make it good in either direction.

It seems youd be going a bit overboard.gtTo a shepherd their sheep was their livelihood. Sheep stay together in a group fairly well when grazing. Going after one sheep was definitely logical because that sheep had time and care invested in it. One more sheep to shear meant being able to take care of your family better and bring able to have a bigger flock the next season . Sheep get highly anxious when separated from the flock and are highly vulnerable to predators.Going after a lost sheep seems logical but leaving a flock as large as  in the wilderness with no one to watch them was not a thing that was done in the time of Jesus. Also similar to the previous parable why would he celebrate so profusely when he found it showing and telling everyone he met. Its clear from the original text that these things were meant to sound exaggerated and ironic.Of course Jesus knew what he was talking about and he knew his audience. Thats the point.

8121059,0,t3_4qgn9r,Second what has been said.  Its personal preference.  More nuanceThe church does officially discourage guys from getting pierced ears and gals from getting more than one piercing per ear but it isnt grounds for official sanction.  More than one set of piercings will sometimes disincline Mormon men for this reason.As for makeup it depends on what makeup and how much of it were talking about.  Is it makeup to a level or degree that you might see at a semiformal diner party or full on goth?  The church doesnt have a stance I think but it might still be relevant.  If he grew up seeing a particular level of makeup on the sisters of his ward he may be inclined to commensurable levels on girls that he would date.  This would still be personal preference but could be culturally driven.  As the saying goes sometimes less is more.Also worth noting were discouraged from tattoos and other body piercings.  They body is a temple and should be treated with respect.Ok now to hypothesize.  Marriage and child rearing are considerably easier when spouses share the same religion.  It just is in a million small ways and a few really big ones.  Theres also a theological element here thats not worth delving into.  The church does officially encourage dating from within the church and eventually marrying within the religion.  Marrying someone outside the faith is discouraged but condoned.  A Mormon can marry someone of another faith in our chapels and remain a member in good standing.  It happens but your son probably knows that it is not preferred.

8204080,0,t3_4rpidt,Im currently going through what your husband is going through. My wife has felt like you have. I feel very fortunate that she has allowed me to remain very transparent with her and she with me. Weve had a lot of late nights. Me in tears saying that Im exhausted. Her in tears saying she cant listen to me any more. Both of us in tears contemplating leaving. Both of us in tears contemplating staying. We have children ages  that complicate the matter even further. Currently we hold busy leadership callings and were active...but its so hard. I would say to listen to your husband. Validate his concerns. Hear him out. But when you have reached your limit he needs to do the same. He needs to listen to you validate your concerns and hear you out. I can only describe my journey like the journey of someone who has lost a loved one tragically. Im hurt. Im depressed. Im confused. I can get angry. I want to draw lines but I learn that there are no absolutes. Im nearly  years into my faith journey and heres what Ive learned. The church will never be the same for me but it is still a good place with good people trying to do good things. . The here and now are what matter most. What can I do today? I can help my wife with whatever she is stressed with. I can make my kids laugh. I can try to strengthen my family relationships. I can plant a tree. I can be a hard working honest employeeprofessional. I can help those around me to succeed and be happy. Today is real. Today isnt a theory. Today is happening right now. Make the most of it and learn to love unconditionally. . My marriage and family matter more than the church. Though Im amazed at the immediate pressure I feel that I cant be a great husbandfather if Im not a totally believing member. The more time that passes the more I learn that isnt true. I have been a better husbandfather in the past few years than I ever have in my life. . Church history is ugly and becoming more transparent every day. Its going to take a while for the church to have a narrative that supports the reality of our history...but it will. Your husband isnt wrong to have doubts and questions. What he is finding arent antimormon lies. Our history is messy. The question is whether or not heyou together can form a narrative that can strengthen your marriage and your family. My wife and I have both decided that were worth it. Im worth being listened to. Shes worth slowing down my journey and harnessing my emotions. Were trying to go through it together. Im not sure where it will end...but well be together. As long as were together  years from now Im happy and so is she. But right now its so incredibly hard on some days. Other days not so much. Of course keep praying. Keep loving each other. You need a Christlike nonjudgmental love now more than ever.  ,latterdaysaints,d532bti,14,t5_2uas2

8637394,0,t1_d6kra8t,This is really interesting. If I were in similar circumstances of course this would be a trial for me. It would devastate me. I disagree that it automatically relieves the OP of any obligation. Thats a decision the OP has to work out.I guess Im in a different set of thinking. I believe God knows all things has all power and is everywhere present by the power of his Spirit. He knew this would happen when they got married. He knew every detail. He knows the cancer growing in someones body before its detected. The question is how are we going to respond in our ignorance selfishness foolishness and jealousies. Will we put off the natural man?.... and submit and what are we required to submit too? or will we start over. I think OP is facing one of the biggest trials someone can face. But with faith he as well as his wife as well as everyone else can know everything can be okay. Everything can work out and the solution? Jesus Christ. I think were all too quick to judge another for their actions handing out sentences as if we were the Supreme Being. I pray for this man that he will find peace and also find the direction God wants him to go. My experience in life has told me these things are never as cut and dry as they appear. Even though the pain and challenge and struggle is very real. While its true that it could be a herculean load of baggage. But I am grateful I have a Savior who while in a sacred place took on himself that herculean load of baggage and did so without complaint. All the while saying he did so because I love YOU.

Not only is she a tenured professor but she also has  kids. If the church felt uncomfortable with her desire to be a professor there is no way she could get tenure.For myself I believe  that kids come first. But kids go to school during the day. Most mothers take up a hobby when this happens but I plan on my hobby to be physics. Im at the top my class and I plan on obtaining my Ph.D. I know that if Heavenly Father has different plans for me he would make it painfully obvious. Hes made it obvious for me to do many big decisions in my life. I constantly pray to say that Im willing to have kids earlier than I plan after  years of grad school and I pray to always be receptive to His plan for me. Basically you probably shouldnt get a job just because you want fancy things or prestige but if you have something you enjoy and you feel that God is okay with your job then you should go for it!Sorry for any typos Im on  my cellphone.,latterdaysaints,d6v31n2,5,t5_2uas2
8716901,0,t3_4ze5hq,There are different things that we have faith in. First theres faith that God exists. This one might be easily solved by God simply appearing to us and letting us know hes there. But were deceived all the time by things that we do see that are right in front of us. God wants us to learn to use our spiritual eyes instead of relying solely on our physical ones because our physical eyes and brains are far more fallible and make far more mistakes than we realize. Second theres faith in Gods power and that hell keep his promises. This I think is the far more important kind of faith and even if God lived in your house and spoke with you face to face daily youd still have to develop it regardless. Its the same kind of faith you have to develop with other people. Are they reliable and trustworthy? Do they keep their promises and do what they say theyll do? Even someone explicitly telling you that they will does nothing to show that to you. A relationship must be developed before that can happen. Its the same with God. We have to develop a relationship with him and learn to trust him. Otherwise well never progress because we need his help.All of this will be useful in the eternities. Learning to use our bodies in tandem with our spirits as well as building meaningful eternal relationships are the major reasons for this portion of our existence because well need to continue to develop those abilities in the next life as well.,latterdaysaints,d6v92fz,2,t5_2uas2
8720167,0,t3_4xioi2,Last year my oldest daughter was going through an incredibly hard time with depression anxiety cutting and even thoughts of suicide. I wrote to President Monson for advice both for myself and for her. I felt like maybe I was over stepping my boundaries but I felt impressed to write. Within the week I was contacted by our state LDS Family Services representative. He had been in contact with Pres. Monson and was instructed to call us immediately to make sure that my daughter wasnt in any danger of hurting herself and to see if he could provide us with any immediate resources for her. He was also instructed to call Pres. Monson back and report what he had learned because Pres. Monson was leaving the next day for his Thanksgiving holiday and wanted to make sure we were safe. That in itself was so incredibly comforting and heartwarming. Not only had he personally read my letter he wanted to make sure she out of millions of people was ok before he left on his welldeserved family holiday. About  weeks later I recieved an official looking envelope from the church headquarters in SLC. It was a letter from President Monson to my daughter telling her how hed put her name in on their prayer roll at the temple how loved and cherished she was as a daughter of God. There was a lot more in the letter but the are almost too personal and sweet to share here. She sobbed reading his letter and holds it as one of her most prized cherished possessions. Fast forward to nearly a year later and her spirit has brightened her despair is receding she was on the Honor Roll all year played basketball attends both church meetings and YW activities regularly and will be starting Seminary on Monday. There is no doubt in my mind that our Prophet is a true servant of God. He loves each one of us dearly and is truly concerned for the well being of every member of this church. I will never forget his effort in taking time out of his incredibly busy schedule to connect with my daughter personally.

There is the Father the Son and your own personage of spirit made holy.gtWhere we differ is I dont believe there is a separate individual spirit person set aside for all mankind as the Holy Ghost.Yes this is definitely the difference.  We agree with the function of the light of Christ and how it sanctifies us and prepares us for eternal glory.  So in short you think each of us are the Holy Ghost as predicated upon the light we have received?  So you take every instance of Joseph referring to it as a personage as reference to each of our spirits instead?Whats interesting is I had a guy on my mission say each of us are the Holy Ghost but he wasnt LDS Im not sure if he ascribed to any of the other LDS denominations.I still disagree with your interpretation but Im not sure this gap can be bridged.  I just dont think we would be referred to as the Holy Ghost contingent upon us becoming one with God.  I dont think God would say we are part of the Godhead in that way.  It seems inconsistent to me the first two members are individualized beings but the third member is referring to all of us.  This issue ultimately comes down to the proper interpretation of Josephs meaning of personage in reference to the Holy Ghost.  The leaders have been clear that He is an actual entity that testifies of truth to us.  The church is founded upon the shoulders of the Apostles and prophets.  I am going to follow the interpretation given by those men because I fully believe they are not leading us astray and I dont think God would leave this interpretation in the dark to us.

Thats my interpretation of your question unless you mean something else.Ill admit I dont have a strong position on this.  I can see the arguments from both sides.  Ill give the opposing view based on your comment unless you agree.If we consider suffering a condition of mortality whatever it may be and we consider suicide to be the wrong way to get around that suffering then it follows that suicide or assisted suicide would be considered the route not to take.  It essentially reads as tough it out I know.  Im not one to tell people what to do but I can see the reasoning.I think ultimately some situations do necessitate death Im just iffy on it being done deliberately unless its just removing the aid which prolongs life.  Then that seems okay in certain circumstances.  One is to remove the prolonging the other is deliberating taking life those lines are blurred in many cases in which I say judge it as best you can.Sorry that I cant give a better answer.

9345635,0,t3_58dpnv,A few thoughts as I read through thisgt You have a good church. Your people need to own it. They are borrowing their religion.Our church is really good at making church a fairly consistent experience around the world. A side effect of this though is that I think that we are often somewhat disempowered. Rather than study scriptures and ask what do I believe we tend to look at scriptures and ask what does The Church teach? Also members often look to The Church to make decisions for them instead of making those difficult decisions themselves. The church also encourages this in some cases.gt Ive often thought that because we do need to live by faith here the Book of Mormon for instance is never going to be proven by archaeology or history or DNA studies because the Book of Mormon will always need to remain a matter of faith.This is something that Ive been hearing a lot about especially from Terryl and Fiona Givens. Is it a popular opinion? Is it gaining ground amongst church leadership? Im a little surprised to be hearing this opinion from a General Authority although Im less surprised since its Marlin Jensen. Id never ever expect to hear something like this from Elder Holland.gt Which I translated for this young man as simply saying Just lean into the church. Soften you skepticism and lean into Mormonism as things come to you. As you marry as you raise children and see if this isnt the way youd want to live you life and the way God would want you to live it. But there are literally thousands of young people and young couples much to my dismay even in our little secluded valley Ive met with  or  couples in recent years that are in their s or early s who have left the church over these troublesome issues. So I think its personally been a great loss to the church.I am entirely sympathetic toward people who leave. Yes its a great loss to the church but its very easy for troublesome issues to shake faith in a one true church. It would be another thing altogether if we taught that we were a pretty good church the way youd want to live your life. Thats not what were taught though. We are taught that the value of the church is in being true being right having exclusive authority etc. If that is challenged then its a long and difficult journey to find other reasons to stay.gt But what its really taught me is that there are many ways to live this gospel. And I love the last panel. I didnt hear it all but that idea about love and acceptance and being nonjudgmental with each other. Assuming hes doing the best he knows how. Whatever our approach whatever our degree of knowledge or the depth of our fault just to be in it together to appreciate that its not clearcut its not the same for everybody. I think this is something that create an atmosphere of love and acceptance in which faith could prosper more than it probably does in the church at the present time.AmenIs this a sign of a shifting approach to Mormonism among church leadership or is Marlin Jensen more of an outlier? It really does seem that how can we get people to stay is becoming one of the most significant questions that the church is facing right now.,latterdaysaints,d90mk2o,2,t5_2uas2

But nowhere as far as I know has God said DampC  is a commandment now.  In my opinion if we are to believe that the decision to begin enforcing parts of the WoW was inspired it must also stand to reason that the decision not to enforce other parts of it is also inspired or at the very least something that God is not bothered about right now.DampC  at any rate makes it very clear that God doesnt forbid the eating of meat in any way.,latterdaysaints,d921g9n,4,t5_2uas2
9356838,0,t3_58nq7a,Here are my quick bullets. Ive been a decades upon decades lifelong active member and active learner and havent really noticed any special exceptions about omitting or deemphasizing eating meat.. The Word of Wisdom is asked in the temple interview. It is a very rough barometer to see if there is a deeper problem. Since its one of the more easy commandments to keep imo I think the key intent for usage in the interview is to quickly uncover any issues. The basics of  coffee  tea  tobacco and  alcohol can be a gateway to other issues as well. I would say if one of the big  are discovered then the BishopricStake Presidency should auger deeper. Parsing beyond the big  starts to cross into the letter of the law granularity to how much vegetables fruits amp meat is consumed. Over granularity starts to track to being overly concerned overthinking the base intent of the doctrine and pedantry.. Contemporaneous to the time the revelation was given meat would spoil quickly and the consumption thereof could be fatal. Hence one of the main reasons why the term sparingly was mentioned imo. Nowadays with refrigerators being prevalent meat can be stored much longer without said risk. Also during their timeframe it was often believed that meat was the staff of life  the Lord seemed to be establishing a mind shift that grains should be such instead. Also sparingly will vary based on age weatherseason location activity and other factors. An infant for example will usually not be fed steak.. Scriptures like DampC  amp   Tim  Genesis  amp  all point to the idea that there is nothing perverse with ingesting meat. Jesus ate fish. If he ate meat then meat consumption is not taboo in any way imo. Also I believe prior to  the comma was absent in verse  that creates an entirely different grammatical modification where if absent it could be ambiguously understood and appearing to conflict with other verses.  . In short as with any any doctrine there is the letter of the law and there is the spirit of the law. Grinding things down to a list with heavy criticism on the preciseness and exactness is letter of the law. The Pharisees were condemned by Jesus due to their letter of the law practice. Mormons should understand and focus on the big  and be left to interpret what sparingly means for themselves individually and for their families.,latterdaysaints,d921ost,5,t5_2uas2
9381890,0,t3_579laa,Hi This is a very important question.  I would be very glad to correspond with you privately if you like.  I will try to briefly answer a bit of your question here.  This is a big subject area.  For your information I just completed a diploma in theology from a leading international university and wrote my last exam on Wednesday.You are wondering about the LDS position on the divinity of Christ.  The answer to your question starts with the word divinity.  Here you are talking about what makes God God.  Simply God is not a creature but is the creator of all that is created.  Gods identity as creator was one of the principle things that identifies God as God in the OT.  The identity of God is the principle concern of the OT and not the nature of God.  What is Gods identity?  God for example creates forgives sins and judges.  If God creates then God is transcendent and is before all creation.  What is creation?  Creation is what we see before us and it has its origin from Gods act of creation.  God is also responsible for its ongoing existence.  God is not part of creation.In Mormonism it is important to appreciate that God does not create but makes.  This is made clear in the temple film.  God is not responsible for the elements but takes of existing elements and fashions the world from them.  This gives God a different identity then what we find in the OT.  Secondly God is himself part of creation and a created being.  Many are familiar with the couplet but there has been much more taught and said about it over a long period of time to firmly establish the Mormon principle of eternal progression the same progression that God undertook.Mormonism holds for a heavenly mothers see the recent essay put out by the church on a heavenly mother who in concert with her husband fashions spiritual bodies for preexiting intelligences.  These intelligences inhabit a world of spirits with their physical parents.  The leading spirit is Jesus.So to the question is Jesus divine?  Even if we ignore that Mormonism includes God in creation and so denies his divine identity we cannot conclude that Jesus is divine.  Jesus is created and so a creature and by definition creatures are not divine.The responses you have received to your question have failed to appreciate that they have offered a new definition of divinity.  This is an absolutely critical aspect of understanding Mormonism and especially when bringing it into conversation with Christian doctrines.  Mormonism appropriates the vocabulary of Christianity and redefines it.  So here I have described very briefly that creation and divinity have a meaning for Mormons that is not shared by Jews and Christians highlighting the very different concepts of God between them.I would be happy to discuss the heresies you mention and their relationship to Mormonism if you have an interest.,latterdaysaints,d957z03,1,t5_2uas2

9437885,0,t3_59xqzx,I did a Software Engineering internship with the Church in their FamilySearch department. The pay was about normal in my experience  comparing to the national average is misleading because of cost of living. Utah has a low cost of living so salaries are lower but you still get the same buying power as you would elsewhere. As for the actual experience  it was highly mediocre. I have never had so many meetings in a software engineering environment anywhere else. The way the church runs things is slow and very different. In my experience the church was where engineers go to die. Most of the engineers were men at the latter stages of their career and had come to the church for stable employment before they retired.Personally I think there are far better environments for an internship where youll learn a lot more than you would at the church.

Not that he promoted sin its just that he was very compassionate.  When he got angry it was with power seeking hypocrites people who maliciously profited from the poor etc.So I wouldnt feel comfortable throwing around the word bad to describe people who are making mistakes.Having said that I think your classmate is probably not trying to be as harsh as she sounded. Many people generalize to simplify and its easy to say Bad Mormon when referring to a situation that is likely more complex.

For a woman who DOES want to do something even as basic as be the Ward Financial Clerk because she has a degree in accounting she would never ever be given that opportunity to choose to accept or reject the calling.

My issue is that I am severely lacking reasons to believe in God or the church at all. I currently have substantially more evidence that it is not true than it is. Im here looking for reasons to believe trying to disprove atheism rather than the contrary. gtIf there was concrete proof of the existence of God that we could validate it would negate the purpose of coming here to earth in the first place.Off topic but Ive never understood this doctrine. If God revealed Himself in fire and glory to the world a select few people would still rebel. But the vast majority would completely change and live the commandments even if He didnt involve Himself beyond removing the need for a basic testimony of Him. It baffles me that the literal billions of people on the earth who are religious arent permitted to know the full truth of Mormonism or Christianity or whatever. gtTo believe or not to believe is a choice that you must make. It is a decision on how to live and how to view the world. You can see coincidences. Or you can see Gods hand in your life. I know it is much more difficult to do than to say but you need to decide if you believe or not. It requires faith. Faith by definition means that you do not have proof. I understand your point but this horrifies me beyond words. I cannot accept it. I need to understand how to live my life and if God wont reveal Himself I cant follow Him. gtEvery antimormon I have ever encountered was a bitter person who had a hateful story where they were offended by something or someone. They never tried to understand the other side of the story and dedicated much of their energy to tearing down and vilifying the church or Mormons at every opportunity. I find that very sad. The church isnt perfect. And neither are the people in it. But it is a force for good in this world.Ive met many people like that both in and out of the church. Its present in religion politics finances and nearly everything else. The antimormon position is that the church is a cult ruining lives. They want to help people escape something that ruined their life. Of course they will be a bit vitriolic since they are genuinely hurt. But that hatred demonstrated by a few or even by many does not invalidate the position they have of the church possibly being untrue. Thanks for your post and your time.

Providing safe and legal abortions is an option but its not the only option. And if youre of the opinion that its an inherently immoral option then providing it legally is a nonstarter. Id also argue that leaving the woman in a position where a backalley abortion is even a tempting option is immoral too.Besides people who make the argument tend to paint it like there will be a  replacement of legal abortion with backalley abortions.

This paragraph from the old Institute DampC Student Manual gives some good insightThe book which John saw represented the real history of the worldwhat the eye of God has seen what the recording angel has written and the seven thousand years corresponding to the seven seals of the Apocalyptic volume are as seven great days during which Mother Earth will fulfill her mortal mission laboring six days and resting upon the seventh her period of sanctification. These seven days do not include the period of our planets creation and preparation as a dwelling place for man. They are limited to Earths temporal existence that is to Time considered as distinct from Eternity. Whitney Saturday Night Thoughts p..In General Conference not too long ago Elder Holland said I do not know the details of what happened on this planet before the Fall of Adam and Eve but I do know these two were created under the divine hand of God.So we might not know all of the details of the Creation or following history of the planet Earth but we can have faith in what has been revealed to us through modern prophets and hope that eventually even more will be revealed to the saints.

And the overall growth in membership in  was the lowest since .Thats nothing dire but it has been slowing. Are the exmos right that this slowing growth is because people are finding historical issues and whatnot that prove the church isnt true? Well its surely part of the issue. But theres much more going on.The first is that people are becoming more secular in general. More Millennials identify as none no religious affiliation than ever before. People just arent into institutionalized religion. It isnt a Mormon problem its an all religion problem.The second things is our services. While we offer the restored truth a lot of people arent asking the questions that we offer answers to. That is I dont know a lot of people who are asking Which is the one true church? Who has the authority to do ordinances? Whats the right way to do baptisms. Theyre not asking the same questions that Joseph Smith asked and that even people were asking  years ago. For many modern folks its more important for a church to be good than it is to be true. They want a church where they enjoy the services feel edified like the programs for children etc. I can say as a convert and someone who still goes to a popular megachurch sometimes with my extended family in this competition in the church marketplace we are waaaayyy behind.  years ago even  years ago most church services were like our own  pews hymns slowgoing. Today the gap between our services and others is HUGE. For a lifelong member I dont think this fact will be easy to totally grasp.Its true that people simply need to hunker down and accomodate themselves to the LDS way of doing things but at a certain point the gaps just too big and it is and will be going forward a significant obstacle to successful missionary work.So to the original questionis the church in trouble? Yes and no. We have the truth so were always going to be around but yes our growth is slowing. But the slowing I think has much less to do with our doctrine and history and much more to do with our services and those can easily be changed over time.,latterdaysaints,df9wszi,21,t5_2uas2

Imagine having significant equity in your home giving you the freedom to relocate for career or personal reasons and suddenly finding your mortgage under water because of a big drop in your homes market value. Or having saved for years to buy a home in a nice area and having all that savings youd sunk into a relatively recent home purchase disappear suddenly leaving you with no equity at all and no ability to relocate without walking away from homeownership and becoming a renter again.

11451077,0,t3_63fvbh,If it helps think of this experience I had a while backI was sitting at my desk.  A phone call came in. I talked with them for a while. Afterwards my coworker asked me Who was that?It was google I said.Now think about that.  In reality it was technician  Shelly from Washington employed by Googles adwords department. But I said It was google and my coworker instantly knew what I meant. She knew I didnt mean the corporate entity of Google called me up. She knew I didnt mean the CEO called.  She knew it was a representative of Google and that by working with this representative I was working with the company.It may feel sacreligious to consider it this way but the word God is not a name but a title. It is owned fully by our Father in Heaven and he alone decides who gets to use it. In the case of Jesus Christ the full title authority and power of God were given so that he could complete his assignment and mission  to create rule and redeem all the earth in the name of the Father. ,latterdaysaints,dftyy1v,15,t5_2uas2

11493890,0,t1_dfyt42v,In this forum on Reddit maybe I could be open about how hard it is. In church every week? Not so much. Everyone is obsessed with looking perfect. I attended a meeting last year for people in leadership I was in the RS leadership at the time about how tominister to LGBT members. The teacher said some really stupid stuff like that homosexuality was most often the result of abuse but one thing he said that felt very true was that people have a tendency to put same sex attractions or behavior on this pedestal of sin like its wayyyyy worse than any sin an average member would be committing when all sin is not acceptable to God. When you know that the minute you tell them youre gay a good number of people in the church will start desperately scrambling to define themselves as inherently morally superior to you or paradoxically to define you as spiritually superior to them its such a hard trial you must have been soooo valiant in the preexistence! HF chose you to bear this trial because youre so strong! it makes you never want to share your struggle at all. And then you become really isolated and start to crack and get angry. ,latterdaysaints,dfytxzu,2,t5_2uas2

11782898,0,t1_dgvgy16,Korihors story would be high comedy if not for its dangerous message that his should be the fate of nonbelievers. Its comical because the author goes on for several verses that belief is no crime then the next verse is hes arrested for preaching his belief. Theres also the paper thin reasons Alma gives that prove the existence of God and the error of Korihor. But in the end his crime is blasphemy and he is cursed for his contrary belief. Alma doesnt cast out the devil that possessed him which could have made Korihor a believer. Instead Alma curses him to punish and set an example of what happens to unbelievers.We only think Korihor knew there was a god because Alma tells him and the reader. Korihors socalled confession after the curse is so sincere that not even Alma believes him.No what Korihor did wasnt bad preaching isnt bad. Whether its true or not is is really immaterial because its very hard to say which belief is true or not. The high priests and the civil authorities were upset because he was teaching something they didnt like he was having some success and in the end despite the lofty rhetoric of religious freedom Korihor was punished for belief and proselytizing.,latterdaysaints,dgvmoep,8,t5_2uas2

He was still worthy but his faith was at crisis level his emotional burden grew ever heavier and his spiritual pain was more and more profound. He was by turns hurt confused angry and desolate.gt ...gt But with the grace of God her own tenacity and the help of scores of Church leaders friends family members and professionals this importuning mother has seen her son come home to the promised land. Sadly we acknowledge that such a blessing does not or at least has not yet come to all parents who anguish over a wide variety of their childrens circumstances but here there was hope. And I must say this sons sexual orientation did not somehow miraculously changeno one assumed it would. But little by little his heart changed.,latterdaysaints,dgw9y40,16,t5_2uas2
