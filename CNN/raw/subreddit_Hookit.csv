3291591,0,t3_2xu27d,Had something similar happen to me a couple times.  One was on I in Brunswick the other was along a back road near Glennville.  Both had one thing in common the owner wanted to retain their godawful rims and replaced them with stock or junkyard rims and tires and only put the lugs on finger tight.  Of course that is partially my fault because I did not check them before I loaded the vehicles but whatever.  First one happened at MPH.  I felt a jerk behind me and I checked my mirror.  Saw the jeep I was towing leaning to the driver side.  Thats when I noticed the wheel rolling past me.  I looked back and saw two semis moving over to block the three lanes of interstate to see how the tire was going to act.  It rolled to the median hit a culvert WENT AIRBORNE and landed back into the median drifted back onto the direction I was traveling crossed the road hit a guard rail went back across into the ditch and rolled on its side.  With all the close calls of collisions Ive had where other drivers nearly creamed me I have never been more afraid before or since.  Thank god for the two big trucks holding traffic back so it didnt hit a car or the fact that the tire DID NOT FLY INTO ONCOMING LANES.  Ive read news reports of people getting killed by tires like that.  What pissed me off about the whole ordeal was that the woner said that he replaced the wheels and put all the lugs back on with an impact.  I checked the other three wheels ALL WE FINGER TIGHT.  I moved some lugs around tightened all of them properly and went on my way.  Second one was similat but the wheel went down a small ravine on a narrow two lane road.  ,Hookit,cp3guur,9,t5_2w004

3704081,0,t1_cqeg5ky,Im right there with you on regressive taxes and income distribution is fcked in this country which is a much bigger issue. BUT owning a car and driving is not a right. If you cant afford registration and insurance you cant legally drive. Similarly if you dont have  in the bank for a tow in case your POS breaks down you shouldnt be banned from driving necessarily...

5372070,0,t1_cvxvlrp,I dont mind getting up in the wee hours to help somebody who needs the ride. Ive certainly been stranded a time or two. It bothers me greatly when people call after pm to have their car towed from a safe location to the dealership forty miles away when they have a second car and its a weekend! Who are these inconsiderate assholes who couldnt just wait until daylight for a tow when their car wont be seen until am Monday anyway?We are a small outfit in a tourist town. I think folks that come from bigger cities think that we are sitting in a break room all night getting paid hourly waiting on their call. That isnt close to the case Im busy drooling on my pillow. Fortunately our boss is liberal with the pricing based on inconvenience. We may say ok itll be  hook up and .  mile tonight but only   .  mile tomorrow morning. Ive had folks call up hollering about needing a tow at midnight when I get there an hour later its  safely parked at a shop they are there in another vehicle and they complain about how late it is and how tired they are.

8383014,0,t1_d5n6law,Please do some basic research before posting not everyone requires a fullsize truck to do the occasional move.  Ford wouldnt risk the legal liability by rating the Escape to tow that much if their teams of lawyers didnt think it could.While not a bodyonframe SUV the Escape is a pretty capable hauler.  The older Crown Vics may have been able to legally tow K but the  and up models were rated to K max due to a rear suspension change.  You may be able to tow it but we are talking about legally here.  The Escape makes a fine medium duty tow vehicle but it has two penalties namely that it is lighter weight and has a short wheelbase.  Ive had a x single axle box trailer loaded fairly heavy still under  on my old  multiple times without issue.  In fact it pulled and stopped better than my old Ranger which was rated to tow K because of the upgraded engine power and brakes.  The OPs problem is probably one of two things.. Not enough tongue weight  This is the easiest to check for.. Equipment problem  UHaul trailers dont lead easy lives.  Something may be out of whack on the trailer due to mishandling from a prior renter.  I know for a fact that a trailer we rented had someone rearend it and then speed off was in the tow vehicle when it happened.Edit Words...,Hookit,d5pfb8l,1,t5_2w004

Im not doing a WWE suplex where I jump up and slam myself on the ground. I carry a smith and Wesson Shield ... you should look into it. Why dont you pocket carry a ruger lcp which is  or a ruger lc which is mm?Its going to snow like a bitch up here in upstate New York so Ill have a coat on so my option will be pocket carry or a chest rigshoulder harness. Glock  is a huge gun you should consider maybe a glock  which is the smallest double stack  they make or go with the new glock  which is a single stack . I also have a glock  and it is half an inch shorter on the barrel and grip but you can get all fingers on it. Its still a big gun but very easy to conceal. Carrying in the truck means that you carry offbody. There are a shit ton of news stories where that is deadly. Always carry on your person. We need to look out for each other since no one else will.
