148362,0,t1_ceuyngz,This is not the only way to do it. It would have hurt nothing to include multiple game modes and let people select the challenge level that they want.I may not have Thousands of hours in the game but I do have hundreds into both BL and BL and I feel NO desire for some sort of superduper challenging mode like UVHM is supposed to be.Let me make a comparison from another game I play if I might. Super Robot Wars though a completely different genre encourages multiple playthroughs as well. Its called NewGame instead of TVHM or UVHM but the concept is similar incentivizing players to replay the game after completing it. But Instead of jacking the difficulty up things get easier the second and subsequent time through. on a NG you get all the money you spend in your last playthrough as the starting balance in your bank. Your characters get all the XP they earned the last time through. Oftenplayers will use NG as a chance to try and reach the optional more difficult level objectives for an additional challenge but if you just want to romp through smashing enemy robots gleefully you can totally do that.I would imagine that only a small percentage of players replay through SRW games more than once or twice but the option is there its rewarding and its not You must craft your build in this optimal fashion use one of these three pieces of gear and be prepared to die a lot to even random mooks difficult.Theres more than one way to do it and I wish wed been given the option.,Borderlands,cevbv4h,1,t5_2r8cd

312869,0,t3_1xnyaf,Still works! Your post inspired me to go back and see if I could still do it and I can. As Mordi make sure you have a Skullmasher Defiler Hellfire and Orion as well as a purple sniper and survivor class mods and some transfusions. Youll only be using one gun for each type of enemy and the masher is whats going to take down Craw. Run to the corner and duck with your face in the corner untill you hear craw start to loop. Equip sniper mod take out any minions you can see then look up at Craw careful not to actually move from that spot and take aim at each of his weak points until all thats left is the back one. Now the tricky part. You have to move to get him to move and expose his back so just jump up or run to the right very quickly then right back down with your face in the corner. Chances are hes going to spit at you so throw some transfusions in advance of this and have the survivor mod equipped for the health. You may have to do this a few times and youre probably going to die a few times too but eventually hell get stuck facing away from you and you can re equip sniper mod and take out the last weak point.

Im sure if you spec into sniping there are a few snipers that are good but for all round purposes sniping becomes a little hard. You need to get crits on every shot and it makes health gating harder than a pistol or melee build.

It is a nice introduction to the mechanics of the Borderlands games Borderlands  is a bit more complex and you dont need to constantly farm bosses for good guns because the way that guns spawn is completely random. You are also able to keep a gun for around  levels without before its usefulness drops. And I think it is a better game than Borderlands .,Borderlands,cg2680v,1,t5_2r8cd

Couple that with the bonus crit damage from the sniping tree and youre kinda good to go.

So i have to throw a couple in to get the  effect.Legendary Hunter is good but if youre in UVHM Id ditch it until you find a  version. What are the bonuses on it? statwise I mean. Iron Hand still isnt worth the points though. At least KB lets you melee things and finish them off without ammo usage the small mobs.Shot COM has HUGE accuracy boosts I think you may enjoy it.Well Turtle shields and Zer have a great affinity. Id try it! Shoot until your shield goes down use Deception throw a slag transfusion then try to proc Grim quickly and your shields and health are back to full quick.Depends on your definition of decent. Id be looking for a short delay much more than a rarity value. Id also try to snag a shield that fits the situation.

1313419,0,t3_293bwa,I think theyre doing the same thing Halo did. They released Halo  ODST between Halo  and Halo Reach. ODST was on the Halo  engine and had short missions a basic story and no competitive multiplayer. Halo was and still is one of the most popular and influential games in existence and and ODST was designed to tide people over before the release of Reach a full feature game with an in depth story and its own engine.

1349510,0,t3_29j56c,Well I cant say anything about Sniper but I used to main Melee Zer back when I actually played BL. Hes disgustingly strong on typical PvE but he has a very hard time with large bosses BNKR Warrior All the final DLC bosses except Hammerlock. This can be avoided by actually uses guns but a Melee Zer using guns except in FFYL is like a homophobe  walking into a gay bar. Rubi  Thumper is pretty fucking incredible especially if you get a good grenade too. I cant really say much else as I stopped playing after the Tiny Tina DLC came out. All in all as much as it may not help just do whatever you want. The great thing about Borderlands is you can try all sorts of skill builds with next to no penalty as opposed to similar games like Diablo.

1760986,0,t1_ck13wut,gt The damseling of Lilith and Angel really sucks especially since Lilith demonstrates herself to be pretty damn powerful earlier in the game. Aside from that the women are handled pretty well.Yeah damseling is a stupid concept to be upset about in games. The player is a hero and a hero needs somethingsomeone to save. You cant just take saving people out of the equation becuase it might evoke a sense of helplessness. People are helpless in real life regardless of sex or creed. We also saved Roland Bloodwing the whole damn town of Santuary and the people of Overlook. Heroes need someone to save. If that someone is a woman it doesnt diminish her as a person. People need saving all the time. Angel was imprisoned for a long time and she is the one that orchestrated her own freedom. Lilith was captured in a moment of vulnerability by Jack who is a capable fighter. In neither instance are these women diminished simply because they needed rescuing. ,Borderlands,ck14nx6,11,t5_2r8cd

Since it acts as crowd control and a  OHKO I think itll be much more practical than pure damage. Well probably be able to run around and freeze the shit out of everything while throwing nades and Slamming instead of just switching weapons back and forth constantly. Therell be much less time that you have to worry about shit whens the slag gonna proc so I can swap my gun at the ideal time instead you can just keep spraying away without worrying and then nuke everything around you depending on how easy it is to proc or how long it lasts.,Borderlands,cksge0y,17,t5_2r8cd

Now that store says it is for Mac only but they are steam codes for steam play enabled stuff.If you have the MAS version on the other hand I kind of feel sorry for you since a only multiplayer with other MAS copies through game centre and b no more golden keys for you because I believe Shift fails certain MAS requirements. Basically its a bit gimped. To be honest the MAS is okay for single player games or games that are Mac only but as soon as something is crossplatform it falls apart.Edit to answer you original question and assuming this offer works out  the Psycho pack.

2107889,0,t1_cl7hgz7,Im pretty sure he was just being silly but you can use stuff like Gibbeds mod to give you access to your action power and add skill points.  The only rule is that Gibbeds is bound by the game principle of not being able to access a skill without enough points in the previous skill.  You need  points in a previous tier. You can either do it in a list of skills or you can just give yourself a bunch of skill points. The latter only works once youre level  and have the power to use skill points. Making a godtier character is fun for about ten minutes.  Its like getting a shitload of Legendaries from someone who joins and just dumps a backpack of dupes.  You destroy everything and no loot is worth stopping for.  So youve taken one aspect of the game away completely.  Its now a shooter instead of shooterlooter. ,Borderlands,cl7razk,11,t5_2r8cd

2123579,0,t3_2j9a8q,Im  hours into it now and really enjoying it. As some people have said its very similar to bl but its not as slow starting out. Youre instantly immersed in battles and you get your skill tree before you leave the first area which I think is a big plus. The anti gravity is really cool and the gravity slam makes fighting seem different since you now have to look out for bandit equivalents falling from the sky into you. The addition of laser weapons is a pretty cool concept that I havent toyed around with as much as Id like to but I think they will be very beneficial in the end. The biggest thing I have noticed is at least to me it seems that moonstones eridium equivalent is much easier to find Im level  and already have  backpack upgrades and  sniper ammo upgrades. And one helpful hint that may be obvious but I was glad to figure out if you play as Wilhelm and you run out of oxygen you can deploy your skill wolf amp saint and saint will regenerate your health at a rate that the oxygen deprivation will not affect you.

Between Heat Sinks and Energize youre extremely durable when Saint is out and because of Laser Guided and Rapid reinforcement you can have him out almost all the time.  If youre good about lasering enemies youll almost never lose him in the middle of a fight.As for Wolf I think a lot of people really underestimate how devastating he can be if you fully upgrade his tree.  I think the first two skills are necessary but venom bolts and rolling thunder are exchangeable depending on your class mod.  Currently I have  points in venom bolts and it is very strong but without any boosts I think rolling thunder is certainly better.I just threw the last three points into Laser Focus just because I use lasers way more than anything else and I have a class mod for it.,Borderlands,cldph6g,2,t5_2r8cd

2287884,0,t3_2ldeps,I thought TPS did a horrible job of portraying Jack and I think thats why theres so much debate. His character never really evolved....he would just do randomly good things and randomly bad things. He didnt have a particularly bad or good motive throughout the game he didnt really change his views during the game. His interactions with the PCs was basically You work for me so Im your boss sometimes Ill be cool but other times I wont be. There wasnt really a gradual shift from good to bad in this game.Killing the Meriff was so neutral that it made my head spin. He was gonna let the guy live but then decided against it. That doesnt make him good or bad just reactive to situations. Same with being betrayed by Moxxi and crew  he reacts to a situation with an appropriate level of anger. it doesnt make him good or bad in the Borderlands universe because thats what everyone does.  To go back and replay BL it just seems mindboggling that hed be THAT EVIL and that TPS was supposed to explain why it happened. Like Ive made the strategic decision to kill all these people because they might be bad guys to I ripped out a guys eyes with a spoon because Im a hero....no.

If you get on the roof of the area just before the bridge gets blown up the name escapes me the one with the airlock then youll find a jump pad which sends you off into wreckage. Jump on it and youll find another one you kind of have to aim where you are going with air boost and then go on that one to get to a really high up place.

2390725,0,t3_2mpbi2,I played all the borderlands with my so and we got creamed by the destroyer. It was kinda terrabad. Mostly was knocking us off the cliff. It was also a huge disappointment being the first vault and instead of awesomeness there was a big baddy.The story leading to the warrior was awesome and atleast this time you expect the vault to have a boss. And after our last vault boss we where worried. Then a few moments later that warrior was crushed. And then jack. So a little underwhelming in my opinion. The sentinel was neat i died on my first run do to failed second wind. I almost ran out of ammo on my second run with a friend. And my wife and i crushed the raid boss while buffed by glitched shields. I dont know honestly none of the vault bosses really excite me in a effort reward scenario. ,Borderlands,cm778p9,1,t5_2r8cd

2457466,0,t3_2nokta,Ive been loving the PreSequel so I dont know that I really share all your concerns. Still its pretty interesting to look at the charts for BL in a similar period. If Im understanding correctly BL had around k concurrent players on day one while TPS maxed out at around k a few days after release. BL had declined to about a fifth of its max total after a few months TPS is currently at less than a tenth of its peak total.This probably shouldnt be surprising though the spinoff nature of TPS was pretty clear in its marketing and it has a lot less content and therefore less stayingpower than BL. I think its basically guaranteed to get less DLC as well considering the smaller userbase. Still as long as we get one good campaign DLC Ill be pretty happy at  hours Id say Ive definitely gotten my moneys worth from TPS already.,Borderlands,cmfg0vx,17,t5_2r8cd
2460434,0,t3_2npkip,Just finished episode  less than five minutes ago and hopped on Reddit because I am itching to discuss it. I loved it. If you are interested in a more behindthescenes look at the Borderlands universe than the Vault Hunters get as almighty powerful characters this is perfect. If you like the environments and design of Borderlands this game is perfect. If you like the characters and enjoy referential humor and injokes from the series itself no not memes this is perfect.I found myself busting out laughing at several moments thought the first episode was funnier than the PreSequel actually and I really enjoyed the way they weave the protagonists stories together. I bought the season pass outright and I feel like  is nothing to pay for Telltales work. In case you couldnt tell Ive fallen hard for this game. One thing to note though is that this is mostly point and clickdialoguequicktime event based. Theres not a LOT of action or shooting.

2469382,0,t3_2ntozs,I must say I got bored with the moon fairly quick while I think the Helios station levels enemies and side missions are great fun. The second half of the game from the moment you get to Helios really redeems the game.Not that the first part is just all bad but I get what you are saying.In general the game just lacks content and depth. It doesnt really help that to me personally the only feasible builds for ALL characters means skipping the middle tree and maxing the other ones with the skills I like best.The mission structure is rather poor too TPS really makes you go somewhere only to head back. Kind of like a continued sawtooth caldron side mission that part also always really annoyed me. Made me rush through that area just because I wanted to get on with the story.Feels a lot like BL tbh but I do think you owe it to yourself to at least finish the main story once.

2568371,0,t1_cmt8204,There are only two acceptable routes for them to take with BL for me Dont go ambitious. Theres no need to. To me when a game tries too hard to get away from what it is and go bigger it runs a serious risk of derailing itself. I know a shitload of folks who loved the first two Diablo games and the first Starcraft game and just couldnt get into Diablo III or Starcraft II and Im one of them. Its not that it should never be doneWarcraft III and Fallout New Vegas were greatbut dont just do it to do it. Do it because it demands to be done.OR Make it more of a true RPG in the storytelling sense. Im fine with it being a quasiRPG hackandslash game because thats a lot of fun. True RPGs in the DampD mold can honestly get very boring for me. They become so much of a chore. But in terms of storytelling I dont feel like an RPG has done its job unless there are consequences to actions. Having a strong and linear story can be a strength and I think it has been a strength of the BL series. But if they really want to be ambitious its time for dialogue trees its time for TRULY failable quests its time for quests with TRULY different ways of fulfilling them its time for there to be an option to play pacifist its time to be able to side with various factions etc. etc.,Borderlands,cmttoio,1,t5_2r8cd

His sniping build is not FULLY complete but you are definitely very close if you want to go that route as well. Heres Zers melee build. The last point goes into Cunter Strike once you level up then youre done. Heres a pretty stock sniping build. Maxing out Tw Fang and Velcity is your next step then you can do whatever you like. Some people like to spec into Execute others like to put more points into the Sniping tree. Melee Zer doesnt require too much equipment. I took my Zer through UVHM with a level  Rapier level  Rubi and a level  blue Shadow Ninja COM. All of the other equipment I just found. Once you can acquire a Vladof sniper rifle and can stack Critical Ascension any gun will be able to wreck mobs. Just be on the lookout for Vladof and Maliwan sniper rifles and youre good to go.As for other recommendations what does your current gear look like? Are you slagging enemies?

It doesnt take very long at all to get to that level in any of the current Borderlands games and it could be overwhelming to new players. If they DID add multiple Action Skills which I think is a bad idea I could maybe see them as being either rewards for significant story progress something you get at the start of a new playthrough or a piece of equipment type thing maybe your Action Skill is dependent on the Skill Tree you go down or the Class Mod youre using?Meh.,Borderlands,cncesuh,13,t5_2r8cd

3464011,0,t3_2zx5e1,From what I remember the best way to farm it is to beat Knoxx then glitch through the floor look up a video for the precise spot but its not a hard glitch to do at all and clear the lower room. There is one section of boxes that does not scale past level  so you can just ignore them and there is one room with a few boxes that you CANNOT go into because it triggers the quest. After you clear all the safe boxes simply save and exit. This restarts you at the entrance to the Knoxx DLC with all enemies including Knoxx himself respawned and the quest left unfinished. You can then race past all the enemies bring Knoxx down with a defiler or whatever else you have that works well and go through the floor. Rinse and repeat. I got my times down to about  minutes from loading in at the start to saving and quitting using a lootspeed Siren setup to just ignore every enemy except Knoxx whom you have to kill to open up a door.The boxes scale with level so you do need to be at max level to get max level loot but if you just kill everything between you and Knoxx each time you clear it you will level up pretty fast. It slows down your times though.,Borderlands,cpn4eib,6,t5_2r8cd

3561553,0,t1_cpy8dp6,Tediore reloads like most Torgue weapons benefit from grenade damage which Axton has in spades. They also benefit from magazine size and reload speed which Axton also has in spades. This makes Tediore Axton or Chuck Axton or simply Chuxton a very popular speedkilling tactic among commandos. While Krieg can do more damage with Tediore the requirements for him to maximize his potential are very situational so Axton is generally considered the best Tediore user due to his consistency.example video I know ujiandersonzer doesnt like this guy but idgaf,Borderlands,cpy8r21,1,t5_2r8cd

As far as I know on Xbone the textures do take about  to  seconds to completely load when you load up the game but look great once they do.  The framerate only starts dipping a bit when a lot is going on and even then only in certian areas.  Does it look as good as a built PC?  No.  Does it look good compared to last gen consoles?  Hell yes.  So if you played it on last gen Id definitely pick it up. ,Borderlands,cq3n1o6,1,t5_2r8cd

3617564,0,t3_31sf47,I just bought BLS for the Vita last week fully knowing that it will never be as good as the  version with that I have logged a stupid number of hours on. Id give it a  overall. At the moment I have a love hate relationship with the vita version. I love the ability to play and use it anytime and anywhere I want but it has a plethora of problems that come with it. The framerate isnt glaringly bad until you are running around Sanctuary and then it drops significantly due to how much activity is going on over there. Sometimes it feels like Im playing a game on my iphone when the framerate drops in battle. But when I fast travel to a dungeon or something like that before running into any enemies it runs as smooth as my . Ive also noticed that in combat like  of the time when I hit to aim down signs on an enemy my HUD will point off to the floor or towards the air not directly towards the enemy and that bothers me. Sometimes the sound will cut out on a specific scene I am watching or suddenly you wont hear your own footsteps for a while or load times are significantly longer than the other platforms etc.. These are minor things that dont affect the overall gameplay but when your game crashes and it will every now and then youll wanna throw your Vita against the wall for the shit you lost.     If you accept that this game will never be the same as if you are playing on the other platforms you will be okay. The development team made a goal that was way beyond their means with little time to develop and we got a game that is....lets say  of what it really should be with DLC and performance consistency that the other platforms have. It is commendable that something like this could be done though. It was a big step towards portable platform gaming that many companies will learn from.If youre worried about the shift from p to the vita try watching a Youtube video in p and then switching to  or something pixels and if youre not irked by it then you will be fine.One last thing though....Since The Handsome Collection came out they suspended Shift accessibility for the Vita for the time being. That means no golden keys no Loottheworld and other stuff that revolves around your shift account. They say that they are doing some routine maintenance on it but its been about two weeks and the semi official word is that the update is still in the testing phase. My guess is that gearbox is more focused on fixing immediate issues with THC owners at the moment and not the Vita. To leave players in the dark for two weeks is a little disheartening and Im not optimistic about any further support for this platform.        ,Borderlands,cq4mmne,1,t5_2r8cd

Test your Internet connection too under SettingsgtNetwork and make sure it connects to PSN.

4045684,0,t3_36vexu,The Nukem has a relatively large blast radius for a launcher and it fires its missile in a little lobbed arc so it can be a dangerous weapon to use.  Its damage per rocket is gargantuan but its fire rate is usually pretty sluggish and its reload speed is long so it is best used as a weapon to pull out when youve been backed into a corner or into Fight for your Life rather than relying on it for a DPS spike like Vladof launchers can be used.The Black Queen is kind of a rare spawn definitely less than  chance and shes at the end of a zone which is pretty dense with enemies... but shes also in one of the best Chubby spawning areas in the game and you also get a crack at the Lyuda and the Veruc if youve also done the Good the Bad and the Mordecai by climbing the hill behind her.  As such while I dont know if the farm is worth doing just for the sake of Nukem I think its a good farm to do in the general case.  The fact that the Nukem is part of that farm is cool so its worth going to look for it but I would definitely wait until the Good the Bad and the Mordecai is finished to start it in earnest.Thumbs up great to have if it drops and totally worth running the canyon that qualifies as its farm.,Borderlands,crhfsgv,5,t5_2r8cd

So instead of there being  Maliwan barrels that are all basically the same just different level there would be like  each one would have a minimum level requirement of appearing on gear but otherwise have basically fixed stats.  Kinda like how weapon base types and prefixes and the like work in Diablo  or Path of Exile.  Among other things this means that each manufactorers weapons always look distinct. As to answering the actual question  Bandit guns actually would be able to get the parts from other manufactorers to spawn on them being the intentional Frankenstien guns.  They would also come with  magazines instead of just one both rolled seperatly.,Borderlands,crwb4ip,0,t5_2r8cd

4246090,0,t1_cs417ji,Well I dont want to tell you one way or another because of the negativity my parent comment got. BUT. IMO. It is more likely to get a flash sale over the PreSequal because of its overall smaller platformnot a full AAAw.e. Plus the PreSequal is still relatively new and various TellTale games seem to always be featured in a flash but idk if they were complete or not at the time as is the state of Tales from the Borderlands. Sorry I just really want the PreSequal to drop lol but in regards to all of steam it is hard to say if TftB will get a flash. Regardless of the chart that was posted I still believe Im in the right from what Ive seen at rsteam rgamedeals and personal experience the last  years. So I will personally be passing this daily in hopes of a flash sale or wait for it to appear as a daily again or encoreplayers choice. However its not a must have on my wishlist so saving my money to put towards The Witcher  or The PreSequal is greater than missing out on this daily if it is the lowest itll go OR the only time well see it.

4431756,0,t3_3brov4,re cheat protection Id actually rather they went in the opposite direction. I love BL but I cant be bothered to farm for hours and hours for specific weapons when I want to do fun endgame build stuff.If the cheat engine was builtin then gearbox could add all sorts of restrictions to it i.e. characters with cheats enabled cant earn achievements or join games with characters that dont so you can still have a pure experience.,Borderlands,cspb8at,10,t5_2r8cd
4432246,0,t3_3brov4,I think what I want most is fun and unique classes at least one melee viable class and replay value. Thats probably why BL is my favorite of the series.For me TPS took too long to get going and for a game like BL a boring beginning really kills it for me because thats whats going to keep me from trying all of the characters knowing that I have to slog through the crap part of the game. And with TPS the whole first half felt like the crappy introduction part. In BL I played every character besides Axton to level  and had a blast doing it especially Krieg Zer and Sal. In TPS I played Claptrap with a friend and when I went to try Athena and Doppleganger Jack to be my solo characters I got bored and gave up before level . Not trying to shit all over TPS Im sure others like it just trying to find tangible reasons why I wasnt in love with it like BL. Also can we get a third person mode? Really dont want to install cheat engine and get banned by accident on other games. ,Borderlands,cspdfzk,2,t5_2r8cd

Im just saying that you cant just call him evil and be done with it. He had reasons he thought he was doing good. He saw himself as a hero and to an extent he really was. He had good intentions. Sure he did some evil shit but the world isnt black and white. Pandora is pretty evil what with all the daily systematic murder and whatnot. Everyone loves killing on this planet. Maybe someone SHOULD wipe those people out. From what Gaige said it seems the rest of the world is pretty corrupt. Maybe people want to be free but their only choice is the Borderlands like Pandora where they WILL be horribly murdered. As for the taking credit thing anything he did after Lilith fucked everything up is after a major psychotic episode and after his brain was permanently altered by an alien explosion and branding.

5275493,0,t1_cvlz0x1,Dont get me wrong I spam the fuck outta my action skills but I hate when Im in a position where I need it but its cooling down. The Doppelganger and Nisha are especially notorious for that. Showdown with a Lawbringer and Jacks Leadership skills are pretty much the only way to stay alive in  situations like fighting the Invincible Sentinel RK EOS and in the Mutator arena. This is why my Maya tries to kill the locked enemy asap to get my action skill back sooner. Wreck and Reaper helps and so does sniping with a Pimpernel The Bee and a Chaotic Evil Cleric. The distance keeps you safe and gives you the benefit of surprise.For crowd control Scorn Converge and Chain Reaction and said Pimp combo wipes through most of everything. Life Tap procs and you can tank for a short while. Shes one of my favourite mobbing characters but she just lacks that one exploitable skill for raiding outside of Immolate which is meh. Thoughtlock just doesnt fit that playstyle for me. Ive tried to make it work but who knows I couldve given up too soon.,Borderlands,cvm05ry,1,t5_2r8cd
5276052,0,t1_cvm2jlm,DD.E is too RNG to be relied on for healing imo and this is coming from a Grit fan and being a piece of gear its also buildspecific. Its like saying Nisha is a tank because of Celestial Lawbringer. edit Survivorturtle Zer is a better examplegtAnd on the offchance you go down TP makes it incredibly easy to find a second windFunny thing I went down against the Bosun the other day and TP didnt help me find any second winds in time.gtif youre playing smart you wont have to rely on the UBA mugger either.If you play smart you dont even need to put points into defense.gteven with the lowest dps its still really easy to kill every boss with WilhelmLevel  mutator arena. EOS too but Hard to Kill helps with that.I do think Wilhelm is the tankiest character overall yes even moreso than Jack and Athena but a lot of that tanking ability comes from Saint and he doesnt have much otherwise.,Borderlands,cvm2qek,1,t5_2r8cd
5284547,0,t1_cvn25bv,Yeah for anyone who had never played  Diablo  or quit before paragon was introducedOnce you get to max level you begin to earn experience towards paragon levels. Each paragon level gives you a point to spend that adds small bonuses. Things like gold find movement speed vitality etc.  Just like badass rank these bonuses apply to all characters or actually the level applies you can reassign points for each character.  The Diablo developers mentioned that they were influenced by the badass rank system in borderlands  but paragon does not hit diminishing returns like badass rank does for some things there is a cap on the number of points you can put into it but each point is just as effective numerically as the last.  Also since these are not tied to arbitrary challenges you dont have to use a specific weapon or worry about resetting challenges when you complete the majority of them. It also means you dont even start getting them until you are at max level discouraging farming badass rank by making new characters and just doing the shoot boulders out of the air challenge or similar mindless things.,Borderlands,cvn5utw,7,t5_2r8cd

The point of my post was to remind everyone that theres no such thing as one size fits all and its fine if you dislike aspects of a DLC but to claim that its faulty for those aspects? I wouldnt exactly call that being objective. Theres no way to make perfect content its not possible to please everyone at once because everyone has their own Pet Peeves the best any dev can do is make something that everyone is okay with but then theyre just left with okay content. Okay content doesnt do much to sell. If people can go either way on buying something theyll tend to not buy it. They need hype niche and brand loyalty. They rely on people buying it because they love Borderlands and want more they rely on people buying it because the marketing did their job right the rely on people buying it because it provides something that appeals to them. So not everything they release will be aimed at the same market. They change things up to expand their demographic.,Borderlands,cxll07p,1,t5_2r8cd

6222794,0,t3_40t93j,I just finished the main story in BL yesterday for the first time as Lilith no less so I think Im qualified to answer.To start I went down the Elemental tree to get Phoenix ASAP but I think this is a mistake in the long run. I didnt have the raw power to mow everything down and was neglecting her defensive skills that let her become effectively immortal.So I respecced. Put my points in the Assassin tree taking Silent Resolve Hit and Run and Blackout. Damage reduction out of Phasewalk extra Phasewalk duration and  seconds to cooldown for every kill. Kills made during Phasewalk such as through DOT or the initial Phase Blast count for this. Suddenly I could move around more freely with the extra duration was a bit safer coming out of Phasewalk and if I needed to GTFO I just needed to kill a mook or two and I had a fresh one ready to go.I didnt bother with Phase Strike.Once I maxed out Blackout I focused on the Controller tree. Striking for daze on melee Inner Glow for health regen and I cant remember the name Hard to Get? but whatever skill shaves off some cooldown time. At this point my strategy was to Phasewalk into a group of enemies melee a toughlooking one for the daze effect plus bonus Phase Blast damage kill the weaker ones Phasewalk again rinse and repeat. Inner Glow kept my health up every time I did this while Hard to Get and Blackout meant I could spend nearly half my time in Phasewalk given sufficient enemies.I was level  by the time I got to the vault.Blackout and Inner Glow are the bigticket skills here IMO. Blackout is the key skill that lets you Phasewalk often while Inner Glow is simply reliable healing and survivability always a plus. Once I maxed those two skills out I never went into FFYL unless I overextended or did something else stupid.,Borderlands,cywyq35,6,t5_2r8cd

I was able to get on the roof of some sheds.  I could keep behind cover if I need to recover health and unreachable to melee attachs.In the Gully if you go to the right of the spawn point and stick to the edge of the map you can jump up on a ledge where again you can hide and be save from attacks.  And for the Angelic Ruins there is an area that has two stair cases opposite each other that have platforms with sandbags.

7357541,0,t3_4g3yoo,I usually go Mania tree first. It really helps out with getting more uses of your primary skill. Afterwards you should specialize in the Bloodlust tree. Typically you dont want to both specialize in fire incase you fight enemies that are strong against it. Maya though is a great choice to play with Krieg. Her teamoriented survival skills are perfect for keeping Krieg going even longer.Basically your hero ability is your number one damage source and source of healing. Everything Mania does is make it better shorter cooldown more damage and so on. Bloodlust complements it so well by adding length and survivability. The righthand tree isnt bad but I feel like theres just not enough skill points to go around. You have to play very aggressively with Krieg. The end skill for Mania is just bonkers. If youre sniping youre doing it wrong.Generally Krieg is better solo except when playing with Maya.This is generally what I want by level . By level  I want to make my krieg like this,Borderlands,d2ei34p,2,t5_2r8cd

7987513,0,t1_d4dl6n4,The bit about Moxie guns not doing great damage isnt true for all of them Ill give you the Grog Rubi and the SMGs which suffer from being maliwan SMGspistols weapons that have issues scaling anyway the Hail is one of the most powerful ARs in the game the kitten requires a little messing with skills but it can be quite powerful as well the heartbreaker is basically a really stacked firelocked Thinking the Slowhand is a bit odd but its one of the best utility weapons in the game and with the right build it does really solid damageThe bit about moxie being nessisary is totally wrong even sal can make due with brawn and transfusions through most of UVHM the point I was making was that players should avoid moxie especially in their first forays into UVHM because it forces them to learn the attack patterns and the audiovisual cues that enemies have because that knowledge is really what allows them to push into endgame content with less frustration.To address what utmbl was saying I think a different set of rules applies to Moxie weapons from other unique weapons because unlike the other weapons Moxie weapons provide a ton of survivability in addition to solid damage. Like I mentioned in the last paragraph the important part of especially the early parts of UVHM is that the player learns how to really deal with enemies and using moxie to trivialize enemy damage is really not conducive to that but I think using powerful damaging weapons is not for the most part because in general you can only kill one enemy at a time and the skills you need to be learning are more related to avoiding damage from several enemies at a time.,Borderlands,d4dvfbj,3,t5_2r8cd

I never said you couldnt use guns just that you shouldnt go out of your way to buff them even though Bloodbath will buff the hell outta gun damage. You dont have the points for it and shooting is not the point of a melee build. If you want a gun build I could help you with that. Until you get Bloodsplosion you need to streamline your build. You need to read the description for Release the Beast. If youre using Buzz Axe Rampage when your health is at  or lower aka when the red blinking triangle comes on youll turn into a Badsss Psycho and get a bunch of bonuses. When BAR ends youll have your cool down back. So why would you need to use Fuel the Rampage if youre using Release the Beast Ask any other veteran in this sub if theyd take Fuel the Rampage. Also avoid Blood Trance. Jumping in and out of RtB to constantly health gate is safer.If youre constantly rampaging youll be on health and Salt the Wound will proc and with a decent build you can tank enough to max your Salt Salt stacks. Idk why you still skipped Bloodbath. Its easily one of his best powers. ,Borderlands,d70l1wg,6,t5_2r8cd

This needs to be at the top instead of buried at .gtThe LootColor tool will automatically detect which game is running and switch to the loot color screen for that specific game.  Once the game is detected the LootColor tool will start scanning memory trying to find the loot color table.  It will display Scanning... when it is looking for the loot color table and will display Loot Table Found when it has found the loot color table in memory.  You can manually select the loot color configuration screen for a specific game by selecting the Game item from the menu and choosing which game you want to configure.  Each game has their own custom color settings so you have to set each one up separately.  You can have common colors that you use in all games by setting a Custom Color in the color picker dialog and then using that custom color for the color of an item in each game for example you could pick a shade of light green assign that to one of the Custom Colors in the color picker dialog then use that custom color for the Money color in all games.

9324268,0,t1_d8xwetr,Its not like its impossible to make unique action skills is the thing  Athenas shield is super original just mentioning how it can absorb damage and then send it back. Thats tangible gameplay and unique design. Fragtraps is probably my favorite just because its crazy and its randomness is naturally engaging especially with the newly introduced random skills and something as simple as giving Salvador two guns to fire for his action skill is much more interesting because you have to consider your guns your ammo and what youre trying to accomplish. Obviously theres a much higher barrier for unique and balanced skills because FPS is a very hard shell to crack in terms of skillbased versus reactionbased gameplay especially since BL is so reliant on minmaxxing weapon loadouts and skill tree points but Gearbox has shown they know how to do it. Its just about not overcomplicating things and making simple yet impactful changes based on the character to conventional gameplay. Off the top of my head elementals is something that hasnt very well been experimented with except for skill tree augmentations. Perhaps a skill where enemies hit while the skill is active will be afflicted with a random element or damage having a unique interaction with a certain element. Just something that requires input other than press a button. you know have free damage and aggro switching.,Borderlands,d8xx4a7,1,t5_2r8cd

Its foolish to not take advantage of his amazing melee builds and whack enemies to death but the real question is how you like to build up your own overall strength when you arent filling out the Mania tree. His other trees are a decision of whether you prefer constantly dealing damage to do even more damage Bloodlust or constantly taking damage and laughing it off Burn Baby Burn  Fuel the Fire. ,Borderlands,dasxhj1,5,t5_2r8cd

Imagine a dishonoredstyle blink thing where you go underground for a second and pop up somewhere else. different skill trees could have different effects on the tunnel say when you pop up youll have a nova shield style explosion of a certain element just like fire threshers do. Possibly when you pop up you can leave a thresher that could act like a turret. Another possibility is using the ability on a person could cause a thresher tentacle to hold onto them or possibly pull them underground for some form of phaselocklike ability.

10746586,0,t3_5tqeg8,Explosives dont behave like normal elements theyre about as effective as normal bullets and arent weakened significantly by anything. In BL explosives do  damage to flesh  damage to armor and  damage to shields as opposed to  for regular bullets.So whether or not you should use explosive generally depends on the weapon at hand. Generally its simply a matter of getting used to leading targets so that the slower projectiles land. The splash damage is also useful against large numbers of enemies bunched together and enemies like Loaders where you can hit multiple crit spots at once.,Borderlands,ddoffup,3,t5_2r8cd

TVHM as a whole is a pointless grind to get skill points before you can actually play the character properly.Try something along these lines for the build aiming to get the capstone as soon as possible. Max out Innervate first before putting points in rising shot when you reach .

That would make a natural limit if there were six dimensions.Sirens probably get their tats atnear birth. Maya was sold to the Brotherhood as an infant presumably because she was a siren but not necessarily.Lilith had her tats as a youth when she played Bunkers and Badasses. She must not have been recognized as a siren otherwise she would have been enslaved like Angel Maya and Steele.Angel probably had her tats at birth considering Jack took pains to keep her secret. No tattoos evident on her desktop portrait at age . Her power manifested at a young age possibly right after the photo. This also lead to Jack developing the chair and later the collar to control her power.From character backstory and ingame evidence it is not obvious when tattoos appear nor is it clear if the powers show up at the same time or possibly later.

Preface The damage stat isnt everything. Be sure to check out other stats like fire rate accuracy or reload speed. Jakobs Pure and Raw semiauto damage. Often comes with critical hit damage boosts.Bandit High Mag size. Not really known for their damage but can really churn out bullets. I generally only use their shotguns.Maliwan pure elemental. Lacks raw damage but makes up for it with Damage over Time.Torgue Pure explosive. If you believe that its really not a kill unless you have to shower off the guts and blood of your enemies then this one is for you. Usually lowish fire rate but axton gaige and kreig can make these weapons shine.Dahl Their quirk is burst shots? Basically aim and fire bursts. Good for lining up multiple headshots.Vladof High rate of fire good for pure Dps. Hyperion weird reverse accuracy thing. Becomes more accurate as you shoot. I like their smgs and shotguns for lining up headshots.Teidore Fast reloads also you throw the weapon like a grenade when you reload. If your clip is empty then the damage is low but if you leave a lot of bullets in there when you reload then it does respectable damage. Base damage is usually lacking though. I think I touched on all but I probably forgot one and will feel really stupid after someone corrects me.  ,Borderlands,deukwvy,4,t5_2r8cd

11146465,0,t1_dev3vzz,Thats my problem though people saying its too late and to move on. The fact that numbers have been increasing more so console population shows people are willling to through away  to try a game and realize Oh this isnt half bad. It just needs time.Every day I see new accounts playing the game and the clubs keep growing gradually.Wanted to add Ive no ill will to people who like OW. I personally get bored by it after a couple games but its extremely smooth and well made obviously. The problem was not only a mix of people wanting to compare everything a lot of hype for the game and a mix of Pitchford calling out Overwatch. It was probably a joke in his mind but people online are easily offset.,Borderlands,devfujv,3,t5_2r8cd

I had to actually slag  things...waste of time.  EDIT Im near the end of normal mode on my sniper Zer that Ive been playing recently hopefully i wont have to slag things in UVHM.                                                                        slag ,Borderlands,df9t80f,1,t5_2r8cd
11282532,0,t3_610mi1,the general Knox DLC has an amazing chest room that you can farm  as well as an insanely hard boss called crawmerax. both methods are awesome for getting some of the best gear in the game.other than that the only thing i can think to farm is AJax on the general knox dlc as he has a very rare chance of dropping the OGRE machine gun which is very powerful.BL is good in another sense because random enemies have the chance of dropping amazing weapons so dont be disheartened that you cant just go to one boss over and over for the good gear.,Borderlands,dfauwqi,2,t5_2r8cd

11404316,0,t3_62qnuz,First Playthrough Go into the ScarlettTorgue DLCs between    but Id recommend at around level  you start one or the other. Past level  itll scale until . For the Tiny TinaHammerlock DLCs try to do it at the end of the storyline but itll scale until . The Main story will not scale to your level so you might be overleveled if you havent completed the story.Second Playthrough ScarlettTorgue DLCs start at  but I believe it scales infinitely past that. Then the Tiny TinaHammerlock DLCs do them after the main storyline.Third Playthrough Do any of them in any order since all the quests will scale to your level. However lootwise do all the DLC after the Main Storyline.,Borderlands,dfonxyc,1,t5_2r8cd

11414247,0,t3_62s3e8,I realized I commented on the wrong video.I knew the axe registers as a Bandit pistol but I didnt know tossed axes were considered bullets. TILFuel needs to go. Id swap it with Blood Trance and make Fuel a stack based kill skill. Movement speed definitely sounds like a good idea and fits the theme. Id like if Krieg did a nova when he activates Light the Fuse. Also I vaguely remember Bahroo doing a video on Type C crits with Pain is Power and that ARs were doing less damage when critting than body shots.

11665525,0,t3_66d7cu,It seems accurate to me. I strongly prefer  over  but I still like  enough to play it every now and then years after release. I much prefer the loot system from . Being able to find legendary weapons at any level after about  was great. I feel in  that youre only ever gonna have a level  hellfire or level  UH etc. The random world legendary loot drops were awful and BL was always a looting game to me not a farming one. I realise my loot issues dont really apply to people who only play end game borderlands  but Im talking about the game from a normal point of view not end game meta. Also when I die in  it feels like its always down to bs. Its like Ive never had a legit death. Just the game decides I have to die puts me into ffyl enemies suddenly vanish and thats the end of that. For comparison though  Demons Souls and Dark Souls I love equally. I despise  and . Silent Hill  and  I love equally.  and  were not great...Fallout  was fantastic.  was trash.
