Its an automatic process.There are some global flags. We usually add some when we feel theres a need of it. E.g. theres a pulseaudio support flag. But for packagespecific flags we dont add global flags instead one may choose to use a specific package built with specific flags.I think in any distribution you can build a package locally thats a must for any libre OS You have everything at hand with nix just make sure you are aware of the fact its a mind shift. Most of the time you wont find X feature of another package manager in nix and you wont find Y feature of nix in another package manager.That said theres no fully standard way to write nix packages. Some packages may lack customization for this reason some may not.,NixOS,cllhbsx,2,t5_2ssc0
