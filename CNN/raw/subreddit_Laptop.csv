4933412,0,t1_cugb4sd,What specs for the ts would you recommend? Is an SSD necessary or is an HDD fine? How much ram is good enough for my program? I know the i processor should be fine.,Laptop,cuge9ex,1,t5_2qikn
5098236,0,t1_cuxteoe,Forget about the shock protection. Just dont drop your computer.The biggest deal with an SSD is that it will speed up virtually everything you do. Your computer will boot in lt seconds instead of  minutes. Programs will open almost instantly. Files on your drive will open almost instantly. You will notice the difference.That said a gb SSD is still a bit overpriced at this point. Something in the gb range is going to give you the best bang for your buck especially on such a low end computer that frankly isnt worth upgrading. Personally I would get a smaller ssd and if you really need more storage grab an external drive to store large files on.There are also hybrid drives that will let you get much larger amounts of storage. They combine a traditional hard disk drive with a small gb or so of flash. The OS is installed on the SSD and youd put your applications and files on the HDD. This will still have a huge performance increase over a standard hdd and is cheaper than just buying a large ssd.,Laptop,cv0j082,1,t5_2qikn

6327738,0,t3_42adr7,gt I was under the impression that my laptop would work as long as it was plugged in even without battery power. That depends on the laptops design. If you check the user manual on laptops it will say whether or not you can run it without a battery. However there really isnt a reason not to run a laptop without a battery. Your laptop should run without a battery.For your case though I would remove the battery completely plug in the ACDC power brick and see if the laptop runs. If it does then replace your battery. If it doesnt you may have bigger issues. The cheapest fix right now would be to get a new battery but its hard to say if your laptop wont turn on because of the bad battery or if something was damaged. Dying batteries place more load on charging circuits of the power brick and Ive seen cases where the laptop battery pulls more power than safe and fries the charging adapter completely. If this is the case then your laptop wont turn on because your battery is pooped along with the power brick.,Laptop,cz8w7qq,2,t5_2qikn

7239281,0,t1_d20p9nm,Thank you so much! I have two questions if you have a moment if not I totally understand. Do you have any experience with Thinkpads? If so do you think they are good laptops overall andor if not are there better options?The SSD upgrades are as followsGB Solid State Drive SATAGB Solid State Drive SATA GB Solid State Drive Serial ATA OPAL.  CapableGB Solid State Drive SATAI assume as they scale in price as they go down and as the GB increases they are better. My question is how much does one need in a SSD? I dont mind paying the top price if Im not getting ripped off. Again Thanks so much,Laptop,d211xq5,1,t5_2qikn

9641399,0,t1_da1ds3o,No. Youre better off getting a  TB SSD instead of the m version. The speed difference is minimal and really not noticeable for the price difference. If they were the same price yes Id go for the m but for the price difference its not worth it. For my gaming PC I decided to go for a larger SSD instead of getting a smaller m.You also have to remember that an SSD is only supposed to be at most  full or the speed which is why you want an SSD in the first place drops dramatically. So say you buy a  GB SSD once its formatted its only about  GB.  of  is only  GB. Windows uses about  GB so that brings it down to  GB. Games like GTA  take up  GB or more. So buying a  GB SSD you really dont have much space if you have more than a few games. This is why I ended up buying a  GB Samsung  EVO SSD first and having to add a  TB Samsung  EVO SSD after because I ran out of space quick. For my gaming laptop I added a Mushkin Enhanced Reactor  TB SSD as its fairly close to the Samsung  EVO in speed and performance but about  cheaper. I only paid about  for the  TB Mushkin Enhanced Reactor from Neweggs eBay store I just checked and the price went up to  for the same SSD Mushkin Enhanced Reactor . TB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive SSD It was brand new not used or refurb. I also have a HDD on my gaming desktop for music TVmovies pictures and all the other programs like Microsoft Office and everything else but I like to keep my OS antivirus and games on the SSDs.,Laptop,da1i1nf,2,t5_2qikn

11206699,0,t1_df20wfh,This review here says that while the laptop outputs a significant stream of hot air it doesnt get too warm on the lap. Additionally the reviewer mentions that the fans werent particularly annoying.This wont be a problem for you unless you find the sound of the fans to be annoying. Additionally cpus  gpus often jump up to  degrees Celsius when under load. This is completely normal and quite safe. It will not melt your computer.These temps are for the gpu. The CPU should not jump above  degrees for extended periods of time.,Laptop,df29lhq,1,t5_2qikn
11406498,0,t1_dfowayz,Ah sorry yea thats the one. Ive had it about  months and havent had any problems. I paid extra and got the  one with better specs. Id say for its price its a  battery is shit but whatd you expect on a gaming laptop haha ,Laptop,dfowuv2,1,t5_2qikn
