10277843,0,t1_dc9151y,Its not a conscious thing. I personally would go to a website and subscribe to get a coupon or something when I was shopping there on purpose. Then the coupon would show up but I would keep getting notifications of sales on this and buy that before its gone etc. You just keep seeing all of the notifications and mindlessly browsing. It just kinda creeps up on you. I think its harderless the norm to actually pause and think about what youre doing than it is to get sucked in. ,minimalist,dc91sgj,3,t5_2r63g
10283420,0,t3_5m9pup,Increase the freedom in your life by being yourself.  Being a freelancer isnt all roses those dudes in the documentary probably work more than they admit and the nomadic lifestyle writing and talking isnt for everyone. nor is it easyI find myself just seeking to keepmake work rewarding.. I work in high tech and im married to my cell phone at times but ive focused on NOT getting alerts NOT having problems NOT focusing on bad days..  At work we have a nice bistro and porch i go out and work out There if im working on a project with others i go sit at their desks. I make work be about enjoying work and getting things done  but not as a routine that limits my freedom but as a way to better express myself. I show that i can get work done at home at the office at the library at the coffee shop at the book store. I make it the freedom I need. weeks of paid vacation a year is a lot.. especially since you probably get another  as holidays. Make every weekend a vacation make every evening a free evening so your goals arent to escape reality but enjoy it. ,minimalist,dc9okfc,2,t5_2r63g
10400292,0,t3_5owsc4,I have not been sold on The Minimalists. I like their website. I hate their podcast. I havent watched the documentary but Im not convinced it would add value to my life or my minimalist journey so it is not a priority to me to take the time to watch it.All that said there is another minimalist blog that I follow that has some posts specifically on a minimalist kitchen that may interest you.Im going to be honest I have avoided minimizing my kitchen. I really think it might be the hardest area of the house to tackle.Here is how I view minimalism though. Each persons journey is their own. So if your journey does not align with the minimalists opinion of a minimalist kitchen then that is totally fine!,minimalist,dcmxubl,8,t5_2r63g
10513042,0,t1_dczqq2f,preloved is mentioned two times on the entire site and preloved is IMO hardly a truly descriptive term it should at the very LEAST say the word used on the item description hell you can even use preloved as long as its on the actual item description. When clicking All Products you dont see the warning that the items are preloved. New clothes can be ecoconscious and minimalist if theyre produced using sustainable practices. Perhaps the site isnt working for me but the every other section says there are no products available at this time so either the sites not working for me or HandPickedU is in fact the only collection you sell at the moment..All in all it strikes me as deceptive whether thats purposeful or accidental wouldnt be fair of me to assume it needs to be a lot clearer what your customers are ordering because its very easy to buy a product and never see the words preloved. You can either click on a product straight from the home page you could click on All Products and shop from there. Hell you can even go to the damn FAQ and not find anything about it.So yes I did visit your site before giving my feedback.,minimalist,dczrk9d,3,t5_2r63g
10513527,0,t1_dczr6zy,Its a world people who are use to vintage and thrifting use frequently actually. But as you state internationally it makes no sense. Thank you so much for your feedback! Ill replace the word! ,minimalist,dcztjqi,1,t5_2r63g

11592106,0,t1_dg9yury,I appreciate the confidence. While I did go around posting about the podcast in three different subs which I understand is kind of spammy I did it simply for exposure to as many people I felt would appreciate it as possible. Again thanks for the confidence and checking my history before just taking it down.,minimalist,dg9z203,7,t5_2r63g
11592209,0,t3_6407kx,I think social media is one of the aspects we often overlook when decluttering even though it can be detrimental to our time our ability to focus. I try to follow a  rule. Consume  of the time create  of the time. Social media is great as a tool but it can be the Achilles heel for productivity.,minimalist,dg9zh50,1,t5_2r63g
11744026,0,t3_67kkmb,Do it!!!I held it against him at the time but my ex really opened my eyes to using space in our house how WE SEE FIT and the BEST WAY FOR US!We rarely had guests we had some unique hobbies and an interesting layout as well.  We didnt keep our living room set up as one but made it a multifunction podcastyoga room.  I also had a tumbling room I used to practise martial arts with padding and mats everywhere.Youre on the right track its your space so use it how it works best for YOU!!and him,minimalist,dgr7r8b,4,t5_2r63g
