In The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe it was Edmund who was a complete dick for almost the entire book and now in Prince Caspian it s Susan who s asking for a good bitchslapping.

Because of this the lion Aslan tells Jill the task that he has for both of them but that her part would now be harder because she made Scrubb fall off the cliff. She needed to remember The Four Signs they would need to find Prince Rilian..   ,mcamateurs,cxbxjpw,1,t5_2wqno
