1657430,0,t3_2dbf63,I dont think the problem is so much a saturated market but youre closer in saying that people dont understand the value. Audio is undervalued and always has been because of its abstract nature. We are for the most part visual creatures vision takes up more processing than any of our other senses and is arguably the sense that we are most consciously aware of. We have many more words and therefore a larger framework of understanding for describing things visually than we do aurally.There are some key differences between vision and hearing also. Though both media represent information in d space vision has a limited range of about  degrees. Hearing on the other hand is omnidirectional. What that means is that audio is very good at giving a sense of place. I live in Orlando and so am surrounded by theme parks but the biggest thing you can do to transport someones imagination isnt show them a bunch of props and sets its play some good environmental audio. Another difference between vision and audio is that audio is much quicker to process. We are able to identify things much more quickly aurally than we can visually audio icons. Also because audio is much more tied to the subconscious you can influence peoples emotions much more easily than you can with visuals. Music is an obvious example of this but try watching a horror movie without the audio and tell me how scary it is.If I were going to try and sell myself as a composer sound designer or whatever I would start by addressing the personal needs of the client based on these differences. There are some pretty easy ways to show someone how audio is working by just turning it on and off in different situations. Now for selling yourself against bargain bin sounds that may be a little more sticky but you can easily make the argument that you can buy stock visuals with about the same end result. Like any good business though the key here is that you need to differentiate and have a good brand so people dont have to compare you to  cent sounds.,gameDevClassifieds,cjo2yub,1,t5_2sg66

It takes place in  level that the player get very familiar with over the game with added nuances and alterations. I chose for the game to be very story focused and self narrative driven  so that I could go easy on the complex coding Im sure comes with each added thing for the player to do.

2993704,0,t1_co80k3s,This actually shows a lot of ignorance of the process. The math behind balancing a card game the mechanics as you put it is considerable. There are many existing systems for card games you can copy but if they are too close to the original without crediting them you can get sued. But as a guy who hates math thats the least of my concerns. Starting with a base power number then adding modifiers then wild cards attacks defenses it all adds up and starts spiraling out of control very quickly. I had a client who had an idea for a card game and we made dozens of cards for it. I was serving as art director. When he play tested it for the first time he said it wasnt fun. He had no clue how to adjust the mechanics or the math that was needed behind it. He tried to get me to do it and eventually gave up on the project.

No. None of that happened. We made a game. It wasnt very popular. Thems the breaks.

7406435,0,t1_d2k21q5,Hey SeluxThanks for question. I have actually given this same advice to a handful of people via PM already. The best advice I can give you is to just do it and make Shia proud.When I say just do it Im referring to taking your lack of knowledge and turning it around. Start researching. Start downloading a free game engine and playing around with it. Unity is a GREAT place to start because the tools and support are solid and noob friendly.Unfortunately idea guys are a dime a dozen in the game industry and what sets you apart is being able to take that idea and turn it into a working prototype or a fullfledged game. It will be long it will be difficult but you will learn a lot along the way as well as jump start a career. People will take notice. This same advice was given to me and I took it to heart. I created a couple mobile games and the next thing I knew is I had job offers and the rest was history. You can do it too!,gameDevClassifieds,d2k2ae7,2,t5_2sg66

8936011,0,t3_52k913,The info youve provided is actually very vague and as the other comments have already stated  you dont really need a massive team to make a game. It all depends on the scope and considering how youre the writerdirector for the project  it is always going to increase seeing how you have no prior experience. I really dont mean any disrespect with that statement. If youre really serious about making this  you need to find yourself an experienced producerdesigner and sort what you actually want to do. Only then can you even know how many members you need. Sandbox and RPG are taken very seriously in the community  the last thing you want is a broken design. ,gameDevClassifieds,d7lz5w3,1,t5_2sg66
