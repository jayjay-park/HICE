11206394,0,t3_5zzb6n,Found this mysterious boatlike glyph sailing along the Hudson. My boathouse showed  active boats and I saw the first three boats along the river. This spinning thing followed the river and got regular bonuses same values as other boats.This was before this mornings patch.,BitCity,df28c08,3,t5_3ir6i

11246638,0,t1_df6cao0,The start of this mission started midway through Empire City seemed like a perfect time for my first prestige.  Rebuilding the earlier cities will work toward this mission and I wont be taunted by other missions that arent possible.,BitCity,df6sfqm,3,t5_3ir6i

11625621,0,t3_65vxrg,Oy! Sorry. I posted from a mobile device and my comment didnt make it.I meant to say that of the  lots to develop in City  almost  involve caffeine in my version. There are  Star Bits and Buzz Huts. I wonder how this saturation resembles what is happening in the nonvirtual dimension.Edit added the comment which originally went off into the ether.,BitCity,dgdry79,3,t5_3ir6i
