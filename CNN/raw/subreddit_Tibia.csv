4002831,0,t1_crc9ejd,Wouldnt use this. The news section links to Alibaba its got ads all over it. Doesnt look legit at all. Claims it uses WineSkin which is a tool to wrap .exe so they play on a Mac. No different than parallels.Even if this didnt have lag issues youd be better wrapping it yourself to avoid risks,Tibia,crcjycu,2,t5_2rmit

For paladin probably also corymscyclops and then dragons.  Its hard to PG anything else than mage.,Tibia,cw50nht,1,t5_2rmit
