You wont see it unless you look for it tho I had to put a black image and turn the lights off in my room to see the bleed. I dont have any dents or uneven bottom etc. No hissing from audio. The speaker isnt great at anything less than ish though.Cameras are very good phone is very smooth and fast to switch apps.

7152385,0,t3_4di6sc,I will chime in for you! I bought a v on swappa for a month and then resold it. I really did love it. But like you it was rather large. It fit better in the hand than the P i tried out. To me the G is the perfect size. The wide angle camera on the back is more of a use to me than the front one on the v. Both have exp storage and replaceable battery. The g SD is alot more powerful than the SD in the v.  Id say if you really do not like the size do it. What your losing is the screen size of the v and durability.What your gaining is the smaller size usb type c moduleshard to see if this will be a big deal other than swappable battery so far Faster SD chip much better fingerprint reader.Ill say I tried out the Nexus x P  V and the G is def my favorite. The p and v were a tad too large. ,lgg5,d1r5kw5,4,t5_31m2p

But I agree the issue with the light sensor is serious and the case does need to be tweaked to fix that most likely.But  your complaint is mostly BS. The case is plenty water tight its just not meant to be put on and taken off on an ongoing basis. All Lifeproof cases have a maximum recommended onoff times to keep wear and tear down in order for them to remain water tight  for my iPhone case it was  times or less that was the maximum recommended and less than that was safer.

8960740,0,t3_52w1mu,I got my G about a month ago and I love it! Its not the flashiest phone on the market but it does everything great. The build quality is okay but its easy to fix with a phone skin or case. The screen is great have had a little burn in issue but it fixed itself. The battery life lasts me a full day. The camera is the best thing about this phone Ive taken so many great photos with the dual cameras. Overall its a great well rounded phone. Id recommend it but maybe look into the V if you want the newest on the market. ,lgg5,d7oy2vh,3,t5_31m2p

As well as a plastic piece that needed some careful removing from the old area next to the battery.  I moved them all over to the new screen with  issues.  Not sure if they were needed as I noticed the guides didnt swap them but being left with extra parts can never be great.  I just made sure to take a long look between the old screen and new and transferred all the parts over making sure my new one matched the old one.
