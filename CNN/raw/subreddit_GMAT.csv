I also wanted to increase my SC as I have calculated it to my weakest most correctable portion so I bought the GMATPill Sentence correction and have just about finished it. It was good from my first run through a little pricey but they teach natural language not book language so it is different from Manhattan and other books.

754629,0,t1_cgpylad,Well if you dont have a valid score to submit then yes take it again.It is also generally agreed upon that schools dont want to see applicants taking the exam a dozen times. This can communicate negative qualities to the admissions committee such as poor time management skills slow learner syndrome or good old fashioned poor judgment or misalignment of priorities. So how many times? Three is the number we hear most often as acceptable or reasonable. Schools tend to think that if you havent achieved your max or close to it in three tries you may be left behind in a typical bschool curriculum. Veritas Prep,GMAT,cgq23kn,5,t5_2rucg

My time management has improved since I started using a new technique. I answer  questions on each page expect  page where I do  and on the bottom of the page I write the time I should have. If Im over time I have to strategically guess on the next  questions. With this technique Im usually  minutes behind at most. No I havent been taking practice tests at the same time. The last practice test I took was pm.  During the official test I feel very rushed and sometimes I feel that I dont know the material at all too hard that answering the question will take a really long time that the question is super easy or I know how to solve it but Im not confident in my solution. The last test I was feeling pretty good although I was paranoid that I would have to pee during the verbal. The test before that I was starving during verbal. Im very easily bothered by noise and the people at the center chatted loud enough for me to hear. The soundproof earphones give me a headache.

6813742,0,t1_d0o27rk,I disagree with this. If you read that chart properly one sees about the same improvement whether one improves Q or V.Two pieces of advice for everyone. One cannot perfectly predict overall scores from Q and V subscores because those subscores are actually rounded to the nearest integer or truncated Im not sure. Since the overall score is calculated based on the underlying subscores with their decimals you will see slight deviations in overall score outcomes. For example QV might translate to  but it also might translate to  depending on how high the underlying decimals are.. Stop worrying about percentiles. They are based on other testtakers and are vastly skewed by a variety of factors especially international testtakers who get really high Q and really low V  many test multiple times because they are cheating or because they hope to get lucky on their verbal. Therefore I think its wrong to look at a high V percentile and think that you should stop working on it. If a university wants a certain percentage okay then consider the percentile. Otherwise consider instead what will best improve your score towards your goals and usually that means increasing whichever Q or V measure you find easier to improve regardless of the percentile its at.,GMAT,d0omvb9,0,t5_2rucg

The way to think about that is that the slope  riserun pronounced rise over runPick any two points on the line and start from the point on the left and look at how high you have to rise go up and how much you have to run go right to get to the second point. More abstractly for any two points on the line Rise  the difference in the ycoordinateRun  the difference in the xcoordinate.

9275341,0,t3_571bvq,Given that you only studied with a few practice exams a  is a great start! When considering how to improve your quant knowledge remember that the GMAT is such a challenging exam because there are so few questions asked in a given exam yet those questions come from a huge topic pool. Thus the best way to get a great GMAT score  is to have a thorough understanding of all that is tested on the exam. To develop such mastery you want to strive for linear and targeted learning followed by focused practice. In other words you want to master one topic before you move to the next.If you are learning about Number Properties you should learn everything possible about that topic LCM GCF units digit patterns divisibility remainders etc. After that be sure that you practice with at least  questions just on Number Properties. The results of that practice will help you to determine how well you have truly mastered that topic.

I decided in August that I wanted to pursue an MBA but have been out of school since  so I was unsure of how the GMAT would go. I originally looked at schools that would accept you without the GMAT but then realized that was taking the easy way out and I wanted to go to a good school otherwise what is the point.I signed up for the live online course with Kaplan and felt they did a good job of teaching you the tricks to the gmat but it was light on the fundamentals. After taking the official GMAT twice and not scoring what I was hoping for I signed up for the live online class with Manhattan Prep. They focus more on the fundamentals teaching you the equations and less on the tricks. I took another shot at the GMAT about  weeks after the Manhattan course and scored a  which was higher than what I was hoping for.
