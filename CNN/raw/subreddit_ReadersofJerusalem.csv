9840929,0,t3_5fwbi3,I agree! I also did the audio book and was absolutely entranced! The only question I have is what exactly was the Porthimoth Di Norhan and how did it redraw the boundaries? Honestly Im not sure what the boundaries were to begin with. ,ReadersofJerusalem,daqao5v,1,t5_3gepi
11749832,0,t3_67iug3,Ive been working hard on this Its a work in progress. I have finished nine pages so far but theres only eight here as I havent finished noting the ninth page.  I still have forty to go but I have found it has been getting easier as I go and I hope to pick up the pace a little. The translation isnt as hard as unpacking the references researching them and then noting.  I included notes that I thought were relevant.  Usually if something rings a bell or sounds like a reference to another work I start researching. That often leads me down the rabbit hole and I have wasted afternoons rereading portions of Joyces or Lucias Bios that should have been spent translating.  There are certainly references I missed and some that I deliberately skipped over if I thought they were common knowledge.  Its a long way from complete and far from perfect.  I am sure it is riddled with grammar and spelling errors.  I have not really edited it yet so please excuse bad writing.  There are still areas I have not figured out a satisfying translation for yet. I am always open to suggestions if anyone has any.  Lines or passages I have not cracked I left in italics as they appear in the book. My footnotes are still unfinished but they hint at what I am ultimately shooting for.  I havent created a bibliography yet but it is in the works. When I thought it was fitting interesting or funny I noted in brackets after a word the other connotations.  I probably didnt do it as often as I should have but I thought some were  quite on the nose and didnt need to be pointed out.  Perhaps when I am finished Ill go back through and highlight more of them. I am open to any feedback corrections thoughts on potential references I missed etc.  My citations are atrocious I know I mostly forget MLA at this point but I will brushup and correct before I complete the chapter.  This is just a rough draft of the first few pages but it hints at what I am aiming for. ,ReadersofJerusalem,dgrvfmq,3,t5_3gepi
