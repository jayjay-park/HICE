Each time the glass cracked more and more until it was a lot uglier than a phone in a case. I got my S after smashing the glass on my Moto X when the small but effective bumper case I had broke and the phone was caseless for a few hours and slipped out of my pocket while I was bending over. You can bet I got a case for my S immediately after buying it.

And when it is fully charged itll drop  in less than an hour. Im speaking as someone who loves these phones but its ridiculous. You mentioned  devices...yeah its kind of expected to come with a short lifespan. Phones these days are  at least...majority of them especially here is Oz are over K...with phone designs having nonremovable batteries.
