I know fusionbeads.com and beadaholique have some. . is about as cheap as you are probably going to find unless you take the risk of possibly getting really poor quality ones from ebay or alibaba. You can also consider making bangles instead of bracelets so you wont need to add endcaps and a clasp.Good luck!edited to add you can also search for kumihimo cord ends as kumihimo is popular right now and a lot of manufacturers are creatingmarketing large cord ends for that. ,Beading,ct0ae9z,1,t5_2s656

9839207,0,t3_5fc81j,HiI am new to the whole social media thing. The craft projects I submitted take many many hours to create and write up. Sharing them or giving them away for free to me is a very generous thing to do. However by your comments i dont think you agree. If you are asking me to remove them and the reddit button from my site then I am happy to comply. Please advise. Thank you.,Beading,daq2l93,1,t5_2s656
