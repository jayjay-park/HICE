6839552,0,t3_49bony,Just curious OP. Why was he hired if hes not yet that knowledgeable when it comes to SEO? I mean hell just earn negative reviews from his clients if he cant even handle a simple project like that.I do admit that Im not really that great with SEO either but I dont really reach out to real clients immediately and expect myself to fully produce some results. SEO is one crazy thing that cant be handled that easily.For the benefit of the doubt lets say that it wasnt really the lack of knowledges fault of his failure. But hey at least he should know the errors that he made when handling that specific client.SEO is easy to learn but definitely hard to apply. So I guess he has the brains but not the guts to make use of it.,get_traffic,d0rkf6i,1,t5_37m5z
