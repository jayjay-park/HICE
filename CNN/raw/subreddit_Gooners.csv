937667,0,t1_chav1s1,On the contrary its in the FAs interests to implement a system that will help cultivate and develop the most talented players possible from the available pool of English talent. Sure their attendances will be crap but it will be good for young players at the top clubs and for the English game in the long run. Surely that takes precedence here? ,Gooners,chav9c0,1,t5_2txps

1174849,0,t3_27kki5,gtbut quite why people overlook the went to Spain bit when it comes to his performances is beyond me. Theres a direct correlation between him being in Spain and him playing well. I dont get why people say things like this. The guy barely started a game for us. The bulk of his appearances came from the bench and it never seemed like there was an earnest attempt to fully incorporate him into the team. His sporadic usage reminds me of how Podolski has been used in certain periods. Wenger gave more chances to Denilson who was solid in  but still.... I always thought he did reasonably well in the limited time he was able to play. ,Gooners,ci1sgz0,1,t5_2txps
1177469,0,t1_ci1sgz0,He did... alright. And hes been exceptional this season. But we dont need another small technical wingerstriker. We need a powerhouse. Someone thats going to turn and run at defenders and scare them. A bit like another Poldi rather than another Santi. Bring on Super Mario. If Wenger can calm that lad down without him losing anything from his game hed be the bargain buy of the century so far.  Remy could probably do a job as a back up. Im not convinced Vela could and he doesnt want to come back anyway. We should just take the money and be glad of it.,Gooners,ci232sv,1,t5_2txps
1181343,0,t3_27nigj,Well hes worth at least  million now. Depending on how people feel about him in Mexico it could be higher.,Gooners,ci2ir98,0,t5_2txps
1211081,0,t1_ci5uwsn,He was mine as well.The people on rgunners comparing him to RvP and Nasri are deluded. I believe he genuinely wanted to come back but Wenger just said no. I didnt think Wenger was stupid enough to let this happen but hopefully hell prove me wrong with some big transfers later in the summer.Im indifferent towards Cesc now. I cant bring myself to hate him but I dont like him either. One huge signing and well forget about this. Lets just hope that signing actually happens.,Gooners,ci5v5az,3,t5_2txps

1446857,0,t1_cixkhcn,gteveryone else is going to want an inflated salaryThis relative salary thing is the reason why folks like Arshavin and Bendtner were overpaid and impossible to move.Not everyone is going to get the pay raise they are seeking and if they do itll be performance based not necessarily because of how much we are paying someone else. If someone is unhappy too bad. If they start making too much noise theyll be sold like the money whores before them and well invest the proceeds into good talent ,Gooners,cixn1ha,3,t5_2txps
