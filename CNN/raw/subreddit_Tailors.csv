2199695,0,t3_2k86k2,I would agree with buying a larger size the  have it tailored down... ONLY if the shoulders still fit. If the shoulders are too big then forget it. There is usually about an inch in the hem of jackets that could possibly be let out. If you could post some pics of you wearing it or would be helpful! ,Tailors,cljfopg,2,t5_2wxfp
2241040,0,t1_cloontc,I see well the reason for the flexibility is so that I can move my arms around without having to feel like the entire coat is shifting with the movement. Im not too worried about how it will look at the end considering im going to get hit with paint and will be running through forest lol.Lucky me I wont have to fire shotguns.. gauge sucks! The paintball guns rely on pressurized air and are smaller so as far as Im concerned they can take all the back material they want to make the fit work.How much do you think Ill get charged for such destruction? Lol Im seeing myself in the  range,Tailors,cloou8b,1,t5_2wxfp
3859279,0,t3_34mwsa,Where is it too big?  Shoulders?  Waist?  Sleeves?  How big is too big?  An inch?  A fistful of fabric?Easier to help you figure out what to expect if we know what needs fixing.  ,Tailors,cqw6y56,1,t5_2wxfp
4832374,0,t1_ctstvlu,Absolutely. People who dont sew will look at something and think Well this looks so easy! and base their price expectations on how much theyd have to spend at WalmartPenningtons. But those items are made overseas by the thousand and that is why they are cheap. Getting it made locally and only getting one to a few done will be a higher price. I outright refuse to make things from scratch. I just dont have the time though that is what I used to do in my mothers shop so I stick to mending and alterations only.,Tailors,cu3ns47,2,t5_2wxfp

6509821,0,t1_czpnoyw,No because the bust point is too high on her body. You can lower the neckline and armscye but you would need to address the high bust point. At that point youd be taking the bodice in more at the top of the bust and the bodice is already quite tight. Which is why it should be lowered or a larger size procured. There needs to be some ease in the fit.,Tailors,czsnyri,-1,t5_2wxfp
6800738,0,t1_d0n435h,A few days ago I sent an email to the address that is provided in the server error message webmastercutterandtailor.com  have not received a reply yet. I might try contacting Jeffrey. I know what you mean  I am seriously worried because there isnt another information source like it available anywhere as far as I know. It would be a devastating loss. ,Tailors,d0n5ng5,1,t5_2wxfp
9075022,0,t3_54bcwa,Instead of just removing it all together I would try to get some leather or pleather in a matching brown and take it somewhere to replace the ribbing that is what the stretchy fabric is called with the leather. If it looks like I am picturing in my head then the zipper probably extends down into it... and if you just removed the ribbing then there would be some excess zip at the bottom. You cant just cut that zip off you can only shorten it from the top so youd also have to take out the entire zip to reposition it... so replacing the ribbing with another material would be best.,Tailors,d82o5co,2,t5_2wxfp
9126844,0,t1_d88j3ro,Youre right  its best to size up and then tailor down. However there are shirts in my closet Ive already purchased or that used to fit fine before I started weightlifting a few years ago.Is there any way that shouldersupper arms of shirts I already own can be tailored or altered for a bit more room? Or am I dreaming an impossible dream?,Tailors,d88wc50,1,t5_2wxfp
