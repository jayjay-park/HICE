Between just throwing some money down and having all the cards at your disposal or just flatout being good at the game people always seem to one up me. So bunker down power through enjoy the emote then put the game down.  At worst you get your emote. At best you find out your get the hang of it down the road. ,KrosmagaEN,deglzjd,1,t5_3hndm
