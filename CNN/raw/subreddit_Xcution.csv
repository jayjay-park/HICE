His face showed a scorn that very obviously didnt approve of the interference in his work.What is it Cameron? Are you just here to waste more of my time or is there something important going on?Tyler was clearly tired. His entire face was covered in motor grease and he seemed to be rather impatient with Cameron. If his fellow fullbringer was only here to waste time then he would be forced to be an impatient ass with him again just to prove a point.Well? Spit it out.,Xcution,cfap9zo,1,t5_2wehv

344190,0,t1_cfgfw86, I had a couple of ideas but if youd like I can do it like that. Was kind of basing it off of an old OC.The voice began laughing shaking his head in the shadows unseen. Exactly what I just said. You Shinigami are so pompous when it comes to looking like youre doing your jobs. It amuses me.The echo didnt stop even as there was a flash of light and a tremendous searing wind. We were warned about our prideful ways nearly sixty years ago care to explain why we have yet to change them?,Xcution,cfgg0f4,1,t5_2wehv

As they started to walk away from the playground Hiraku gave one last look over his shoulder to see the little girl being shepherded into a police car. She waved frantically again touching his face with a smile and a little bit of water.So Aoi. How go things when the big mans not around? Havent had you chew my ear off for a good few months now. Hiraku teased her. Probably because he hadnt actually been given much of a chance to talk to the woman as of late not with ether the stress building up to this or Ryuuhei keeping her attached by the wrist with paperwork. So anything new?As they rounded a corner Hiraku noticed a small convinced store up ahead. One that people were leaving with what looked like takeaway cups. Tea! He said a bit too happily for a grown man and increased his pace a bit his course now dead set on the shop. Coming Aoi?! Hiraku called back. ,Xcution,cfhm9h8,1,t5_2wehv

He turned on the faucet to the hottest setting he could get it up to before beginning to wash his hands up to his elbows. The skin was turning red gradually as he washed his heart beat increasing as he scrubbed furiously. Misoras glasses were slipping off and at one point he just had to take them off. He was unable to stop this time feeling that his hands were just covered in filth and germs. At this point the water had been running for a considerable amount of time so that anyone in the area might have been able to hear it. ,Xcution,cfir7j9,1,t5_2wehv
377011,0,t1_cfju1se,As if Yoru couldnt be capable of getting angrier than he already was the asshole of a Shinigami Hiraku just had to go and use a weak Hado spell on him. The binding wrapped around his waist and felt himself tugged but planted his feet on the ground harshly and grinded against the asphalt from the attempt to be thrown aside before raising his blade and cutting the spell easily and glaring viciously at Hiraku. It was at times like these that he really did wish that he had no position and was as independent as Pandora. Then he could kill this guy and not have to worry about consequences much.You idiot! Yoru growled as he was focusing on where the reiatsu was coming from. I dont fucking care if you think that Im being a high and mighty asshole with my position but your job is to watch over Aoi isnt it? Well then take her to the ship and keep her safe there for fucks sake. Goddammit I have never met someone as stupid as you. Get your head out of your ass and get out of here! Yoru stopped looking at his idiotic comrade that thinks that nothing is wrong. He took a deep breath. Listen Im not ordering you Im asking you. Take Aoi to the ship. Shell be safe there. Someone begged me to make sure that shes not harmed and you told Ryuuhei that youd watch over her. So you can do that much. Just take her back to the Seireitei and warn the other Captains of the danger coming. You are a Shinigami and our job isnt just to protect humans and purify Hollows. Its to protect the other souls in Soul Society.He noticed Aoi tripping over something. Aoi dont touch the wire! he said as he went to her. Someones controlling them. Someone strong... Even as he said that he was trying to make sure that no one would take advantage of this situation. ,Xcution,cfjucde,1,t5_2wehv

People within a radius of  feet all fainted because of the spiritual pressure and he approached the duck. Picking it up with both hands. Why does this have to go the hard way. Ill take you to Xcution myself he said while walking away surpressing his reiatsu again and bringerstepping through the streets before he reached the Manor. He pointed at the building.

The two discussed something between themselves for a bit then wandered out of the room not having taken notice of Daniels burst of reiatsu or the spirit weapon that formed in the rubbish bin. Were going to give you two time to reevaluate your choices you have ten minutes before it starts on both of you. Said the once calmer one with a nod towards the rag.The two exited the room with only slight mumbling of If they dont talk then well just have to kill them and start over with the others to be heard before the door shut behind them with an oddly soft click. ,Xcution,cgymvva,1,t5_2wehv
956007,0,t1_chcx5ul,Mami stood there staring after the redhead completely lost now... alone and hopeless.   Mami knew Rio was right and yet she had healed them looked after them... all she had wanted to do was look after them and make sure that they wouldnt die before the human doctors could look at the men... was that so wrong?Then images flashed unbidden through her mind as even Mamis naivet reached its limit realizing just what these men would do to a woman if given the chance... and all that pain and fear and suffering... it would all be Mamis fault.So you just want me to kill them then?  To just snuff them out when they cant even beg me to stop? she screamed needing to say this You want me to betray everything Hirokusan taught me and just kill a defenseless person is that it? she yelled not sure if Rio could even hear her but she kept on screaming Fine Ill get rid of them and you wont have to worry about any of that she snapped not even sure of what she was saying.Nothing made sense in Mamis life anymore not since Hirokus death.   The only thing she had had was healing... but apparently even that was wrong.   Mami couldnt handle it anymore  Her hands glowed as she began mumbling an incantation.  She didnt know what kido she would use but even now she wanted to be sure to make them suffer as little as possible.   The men cried out those that were conscious at least and tried to back away.  Spiritually unaware as they were they could still feel something happening and the girls words just now... they knew they had every right to be afraid.Mami didnt care anymore... a part of her honestly did just want to hurt something anything.   She wanted to share the suffering that had filled her for the last two months.. and this was especially true towards men currently.    The energy filled the room flowing outside as Mami prepared to incinerate everything in that building.  ... a tiny voice suggested perhaps it would be easiest if everything included Mami as well... that was a very tempting thought... More tempting than she ever would have thought before now.,Xcution,chcyg11,1,t5_2wehv

1354634,0,t1_cilbqhe,Vergil narrows his eyes at Saki when she puts on that coy expression saying its a secret Vergil hated secrets. It made him all suspicious and shit but given her circumstances and seeing how he just met the girl he cut her a break anyway seeing hour she was generous enough to come over there with him in the first place. Yeesh! Fair enough Miss Kokoro I wont interrogate you anymore since its none of my business. Just as long as you werent there up to no good and trying to do unthinkable things like...well you know...but anyways in regards to what you said earlier you my friend are correct! he says giving her a wink with a shiny thumbs up but on the inside he was a bit more cautious than that. He knew that she was a special human but which one? Vergil was having bad luck with Quincies and Fullbringers alike lately a lot of them were rouges and petty thieves who sought to do ill with their abilities. It was disappointing actually not even humanity was in the same page...no take that back. As if they ever were.Alright so Im not going to lie when I first saw you I knew that you werent like them typical shiteaters. What gave it away? First of all I swear Ive seen no normal human with red eyes. Secondly you plus that bar equals not making a lick of sense. Thirdly I didnt feel your aura until you were closer to me than the others and that other guy disappeared. And now Im going to ask you a question what gave me away? he asks as he starts fiddling with his cross once more he tries to remember that he did try his best to be discreet back there with his abilities. She mustve had some sharp eyes to catch him in the act.,Xcution,cim3emh,1,t5_2wehv
1364515,0,t3_29jsgl,A twist here a turn there... tighten the little bugger up like so...   There we go.Mickey grinned as he set what appeared to be a remote control racecar on the ground in front of him and extended the little antenna on the remote that came with the device.  Not that Mickey needed it.   Not for this little toy of his.   While it may look like a normal car th thing is in fact a kind o Kishi engine... or reishi... or something I forget he explained to a bird that was perched on a nearby windowsill. Anyway the long n th short o it is  This thing dont run on bettaries but on the energy of spirits and ghosts n th like he said and sighed as he used his flicked forward on the remote Now I know there dont be a whole lot o that stuff in a world like this but this little bugger dont need a lot o juice... just what yer average spirit would leave around just by walkin by... at least this city is lousy wit that kind o thing so there need ta be no worryin about it the Irishman said cheerfully sending the toy vehicle forward to see if his design worked... or exploded violently... either way should be fun.The foreigner hummed to himself absented mindedly liking this road.   It was rather secluded so unless they were on their way to Xcution Manor or some such he wasnt likely to run into a soul out here or have to worry about someone asking why he was giving exposition to a bird... not that Mickey would actually care about that.Rather he wanted someone to show up...  secluded as it was anyone that showed up would be a rare encounter so to speak.   A special event that could lead to so many possibilities some boring some not... it was the randomness of the outcome that made it interesting.   Maybe it was the Leprechaun in him but Mickey has always had more than a passing interest in luck and all the things that came with it.I figure she will notice the fact that the car is doing things similar to what a Quincy would do... and if that isnt something that will catch her interest Mickey will probably purposely trip her for the giggles...   So either intelligent conversation or dealing with weirdo.  Whichever Moko prefers ,Xcution,cinbxvn,1,t5_2wehv

Although that hope soon turned to confusion as he questioned her about her birth parents. Hope had always seen them as a King and Queen who protected the land but when she thought on it no one had ever told her that. Even her Dad seemed to get sad whenever he talked about them so shed never really asked. Well... Umm. I know that my Mummy was a pretty Queen... She mumbled sheepishly a bit embarrassed to admit something that she doubted may not be true based on the way Sherner was talking to her. While she waited for his reply Hope looked down and pressed herself into Aldo more. It wasnt often that someone would manage to catch her at a time like this after shed opened up and the little Quincy was finding it frightfully hard to go back to happy Hope again. ,Xcution,cj9gstf,1,t5_2wehv
