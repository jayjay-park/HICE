2868348,0,t1_cnsv9p8,Sorry.  I dont know anything about time infrastructure.Are you asking about using an MX as a switch?  Or routing NTP traffic?,Juniper,cnu4roq,1,t5_2rwj6
4794558,0,t1_ctym9et,Keep one thing in mind.Cisco books and Cisco tests are NOT aligned.Juniper books and Juniper tests ARE aligned.Thats why he failed it. Not because he didnt know it but more likely because the book didnt adequately cover the test material.,Juniper,ctyw5tt,2,t5_2rwj6
4870159,0,t1_cu83mqi,Seconding this.  I have  EXC all connected running OSPF.  You will get a warning on commit but they dont restrict the feature.  For a simply lab setup you are fine that is what mine was doing.,Juniper,cu8f5ox,2,t5_2rwj6
5273917,0,t1_cvlkj75,The current configuration installs a static route via the other side of the physical .Using a numbered tunnel would have you put addresses on the st.x interfaces and setting the nexthop of the static routes to the other side of the tunnel. This way the selection of which tunnel to use is done by examining the nexthop of the route.,Juniper,cvlswun,1,t5_2rwj6
7697848,0,t1_d3h3aj9,I come to rJuniper due to my lack of JTAC support unfortunately.  But thank you for your confirmation of umassives assessment.,Juniper,d3h71en,1,t5_2rwj6
7829427,0,t1_d3p8ucv,I just took delivery of two of the new SRXs... Ill let you know what it looks like.,Juniper,d3w3ewa,2,t5_2rwj6

8350790,0,t3_4tytg0,Can you provide the port config? Where are the VMs gateways  on the EX or elsewhere? Can you see any MAC addresses in the appropriate VMs VLANs on the switch port the VM host is connected to? How about ARP entries on the routers?,Juniper,d5leh8x,1,t5_2rwj6
8399903,0,t1_d5rij0i,Ive done this but im still getting the same error. ,Juniper,d5rj8uy,1,t5_2rwj6
8604964,0,t1_d6h78oz,Thanks for the reply.The site just feels outdated and I emailed the creator but he hasnt replied.I will maybe give it another go soon.,Juniper,d6h7qzt,1,t5_2rwj6
8712866,0,t1_d6uq12d,Yea it was really really bad. When we were rolling out this campus the s were only  months old. The decision had to be made on s vs s because we wanted redundant PSUs. I felt horrible that I pushed to do s and they were a pain to work with. Now that the software has matured it is awesome. How many people here can say they have gig to the enduser edge ,Juniper,d6uqu2d,1,t5_2rwj6
8725422,0,t1_d6wb3bc,Amazon... specifically this one I already have the ability to download JunOS as needed is that all I need or is there a license that needs to be applied? This is very confusing to me and unless Im missing it there isnt squat on Junipers site explaining this. ,Juniper,d6wbiu0,1,t5_2rwj6
10370653,0,t3_5ofg9j,I have yet to find a valid use case for a switch acting as a DHCP server... You may want to rethink your layout.,Juniper,dcjkq7p,2,t5_2rwj6
10511294,0,t3_5qijf0,Looks like it only catches  directly otherwise you get the subnet.  gt  applypath was expanded to  gt      ...   gt      ...   gt      ...   gt      ...  ,Juniper,dczkf1n,1,t5_2rwj6

11059801,0,t1_delltur,Thats whats inside the filter. Theres a then accept term after that for everything else.,Juniper,dellzkv,1,t5_2rwj6
11701743,0,t1_dglxml7,The CLI is completely different to Cisco. The first time you use JunOS you will hate it. But once you get used to the CLI differences youll learn to love it. Ive done what you are about to do  gone from an exclusive Cisco backgroundcertification to a Juniper one  and its a relatively steep learning curve until you grasp JunOS  but once you do the concepts are the same. Some things to note. JunOS doesnt do proprietary protocols like EIGRP or PaGP  so if you rely on them youll have to migrate to standards based protocols line OSPF or LACP.When you edit a config on JunOS you are editing a candidate config  unlike Cisco hitting enter does not immediately apply your changes.If you have a support agreement on your Juniper kit they have an online Cisco to Junos converter  it doesnt do everything but it certainty can help get started. Get yourself a couple of books  JunOS for dummies and the ORielly JunOS Cookbook  they helped me immeasurably when I started. commit confirmed and rollback are your friend!Feel free to PM if you want further comment.Edit  Link to IoS to Junos converter.,Juniper,dgmetey,8,t5_2rwj6
