3237103,0,t1_coxgsav,Oh I definitely get where youre coming from but I honestly dont even think that its the only reason. I mean yes it is in fact pretty obvious. For you for me. We know what its based on. But not everyone reads King or watches classic movies. Especially not everyone of those who are still in their teenage years right now. There are a lot of people who still have to catch up on certain things that were totally common for prior generations. The book is from the s and even Kubricks cinematic interpretation is  years old now. Of course everyone saw a poster or a pic with Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance once in their life. I would just be really surprised if every single one of them already made further contact with the story as well. Im  now and even I still have to recommend it to friends of the same age because they simply didnt care enough yet. There will of course always be things that everyone will get no matter if they know the source because they are overused or became memes over the years. Im just quite unsure if the word Redrum and the number  can really be considered as something like that since you definitely have to know more than only the name of the bookfilm or a poster to get what its part of.,lifeisstrange,coxj6mz,4,t5_32tf7

But even if you completely ignore Kate all game and do every bad option at least one of the four options will be correct. You just need to explore Kates room to know which ones or pick certain options like telling Kate the phone was on silent when she called. If you do choose a wrong answer Kate will step back. If the rest of your answers are correct but she stepped back you get an additional question. The answer is in her bible and its the one thats not scratched out.

4035331,0,t3_36q5xh,I dont feel sorry for him but I dont dislike him Like I do David or Nathan or Victoria yet. Most of the things we know or have seen him do balance out.He brought the nearly being shot by Max on himself by drawing a knife on Chloe and threatening her. He started the escalation there and he did it when he knew they had a gun. On the other hand he took nearly being shot pretty well and backs off more then if you dont try and shoot. Kinda looks like he knew the situation had gotten out of hand. Alternatively taking the gun off them after Max didnt pull the trigger could also be seen as him looking after himself or them.His relationship with Rachel could be good or bad as well. Im always suspicious of a much older man being with a teen girl. He was also in a position of power over her as her drug dealer which is also a warning bell and Its not impossible that Nathan and David werent lying about Rachel bringing drugs onto campus with him as her boyfriend. Still its not impossible it was a healthy relationship for both of them and Chloe says he never hit on her when she hung out with him. So thats a possible good sign towards the relationship.,lifeisstrange,crg9awg,6,t5_32tf7

So yeah that will probably happen.gt The homeless woman near the back of Two Whales is Max from the futureanother timeline. Max is Rachel Amber from another timeline. Fate wants Chloe dead.I hope none of these are true to be honest. Someone pointed out in another post that the tornado vision happened prior to Chloe getting shot so its likely it wont be a save Chloe or stop the tornado situation though Id let the tornado wreck Arcadia Bay before Id let Chloe die. The Max is RachelMax is the homeless woman theories are kinda lame to me and seem really predictable. Id be unhappy with those.

It doesnt feel like theres any good choice... I mean no choice worth making because the story will go the way IT wants to go and pretty fast... At least LiS choices feel like theyll be worth something and they make you wonder what that is... Telltale tends to give you a choice and cancel it almost immediately... I like LiS better than anything TellTale has put out... even if I do enjoy TellTale games... its a weird position to be in...Even if the LiS choices havent all been Massive OMFG THATS HELLA AWESOME moments it does feel like it all matters at some point one way or the other... That makes LiS just that much more enjoyable...As for Dreamfall Chapters yeah they give you the hints but up until now its does a pretty good job making choices matter too...,lifeisstrange,crnf7p3,3,t5_32tf7

There are plenty of characters weve never talked to I know in the courtyard at the start of episode  you never talk to at least  girl whos laying on the grass another girl whos talking to Stella the nerdy girl and I believe at least one of the skater guys and one of the football players. Im sure Im missing examples but there are at least a few examples of characters weve never talked to many of them not even having Look options.Finally read through it all I have to say good job on the explanation of why Max retains her memories despite the massive rewind. A protection mechanism built into her time hijinks would explain why she can change five years worth of history and then skip it and have no idea whats going on opposed to the butterfly Effect explanation where his brain rapidly creates the appropriate memories for the changes he made but he still has to remember them while also retaining memories from alternate choices. Although its possible that shell start having strange visions of the five years skipped in the new timeline filling in the five year gap of memories.,lifeisstrange,cs0aypa,1,t5_32tf7

Then they get to go home to their nice homes where youre allowed to make a sandwich I got to go home and get a beating for eating lunch.So ya I completely understand Chloes desire to avoid being blamed Max may get in trouble but she has a clean record and she doesnt have to live with David. Not to mention that theres plenty of research showing that abused children are really shitty at making good long term choices its almost impossible to think long term when the short term consequences for almost any action is possibly be physically abused So basically at everybody who sides with David have fun sympathizing with a literal child abuser,lifeisstrange,csfnwhi,6,t5_32tf7

Id like to think that if she went back again and changed back the timeline shed return to the original universe at the time she she looked at the photo in alternate universe. Similar to how she arrived in the alternate universe with no recollection of the alternate past shed have no memory of xhours lost from the original timeline even though shed have lived in it but didnt experience it.

Looking at Maxs room from outside her window having a tracking device on Max Brooke tells you this and being extremely persistent and not respecting Maxs clear no are things that really get me rolling my eyes and being creeped out. The girl isnt interested and says no respect that and chill out bruh. Also if Max says yes to the date he goes off to tell Brooke that they cant go anymore. Hes kind of just using Brooke there in case his plan didnt work.

4599087,0,t1_cta8z09,I guess Im kinda confused uninformed and not understanding why a game being released this way seems like its being literally worked on into the last minute. I mean I know major AAA releases are quality tested up until just weeks before the release but this is a bit different with a smaller company and episodic release schedule. I was aware of life is strange a few months before its release. I guess I was kinda under the assumption that most of the game was pretty much completed upon the release of Episode . But apparently thats not how they do it? Why or why not? Is it so they can change things based on the feedback they get from players and tweak the game mechanics or story based on that feedback?It kinda comes off as that they are just making it up as they go. Is that due to the nature of the game? Like most normal games kinda have a set narrative structure but since this is a game thats supposedly changing based on player choice does that mean theyve changed things between episodes? And thats whats going on? I dont know. I was kinda surprised to hear a couple weeks ago about how they were JUST now recording voice work for episodes  ampamp . That seems like something that would have been done a while ago. I would think in the weeks just before a targeted release window theyd be doing final tweaks and testing. This probably shows an incredible lack of insight on my part into the video game business when Ive always thought I knew a little bit about it. ,lifeisstrange,ctaaz6s,10,t5_32tf7

I think Chloe would have to go to great horrible lengths to convince Max to ditch her.Plus Max is kind of a bad girl herself depending on how you play her. And even if you try to play her as a goodytwoshoes she still goes and does dumbrebellious stuff anyway and seems to enjoy herself. Like the more she uses her power to escape consequences and such the more reckless she gets. Chloe is a bad influence for sure but Max kinda meets her halfway.

4665518,0,t1_ctihuoj,I really think the final ending will be similar to madoka magica. Madoka Magica Spoiler? s because max is rewriting time again and again and again and saving chloes life rewriting time for chloe cloe is the sole connection and change of all of these timelines. Because of this everytime Max rewinds to save chloe chloe becomes even stronger of a connection. And when something happens to her like being killed because she is such an influence on the universe by evading death over and over again the universe just collapses in on itself. Which is the hurricanehuge storm. Maybe Max is just repeating the week over and over because she keeps messing up and chloe continues to die. Much like what happens with Homura time traveller trying to save madoka innocent who keeps dying Perhaps we are either playing the one time where Max finds a way to save chloe or we go back to the beginning of the week to save her and possibly rachel.

4701401,0,t1_ctn4ekx,gt The path of fixing things is endless because life isnt perfect. would you say that... life is strange?sorry serious stuff.There is the other alternative where Max sets some path up and in order to allow it to continue dies herself. Shes experiencing things like nosebleeds and headaches etc. It seems likely that this power is killing her  maybe as a final effort to set things right again she sets herself as the victim provides the evidence and then dies. Or possibly dies in the process of rewinding things to a point where the world isnt going to go insane around her. I think there are a lot of different and strange possibilities that we dont necessarily consider because we as people outside of the project cant see all the outcomes. Im not sure Ill be happy with any of the endings that are available but Ill certainly be content. If only because I dont know how I would handle the situation where I am responsible for the entirety of the future. Theyll give us a subset of actions we can perform out of every possible action available to us and well select several of them and then decide what we think is best and eventually have to live with that choice. That to me is almost the point of the game. Much like OP said having to live with your decisions is difficult when you know you can endlessly go back and make a different one. Eventually you have to admit the zerosum situation and decide which of these outcomes you care most about and stick with it. If Justice is what you desire as a person more than the life of Chloe or even yourself perhaps you have to accept the death of your friend in order to bring these tormentors to justice. If you cant live with that maybe you can accept your own death instead. If all that matters to you is the happiness of your friend then save her at the expense of letting these criminals escape. That still leaves this impending doom that seems likely to have been brought on by your actions and perhaps you cant accept that. Rewinding to the beginning may be your only choice. Each of us has a priority and weve experienced all of the actions leading up to what we define as those priorities so many times that it actually makes the decision harder. Thats the beauty of the writing in this game. It maps your own priorities on to the characters of the game and lets you struggle with what is right versus what you want. Can you accept consequences for the actions you perform? Itll be very cool to see the end of all of this.,lifeisstrange,ctn5evs,3,t5_32tf7

Jefferson has a few moments in the game where he seems fishy his weird moment of desperation talk the phone call victim blaming Kate ect and in my mind I think I also kind of put him into the red herring theyre trying to throw us off with him zone.So yeah I still ended up surprised when it was him lol.,lifeisstrange,ctrz422,3,t5_32tf7

Someone with schizophrenia doesnt have multiple personalities.Even when youre writing something quickly your handwriting doesnt change much. Its messier but you dont write your letters all that different.The only reason its possible Nathan wrote both is because there are other messages in the game that ought to be written by MaxChloeRachel in which the handwriting is different. So if Dontnod is keeping track of handwriting it cant be the same. If they arent its possible.I would also like to point out however that the writing wasnt written with the same toolsubstance. In the junkyard it appears to be spray paint. You can see splotches of excess paint. In Maxs room the words run and drip down as if actual paint or blood.

4798859,0,t1_ctz0whl,Not possible. If Mr Jefferson is the future of Nathan and he came back to the past he should take over the body of the past Nathan. Just like how Max rewind time back to her  year old body and even to the alternate world where she took over that worlds body. There shouldnt be anyone else with special powers other than Max. Thats what I choose to believe anyway. Also its already to the last episode. You should be expecting the climax now where the lighthouse and stuff comes into play and how everything ends in the game. The reason for why Max obtained this power should be revealed in the next episode. Or its one of those where the developers just doesnt go into the origins of the power too much and just shows an ending with a mystery to how Max obtained it in the first place.All in all dont think too much now. Your questions to that is impossible as it adds even more story to the game when its supposed to be at the finale. Well.. unless theres a season .Sad thing though is that Chloe and Rachel are both gone. Mr Jefferson used a needle with some toxins? on Max. The next episode preview shows more needles with Max being afraid and tornadoes incoming. Episode  Finale will be something worth waiting for!!,lifeisstrange,ctzfonu,4,t5_32tf7

For example saving or not saving Kate seemed to hinge on how you treated her before her suicide attempt whether Victoria believed your warning at the End of the World Party depended on how you treated her in the past as well etc.  I think it would only make sense for them to follow a similar structure for the endings but probably even a bit more elaborate due to it being you know the ending.,lifeisstrange,cu7k4we,1,t5_32tf7

4880249,1,t1_cu9naii,Nathan was drugged by Mr. Jefferson too in his photo with Rachel. Nathan doesnt want to do this stuff and you can tell. His father takes advantage of his mental health and doesnt give two shits about him.Oh here son just pop these pills and youll be okayThats not how you address situations like that especially when the person your dealing with is your own flesh and blood. His father is crappy at being a parent and it explains why his sister left to go to the Peace Corps. Should Nathan have drugged Chloe and all the other countless victims? No but what choice do you have when youre in a vulnerable state and forced to do it? Should Nathan have pulled a gun out on Chloe and Warren? No but hes been raised to believe that he can get away with anything because his father runs the school and town. Should Nathan advertise his rage in public Ms. Hoidas class the diner the parking lot? No but how would you feel if you had all this pent up anger and hatred for yourself and everyone thinks they know you but they really dont? The only peer of his who seems to actually care about his well being is Victoria. Nathan is a flawed character just like every other character in this game. This is what makes them so realistic and want to empathizesympathize with them. Nathan is not a bad kid and his life could have been a lot different if he wasnt abused on a daily basis.

I think in this case its neither. Its genuinely just the texture seams. If it actually is a scar though its definitely not a suicide attempt well or a really poor one because the cut that leaves a scar like that was nowhere near deep enough to kill you and it must be at least one year old to be that faded.,lifeisstrange,cubp569,4,t5_32tf7

I had always interpreted Warren saying he had to cancel plans with Brooke as meaning he was the one who invited Brooke to GO APE but only because he wasnt sure if Max would go. So he was hedging his bets which is why he is so relieved if you say yes. But now I wonder if it wasnt actually Brooke who invited Warren initially  she has a flyer for the screening somewhere that Max can find  and Warren said yes oblivious to Brookes intentions. When he invites Max its because hes doing what Brooke did not playing some Mystery Game B.S. with the eligible ladies of Blackwell. He still could have invited Max to GO APE with him and Brooke which Brooke still wouldnt like but hed be less of a douche in that regard.In any case whether youre Pricefield or Grahamfield or neither its pretty obvious that Brooke and Daniel should hook up at the art museum!,lifeisstrange,cuhjlg0,4,t5_32tf7

5037757,0,t3_3jspom,Good catch on the photo differences. Tbh it really does look like he slaps her in the photo similar to how he slaps Chloe in her room but it never shows it so I doubt it happened. I wonder if they were thinking about adding a scene like that but changed it?Heres some things to add thoughSomeone DID in fact break into the school but its someone other than Chloe and Max. Theres pizza boxes and beer bottles in the parking lot when you leave. Then theres Victorias cigarettes in Mr. Jeffersons room but theres also a lit cigarette in the skeletons mouth in the science room its one of the optional photos. Chloe did NOT put the cigarette in the skeletons mouth for sure because only Max walks back down that hallway Chloe only goes into the office which is right by the front door. An educated guess would be Victoria left the cigarette there since she was  definitely in Mr. Jeffersons room and Max definitely says those are Victorias cigarettes left on the table its not a stretch to say shed pop in the science room and stick one in a skeletons mouth. However I kinda wonder if Nathan and Victoria werent fuckin around in the school before she met with Mr. Jefferson. Anyone else find it odd that hes there with Vic after school hours so late and lets her just smoke in his presence? After ep  we know hes certainly friendly with Nathan to say the least so I believe the breaking in and vandalizing was really Nathan and Victoria and to an extent Mr. Jefferson. Unless someone broke into the school after Max and Chloe.I think he does genuinely care about Chloe he just suffers from PTSD and anger problems still not an excuse to hit her or call her a loser but he really DOES need help this is shown multiple times. He saves a birthday card he gave Chloe he looks at the pictures in the hall before he leaves and Max comments about how she and him look at the pictures the same way I took that as caring and wanting Chloe to just be happy again. I think covering for Chloe was honestly to keep her out of trouble.I think most of your concerns can be answered by what you find in the garage in ep . He clearly works for the Prescotts on the side. Likely something to do with Pan Estates and most reasonably because the need for money is so prevalent in the Prices storyline. Either universe the Price family is swamped in bills. But in the alt universe its Joyce who has a side job working with the Prescotts at Pan Estates. Id wager David works realestate or something but installed cameras on the low cause he wanted to spy on Nathan. I fully believe David knows of Nathans mental struggles he probably both noticed himself since he struggles too and he was probably informed by Nathans dad too. Sean Prescott sends an email thanking David for looking out for Nathan. I think the whole David helps me and asks whats in my head thing is probably just David trying to help Nathan stay calm and out of trouble. David helps me follow who he follows kinda seems to me like maybe David and Nathan have the same therapist? Because we know David and Nathan are both taking pills for psychological troubles. I think theyve formed a somewhat support group together like a buddy system. David is just trying to help Nathan but also spying on Nathan because he knows somethings shady with the Prescotts AND Mr. Jefferson because David knew to put a tracker on Jeffersons car too when Max never suspected him so its even possible Nathan gave David a tip to track Jefferson. Also its pretty much confirmed that he put GPS tracking devices on the car since the longitude and latitude are super accurate down to the decimal point I really dont think he followed them in a car or anything I think he just put tracking devices on the car then printed out the locations the cars stopped at. He easily has the access to do this since the cars were all parked at Blackwell during classes and hes the security guard. I really think David is being somewhat manipulated into thinking Kate is a baddie. Its clear David KNOWS Jefferson and Nathan are doing shady stuff. He tracks Chloe likely because of concern actually its alarming how many parents track their kids irl by phone or car. Theres a fourth person we dont know yet but he at the very least suspects them for something. The only similarities between Kate and Rachel in DAVIDS mind were drugs. I think David was trying to make a connection between the two and the only one he could come up with was drugs. He knows Chloe has been involved with drugs Im sure he knows Nathan is too. I think David was trying to follow a drug trail to figure out whats happening at Blackwell since he even mentions Kate helping Jefferson after class and to never trust men with goatees. Honestly he wasnt wrong. He was really close to figuring things out from the looks of it. He knew drugs were involved and I believe he at least suspected they were supplied by the same guy who supplies Chloe Frank. So thats likely why he was pushing Kate and suspicious if she was on drugs or not.As for David saving Max definite possibility in ANY playthrough REGARDLESS of decisions made. In EVERY playthrough David is either around the Price house or at the least leaves his contact information. In EVERY playthrough David will express concern for Chloe either he takes a while to look at the pictures or he straight up tells Max. In my playthrough I thought David was pretty pissed I sided with Chloe and he told Max she ruined his family. But later theres a note with a phone number and room number for the hotel hes staying at he has a car now and he took a gun. Joyce could EASILY call him or the cops who would then call him tbh. Shell likely notice Chloes truck has been gone forever check her room see the investigation board and realize Chloe and Max are in deep shit then call David who obviously will recognize his evidence and research and easily see CHloe and Max found the location then hed show up to save the day. If you side with him even better. But either way it doesnt matter I think hes the most likely candidate in any playthrough to be the one who saves Max. IMPORTANT EDIT Also I just remembered if you talk to Samuel about David in ep  Samuel bless he is allknowing and a sweetie will say something along the lines of how David actually likes Max because he SEES Max implying that David understands Max has good intentions and is only trying to help.,lifeisstrange,cut8p0e,1,t5_32tf7

5052412,0,t3_3k43t3,I know everyone wants Max and Chloe to get together. Dont get me wrong I kind of want it too. And the second I saw that Kiss Chloe option I jammed the button so hard I damn near pushed it through the controller. But Chloe hasnt shown any real romantic interest in Max since that kiss. Shes made a couple jokes about it but she hasnt pursued Max in that way. Could she be recovering from her heavilyimplied relationship with Rachel especially now that it seems weve found her body? Absolutely thats totally plausible. But Episode  Chloe was giving ALL kinds of playful flirtiness while Episode  Chloe...wasnt. She hasnt even given us the hey Im getting over someone but Id like to try for a relationship with you when Im ready speech. I cant force Chloe to have feelings that just arent there.Meanwhile we KNOW Warren is crazy about Max. He tries very hard to get together with her and organize little fun activitiesdates but hes not pushing her faster than shes comfortable with. Theres nothing too wrong with Warren on paper. Im not saying hes my silver medal or anything but theres no reason not to try a relationship with Warren personal playertoplayer preferences aside.But Im not  sure I even want Max to be in a relationship by the time this is all over.  Regardless of how WE feel Max is going to be recovering from whatever terrors JeffersonNathanBig Bad Evil Guy will be putting her through in the final chapter.  Shes also either just barely saved a friend from suicide or shes been right there to see her jump.  And lets not forget the guilt she must be feeling about savingrekilling William and her choice to make that timeline eternally unavailable for herself.  All this adds up to a huge pile of trauma.  This isnt the right emotional space for someone to start a relationship in.,lifeisstrange,cuv09qk,2,t5_32tf7

Lets talk about the internet points. You do realize that your argument about posting stuff on forums for internet points makes little sense as the only purpose behind this mechanics is to tell you how much people liked and disliked your post. There are only two reasons you would post something on a social website you want to make people feel good or you want them to feel bad. Whenever you post something here and it gets an audience you will get rewarded with points and this is how people communicate to you about how your content made them feel the karma points are just a simplified communication tool limited to one possible input. Naturally you will want to receive as much positive points per post as possible as that means that you made a lot of people just a tiny bit happier today. In another scenario where you want to hurt people with your posts you would want as much negative points per post as possible. The total amount of karma points communicates to everyone including yourself how much people like you around here. Putting everything I said in a rational perspective one would logically conclude that everyone that publicly participates in social networks is farming some kind of points likes karmas thumbs up votes etc. if he werent he would not be participating in an interactive way with the community. Thats the whole point of social interaction the exchange of positive intentions reddit externalises that as karma points. Youre trying to make the OP feel bad about being a healthy interactive part of the reddit community congratulations!,lifeisstrange,cv5ahht,1,t5_32tf7

If the journey sucks you might not get where youre going at all no matter how appealing the destination might sound. But if the journey is good and Id argue Life is Strange qualifies as an excellent adventure then even if the destination is disappointing at least we still had a good time getting there.Ill also add that if any ending to any story upsets us then we should examine why the creators did what they did and how rather than judge a piece of fiction solely on whether it was wholly satisfying or not. If what they do doesnt make sense its a bad ending. If what they do makes sense its a good ending. If what they do makes sense and it hits the feels satisfyingly its a great ending.,lifeisstrange,cvyksk5,1,t5_32tf7

Whats she been doing? What does her being alive add to the story? I think its better for the story if she actually is dead. I just think it hits a lot harder. Moving on I think that someone is going to have to die. Maybe Chloe actually very likely Chloe. She has died several times or been seriously injured it seems like the universe has it out for her. I have no idea how the storm ties into all this but you know the butterfly effect change one thing such as saving Chloe and things spiral out of control.

5434565,0,t1_cw64j3b,Because the let my decisions mean something ending isnt a fair representation either. People want the relationships they built with the other characters to mean something which they most assuredly do not if the town is wiped out by a magical F tornado and everyone dies.Essentially the game forces you to choose between erasing your decisions or erasing the people with which you made them. Either way the player loses.,lifeisstrange,cw6bj86,2,t5_32tf7

5434769,0,t1_cw6a130,more on that point in the barn youd find they knew some hundred years already that these storms? were about to happen if someone is so dumb to stay out in the open.. isnt that like a thing in USA?Also yes the storm was there at the start of the game before I woke up in the class for the first time no way not interfering would help that. Also with this experience I cant picture Max just looking next time someone is dying if its about some accident.. I dont know I was thrilled at first but yes it couldve been  longer more story more character development so that the choosing would be harder at least for me. I didnt went through the game just to let her be dead after that  I hate this kinda approach everywhere movies stuff.. bam you just wasted a lotta time and it basically wasnt worth it.edit otherwise classic. The paradoxes time stuff in general is that complicated that it cant be handled reasonably well. At about the third into this episode five I was like dont F it up dont get lost in it and to be honest they did. To be fair time travel rarely in any story.. makes sense ,lifeisstrange,cw6ch3w,1,t5_32tf7

5436295,0,t3_3phivr,Thing that annoyed me the most even though I fking cried like a bitch at one point was this idea that our timetraveling was the cause of the tornado. It made no sense to me I mean warren kind off shuffels around this idea of it at the diner but in that moment Im like the fk is wrong with you Warren thats retarded and I didnt really belive the game was going in that direction until the very last choise where the game litteraly tells you thats how it is. Maybe if that idea had been warmed up to me abit more I would have been less whatthefkie about the ending but it was still a very black and white nonchoise ending. The series as a whole though is one of the best games Ive ever played and Im planning on doing another playthrough of it real soon. Im stoked!,lifeisstrange,cw6jhin,4,t5_32tf7
5436542,0,t3_3pgcy7,Well... I think its Max if you pick bae over bay... the butterfly was just the launching pad.,lifeisstrange,cw6kmby,1,t5_32tf7
5436600,0,t1_cw6khoe,And thats bad gameplay writing and just shitty overall.Whether you agree or disagree with the choices if its there it should be worth it.If not whats the point? Just to say hey we gave you a choice between a good ending and us saying fuck you. Dont complain.I get it. You dont like that ending Chloe is selfish whatever. Its a bad ending yes. And thats fine make it a badshitty ending INSIDE THE GAME. dont punish the players outside of it because its not the ending you didnt want.Its like reading a book and then at the end the author gives you  choices go on an read the ending he wanted or look at a post it note that says heres that other ending fuck you. Theres a difference between making a choice have bad consequences and making a choice make the whole ending shitty in gameplay storyline and storytelling.Imagine that Dontnod wanted pricefield to be real and they didnt like WarrenMax. Imagine what would happen if in the end you get  choices Be with Chloe its all good they live happily ever after.orMax kisses warren neither of them show any emotion they dont laugh cry or love it just cuts to black. Thats your ending.Thats shitty writing storytelling and gameplay.Theres a difference between making morally bad endings and just outright shitty ones.,lifeisstrange,cw6kvxf,1,t5_32tf7
5436940,0,t1_cw6m5zr,No you cant say for sure that everyone dies but again I really do think that Dontnod implying deaths and showing all of the destruction does imply that almost everyone in the town died as a result of the tornado.I mean either way theres no way of telling  she either never meets Jefferson or we never see her on screen.,lifeisstrange,cw6mg5h,2,t5_32tf7
5437387,0,t1_cw61lum,I could also see her doing it as an act of permanence. the whole game is based around going back and changing things because you changed your mind. that turned out to be the source of the problem at hand so I could see why Max would tear the photo. ,lifeisstrange,cw6ohwi,3,t5_32tf7
5438104,0,t1_cw6qp83,So two things come to my mind when looking at those situations  the events of the game arent limited to one instance of a timeline.  Maybe theres a grouping of things and what Max is experiencing is other versions of herself in other timelines and what they see.  This causes events of the timelines to start overlapping as Max kind of merges with herself.  i.e. Herself that that is current and herself that is at the roof with Kate.  Max isnt rewinding time but transitioning to another phase of herself in another parallel which causes physical havoc on her body.  So instead of going forward and back shes going diagonally.  Then again this means the ending is Max finally arriving in one universe where she has a chance of being with Chloe.  I dont know a good way to explain this but I kind of think of this theory like this.  There is a fixed point in time call it the origin.  Maxs interactions pivots around this origin and her path forward her timeline is the resulting linear formula of sorts.  So the changes we make in the past creates a secondary point for which the universe utilizes the regress out a new timeline.  Things we change augments the a in that aXb formula that creates a timeline.  So with the timeline as a linear line it goes through a  dimensional set of all possibilities. Imagine a cube made of an infinite amount of points each point an event in time.  Maxs actions keep placing her in the subset of that infinite cube where all possibilities are plotted that creates such events. In this theory a normal human would experience a normal horizontal line not diagonal which is why events between the timelines for Max seem the same because then each imaginary plane in the infinite cube of time must also contain groupings of possible events..  Okay Im rambling at this point but this is so much fun because the game could inspire such craziness... There are two layers to this game.  The game layer which is what happens ingame and the player layer which is what we perceive.  Kind of like having a constant metaphor.  Max only ever acknowledges the deer once and Samuel identifies it as her spirit animal.  But we as players see it constantly.  So its much less of an indicator for Max than really an indicator for us who are controlling Max. I know Im kind of circling your points and I really dont mean to but at the very end all I can say is that theres just not enough there to form any competent ideas.  All I can do is speculate.  To the point of her nightmares though I think thats the only place that seems slightly more out of place than others.  Its really hard to pinpoint in them what situations they exactly stand for other than just the incoherent ramblings of a brain that has gone through multiple timelines.  We could say that on the inside Max feels guilt but I think theres something else at play and here is where I think we should look at more closely to figure out of there is a universal agent here messing with Max or just Max.  ,lifeisstrange,cw6rs9l,2,t5_32tf7
5438143,0,t3_3peyj6,While I was happy we get the option to save Chloe it felt like you get rewarded letting her dieThe town ending is  minutes longer has kisses and i love yous a new location group shots and closure with the butterfly it starts end ends with it.While the other ending is just so...empty.They could have just let the kiss there and show surviving characters cleaning up the town while chloe and max drive off.,lifeisstrange,cw6ryp8,10,t5_32tf7

5439168,0,t1_cw6wi7q,That variation I thought about but doesnt make any sense either. If Im Death why would I use a big ass tornado to kill Chloe. All I gotta do is wait till shes asleep and send her a murderer or burn her house down with an electrical problem. I just dont think the writers were going for this angle and even if they were it wont explain the beginning of the game.You literally begin WITH the storm BEFORE you saved Chloe and know you can rewind time.

5441327,1,t1_cw7521o,I can understand that feeling. At the same time throughout the story your choices mattered in various ways that were for the most part more prominent than in other games within the genre. Compare this to a Telltale game and the choices matter far far more.I can accept that other people did not feel satisfied by this ending. What has become more obvious is that most of what people want is not actually better. Which has pushed me more in the direction of being happy with what we got. ,lifeisstrange,cw76kvc,2,t5_32tf7

5442190,0,t3_3plcsa,Joke aside...my personal experience in case anyone wonderedWhen I just finished I thought it was a great ending Save Bay. Not flawless I wanted more epilogue and was sad that nothing Max did happened regarding other characters not her selfdevelopment. But I really enjoyed the whole experience and wanted to see what others thought.I came here and now that there are several disappointment reactions and critical feedback I reasoned how the episode was probably rushed and left incomplete. I dont want to recite everything I read you probably know what I mean with major faults but now I feel deeply conflicted between what I experienced with the game and what I reflected with the discussion here.I should have waited a month or something now I have these two conflicting ideas about Episode . Things were easier when I could just finish a game and move on...I still love the game overall but now I cant make up my mind about the ending and the aftermath of the story.TLDR the title also represents my own feelings towards the episode,lifeisstrange,cw7ajj6,2,t5_32tf7

5445457,0,t3_3pmrfn,gtRemember when she first went back to Jeffersons room when she submitted the contest photo Won comforted Kate and texted David? Yeah she didnt even use her rewind once yet the storm still happened. She did use her rewind though to get escape the Dark Room and get to that point. Its the same as her using a picture to rewind to when William was alive or any other time she used a picture to rewind. When we rewinded to William to save him and then returned to present Alttimeline Max whales still died which means supernatural stuff still happened which might as well lead to the storm even in the alternate timeline.After handing Jefferson that photo she or at least her autopilot persona probably went to the bathroom to save Chloe right away seeing as Chloes alive after that scene to call Max to tell her about the storm while she was still in San Francisco.In my mind the logic behind it is that Chloes fate was the first thing Max changed and so everything that happens subsequently are all based around that change. The original timeline wasnt in fact original because imo most of that timeline was based on the idea of Chloe being alive. Had Chloe been dead like in the BayOverBae ending things would unfold a LOT differently. It might as well be a completely different timeline completely different from the one we lived in since the start of the episode.,lifeisstrange,cw7pk3l,1,t5_32tf7

5454405,0,t3_3pptzj,Personally I would very much love the option to have DLC be made as I am always one for a new addition to a storygame I love. I am however not sure whether I would like to see this DLC take place post game or moreso take place in a prequel about Chloe and her time with Rachel Amber Like playing as Ellie in her DLC from The Last of Us as we players got a glimpse of her past through her eyes I think being able to play as Chloe would be awesome and to see her background story too as well as being able to visit her past days with Rachel before her dissapearence would be pretty interesting as we never really got to know Rachel through a first person perspecive and rather always third person if you will in which they only really ever described her as being both yin and yang. To actually see Rachel speak move and interact with Chloe as well as her environment would be a very cool experience that I personally would enjoy as I would like to get to know more about her seeing as she played a major role within the game itself. ,lifeisstrange,cw8uou9,2,t5_32tf7

At most theyd be acquaintances. Max was living in Arcadia Bay for what a month before the events of the game? Sure both are ecstatic to see each other when Chloe picks her up in the parking lotand who wouldnt be? but that wont last. Theyd eventually drift apart because of their two completely different lifestyles. Chloe is some punk stoner dropout who deals with shady people and Max is a loner hipster with  friendIn Arcadia Bay but she doesnt seem to have many in Seattle either who wants to be accepted by any and everyone. gtMax returns to her life at Blackwell presumably still bullied and excluded by the Vortex Club as the events that lead to her and Victoriaeveryone else becoming friends never happenedI wouldnt be so quick to assume that. Victoria shows up at Chloes funeral and there are only two reasons shed be there. She feels partially responsible for her death or shes there because of Maxwhich is what I think is the reason. And we know from conversations with other people and Victoria herself she would actually like to be friends with her. So I doubt shed continue to pick on her after Chloes death.

5474023,0,t3_3q1ag6,I feel the same way about it as you do. DONTNOD have convinced is through their art that these are realistic characters worthy of our emotional attachment and with the conclusion of the story we are faced with their deaths as actively portrayed people. This is hard enough to deal with in books and movies but this new medium has severely upped the ante and as a result some of us in the audience are having to learn to deal with the conclusion any conclusion really in a new way and perhaps a more real way like the death of a friend. If we feel betrayed or let down or conflicted about the events of the plot we still have to honor the exceptional work done to make us feel this way. That were dealing with anything emotional at all is outrageously special.,lifeisstrange,cwbcw3f,3,t5_32tf7
5475553,0,t1_cwbi78d,Because not ONLY One thing happens as a result of destiny being broken. MANY Things will happen. The storm was one of them and there were many others. It makes perfect sense.

5477381,0,t1_cwbgbtr,Because Chloe had to die at a point where Max hadnt been fudging around with time already before that I suppose I dont really know what to think of this theory. In the AU timeline she messed it around by saving William so the Bathroom scene never happens and in the original timeline when Chloe is killed by Jefferson shes already been through the past few days using her powers to change things and saved Chloe initially. So Chloe dying either of those times makes no difference as the storm was set in motion.BUT if you argue that above you can argue that Max went back to the time of lecture after seeing Chloe die the first time so wouldnt the above not work letting her die. She answered Jeffersons questions correctly etc. though she never technically altered anything drastic at that point so you could also argue she hadnt altered time drastically at this point and it was still essentially the same timeline.Sorry if my wording is confusing Im really bad at explaining time travelling stuff.,lifeisstrange,cwbsbv8,1,t5_32tf7

5483743,0,t1_cwc2elp,gtOk... Various things here. I still think Max has no excuse for not pressing the alarm  it doesnt require her to go outside the photo or time boundaries.Future Max is still in control at the time of Chloes death. Future Max refuses to press the alarm she just sits in the bathroom all huddled up feeling miserable while she allows her best friend to die. Its not until she leaves the photo that Maxthe new Max from the alternate timeline created by future Max which Future Max perceives as a kind of autopilot moderesumes control at which point given the way the events unfold one of three things must occur Max loses her powers. Max snaps out of it realizes Chloe is dead but cannot rewind far enough to save her. Some fragment of Future Max intention remains and Max knows that she let this woman die for a reason even if she doesnt know what on earth that reason could possibly be. Ill admit that the third point is the weakest the first point is never established and the second point which makes the most sense kind of makes me question the way that Maxs timestreamjumping powers operate in the first place. We know that when Max goes into the past using a photograph she can see anywhere she could reasonably have seen in threedimensions from the point at which the photo was taken. What we dont know is how long she is able to remain anchored in space. As it is every time she goes back via one of her photos she goes back to change something and remains until the opportunity to change it has passed. This leads me to wonder can she remain anchored to a photograph longer than she can rewind?  If so then its conceivable that upon leaving the photo and going into autopilot Chloe would be dead and Max would not be able to rewind in time to save her. gtYoure also suggesting that how much Max alters the timeline is significant but Im not sure that makes sense. I believe that the reality in which William lived and Chloe was crippled and condemned to a long slow death was significantly different from the reality in which William did not die and Chloe was not crippled. I am not willing to make the same claims about the reality in which Max lets Chloe die the only claim I can make about this is that it is the first time Max changes something.gtEveryone alters the course of events just by acting. The fact that Max has knowledge of the future cant be helped. Well if she acts on the knowledge she has of the future e.g. by saving Chloe from a bullet by texting David with knowledge she could not possibly have possessed by berating Victoria and possibly stopping Kates video from going viral by saving William then the reality which unfolds as a result is different from the reality which would have unfolded if she had not acted on her knowledge of the future. If the storm is a result of Chloes power then it doesnt seem inconceivable to me that going back to the point in time when she first uses her power would resolve her manipulations of spacetime.  gt...she burns the photo and says something different to Chloe. That alteration of the timeline is irreversible.Huh. Now heres a paradox if Max goes back to a point in time before she first uses her powers and she alters the timeline in such a way that the events which would have caused her to go back to the day of Williams death never occur did she still go back to the day of Williams death? Or in that reality since she never went back never chose to let William live and thus never had to go back a second time...is it possible that its as if she never went back at all? gtAs for whether the tornado is still coming in the alt timeline I noticed there is a newspaper article about the whales and Max says this is just a warning of the tornado to come. So thats a pretty clear hint! Hah. Good catch! Yeah point taken I guess?gtWell done Max for being so sure it was coming and not alerting anyone to the potential danger. After the other freak occurrences some people would definitely have believed her.Yeah so much this. She had so many chances to warn people about the storm.

And when the realized that shes been ripping up time like dogs rip newspaper shes given the convenient choice to walk back and solve her problems with a single warp.

If Chloe is to die which is a perfectly reasonable option then let her death fix few things but not all let the chaos youve sown be a reminder of your failures.Again I follow the thread that Dontnod unraveled.

If Chloe had been some kind of stereotypical blonde with perfect family and home life it would be quite dull IMO?Anyway  youre entitled to your opinion  I just dont agree. ,lifeisstrange,cwfm9sa,5,t5_32tf7

The key word is character growth.She starts off being very mean rude rebellious and shows her bad behavior all the time.  When she argues with Joyce the closet situation the call everything with David  But she regrets everything and is sorry for what she has done.Shes still the same girl we saw in the past with William but upset because of the death of her father and the disappearing of Rachel and Max. She went through a lot and has a weird way to process it. The new Max brought her back to happiness.She went from Lets turn this place to glass to People deserve to live more than me. Thats something I really liked about her even though I wasnt that much on the Chloe hype train.

DigitalFoundry did an excellent indepth analysis of the game and performance and I highly recommend checking it out.Im not saying The Witcher  is a bad game. I never did and if people honestly get that from what Im saying then I have no other way to dumb this all down.

5570984,0,t1_cwniiag,Hmm... well I see it in two ways. With mindreading only it becomes a matter of our protagonist being judge and jury of thoughtcrime. She can choose to help or condemn people based on their thoughtseven deeply suppressed thoughtsrather than their actions. In the name of some elusive greater good she can dig deep into someones past into their childhoods into shameful thoughts they want no one to see. Some players will have no compunction about digging into the brains of their fictional videogame friends some may think twice. But the amount of falselyobtained information and the web of lies she has to maintain is a precarious house of cards. This is I admit more nuanced and less overthetop than time travel or mind control but Im okay with that.. Adding in mind controls makes thing more interesting sure. At what point is it simply giving a friend a helpful idea or brainwashing your friend into liking you at all? And having the moral conundrum upandcenter to me makes it just fine. I see not reason not to question the protagonists morality. I mean say she forcefully mindbends a criminal into a good person. Was that morally just? Was that just expediting the process the criminal was going through already? Was it justified in that it benefited society at his personalitys expense? At what point will your friends simply... back out out of fear that they dont know which thoughts are yours and witch are theirs?My issue with mind control is that it may be too powerfulnot in gameplay sense I mean in the playerrelatingtotheprotagonist sense. And for dialogue trees well I guess thats part of it you carefully move through the conversation trying to show you dont know too much because you DO know too much.

5645926,0,t1_cwwb6fd,It does seems like there was waffling about the cause of the tornado but I like it being a result of Maxs power messing with timenaturespacetime continuum or something. The two moons both out of focus like she is during rewinds worked really well to show how creating these alternate realities might be wearing out the fabric of time. It doesnt exactly follow why that creates a tornado but it keeps the main conflict about Max her powers and her relationship with Chloe.The plot hole I wanted to be filled in was the ways other people in town seem to be into something supernatural that has to do with Maxs power if not her directly and the apocalyptic natural events. Before we learned about Jeffersons photography career I thought Rachel Ambers disappearance was some weird larger sacrificial thing touching on . The glyphs totems weird messages the rather ubiquitous Trust No One which I took to heart following Ep.  . Franks blood oath thing whatever that was about . Vortex club seeming like a Rosemarys Babytype cult . Twin Peaks references. Now that Im thinking about it there does seem to have been a shift in explaining all that. We might chalk it up to the same problem Twin Peakshalf of all horror movies have Weve thrown a bunch of creepy stuff in the airhow do we resolve it now??? but Dontnod had the whole thing planned out beforehand. I suppose the only real feedback from fans that might have influenced them was the Pricefield love but honestly that would have been unavoidable no matter where they took the story.,lifeisstrange,cwwxjrz,1,t5_32tf7

5675235,0,t1_cx0jz0v,I loved that early part of the episode stuck in the bunker I kind of wish it was possible to actually fail the game I think that would have been pretty cool to have the EXTREMELY shitty ending exist where Max has driven away anyone who might have helped not sticking up for David leads to him crying in a motel unable to think of helping catch Jefferson so you are saved by Frank unless he is struggling with the loss of Pompidou or else he has been shot or stabbed in which case he is too injured but if hes not too injured he puts  and  together and figures out what that delivery of heavy shit out to the boondocks was and finds you there but if youve driven both of them away noone knows where Max is and Max lives out her last minutes slowly losing grip on consciousness and being less lucid as whatever Jefferson injects her with takes effect reflecting on the time she spent with Chloe and how badly they fucked up.But beyond that the endings are fine for what they are... its just whether or not you think the nightmare sequence was useful I really dont think it was necessary to have it since it felt like they were building to something cool with the Prescotts but sold all that short since they felt the episode needed more time yes some parts of the nightmare sequence are important that inner dialogue Max has was about the only good part of it but it feels like they skimped on more ending content for it what has Shaun Prescott got to do with this? why do they know the storm is coming? what is the big Prescott family secret? How was Jefferson able to convince them to build a storm bunker that is actually stocked with storm supplies as well as incredible amounts of photography equipment? and why do the decisions not actually affect the outside world in the end all those things Ive done are either dead with the people in the town or dead with the time that vanished and either way that is not a good way to end a game if you actually suggested endings based on how we play hell I would have been happy if the final choice was made by Max based on how we played like the final bit of control we have over her slips away at the end say a certain closeness to Chloe would save her and a certain distance or closeness to the town would save the town...,lifeisstrange,cx0khlb,4,t5_32tf7

5776236,0,t1_cxd2mpi,gt When he asks her out she writes I hope he doesnt make a movie on me.Which is in ep . From that point onwards he kinda comes up big every time he gets the chance.gtBut we who are privy to her constant thoughts and diary musings see no evidence of her even thinking about Warren at all.From then onwards her diary entries are pretty focused on the specific stuff that keeps happening and not how she feels about life in general.gtWhen she seems to suddenly warm up to the idea of them together it comes totally out of the blue.Eh he turned me around by the end of the game as well. He turned up and helped out when Nathan was being an ass twice over and then spent his time manning up and trying to help people by searching for first aid supplieshelping Joyce in general when the storm was getting crazy as shit in ep  while pretty much every other character their age was either out doing stupid shit and getting themselves killed unless Max fixes it or just in full on panic mode.Showing that youre able to stand up for yourself and that youre dependable as fuck when the apocalypse comes knocking on your door are two pretty decent ways to wash off that harmless nerd tag and take a step out of the friend zone.I tried to set him up with Brooke for the first twothree or so episodes because I didnt think it was wise to put another person in danger just to get some action but he convinced me and thus my Max otherwise by the end of the game.Hes pretty much the opposite of Chloe nerd and dependable instead of rock and... issues is the kindest word I can use to describe her mental state so I can see why Pricefielders dont really get it in that regard.,lifeisstrange,cxd3h62,2,t5_32tf7

5797847,0,t1_cxfrvlh,I agree there is no confirmation about it but the ending when you decide to sacrifice chloe makes it look it that way. I feel the storm is the physical explanation and visualization of the inevitability that is life. It will always happen no matter what. Thats why i am not really upset about decisions earlier not changing the actual outcome later Something people new to storytelling games that dont like it cause ending dont seem to know or just dont care about. Its what you do and experience in the way to the end and not the end that determines if it was good. Thanks for the compliment on the english and i really like your analogy.

5877833,0,t3_3vrtq6,I really hope you dont get a lot of hate from people misunderstanding this post. I know you dont have any bad intentions at all.As a female I pretty much agree. A lot of us have a deeper sense in friendship that we tend to express therefore it grows even further because the other person is aware of how fond we are of them resulting in them showing us how they are fond of us in return. Whereas a lot of guys tend to hold back how much they appreciate their malefriend most of the time. Not to say that all are like that but its unfortunate that they feel the pressure and need to be more masculine about it.But the thing is the world is changing. Theres a significant difference now and a decade ago. Media and art like Life is Strange is influencing people and helping them realize that they should show their love and care towards someone they are close to regardless of gender age and race. Its human nature that we must practice outside this game in general.As for Max and Chloe they have this established friendship to where they dont really hold back much however you can see from their tone and expressions that they still kind of do hold back and get shy when it comes to flirting or in scenes where romance is becoming a possibility EP SPOILERSs like the pool scene and the dared kiss scene. Its pretty amazing how their deep friendship can turn into one of the most beautiful love between two people not just because they are females if you just let them. Thats why people love them together and accept them even if itd be a homosexual relationship its apparent and the progression balances out well even if they are crossing the friend gt romance chasm. The chemistry and sexual attractiontension floats around the theme of friendship with Max and Chloe.,lifeisstrange,cxq46hw,53,t5_32tf7

5886226,0,t1_cxr1nqf,Brilliantly put EXSource.Of course the games complex choicebased narrative does boil down to one binary set of options at the end but not in a reductive way by any means.Your choices and experiences in the previous episodes do matter as you said in your and Maxs emotional journeys. They define what kind of person Max is what kind of person Chloe is the friendships or enemies youve made how dear Chloe is to you and whether she or Arcadia Bay are worth saving.Your previous choices infuse the limited final choice with emotional weight and responsibility.Moreover and heres something Im surprised more people arent talking about the final choice in Episode  is consistent with the rest of the game balancing power with powerlessness.Maxs time manipulation abilities are an elegant metaphor for how most of us feel when were teenagers. Teens think they can take over the world and do anything but are almost always held back by rules anxieties social expectations and plain luck.Maxs rewind ability allows her to bend reality and change destinies but even then her reach is limited.There are times when her power fails on her she had to help Kate down from the roof without her powers or is inadequate to help someone she couldnt stop Chloe from pushing her away at the end of Episode  or prevent Chloe from getting shot at the end of Episode  or try as hard as she might cant negate certain outcomes that MUST occur namely Williams death for the sake of Chloes life.The fact that Chloes averted death which is a fixed point in time caused the tornado is another example of Maxs rewind ability a form of control causing something beyond her control. This is a great metaphor for our actions getting away from us.These limitations in her powers have been used to boost tension and effectively set up big emotional moments throughout the game.This blackandwhite choice at the end of Episode  was foreshadowed from the very beginning and is another example of Maxs rewind powers an ultimate medium of choice leading her to an event she MUST face and cannot back away from.I think Life Is Strange ended beautifully.And you dont HAVE to sacrifice Chloe if you dont want to. Its the CHOICE that was foreshadowed from the start not necessarily the DEATH.Im glad you know whats up about the final choice EXSource.  Cheers.,lifeisstrange,cxr7ulh,4,t5_32tf7

Max the girl who can bend time and space whos been making decisions for everyone throughout the story comes to the point where Chloe takes her future in her own hands.Going back through the game its striking how much our time with quadriplegic Chloe is a microcosm for the whole story right down to her last words to Max.  One of the biggest frustrations she mentions is not having any power over her futuregtChloe At least you have a choice. When you want to make a decision you can just do it. ...

5991287,0,t3_3xiuv8,The characters I cant think of another game that had their characters done in such a great way after a while once you speak to them their outer shell breaks down and they actually felt like people ones who have flaws and problems of their own which I dont think games do enough they usually  have characters focused around certain traits that dont get expanded on as much.Also the topics depression loneliness anxiety and fear of loss. These are things that almost  everyone goes through and the way they touched upon everything was amazing which is why its so hard to forget.Last of Us is the closest I feel has come to this but Life is Strange just felt more alive.,lifeisstrange,cy4zlq8,7,t5_32tf7

Season  of TWD was one of my favorite games of all time and at the very least my favorite story game of all time but after LiS its been dethroned albeit barely. With recent Telltale titles my faith in the company has waned a bit as the overall quality of their games has gone down a bit with Season  of TWD being a disappointment not a big one but still nowhere near as good as it could have been but LiS proved that Dontnod has the writing chops needed to exceed anything Telltale can do.

6124472,0,t1_cyl8mpo,I completely agree saving Chloe is selfish but you cant say other people who saved the bay were not emotionally invested. these are two totally different things.I like you chose to save Chloe and even then I knew it was the selfish thing to do. But how is Max who had gone through so much to save other people from the great and small with and without powers not at all justified in saving Kate circumstantial of course! the tramp circumstantial  and umpteen others! I found childrens colouring in pics near the diner during the storm and the voice actor needs a pat on the back. Her oneliner nailed it! Max was mortified for the children of the town! If you think players were not emotionally invested if  when they decided not to sacrifice all this then I do believe you may be much less emotionallyinvested in Maxine than you think Im afraid.However I do have to ask where did you come by information that the doe was Rachel and so on... Is this your own take on it or was this announced by DontNod somewhere. Hope it wasnt in the game cause Ive bleeding played it enough and itd be shameful I missed it unless it was from all those optional pictures  didnt bother with them as I really cant be bothered running around after achievements. ,lifeisstrange,cylseju,1,t5_32tf7

6200078,0,t1_cytyi7b,Ok but sit down first because it goes from  to  real quick.I dont have any making of photos so its going to be long an confusing.The base is made up of two of these profiles facing each other with mm plywood as spacers for the mm plexi sheets. The resulting tunnel at the bottom accommodates the LED strip. Originally I wanted to use RGB LEDs but instead opted for something more unconventional. I printed colored rectangles onto transparency film with a regular printer and used those to make each frame light up in different colour. Heres some pics.As for the image itself I extracted the frames from this animation and engraved them at work.You can make this  ways.  Step  Ignore everything and go to method B.Heres what you need in method A the one I did   xmm pine board. Basically a stick. Tablesaw with tiltable blade Router not the Linksys kind laser cutter mm  thick plexiglass mm thick plywood board   amp  grit sandpaper wood filler paste spraypaint white LED strip w transformer not the Optimus kindIn this version that obviously anyone can do s you just use the tilted  tablesaw to give the outer edge a slight bevel then a handheld  router to route out the tunnel. From here its basically the same as method BMethod BThis is basically the blueprint on how to make edgelit anything at home. Like this I made for a friend as a Christmas gift.Heres what you need in method B   xmm and xmm sticks. saw A good quality image of what you want to engrave mm thick plywood board or popsicle sticks   amp  grit sandpaper wood filler paste spraypaint white LED strip w transformer not the Optimus kindStep  Look at this. This is what youre making.  Step   Find a place website that does laser engraving and explain them your vision including how you want it cut and of what material and thickness. Theyre literally everywhere and work cheap.  Step  While waiting for your stuff to be engraved take a trip to LowesHome Depot and harass the shit out of the employees until they find you what you need.  Step  Measure your freshly engraved plexi glass and cut the wood to desired length.  Step  Glue the x to the x as shown above. You should end up with something similar to the profile I showed in the very first image.   Step  Cut the spacers to size so they fit as shown but overhang a tiny bit on top and glue them to one of the sides making sure the plexi fits between them.  Step  Glue the two sides together but remove the plexi first in case its still between the spacers.  Step  After you made sure the glue is dry wrap the  grit sandpaper around a block of wood a small box or some thin that you can hold in your hand and carefully  sand down the overhanging spacers on the top.   Step  Were going to need to make endcaps and a base. Cut or sand down the ends making sure theyre flush. At this point you can improvise. Either buckle up and cut the endcaps from the plywood board or find something easier to cut like a plastic card. Once the endcaps are glued in place sand their edges down. At this point you have to cut an opening to the LED wiresplug. This is situation dependent cant help you here. Do the same with the base but dont glue it well need to put in the LED strip first.  Step  At this point you should have complete albeit rough looking lightbox. Now take the  then  grit sandpaper and sand the everliving fuck out of your box.   Step  With a straight edge knife apply the filler paste wherever you see surface marks holes or cracks. Smooth it out but dont make the paste paper thin.  Step  Using the  grit sand the paste down once its completely dry. Once more sand the everliving fuck out of the whole thing now with the  grit just for good measure.  Step  Spraypaint your masterpiece multiple times gently caressing it with the  grit between coats if surface roughnesses show up.  Step  Slide the plexi into the slot and stick the selfadhesive LED strip to the base. If it works glue the base to the rest and youre done.,lifeisstrange,cyuds2v,6,t5_32tf7

Theyre gonna make the sequels to The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones with all the characters deadalive and make a branching story line without compromising their Artistic Integrity. Look at any other developers that makes sequels to a beloved game. If a charactercharacters in a game are well received by fans the developers generally make a sequel based on those characters. The result? They make fans happy and they earn a lot more cash. If Dontnod makes Season  with Max and Chloe theyre gonna make hella cash. I hope they realize this.,lifeisstrange,cyv2bdm,3,t5_32tf7

6217502,0,t1_cywd1lq,gtWhich is the issue here. Not having a good name dehumanizes them. And makes discussion harder. Theres a reason naming an animal makes it harder to kill. Calling someone SOGirl is dehumanization. Which could make the final choice much less impactful.I already explained why its more of an impact. The person would never be called SOGirl except on the backend.. Youre grasping for straws.gtDesign from the ground up. In the early days of LiS we discusses how stereotypical some characters were. They bleed their personality. Even a skin swap is hard because Chloe has tattoos. Something which is technically against the bible. Making her as religious chick a little harder.Plenty of Christians with tattoos...gtI missed the entire part of my life where I care about music genres. I began listening to pop at  and still listen to pop  years later. I dont know much else about music. However the game portrays her as a punk. So I call her one.Thats on you.gtBut lacks a point for all the extra work.Not at all.gtWhich then contradicts you saying there is no different in plot. Again. Either its just a skin swap or you change half the universe in that prologue.I provided you with two different hypotheticals  Simple skinswapping what I wouldve done from the get go. Simple skinswapping nothing is changed.. SOGirl is still suspended whoever she is. That doesnt change the universe much. gtAnd i have an eye for stories in games. Hence why I mod rinteractive cinema. Its my favorite genre. And how does this make it more replayable? Same story same setting. Same people...Depends on what hypothetical were discussing. But yeaaaaah this is pointless to discuss. You feel one way thats fine. I feel another. Thats what makes the world grand differences in opinion. Im done discussing this though. I dont have to defend the idea. You can suggest that character swapping roles doesnt enrich the game all you want.. That simply isnt true.,lifeisstrange,cywd3a8,1,t5_32tf7

6233833,0,t1_cyy6w6c,gt COZ she hasnt accepted the a consequences of her actions.Its an odd sort of ending. If she goes back shes accepting she caused a lot of havok. If she doesnt shes pulling a Chloe and is blaming external forces for what happens. Theres lots of ways to look at it although I personally see it as giving up and admitting that she cant control her powers I also believe that the final rewind to kill Chloe causes her to lose her powers. Whereas in the Bae ending shes accepting that she cant control her powers yet. Theyre very similar endings with just slightly different changes. gtAlso There wouldnt be any automax and Chloe memories because THAT is the butterfly photo. It jumps right back to when Chloe was about to get shot in the bathroom. The one without a Max thinking Max abandoned her for  years.This may sound odd but I didnt play or have seen the Bay ending. I dont feel like crying that hard. That said Im looking at this photo as her not ripping it up after that. Since in the Bae ending she does rip it up. And that she would jump back and let Chloe live as her final act. Or when she gets bored with life who knows. ,lifeisstrange,cyy7w7d,2,t5_32tf7

It reduces Chloe to nothing more than a plot device to get Max from A to B.Thats certainly part of it but that doesnt mean there was no closure on Chloe. There certainly was. She has been developed. Shes realized the purpose DONTNOD set for her. Shes realized that people care for her. Shes seen her worth. Shes seen the good in the world. Shes not just sad and angry at the world anymore.

Other scenario could be the same but instead of only her falling down something else falls down time freezes rewinds she breaks her back depends of the fall the process gets quickly disturbed bam dead.

6380372,0,t1_czeduz2,To be fair that would kinda ruin the trauma. And could turn it into a kind of twisted happyish ending. Also DontNod are very antisuicide. IIRC they included antisuicide help lines at the end of EP when Kate does her thing. Keep in mind that we care for max. Her in the chair is sickening. Her bleeding from her nose and passing out makes us feel empathy. However her living without Chloe gives us more feelings than if they pulled a Romeo and Juliet. If youve ever played SOMA compare the endings pre and post credits. One makes it a Tragedy. The other a Heroic. Over in rSOMA some people dont like how the Heroic ending makes the game more light hearted. Others welcome it. If youve never played SOMA and dont want to then fine. Compare it to peoples perspectives of real life. Most religions have some form of afterlife and Max and Chloe would live for eternity together happy as fuck. And Atheism would go ahead and say since theres nothing after death neither would feel bad. So yeah. Max living in a life withought Chloe both opens up the ending for a sequel as well as fanartfanfiction expansions. ,lifeisstrange,czevoyb,3,t5_32tf7

6398212,0,t3_43auk2,gtI have an inkling that Dontnod crafted such a memorable experience because the final dilemma is impossible to completely resolve...Thats pretty much it no matter what youre not gonna find a happy ending because their isnt one all you can do is decide what youre willing to live with.I couldnt possibly separate Max and Chloe after that week together either. Theyd been through so much time and time again proving how deeply they cared for each other so to tear them apart afterwards I felt was beyond cruel.I dont agree that the death of AB would poison their future relationship though. One of the lessons that gets hammered in everyones head throughout the game is how damaging it is to hold onto your guilt and resentment. Chloe did just that and it took  years of her life from her that shell never get back it even led to her death. She was only able to move on and mature once she realized that holding onto it brought her nothing but pain.Same goes for Max. The guilt she lived with over leaving Chloe wasted  of her years as well. She became shy and reclusive letting her photographs live and speak for her. Once she was able to forgive herself both her and us saw just what she was capable of how strong of person had been hiding behind that guilt for so long.I feel like at that point they realized how important it was to make a choice and even if its one theyshe regrets they have to move on or risk being dragged back down to where they were.,lifeisstrange,czgwt01,30,t5_32tf7

6439373,0,t1_czlbvou,To sum up Chloe and Maxs relationship pretty simplyEpisode  Max and Chloe are estranged friends.Epsode  Max And Chloe are best friends.Episode   Max and Chloe are closer than friends. Determinant also Max explicitly states she likes Chloe so gaybi Max confirmed. Chloe would be confirmed except its an easily missed throwaway line in her room stated in a sarcastic manner.Episode  Max and Chloe are more than friends. Bi or gay Chloe confirmed. See what she says about Rachel to Frank if she gets angry or what she says to Max if you agree with her decision at the beginning. The feels.Episode  Max and Chloe are girlfriends or tried to be. If you do the right thing and you supported Chloe in major choices youll see it. If not and you didnt side with Chloe in major choices Max is still interested but doesnt think it will work out because Chloes not ready see her diary at the end. They still love each other though.Edit Yeah I went full team Pricefield there but theres just too much evidence for it to be ignored. Especially considering Maxs thoughts on Chloe and how regretful she is if she doesnt pursue her. And I totally missed it until Episode  its a slow slow relationship withlots of easily missed moments.

6456821,0,t1_czmuon2,They keep insisting that it was not due to lack of funds though. But that showing more would dilute the message. The message that you cant have a perfect life that in the end you had to make a trade off either you save Chloe or you save the Town. As soon as you start showing that people are alive you start trying to weigh the endings to see which one is better say you care a lot about ChloeWarrenKateJoyce if they showed all of them lived it would more clearly make it the better ending to you. Now it is an unknown which leaves you guessing you can think it either way but you cant help but feel guilty for if they are not alive.I would have liked to have seen who lives or dies regardless of diluting the message because to me having the story be fulfilling is more important then getting some message across.uRebootedShadowRaider As for the Kiss in the Bay ending their reasoning was that it was not the right moment for a kiss. In the bay ending it is a good bye forever. And the bae ending they will have a future together so kissing while their town was being the destroyed in the background seemed like the wrong thing to do. I do somewhat disagree with their reasoning mainly because I feel like Chloe needed to know why Max was picking her over the whole town. And showing that with the kiss would have been perfect. If you had gone the romantic route I would have liked it if it went like Chloe Max its time Max Im so sorry Chloe I cant do this I cant abandon you again I... Love you. followed by the kiss followed by her ripping up the photo and then the rest as it goes now. But that would just have been my preference.In the end no matter how unfulfilling the Bae ending might feel I would still never pick the other one. Simply because that one is nothing but tragic to me. I see no beauty in it as some people like to call it. All I see is Chloes whole progression being erased and nothing you ever did mattering. And Max being left as a broken person all alone and nobody to share the bs of that week with. If that was the route to take then Max would have been better off never having her powers. You can say she grew as a person but for every little bit she grew she got huge traumas that came a long with it that is not worth it at all.,lifeisstrange,czn6fj1,10,t5_32tf7

I cant imagine playing games that dont have Max and Chloe in them anymore and that thought makes me tear up I have no idea why I have a very strong character and almost never cry but this game broke me just like a sledge hammer into a glass heart. Every time I think that Ill only see those two characters in Life Is Strange and someday Itll get too repetitive I tear up. Even now while writing this I feel like the need to cry. All I do is listen to the songs that are in Life Is Strange and wait till the weekend to replay it and then I dont know. This game I dont know how THEY did it or WHAT they did but its truly supernatural how most of the people get so attached to the characters and almost no other game has anyone attach to the games characters as much as this one had.That said I could ramble even more how sad I am that this is the only game well see Max and Chloe and maybe Season  wont attach us as much but it wont help.

Lately Ive been internally debating whether we are supposed to believe that a single timeline or multiple timelines exist.  Ive been leaning towards the single timeline argument for awhile but Ive had trouble coming up with compelling arguments against multiple timelines.What you said would be true if Max created new timelines when she phototraveled.   Going back to the bathroom would create a storm timeline which would have to still end in a storm.  Since that doesnt happen I think we can rule out timeline creation via photo travel.

6814326,0,t3_493dk3,I think you only have a limited time window to change things like when max couldnt leave the house while saving Chloes dad so I think it would be a very major decision or something where a few words would make a worlds difference.If I was being selfish and didnt want to change anything id jump back to the last picture of me and my dad before he died. Id just cherish the moment and take a good look at his face and py attention to his voice in order not to lose the memories that now are fading.And if I wanted to try doing something id jump back to letting my best friend know how much i cared about him and try to talk him out of commiting suicide. I dont know if that would work or how that would change me and the relationships of those around me but i think its worth a try.,lifeisstrange,d0op960,19,t5_32tf7

Still one of the greatest moment in my gaming life you feel like you just saved a real person there... I know exactly what you mean most of the choices are really hard to make and Max constantly questioning them doesnt make it easier. DStill loving it that LiS is making you think that hard about all the choices because there are really no right or wrong choices it all depends on the player and on the players values.

I think that the explanation for Maxs powers carries a strong message as well.  Chloes story is a bittersweet lesson about dealing with personal loss.gtnot surprisingly at the final decision where she has to choose between Chloe and Arcadia Bay.Sorry I had to fix that for you. ,lifeisstrange,d0zd09i,9,t5_32tf7

7000002,0,t3_4bjwpu,Only the music part really changed for me. I already was a fan of episodic games and not a huge book reader. Im typically a poprock listener so the indietype music in LiS was a little different from what I usually listen to. But after playing the game and enjoying the music a lot I listened to the soundtrack and still do. Then I listened to some of the artists other songs from Syd Matters Foals Bright Eyes and Angus and Julia Stone. Angus and Julia Stones music stuck with me the most. Their album Down the Way has a similar tone to the music in LiS so I still listen to it from time to time.,lifeisstrange,d19slm4,1,t5_32tf7
7001006,0,t3_4bjwpu,It really did. First off the LiS licensed soundtrack has become daily music for me. I always listen to it before drifting off to sleep and Ill listen to it throughout the day as well. Cant get enough of it. Secondly I cant go back and listen to a lot of my old music before. It feels weird listening to the Daft Punk Mark Ronson Pharrell Williams Macklemore amp Ryan Lewis and whatever other albums that I used to listen to all the time now. Just cant go back. My music taste changed in the way that I felt I had to seek out new artists and new genres of music to listen to. Now Im a big fan of Fall Out Boy Panic at the Disco Halsey revived interest in Paramore and Lana Del Rey among others. I dont think theres any real rhyme or reason to it. As far as games are concerned I havent had the time to play very many games in the last six months. I tried diving back into some multiplayer shooters and some action games I used to love and play a lot of but they didnt feel that fun anymore. Felt like a chore. However I did have a really good time with the Uncharted  beta so maybe its like with the music and I just need something fresh. I also played Firewatch and I loved the shit out of it. Im also oddly more appreciative of movies these days. Ive always loved cinema but now I feel even more drawn to it. Dont know if theres any correlation. ,lifeisstrange,d19wphz,1,t5_32tf7

Now on to the questions  Which Daily Topic was your favourite? I liked a lot of them i cant just name oneWhich LiS moment was your absolute favorite? Its a tie with the pool scene and the morning scene in Chloes room from episode If you could rewind in real life how often would you use it and for what purposes? To be honest i wouldnt use it frequently only for emergencies like saving a family member or a best friend etc. And again good luck dude wish you all the best. ,lifeisstrange,d1cgp2y,11,t5_32tf7

7081047,0,t3_4ckbwy,Here is a list of clues I can remeber off the top of my head.  From the start in Episode  it is clear Chloe is at the very least bisexual and was in some sort of relationship with Rachel Amber.  And then it is implied that Rachel took Maxs place in Episode  so it didnt take me long to connect the dots to see that Chloe for some time was crushing on Max.  Depending on your dialog options on Episode  after the pool Chloe even admits to crushing on Rachel and even says I just dont think anyone is good enough for you except me of coarse.  She dares you to kiss her to be more adventurous and try new things  I dont know but if my bigay friend asked me to kiss them as an experiment that would be a pretty big clue they were into me.  When you pick the girls room at the pool Chloe says something like oh la la implying the choice of locker room was a subtle question of Maxs sexuality.  any time Warren texts or calls Chloe shoots you a jealous glance.  If you kiss Chloe she actually does text Warren to tell him he is barking up the wrong tree. If you side with Chloe enough she even changes her phone wallpaper to your picture.  I dont know if I would ever have a solo shot of just a friend as my wallpaper.  As others have said Max more or less spells out her feelings in the journal.  Now Im not sure of this changes if you go Ape with Warren and show him affection.  Im not sure Im a hardcore Pricefield shipper so I have never gone down that path.  ,lifeisstrange,d1j02jl,11,t5_32tf7

I think adding some audio cues would make each scene more emotional impact.I would like to see the scene when Maxine meets Chloe first time in the alternate timeline and how it transition to the beach scene. Also after Max saves Kate like them walking downstairs together.Some people theorize that photo hopping just creates new dimensions. If so I want to see some scenes that happen afterwards. Like in Alternate Timeline if Maxine chooses to euthanize Chloe imagine her waking up and seeing her doing that. And William and Joyce pop in.,lifeisstrange,d21vvxt,9,t5_32tf7

When Max goes back to the bathroom scene she arrives at a time when there is no alternate world created yet BUT she cant save Chloe because Nathan has a gun and would kill her.And with all the things she learnt during her journey she is able to change the future of the present past ...ok without creating a parallel world.

7831451,0,t3_4ml0r4,The developers hint in Episode  that Maxs power isnt infinite when she cant reverse time with Kate on the roof. This is brought up again in the last episode when shes time travels back to her room to take the original selfie. She starts getting weaker and nose bleedy or whatever. At that point I think it would have been too difficult for her to try and warn every single person in the town even if it is small.Correct me if Im wrong but I think at some point Max even mentions that her powers are not infinite or wont last forever. This seemed like a good failsafe the developerswriters included so there wont be any disappointment with the ending Heres looking at you Bioshock Infinite.,lifeisstrange,d3wbmfz,1,t5_32tf7
7841790,0,t3_4mljip,I only beat the game around a month ago and was fortunate enough to go in unspoiled. Ive been wanting to talk about it but getting thoughts down is hard. Ill give it a shot. I dont want a photo but I appreciate you helping this community to stay active even though the game came a while ago.I guess I love the game so much because it made me really feel something when I hadnt felt much of anything in a long while. Its so easy to just go through the day living a pleasant enough life without really feeling the highs and lows the world has to offer. Life is Strange is a rollercoaster of different emotions. And credit to the writers who made a  year old male care about the plights of an  year old hipster art student  two people who couldnt be more different.Despite its cliche high school setting and sometimes cringey dialogue the game really felt relateable. Max is a shy awkward introvert who gets amazing powers and... just kinda uses them to help people. She isnt a hero. We arent stopping bullets midair or reversing time to throw more punches. For the awkward introverts of the world it feels that much more realistic.The game covers dark themes. Theres not a single person who would guess after episode  that this game would feature EP Spoilerss Suicide assisted suicide watching someone find their dead lover etc.. It sucks you in with a happy High School intro and slowly descends into darkness. Which makes you appreciate the happy moments with Chloe that much more. As a whole the game will make you reflect on life the friends you left behind the memories you have the choices you made and the people you care about.I loved all the characters. Almost all of them are given a good amount of depth. EP Spoilerss David is a shitty abusive stepfather but also legitimately trying to help. We see how devastated he is when something happens to those hes trying to protect. Chloe is a sweet girl in a shitty situation with an honestly bitchy attitude at least at first. Its funny to read opinions of her online preepisode . We get such an amazing look at her life what she could be and how she ended up that way that we often forget how flawed she really is in the main timeline. The time rewinding ability really gave us such amazing insight into all the characters in a way that no other game can.The graphics werent bad low budget maybe but the voice acting and music choice really put the game over the top. The emotional moments just wouldnt be the same with other voice actorsactresses. The plot and pacing are top notch. Episode  in particular is just perfect from start to finish.So overall its just a really wellmade game that came to me at an interesting time in my life and really made me reflect on myself. Not too many games have done that. And after a month Im still thinking about this game nearly everyday. Im excited to do another playthrough soon!,lifeisstrange,d3xhhiw,2,t5_32tf7

Many people die because of a choice you made many days ago. And you have one chance to put it all back. The funeral scene from what I remember is very explicit in its depiction of a livelier healthier bay intersecting tragedy with beauty and death with healing.I feel that there is in fact a guarantee that killing chloe puts things back as the bay begins dying as soon as you save her and the universe immediately begins to try to kill her again.,lifeisstrange,d4ndc1d,2,t5_32tf7

Perhaps for most people that is normal and not an attempt to get max hooked on drugs but for me and max who dont do drugs or drink by choice that is really trying to get us hooked the act of offering itselfI have a feeling of connection to max in the sense that we value old friendships but chloe was really going in a wayward direction. And having her offer stuff like that even though knowing the same old max is like trying to get us hooked.But i know theres a lot of chloe can do no wrong fans here so I expect to be downvoted to oblivion.,lifeisstrange,d4tmy2u,1,t5_32tf7

A sequel to the first is unnecessary.I do however have several questions I want answered from the first. I think this depends on what choice you made in the end but for me since I chose to sacrifice Chloe I want to know how Max got along after that. Did she lose the power? Does she still have it but refuses to use it? Did she manage to avoid the psych ward I cant imagine anyone is psychologically stable after going through everything she did.  At the very least some answers would be nice. Maybe this could come out in a second game as Easter eggs by reading a newspaper or something. Or maybe the mystery is part of the fun.,lifeisstrange,d5350vm,2,t5_32tf7

8368964,0,t1_d5n87es,This was a weird post for me too because the more I thought about her relationship with Chloe I was surprised how more and more angry I got. I wasnt kidding when I said at the end I needed to get some air and chill lol. Maybe I need to reflect more on mom and me at some point heh. Real life is strange. I tried to think about Joyces reasons in all of it. I guess when I said Joyce moved on too quickly I was thinking about  things.The first is the period of time from Williams death to her marriage to David. It just seemed like a very short timeframe to allow for enough grieving. Of course grieving is relative to the person. So like we both mentioned Joyce is a survivor so maybe it was enough time for her. But it wasnt enough time for Chloe and it seems like Joyce kinda missed that point which leads me to...My second thing which I did a crap job of explaining was that as a mother I think she should have waited longer for her daughter. Youre right about love when shit happens boom. But Joyce still could have dated David for awhile and at least to Chloe kinda kept up a more casual front regarding him. It seemed to me that it should have been obvious to Joyce that Chloe was still really messed up about Williams death she was daddys girl after all. Introducing another fatherfigure while Chloe was still grieving was prolly not the best. Taking some time to be a mother to Chloe being available to her emotionally could have gone a long way for Chloe I feel. It also may have helped Joyce grow closer to her daughter and understand her more. Its like Joyce could see the Chloe was upset and hurting but after frustration just lumped it under Chloes rebellious nature. and it became easier and easier to write it off. What I wish Joyce would have seen is the truth Chloe really just wanted to feel like someone gave a shit about her. Youre right I did end up focusing more on Chloe I guess I was mad lol. The more I thought about it I realized how much of an impact Joyce had or could have had on her daughter. So I ended up referring to Chloe a lot because she defines a huge part of Joyce shes a mom.But yah Joyce did have a shit situation. William seemed really amazing and it probably crushed her a lot more than she ever let show. She prolly felt like she needed to be the strong one. There may have been financial worries too with only her paycheck. Maybe William had some kind of insurance but it probably wasnt enough. In either reality we see their household is always really strapped for cash.Another thought occurs to me too maybe Joyce felt like she needed to fill the father spot so her family could be healed and whole again. We know a strong family was so important to her and I really liked that about Joyce. But when we look at Chloe and William they both seemed like emotionaltypes and extremely close. Joyce I think was more the strongheaded type. She and David are a lot more emotionally alike that Joyce and William were.  Not that she wasnt loving or caring but I think when Joyce and Chloe needed shoulders to cry on it was Williams. Its like in the past if the  of them watched a sappy movie Id expect William and Chloe to maybe cry at the sad parts while Joyce might just shake her head and smile at them both. In the end Joyce did the best she could with an awful situation. I just kinda think she missed a few critical cues as a mom and it sucks cause I think she could have been a lot closer to her daughter if shed stepped back and looked at what was really going on.gt As a side note Im well aware that this particular topic can be focused from a very personal real place so if I offended you I apologize  Im just trying to spur discussion in an obnoxious all sides have a good point! way. If you dont want to respond I totally understand!Everything about this story has hit me on some personal level. Its one of the things I love and hate about it HA!But this is exactly one of the reasons I love your comments and posts also. Because of what you said you got me to realize a couple things about Joyce that I hadnt before. So thank you ,lifeisstrange,d5no5ri,2,t5_32tf7

Now she uses drugs white lines to take her back in time before whatever horrible thing happened to a place where she can forget her pain strips to pay for her habit  and the singer is an ex who talks about the woman locking herself in the bathroom probably to get a fix of drugs and how he lost her after that.I mean...I can see some connections based on the video but the actual story the song tells is pretty brutal although it certainly does fit with LiS plot. ,lifeisstrange,d6curb8,2,t5_32tf7

8704844,0,t3_4z5em1,gtWhat ending did you choose and why?I chose to save Chloe. I didnt do this out of any strong personal belief because I enjoy the Sacrifice Chloe ending heaps more because angst makes me stronger and also its more thematically complete. I chose to save Chloe because I thought it was a solid narrative in a sea of stories where time travel is evil not to mention that Max is getting hella PTSD with either ending so its probably better to give her the only person in the universe thats going to believe anything ever happened to her.gtHow do you feel about Jeffersons vision? Does anybody sympathize with him and think hes an artist?Theres a point where your vision goes too far. I dont sympathize with him.gtNathan do you pity him?Nathan is a difficult topic for me to talk about but if I can try to put it as simply as I can a little bit. Mental illnesses like his can do a number on you and I havent even mentioned that Jefferson groomed him yet. Im still going to hold him accountable for his actions though.gtKate do you blame it on max?I think this is more the writers fault than anything... But in the same sense it could have just been Max not knowing what to say. The scene on the top of the dorms was extremely clunky and those were all the words I would not want to hear in that moment. Kate already knew what she was going to do so I would not directly blame Max... she wanted to help but none of the games right answers for that conversation would even be passable in real life so I dont know what to think.gtChloe do you think shes worth the trouble?To be honest I wish I had someone like Max when I was going through the same issues Chloe did. My answer here might be biased but yes. I think she is worth the trouble. It might not be immediately obvious to most people that this is her time of need but it very much is.gtMax do you think its right to have that much control over peoples lives? Do you think that her superpower really implies responsibility?Had her superpowers cropped up in a different situation like from birth or something I might hold her responsible for her lack of moral decisions. She didnt ask for powers the universe never told her where they came from or what she had to do with them and she was just an awkward girl living out her life where people were a little hostile toward her. I cant really blame her.gtWilliam would you rather he dies or Chloe suffers with them along the way? Which is the better way to go and why?In a way this is like the final decision... the death of one is better than the suffering of many? But what do I know I chose to save Chloe. gtVictoria does anybody hold a different impression of her than the one we got ingame?Warren creepy or cute?I think the game utilized Victoria fine. Fine but not great. Some things she did and said were so over the top that it was a bit funny but ultimately Im happy with her and Maxs discussion at the end of the game. They dont have to be friends but dont have to be enemies either... and I think I like it that way.Warren though? Meh... I dont really feel anything about him. Hes  I think from his files? I think hes just doing what  year olds do but really needs to come off it sometimes. No means no not subtly asking Max to the movies every single day afterwards when youre taking some other girl. Pls.gtDavid hero war veteran with PTSD or paranoid entitled bitch who found his calling in the army?David is a character with grey morals. I think this question is extremely extremely black and white and not an accurate descriptor of him whatsoever. David is a war veteran with PTSD with his heart in the right place but he also does some extremely inappropriate and abusive things.gtDid the game make you doubt the value or point in morality?Not really...  I kind of wish I had the same experience as everybody else but how I first came into contact with this game was under weird circumstances. I also readwatch a lot of media similar to this so Life is Strange was not my introduction to it... but it was the first bit of media I came into contact with where it purposely played with your perceptions and biases. I really appreciate that about LIS but it also divides a lot of people because they cant look at the story objectively or think that the creators were out to personally attack the player.gtWhat did the game make you rethinkthink about?The perception of mental illnesses a lot.gtWhat other topics did the game bring up and do you think it brought them up nicely?Sexuality without being weird about it haha,lifeisstrange,d6tqmwf,2,t5_32tf7

8878573,0,t3_51u7h9,I think Max has realized that changing the past for the better might not actually change it for the better.... LOL not being rude but not a hard plot to figure out. Max saves Chloe now the worst tornado in history F as its called is now going to hit the town Max saves William Chloe is paralyzed.  Max goes back and has Jefferson arrested Chloe still alive tornado is still coming. If Max went back and saved Rachel who knows what would have happened. Maybe the worst earthquake in history would have hit Arcadia. Max goes back and stops Chloe from driving maybe Joyce would have died instead. No matter what timeline Chloe was still alive in the bad weather was there. We still see dead whales and so forth. The only way based on this game sadly to stop and change things was to allow Chloe to die the way she was meant to.As Max says in episode one Destiny. ,lifeisstrange,d7f2vfc,1,t5_32tf7

8888873,0,t1_d7g7y7a,The fact remains that Chloe isnt a straight male though. Shes a notstraight girl. The only outright confirmed nomatterwhat nonstraight character in the game. And her death falls into the tropes of gay characters dying no matter what the devs intended.

8890377,0,t3_51ze6p,Well... girls dont just kiss each other for funsies lol... I swear thats a myth that guys made up. Even if its just a dare they are by themselves in Chloes bedroom in their PJs not lookin cute. Youre not slick Chloe lolOther than that Max continuously brings it up throughout the game and keeps hammering it in that they kissed and even writes in her journal about it and eventually writes about loving Chloe more than just a friend. They share a lot of jokes about it as well to remind you that it happened. EP SPOILERSs Chloe even sticks it to Warren by stalking up his phone number just to tell him about her and Maxs chemistry or whatever LOLChloes body language during the exchange could have been a number of things... probably just teasing the possibility of a relationship by the developers or setting it up for something to happen later. I cant say I was too impressed with the way the scene was written because we only see it from Maxs perspective who seems to have somehow rid herself of all emotion and memory regarding the situation after it happened. Max whyIn my opinion Chloe probably reacted the most realistically... it was awkward and Chloe was nervous. First kisses arent always magical and although its hinted at a lot that Chloe and Rachel were in a relationship it sounded more to me that it was unrequited because she specifically talked about crushes rather than being with her. It may have not been Chloes first kiss but it could have been her first kiss with another girl. PIts also funny to me that EP SPOILERSs Max is always the one to initiate the kiss. Chloe may be daring and say a lot of things but she doesnt have the guts to go beyond flirting lol,lifeisstrange,d7ghwx8,9,t5_32tf7
8895409,0,t1_d7gms78,Yeah. Listen I have way more experience than you when it comes to LGBTQ based media and the narratives we get and the discrimination we face. This ending is a clich. Its one weve seen  times before dating back to the s where it was used to vilify us. This was the only way films with queer characters could end even back then with either one of them dying or ambiguity. This ending fits that perfectly. Now most of its content leading up to the end was very good for LGBTQ people but the ending fits the ancient tropes which makes it something we call queer baiting. Its when a film tv show or game tries to get a queer fan base only to treat us as badly as any other antiqueer media in the end. So why with your limited understanding of the discrimination that people like me face without being a frequent viewer of queertargeted entertainment.m would you continue to argue with someone who has far more experience on the topic than you do?Youre either that much of a LiS fanboy or you dont like that what Im saying reveals your privileged status. Why else would you completely discredit a persons experience on a subject despite not knowing much of anything on that subject. Look throughout this thread other threads like this in this sub. Queer people complain about this and then white knights come in to Dontnods defense completely discrediting our experience on the subject of homophobia even when its subtle. ,lifeisstrange,d7h3nem,1,t5_32tf7

8978835,0,t3_539272,Id definitely like Rachel to make an appearance in a prequelSeason . Shes a really intriguing character and it would be cool in my opinion if there was some sort of supernatural element to the game and she came back as she was but in a different form or just to see her and Chloe as friends like you said. I wouldnt like the entire game to be based around her present state but it would be great to get an opportunity to either play as her in the past even if it was only for a short time or to have the main character meet her. If the new character had powers similar to Max it would be interesting to be able to rewind back years I know Max has done this at times but for the most part she only rewinds back a couple of minutes and change Rachels future so that she andor Chloe did end up leaving Arcadia Bay. Im beginning to confuse myself here though because of course if they did that Maxs future would also be very different. Idk man I just want to meet Rachel haha.,lifeisstrange,d7r4ax8,2,t5_32tf7

9137477,0,t1_d87w48u,technically you would be correct...with one exception it wasnt the second photo she took but the third photo.Which third photo? The photo she takes in the alternate timeline where she rips her selfie apart hours before when she was jumping back to escape Jefferson to get back into that timeline because she was in that  gallery.From that moment where she stopped her Max who is already a autopilot not the one you see in Ep the timeline corrects itself where such details as her photo ripping dont come to pass because she doesnt even get the vision of that tornado anymore because she already chose to not save Chloe.Its a little stretch but the writers expect you to believe that this is how time travel works if the whole universe isnt exploding because of this little paradox. XDOr maybe she got the tornado vision at all but accepted it as a nightmare a daydream what she thought in the very first scene before she had the rewind.So this Max never used her powers never had those powers. When original Max jumped out of it autopilot Max lived her normal human life till original Max jumped back in  days later.,lifeisstrange,d8a8po0,1,t5_32tf7

If you push this person to train tracks you will save  other people further down the line. Will you push this person on the tracks knowing that he will die?And people actually choose not to more often than they do in regular trolley problem where the solution is simple mathematics as victims are all about as far removed from the decider. Proximity and emotional attachment to the subject matters a lot.Its the same thing with executions.

I was not trying to hurt people. I was one of the innocents caught up in it and nearly died.So the game brought back past experiences and I had this strong need to save Chloe no matter what. The game has affected me heavily emotionally and I am reading fanfiction now as I need the story to continue it helps.

10098669,0,t1_dbnf62v,Or gay or straight or anything else. You could interpret her interest in Warren as just heteronormativity like she kissed him because she thought she should be interested in a guy like him. You could interpret her kissing Chloe as experimentation or a heat of the moment thing or that she loved Chloe so much it broke through her usual raging heterosexuality. You could take it all at face value and call her bi or pan or demi or chalk it all up to confusion and call her asexual.Obviously some of those options will seem more or less likely to you but you could argue for any interpretation bi is just the simplest. Personally I see her as attracted to Chloe for obvious reasons especially the diary entries but not Warren because that kiss was utterly unconvincing to me and nothing else suggests real interest. My version of Max is either lesbian or demi and either way shes functionally Chloesexual.,lifeisstrange,dbnvcxe,2,t5_32tf7
10101488,0,t1_dbnwur9,I think this is what really brings the game home. I found myself like OP being able to really care about some of these characters who otherwise are very cliche troupes. I think because the player is forced into Maxs thoughts gives us a connection to her and we are given a window into her life.I really enjoyed going around looking at all the things she had to say about everything.

10112288,0,t1_dbpc6y2,cheers dude. the game as a whole is simply amazing. Ive always been a big fan of story driven games like heavy rain and Fahrenheit or until dawn. I play lots of games in my spare time and enjoy the usual shooters and rpgs. but story driven games have always felt special because  imo they much rarer and the feel of making those decisions really impacts us the players in such a way other games just...dont?but life is strange is certainly special I really hope dontnod keep producing more of this quality I feel like as Ive said they actually put real effort into the emotions and actions of people.the scenes with chloe when shes disabled really are pretty accurate which is something most devs could barely imagine at all. but from someone that grew up with a disabled mother and now works as a career.  they are very accurate. me and my mother would often joke about things when carers would come to help wash her or change her clothes we sit up watching TV together sometimes and just talk or look back at fond memories.but the best scene for me? was chloe asking you to get her some water you can see in maxs eyes that its so surreal that she has to help with such little things because chloe literially cannot do anything for herself and thats....trueI dont know how to explain it unless youve kinda had to do it but when someone you love so dearly is sat that helpless it really brings things together as to how much they as a person rely on those around them.,lifeisstrange,dbpn2gu,2,t5_32tf7

Its no longer your responsibility.Sure as some have expressed him selling drugs to kids is questionable but I feel for the guy. He obviously had a rough life and it seemed like Rachel gave him hope. A reason to live and when she passed away? He was obviously devastated and couldnt fully pick himself back up... just trying to make through this thing called life any way he could. You see that in real life examples of that everywhere. Something traumatic happens to a person and sometimes they just cant seem to recover from it fully or not at all because of lack of support by family and friends or many other factors that can come into play. So they end up self sabotaging themselves unfortunately. ,lifeisstrange,dcp5p2y,1,t5_32tf7

10620396,0,t1_dda6css,Ok some general tips for the beggining. First dont ever stop. Bring you sketchbook with yourself try capturing real people or places. Try different types of penciles it makes a difference.I recomend drawing some simple shapes like ball or cube. Its not as easy as you may thought. It helps with creating similar shapes when you encounter them  for example human head is pretty much an egg. These types of drawing are really boring but unfortunatly necesary if you want to be good.Also study human anatomy. At least a little. I have nice book called anatomy for artist or something like that and it helped me a lot.Try to capture difficult thing separetly first. For example eyes.And finaly focus on shades. Shades create space and depth.,lifeisstrange,ddbewd4,2,t5_32tf7
10624510,0,t1_ddbtl94,gtWed see people from outside the town if days had passed.This could be attributed to lack of budgetresources on Dontnods part. Or that the ending wasnt planned out well.gtBut whether we go with my interpretation or yours its still Chloes choice.Max Chloe I cant make this choice.Chloe Youre the only one who can.gtShe didnt ask for the tornado but she asked for Chloe to be saved and somehow gained the power to save herNo she didnt. When Nathan shot Chloe Max just said NO. She didnt ask to get time reversing powers. At the time she didnt even know that it was Chloe. As far as Max knew it was just a stranger.gtif so we can safely lay the blame for whatever happens at the feet of this otherworldly being. But if the Storm Summoner exists theres no evidence of it ingame.Well it doesnt seem like Dontnod completely forgot about it. Set the speed for the video to lowest setting to see it easier. This shows the butterfly called as Storm Summoner. This video was published May  after the episodes were released. At any rate even if the butterfly wasnt responsible we dont know what is. Maybe Max had the power all along but its just as likely she was given the power at that moment by some unknown force The butterfly Tobanga the doe god.,lifeisstrange,ddbu5e4,1,t5_32tf7

10660737,0,t1_ddeqwyh,I somewhat disagree as someone who was deeply affected by the game the story and the characters. Its interesting that you say that those who are more attached to the characters would choose Chloe I chose Bay because of all the other relationships and characters besides Chloe. Kate Warren Joyce. They mean so much to Max too well unless you play as a Warren hater. Once Chloe made the choice to sacrifice herself as the right thing to do it really solidified the choice for me. Saving Chloe is the purely selfish choice. I didnt want to sacrifice so many other friends and in the case of Joyce family when Chloe herself is sure that sacrificing herself is the right thing to do. It was heartbreaking and I cried my eyes out but I have no doubt in my mind that it truly was the right choice.,lifeisstrange,ddfko9v,5,t5_32tf7

Oops scratch that.But when I got older I started to sometimes find myself with watery eyes. Not crying per se but close to that. Inside Out did this for me for example got a great plot about crying btw. LiS didnt but I dont think its because I was strong or anything I think its just because the buildup was rather slow and also it was possible to stop at just think thats important. There were several choices which made me stop and think for about  minutes.Interestingly when I started the game again after a while and finished Ep  I forgot by that point that Obstacles was playing there too just like at the end of the game. It caught me completely offguard because not only Ep  has a powerful ending all the memories of whats to come associated with that song in my head swept me away.

10962468,0,t3_5wh0gn,I love how broad the story can be. Despite the fact that many of us have never been a teenage girl with crazy time powers we can all relate to Maxs insecurities and comingofage. Take away Jefferson take away the storm and its essentially how most of us felt when we grew up. The possibilities of our future laid out tempered by our regrets and loss. Then theres Max and Chloes incredible bond and love. I can only speak for myself but that kind of relationship is something Ive never come close to having. Its both addictive and frustrating because I want it and yet know how hard it is to achieve. It might not be healthy but I wouldnt want to forget about LIS. I may not obsess about it in time to come but there no denying that this game has changed my life. Its opened me up to the possibility of myriad emotions and hopefully to a better future.

Dana turned from being there because she is Trevors gf and knew Max into a close friend of Max few posts ago. Justin and Trevor from they knew Chloe to we dont know how close they were and now close friends to Chloe. Its hard to even follow this with the constant turmoil in what youre trying to describe.Literally none of the things you listed are in any way contradictory except the we dont know how close they were line which I immediately clarified.gt Where did you find this? You continue to argue about things no one claimed....gt Yet now as a victim her treatment will be a lot different and she will have a lot more options to seek help at including people like Victoria and DanaAgain why do you lie about things I can so easily check?gt It explains why Max would start thinking about this on Friday and not months later as you claim. And quite possibly also make her decision very close to there after talking with her parents.You havent been claiming that Max would start thinking about things on Friday you claimed that Max will make a decision on Friday. Max could be thinking about things for months.gt The reason she came to Blackwell was Jeffersons photography class. She says this word for word. Her interest for photography could have taken to any of the countless photography classes available throughout the country including Seattle were she was living. The reasons she got uprooted and moved to AB was Jeffersons class which no longer exists.Jeffersons photography class would have no relevance if Max were primarily interested in mathematics or English literature. Her interest in photography is what made Jeffersons class relevant.gt Maxs lack of close friends in Blackwell combined with her keeping a photo of her Seattle friends with her and thinking about them is all the evidence anyone needs to realist she is better off with them.Max doesnt lack close friends at Blackwell and even if she did this would be a silly claim. Yeah clearly shes better off with those people in that one photo that we know nothing about because Max never thinks about them or communicates with them.gt And her lack of close friends in AB makes Seattle a one way road.Baseless assertion.gt Violence exists everywhere in the world. But people only really care when it starts affecting them. X people get murdered in Seattle every week means unfortunately very little to people living there. The teacher my daughter traveled to another state to see kidnapping drugging and killing girls while the kid of the guys funding that school shot another student dead all in the first month of her going there would make anyone want to pull their kid away from there.Cool but this is just your opinion without any basis in fact. The murder rate in Seattle means nothing to Seattle residents? Crime and school violence in Seattle isnt going to factor into Maxs parents thinking? Ridiculous.gt And Max would have no desire to stay there since it does not have what she came there for.It has a topnotch prestigious education thats already paid for.gt The basis is on the simple fact that there is no closeness developed in those  days with either one of the  you described. So her great friends in Seattle would most certainly be a lot closer.Nope. Theres plenty of evidence of closeness between Max and her Arcadia Bay friends. Theres zero evidence of closeness between Max and... I cant even remember their names. Those two people in that one photo from Seattle.gt Except if there was more stuff you needed to know you wouldnt have heard them.This makes no sense at all. And there isnt more stuff. Max has Kate go over everything she remembers.Sorry I said that keeping lots of photos is Maxs thing. I thought that was clear.gt So keeping many photos of other people is not her thing. Hence stop dismissing her keeping a photo of her good seattle friends as unimportant because those people were important to Max.Lmao what? Max definitely keeps photos of other people. She can take andor keep photos of squirrels of Victoria of Kate of her parents of some random unsuspecting chick she creeps on in the Art Gallery timeline. Having a picture of those two Seattle people means nothing.gt Plenty of evidence of that already explained you just prefer to turn a blind eye to them since they harm your unrealistic headcanon of Kate being the closest friend Max has now within only  days of experiences they dont even share.No theres actually no evidence. At all. The photo means nothing. The lack of thought and communication speaks volumes in and outofuniverse.gt The scope of the time Max is concerned with is a lot longer than  days. Being realistic means that whatever actions will be taken wont be taken right on the day of Jeffersons arrest but after things start clearing up. Additionally that timeline lacks the fatal shooting of a student in the premises of the school. A shooting by Nathan Prescott on top of the already huge reveal regarding Jefferson.True the scope of time that Max is concerned with is longer than three days. Shes concerned with the next several months. And Principal Wells who would be privy to Blackwells exact political and financial situation would not be going on a trip to SanFran with Max if Blackwell were in danger of shutting down. The Everyday Heroes contest would immediately cease to be a priority if the school itself were in danger. He wouldnt be joking with her and shooting the shit and in general acting like a much happier man if Blackwell were about to implode.And Jefferson represents the lions share of the scandal. Nathan is a student who shot someone. Jefferson is a teacher employed by the school who was abducting students if Blackwell can survive his activities coming to light Nathan isnt going to make a huge difference.gt Oh so now her parents have jobs that allow them to relocate freely? Or they dont work at all? They dont need money? Why did they stay in Seattle in the first place then? Id love to hear about this new headcanon what are these so unusual jobs that allow them to simply relocate like that but yet they chose to stay in Seattle and pay extra for her only daughter to live away from them?I have no idea. Youre the one that made the claim that Maxs parents cant come stay with her for any length of time that Max must return to Seattle in order to be comforted by them. Please provide support that claim.gt Does she even call her a friend at the start? Shes just a friendly person that looks always sad and Max wants to make herself try to talk more often.Does Max call her Seattle friends friends either?gt And without knowing what happened in those  days which Max also doesnt know there is no closeness actually developed without being undone. Being present at the funeral is of little help with that too.Max knows exactly what Kates been going through cares for Kate deeply and remembers profound experiences shared with Kate. Kate cares enough about Max to attend Chloes funeral. Max doesnt need auto!Maxs exact memories.,lifeisstrange,df4lou3,1,t5_32tf7

11252459,0,t3_60l6fw,I feel you. Finished two nights ago and still reeling. Number of gamesmoviesbooks that have made me feel that way is very very small. I remember that feeling of dread which I didnt get until beginning of  when I realised where the game was heading. I was actually a bit surprised that there was a choice at the end since it seemed so clear to me what the game was going for what it was saying about changing the past regret death and moving forward. So I ultimately made the choice I did from that perspective but that didnt make it hurt any less. Then the actual execution of that ending I think was perfect.I dont think Im helping myself by keeping Spanish Sahara on a loop though.,lifeisstrange,df7g6zy,6,t5_32tf7

Remember he is waiting for Max for something rather important to him and considering they havent talked the whole time after the Nathan incident you can understand how one gets very nervous and impatient there. Considering hes not standing there with binoculars and looking constantly but just taking a peek I see it more as verifying if there is still activity in the room or if Max is on her way down. Its not like he could see anything except for shapes and movements from that distance and in that lighting.,lifeisstrange,dfdzaje,2,t5_32tf7

11442506,0,t3_63b20f,I accepted Chloes request. But in hindsight I think rejecting the request is the right move for me. I think mainly I kind of believe in multiverse and what Max is doing is very illegal. She is going to jail after that. I know the doctor suggested it to Chloes family about it but Max isnt a medical professional and cannot legally pull the plug. In the perspective of the law how is it really different than Jefferson just coming in and turning the knob to ? I know there are people out there that are willing to go to jail just to be that hero but Ill be honest... Im not that person. Not for something like Chloes request.,lifeisstrange,dfszx8d,5,t5_32tf7

Point him out to me boy and I will make you a cloak of his skin.In all seriousness I wouldnt say I outright hate any characters except for Jefferson and Sean Prescott. In fact I care for all of them as deeply as Im capable of caring for any fictional character. They all have their little bits of pathos. Victoria and all her insecurities. Principle Wells the man over a barrel who wants the best for Blackwell and its students but works at the mercy of people vastly more powerful than himself. The fisherman who laments the the future of his beloved town. The homeless woman.,lifeisstrange,dfu7hml,13,t5_32tf7

11493949,0,t3_641wx7,If you didnt like Chloe it would make sense that the decision would be easy for you.     But I do think that those players who did like Chloe gets a whole other level of appreciation for the game as a whole.  Im usually pretty detached from moviesgames and the like and I can totally see LIS being just another game for me if I didnt like the Chloe character.      Tbh I feel that liking Chloe is one of the lynchpins of the whole game.  Its just too bad that its not the case for everyone.      And I suppose it was selfish if you look at it.  But it is way more than that.  Not all lives are equal to everybody.  Its like comparing the life of a family member to  strangers.   strangers?   acquaintances?   Its not black and white.,lifeisstrange,dfyu6ok,5,t5_32tf7

11621703,0,t1_dgdas34,I was the opposite I dove headfirst into the whole LiS fandom...read all the fanfics watched music videos bought the soundtrack and several fanmade albums...and its helped.  I know my personality I wasnt walking away from a game like this unscathed so I just embraced it instead.The obsession eventually dies down over time but it will never fade for me because I dont want it to.  As someone who similarly suffers from severe anxiety and manic depression and has for the past  years I know the only way to get over that choking ball of emotion is to understand the how and why as it pertains to you.So yeah you can turn your back on it and the pain will numb over time but that wound will never fully heal if you dont address it.  ,lifeisstrange,dgdbxbm,6,t5_32tf7

11676084,0,t1_dgi5295,I love all your ideas especially the ones about representation. Although Id personally prefer to have it set after the events of season  and have the Max cameo be different based on which ending you chose.I think itd be pretty groundbreaking as far as video games go to not only have a gay romance but a messy complicated adult gay romance. Max and Chloes relationship was beautiful and it had great chemistry but it always struck me as sort of puppy love. Show us two women who care deeply for each other and want to make their relationship work but have actual issues to work out. Maybe they have different lifestyles different worldviews or just different ideas of how a relationship ought to work. Their relationship would be a deeply rewarding one but would require communication and compromise. It wouldnt be a given that everything would work out just because they both want it to.,lifeisstrange,dgji12o,1,t5_32tf7
11686711,0,t3_66r11v,yay i get to repost my comment!gt The odds of them not working on it behind the scenes are pretty low.gt LIS was a critical and commercial success for Square Enix propelling DONTNOD into the spotlight and giving Squeenix one of their perhaps unexpectedly large titles for the year  LIS made one of the top  selling games on Steam for last year  the year AFTER it came out.  To not follow up on that success story when the development team has said that they have ideas and that they would love to work on it just doesnt make sense.gt The reason for a lack of an announcement is likely due to two thingsgt  The announcement may not line up with the marketing plans.  Remember the first time we even heard about LIS was on August   about  months before the first episode came out.  Publishers especially large ones like Square Enix pour a lot of time and attention into making complex multilayered marketing plans for their games to make sure they reach the largest possible audience over the longest possible time for maximum victory impact. To announce LIS S now would undoubtedly take away attention from Vampyr which is DONTNODs current big project and arguably has been since LIS S was completed.  DONTNOD cant afford to market two projects simultaneously nor would it even be a good idea to do so  even larger studios avoid doing so to not compete with themselves.gt When Vampyr releases later this year well probably be about right for LIS S announcements.  Chances are good well know Vampyrs release date at or before E meaning were looking at the latter half of the year for an LIS S announcement with a release in late  or early .  This also gives the team time to make assets assemble a trailer get screenshots etc.gt I could also of course be completely wrong.  But I doubt it.  ,lifeisstrange,dgkpfng,9,t5_32tf7
