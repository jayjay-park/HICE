We do offer financing and payment plans through Care Credit. Heres our Care Credit profile As for the cost it just depends on the type of cleaning you need  e.g. basic cleaningscaling tartar removal periodontal disease therapy etc. Ill send you a PM about your specific case and lets see if we cant find some way to get you and your husband the care you need.

622867,0,t1_cgb1m19, I do agree a more diverse diet is probably most beneficial. Pesceterians for example. I consider us fortunate to have evolved to have a personal choice of diet. I cannot explain the anecdotal evidence I see of vegetarians and vegans running several miles a day multiple times a day have slim fit bodies while I look at my friends and family who eat meat and all have little guts but are sedentary... so it seems you can easily find a group of sedentary vegetarians that will have guts and exhibit poorer health... I think the thing you have to understand is vegetarianism and vegan ism are not usually only descriptive of a persons diet but also indicative of their level of awareness to have chosen that diet. That psychological mechanism is also responsible for people wanting to stay in shape and exercise. You could eat the worst diet you could imagine but if you were running  miles daily  while doing it youll not show much of a determinant to your health and vice versa... I could use that to leverage any study to make any kind of food look good or bad. Not that im saying that is what happened in this study im just describing another common scenario used to make vegetarians look bad. Ill never understand why people care so much about what other people privately choose to do with their own private lives but hey to each his own I guess but that is even in contradiction to my rhetoric... poor vegetarians cannot escape people screaming at them and throwing raw meat in their faces and posting erroneous generalized statements to large groups of society ambiguously like suck it vegetarians... so I could probably understand why this study says vegetarians suffer from more incidents of anxiety and depression... it appears they are bullied often...,raleigh,cgb2js7,1,t5_2r0z3

Its like they are too stupid to realize what happens when everyone in the city leaves work at the same time.  Add a snowfall rate of an inch or two an hour or even worse a flash freeze and you get chaos.    Additionally people just dont understand what Winter Storm Advisories Watches and Warnings are and think that if one happens and it isnt needed it is somehow a bad thing and invalidates the entire system.  Its actually good news if a Winter Storm Warning doesnt come to fruition.    I wish people would treat tornado advisories like they treat winter weather advisories in that as soon as they hear a tornado warning they run out and get in their cars to go home.  It would cut down on the winter gridlock considerably as those people who fuck everything up will get weeded out of the population.,raleigh,cmbvxu0,4,t5_2r0z3

Reading the rules for me usually doesnt cut it I too learn much better when I see it in action which is why the twitch streams have been great. But I would definitely say I am a quick learner. I might actually try to make a character or something when I get home from work today.But I would highly recommend watching some twitch DampD streams my favorite by far airs Thursday nights on the Geek and Sundry channel its called Critical Role. They actually did an episode last week where the DM talked about how to DM and play DampD. The players on that show and the DM are all fairly well known voice actors so the role playing aspect of it is very fun to watch.  ,raleigh,crwry2c,3,t5_2r0z3

4349145,0,t3_3as62q,Been here  years. I think about going back but I cant imagine doing it.We have tons of jobs. A bunch of insurance companies have a large presence in the area. Have your wife check out Metlife theyre really expanding here. For you theres plenty of large companies that Im sure have accounting departments mostly tech. Check out IBM GE Lenovo Cisco Red Hat Netapp etc. The job boards Monster Indeed will get you mostly recruiters but they can be helpful for outoftowners. The company websites themselves are what you want if you dont want to deal with them.Cost of living is probably lower depending on where youre coming from. The triangle area is all about sprawl so there is always a big house for cheap somewhere. It gets a lot more expensive if you want a nice place in downtown Raleigh but about a  minute commute will get you whatever you want for kk.This area loves dogs. Theres dog parks lots of dogfriendly restaurants and even some places that have items for dogs on the menu. I cant speak to any specific dogfriendly apartments havent been in one down here but plenty of friends have lived in apartments with dogs. Some of them even have bags and trash cans around the grounds so you can always pick up after them.The skiing sucks. ish hours get you to Showshoe. Its a mid size mountain with good terrain. Dont ski anywhere else youll be incredibly disappointed. They are all very small with very short runs.That said we have real mountains. Mount Mitchell is the highest peak east of the Mississippi. Theres great rivers waterfalls hiking mountain biking etc. They are great mountains for anything but skiing.I miss New England sometimes but not badly. I miss the skiing see above. I also miss the spring and fall. We dont get the fall colors here quite like up north. And the spring tends to be too short for my liking. The winters are mild so it isnt like it gets hot all of a sudden but the spring seemed so much longer in New England.One thing you missed is the beach. Raleigh is ish hours from the beach so its easy to even take a day trip. This is a great location in that you can make short trips to beach mountains or cities Charlotte Atlanta DC.Hope this was helpful and good luck!,raleigh,csfvptc,3,t5_2r0z3

4828043,0,t3_3gxh7z,Did you know about these problems up front?   As a landlord myself I can tell you that if someone came to me with a list of problems I would ask them to move out myself.   Most of the stuff you listed sounds like you were well aware of prior to moving.  Why did you move in if you knew it would be like this?  Im not belittling your situation because I realize some of it isnt tolerable but things like my roommates bedroom doesnt have windows and The ac drips on the deck is just kind of petty to me.   The reason your roommates Bedroom doesnt have windows is because that isnt a bedroom its likely classified as something like a bonus room. The fact you chose to use it as something other than a bonus room is your choice.  Also the fact the bathroom doesnt have an AC vent you knew that upon move in as well.  The only real issue I see that youve listed is the hot water heater.  This could be as easy as setting the dial in a hotter setting.  If the hot water heater is broke then ask the landlord to fix it.   This landlord doesnt really sound like a landlord from hell as you put it but rather you didnt do your research prior to signing the lease.  Rather than causing the landlord and yourself a ton of problems talk to the landlord and explain the situation.  Theres no sense in trying to get your landlord in trouble for easily remedied problems or things you knew about up front.,raleigh,cu344zs,-4,t5_2r0z3

But I dont see how that is accomplished by trying to curtail successful businesses. The sidewalks should be kept passable for pedestrians. Beyond that it seems silly to try and limit the ability of bars and restaurants to draw people in in hopes that somehow that will stimulate other businesses. All businesses require people so anything drawing people downtown will be good for any business that wants to operate downtown. And I really dont understand the point of closing down sidewalk businesses after a certain time.

As a bourbon aficionado these guys arent at Foundation level hard to be w regards to whiskey but its a robust menu and their scotch game is quite strong. Ample wine and beer options with an admirable nod to local drafts. Their cocktail options are in my opinion a good balance of classics and offthebeatenpath concoctions. Theyre good from the ice front as well two different sizes of rocks depending on your libation. The food menu honestly didnt have too much that grabbed me which may be more of my lack of culinary adventurism than a menucrafting fault of theirs allegedly a full menu will be out in the future. I did try the  Wedge Taters and  chicken and it was great. Just the right amount of smokiness and the chimichurri fit like a glove. Service was spoton too.

10752514,0,t3_5tq232,I live in the Raleigh area Clayton and work regularly in LA. Traffic is so much better in Raleigh. A bad commute here is  minutes. Contrary to what a lot of people in here are saying Raleigh is a pretty liberal city. Downtown in particular is filled with hipsters.    Food is okay. Theres a few great restaurants and different ethnic choices. Ive not been super impressed with food in either city though. Lots of outdoor activities. We get some good shows and stuff you do but obviously wont compete with LA.   However the accessibility is a big factor very easy to drive to and from the city after about  fairly easy parking lots of decks and the city feels safe.   Oh and RDU is very smoothly run in my opinion.,raleigh,ddp1fkd,2,t5_2r0z3

Dont have a car.  They are deciding between the train and a bus.  The bus is cheaper  for a Saturday but the train is a much nicer experience for a little more money.. Have a car but would consider the train.  Maybe they dont want to put the miles on a car.  Maybe they like the environmental angle of the train.  Maybe they want be able to just use their ipad on the way there.  I dont think you will get many people that have a car to use the train at .  The inconvenience and price just make it not worth it.  This is a HUGE amount of people though.  Id love to see a study on them lowering the price to  but having  more people on the train.   milesmpg  . gallons of gas  . per gallon  . to drive your car.
