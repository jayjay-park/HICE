Another poster said it already but Ive always thought that Uncle Fucker was the most original and the best way to go.  As for my comments about Treys music I think that his music for SouthPark BLU is ENTIRELY accurate its very derivative and parody oriented.   I agree that Trey is talented just like I agree that he won a Tony but thats not relevant to his work on the movie.  The movie songs arent strong they are VERY derivative.  Just like my favorite piece by him the Time Child Theme song FANTASTIC but extremely derivative.I disagree that butthurt is the wrong word think its very apt.  They go after Phil Collins more so than most and as far as I know he didnt do anything to dserve that.  Barbara Streisand specifically attacked them in ignorance so they target her but Phil?  It just seems like bitter grapes imo.  ,southpark,cg4hexe,0,t5_2qoqu

South Park is great because its unpredictable and they never stay on one subject too long even within an episode. Im all for guessing which events and situations theyll satirize  and yes the Ukraine situation absolutely should be one of them  but beyond that seems futile and I think cheapens the episodes they actually do write. ,southpark,cg9wceh,1,t5_2qoqu

The outfit and matching scene Cartman has invited many people to bear witness hes set up a scene of sorts and hes even gone so far as to apparently get snacks for everyone just perfectly embody the character of Cartman. Hes meticulous he doesnt just do something halfway. If hes going to get his balls sucked he has to do it in the most grand intricately laid out way he can possibly conjure up  but again its that arrogance that defeats him. The character of Eric Cartman would actually make a fascinating character study  someone younger than me whos still in college and needs a topic for an essay should get on that.

2559444,0,t1_cmsni2y,Woah hold on. I never demanded he apologize. I simply think that his joke was distasteful and that the topic he joked about was not something that even should be joked about. Hes completely free to say whatever he wants that doesnt mean I have to like it or respect him for it. The beauty of freedom of speech is that people are free to disagree about things. I disagree that that type of humour is even remotely acceptable but Im not going to go out and try to censor him over it. I just wanted to express and explain why many people myself included hate him.EDIT If youre referring to the Twitter backlash that I talked about I did not participate in that backlash.

Hell I remember my Aunt telling my mother I might be into devil worship because my friends and I all bought booster packs of Magic Cards back in the s. South Park was a pretty hot button issue when it first started I have intelligent parents that knew I could tell the difference between a cartoon and reality so I got to watch it even though I was  when it first aired. Still remember how many other parents and even some kids told me that I was watching literally the worst show on tv and that it would ruin me.With everything that has been happening lately we are pretty much back in the full swing of PC policing it just took a break through the mid s or maybe its just because I was in my s and didnt pay attention to any of this kind of backlash.Glad Im not the only one noticingremembering.That said I need to watch this episode still Im tip toeing around spoilers at this point heh.,southpark,cv4ypdq,7,t5_2qoqu

5140682,0,t3_3ld3ke,Highlights for me was PC Principal and pretty much everything.  It was a GREAT episode probably a  maybe an  depending on one thing.Lowlights.. fuck the moral fuck the ending.  It was a shitty ending.  Kyle learned the wrong lesson.  Kyle admitting Caitlyn Jenner was a hero is a betrayal of both his character and Matt and Treys show.   What I need to see next week is this being a two parter and we get a proper resolution that or proof this is going to be an on going arc.  Theres a couple GREAT idea though.  Ive recently read an Social Justice Warrior complain that people who say no blacks on grindr profiles are racist.  If we take this to the full extend people who dont want to have sex with men or women are sexist and Id love to see PC bros demand that of people itd be super awkward but itd be fucking hilarious. Id love to see Cartman and Pc Principal really go at it. Id love for Black Lives matter to come in.  They didnt even touch that so its ripe for next week even as a two parter.And PC Bros are all White male frat boys... Thats just asking for something to happen.  Wheres the women at dawg? Part of me would love to see PC principal taken down but another part of me can see him being a season long guy I dont know which I want more fixing Kyles ending or setting up a season long maybe a third of the time of having PC bros be part of the show. All I can say is I have a huge hard on for the show again.  Season  was very good but SeasonE might be one of my favorite openers for a season since the anime episode even with the weak ending.   And Randy as a PCBro is also just prime for fun. ,southpark,cv5n7hf,0,t5_2qoqu

So you should be protected for going up to a poc or an immigrant or a gay couple and assaultabuse them with your speech? And yes we do have the right to not be offended. As a woman if you call me a bitch or a cunt or a slut etc I will be offended and I will call you out on it. I have every goddamn right to call you out on sexist shit that you might say to me as a woman because I respect myself as a person and dont want to be abused and degraded by some little asshole who thinks hes adorable and cute for calling me a bitch because I have opinions and voice them myself.  And the same goes to you. You do not have the right in society either. People can and will say shit to you. And if you cant handle that maybe you should listen to your own words.

5148643,0,t1_cv6dmr4,I think the topic has been unfortunately watered down and poorly explained online. I think the best explanation of privilege is this Think of life as a video game. Now in a game you can play it in easy mode medium mode and hard mode. Easy mode means you start out in life with a lot of money and connections in life to get you to a good school and a good job. Hard mode means you are born in a very poor neighborhood maybe even into a family with lots of problems that makes it harder for you to move up in life. You could possibly move up but it is much less likely due to many factors like having to leave school to take care of family members getting caught up in the middle of an area with lots of gang violence being more prone to having someone introduce hard drugs and addiction into your life lack of education leading you to become pregnant as a teen etc.Privilege is not about making people feel guilty. It is acknowledging  that if you start out with lots of wealth and in an area with little crime you have way more chances of succeeding than someone who doesnt. That doesnt make you a bad person. Instead maybe it makes you not be so hard on someone who was born poor or into a family where the parents are checked out and do drugs all day. It also maybe makes you think about policies that unfairly target one group of people more than others like drug sentencing laws and police enforcement as well as being deprived of an education. Its not about taking things away from people and guilting them. Its about hey as a society are we really making it so that everyone can have the opportunity to move up in life?I am of the opinion that as a society we do not have it so that everyone can make it if they just try hard enough. I think some people are really born fucked and we would all be better off if we tried to change that. The fact that the gap between the rich and poor has only increased drastically over the past few decades proves that. Just food for thought. Im not about policing peoples words but I think we could have things better than we do.,southpark,cv6lsmw,4,t5_2qoqu

Yes the platform that requires more workknowledge about computers and that generally costs more money at least initially is in fact better in a lot of ways. PC isnt always better obviously but there are a lot of things about it that warrant the higher time amp money investment.Im obviously aware that there are scenarios where you spend less money on PC than you would on a console especially when you factor in stuff like steam sales and no multiplayer fees but its still at least a higher time investment than just owning to console and having to live with however the game runs and looks with no option to modify it.,southpark,cv839id,-1,t5_2qoqu

Heres a few quotes from the articleThese are going to be some of the most exciting lofts in downtown in really any downtown in the southeast. Youre going to be right across the street from Publix so you can walk to get your groceries or a bottle of wine walk to restaurants walk to work if youre there said Chad Emerson CEO of Downtown Huntsville Inc.The Artisan Lofts will also feature a resortstyle saltwater pool a java bar and a workout area.You get all the amenities you might have in another part of town but right here in the heart of downtown Emerson said.As far as Publix  the company really researched where to put the store Emerson said.Whats really interesting  we are the smallest downtown in the country with a downtown Publix. What I mean by a downtown Publix is theres not a big massive parking lot surrounding it. You literally walk in to the Publix directly off the sidewalk  there will be parking on the street there will be a parking deck across there  its a smaller prototype but its really fun to say they saw something in downtown Huntsville they didnt see in downtown Nashville or downtown Birmingham or other places said Emerson.This place is highenergy. If you like Cajun food all different types  its family friendly but you also in the evening get together with your friends you have indooroutdoor dining. Its really going to become a goto place in downtown said Emerson.Both restaurants will have outdoor patios.  More restaurants are coming soon too  but Emerson couldnt mention names yet.Oh theyre going to be good. Well let the developer announce them but theyre going to be exciting brands he hinted.,southpark,cw4oqzq,1,t5_2qoqu

5464615,0,t3_3poyg0,I thought this weeks episode was one of the best they have ever written. It really bothers me when I read episode recaps and a lot of people seem to have completely missed the point. The episode has two distinct plot lines for a reason. Randys plot line was to show that while he is doing nothing particularly worthy of shame he goes to whole foods every damn day and is still upset when it happens. Cartmans storyline was to show that if you use social media it is vitriolic and if you feel shamed you need to get off.The point was that they were all complete disconnected from reality. Thats why they threw him in as a character. While no one should have to expect to be shamed Randys when you post online you will whether it is worthy of shame or not Cartmans. You can either get over the shame or get off of social media. You have no right to be upset and no one should feel bad for you when youre shamed if you go back time and time again,southpark,cwa5mzp,2,t5_2qoqu

And the whole Randy Cupid Me and Yaoi aspect was a clever hint that some people still have this dumb idea that being gay can be forced and a choice. Like once youre suspected of being gay you cant really convince anyone otherwise. But they also showed how a depiction of love in art or in real life can help people feel good and hopeful.

Basically its like this yes you worked really hard to get where you are but chances are if you were black you would not be in the same position you are in now even if you had worked just as hard for a number of reasons. Obviously there are outliers but generally a nonwhite person is going to have extra hurdles they have to jump to get to the same place as the white guy. That isnt discounting the experiences of the white guy just pointing out that they dont have to deal with some of the stuff people of color likely would. Also you probably shouldnt use South Park as your example for reality. The rich black kid you mentioned Token is quite literally named Token Black and there have been several episodes about how wealthy his family is and other black families have been which is more than likely the writers attempt to show how unrealistic those token characters usually are...obviously...And yes Kyles Jewish dad is a lawyer which is another stereotypearchetype as is Kennys white trash family...also its a cartoon...,southpark,cwn186u,6,t5_2qoqu

But in my opinion Southpark has become a quality show with sincear and thoughtfull commentary on relevant issues in society today.Through comedy and a slapstick in your face approach Southpark is tackling issues we cant even talk about in public without starting riots. ,southpark,cwzzwtr,3,t5_2qoqu

It certainly fueled my selfhate.Halfway through the episode and way too many things click in very grey Bobby Fischermoment. Jews nwo powerful evil people are out to get you and the only ones being blind are clearly one of the fifty shade of fascist groups with a bit of esoteric nonsense to spice things up. In typical bullshit fashion Trey and Matt are hinting giving nods to those guys just to get that extra controversyfueled rating. For once me and Alex Jones agree... we both like this season.

All that the episode was missing was Cartman gleefully cheering and threatening that this is all a fad that the pendulum always swings and when people will be hit with famine war and hardships again you the individual especially you will be the first to die.

Notice how she is always looking and listening to jimmy and judging him and everything he says like she is keen to learn about him. Remember her saying to jimmy I like that.People want to look cool and hip doing things this is especially what being pc is about now they get sucked into the pc movement so they look cool and have some social status in their social circles and it improves  chances at getting pussy thinking with your dick. People post their life and what they do online other people see it and think thats how life should be so they copy and emulate what they see. Its all an ad! The people who dont conform get ostracised. Social media works on peer pressure.Leslie is the gateway between people ie social media and advertising shes like an intelligence gatherer for advertisers. Whatever she assesses learns and likes the advertisers therefore learn and use to target. PC principal being a sjw wants to control social media and that is why he is always telling Leslie to shut up! but he is unknowingly being subverted and controlled too just like the entire pc crowd is on social media in real life..Social media tells you what is trendy. The people themselves ARE the ads.

5906348,0,t1_cxtuc1e,You know what I mean. Allowing basically anyone to buy basically any kind of gun whether by defunding the ATF or ensuring plenty of loopholes stay on the books or running one of the most sophisticated lobbying operations in history. Obviously theyre not being given away for free the whole point is for the NRA or rather the manufacturers that fund the NRA to sell as many of them as possible.Countries with more guns have much higher rates of gun violence. Arming innocent people doesnt make them safer the odds of a gun actually helping you in the case of a home invasion are astronomically low how many times has your house been broken into while you were home and awake? and just having one exposes you to all kinds of risks. The numbers speak for themselves which is why the NRA fights so hard to keep the government from compiling any statistics on gun violence. You cant completely eradicate guns but you could make them a lot harder to get and prevent a lot of suicides accidental shootings and crimes of passion in the process.I dont necessarily think Matt and Trey would line up to take everyones guns away. But they obviously at least see that the idea of arming everyone is fundamentally absurd and that was clearly the thrust of their argument.,southpark,cxtut3x,-2,t5_2qoqu

I liked South Park as a quite little mountain town with fucked up shit happening all over the place but wasnt completely dependent on current events. Thats not to say the ones that follow them are ALL necessarily bad Kanye West in Fish Sticks Paris Hilton in Stupid Spoilt Whore were hilarious.

The risks of a guard being taken advantage of in prison heavily outweight the risks of a teacher taking advantage of a student.

And honestly I dont know what Trumps intentions really are and why hes really running for president. Its definitely not for more money though because hes pouring in millions of his dollars into his campaign and he has completely stopped working on his businesses. All I know is that George Soros is a psychopathic control freak who probably wants to take over the world and that other special interest groups are just billionaires looking our for themselves. If Trump wanted more money then he wouldnt be running for president. And no hes not looking out for other billionaires because he wants to stop corporations from outsourcing employment to other countries such as China and Mexico.

Id rather give a human my order than a machine most days. But when you live in a society when a business is forced to pay someone like some kid at McDonalds the proposed  dollars an hour theyre going to lose their job to a machine.

8222564,0,t1_d554kyh,Chinpokeandgo The adults end up using it like a TinderGrindr for sex while the kids use it for collecting chinpokomon. Plot twist the Japanese never meant for it to be a kids game anymore it was meant as a subtle adult hookup app to distract Americans from national defense via augmented reality. The children meet together via lures and defend South Park against the threat of invasion protecting the gyms that their parents are fornicating in. The japanese send over something silly like a mascot paradrop to try and win over the kids but they end up getting their asses kicked by the children during an ensuing augmented reality battle.Jimmy and Timmy end up being the silent heroes having been bullied by all of the kids for being unable to play via walking around while using a smart phone at the same time. They see past the Japanese deceit and aim to takedown the servers by manually destroying them. Realizing that they need augmented reality to overcome the servers defenses they team up as one holds and the other one operates the smart phone. It ends up looking super gay jizzus christ. The climax of the episodes battle ends abruptly as the servers crash causing the battle to stop and the parents to come out as well. The Japanese complain and go home but not before vowing to try again.Randy was too immersed in the augmented reality aspect and played it like a grown child by walking into traffic like Mr Magoo mirroring how we play Pokemon go and ignoring all other plot devices. He eventually catches every chinpokemon just before the end server crash just as everyone has stopped giving a fuck. ,southpark,d55dknr,380,t5_2qoqu

I think the best thing beneficiaries of white privilege can do is first acknowledge it...a lot wont even do this and then do your best to work towards a fairer future. Listen to others perspectives learn and appreciate the history of other cultures before appropriating them use your hard earned money to fund a federal study that researches the effects of slavery on black americans seriously I went to schools with kids who straight up denied that slavery has any effect on their lives today...as if all historical events shape the present in some way EXCEPT slavery. That one exists in a vacuum.

Saudis were big investors for a Clinton victory because they wanted america to be in bad terms with Russia make the trade regualtions worse and supply ISIS and other terrorists in Syria. Now this was their goal because they wanted to build a pipeline through Syria to Europe. This pipeline would mean that Russia would lose its biggest resource export capability to Europe pushing them to become more aggressive and oppose america even more.    The leftist media is pushing the bullshit you just said because Putin is trying to be nice to Trump because Trump can easily decide the fate of Russia and not the other way around.

9975006,0,t3_5hzqns,Man it really feels like Matt and Trey just didnt try as hard this season at least not after like episode . They started up so many plotlines boysgirls war memberberries Trump trolling and just kind of forgot about most of them. The only plotarch that actually felt fully fleshed out was the trolling one. Everything else seemed like they were trying to do some kind of commentary on society today but never really got to the point or developed a resolution. Like the boysgirls thing which I assume was commentary on how people are becoming more and more tribal nowadays with identity politics and politics in general. Either youre with us or youre against us and there is no middle ground. Either youre a feminist or a misogynist either youre an MRA or you hate men either you support x candidate or youre a bigot  hate America or something like that. They sort of touched on this but it really felt lacking a resolution like how in earlier seasons were Kyle would explain the problem with a certain way of thinking and how its dividing us and how we should all come together instead. Same thing goes with the memberberries and Trump. They were going somewhere with the whole the world has changed too drastically and we just want things back the way they were thing but it was never really touched on in the last episode or two and once again lacked a real resolution. And honestly the worst part of all of it is they were so caught up in trying to make a  different points at once that they forgot to make it funny. Like there were obviously some funny moments but no way is it on par with earlier seasons. It seemed like they had the same handful of jokes memberberries how we cant live without the internet how much of a narcissist Trump is etc recycled for  episodes. TLDR I feel like they tried to do way too much this season didnt come to a real satisfying resolution or explain the ultimate point of most of the stuff they covered and recycled the same like  jokes. ,southpark,db7rr4d,3,t5_2qoqu
