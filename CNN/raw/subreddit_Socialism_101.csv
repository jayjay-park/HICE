3881747,0,t1_cqyg763,Paradigm shift might not be the right term. What I really meant was that the class that takes up the responsibility of ownership of the means of production and the manners of distribution and exchange changes discretely  one way to think of it is to say that this doesnt constitute a series of steps but a single step so a gradual approach is basically redundant because theres only one real task.I suppose my evidence is the experience of past revolutions where the bourgeois state has been wholly subsumed and abolished prior to the establishment of a proletarian dictatorship and the fact that the case for gradualism is not done well by the failure of every gradualist project thats ever existed. Otherwise what kind of standard of evidence are you looking for? I could imagine one potential objection being that the fact that no gradualist project has succeeded before doesnt imply that they are necessarily doomed to failure. I suppose the best that I could say in response to that is to say that the onus is on the gradualist to demonstrate the feasibility of their project.At this point itd probably be appropriate for me first withdraw the claim that gradualism is not a feasible praxis and substitute it for the claim that revolutionary socialism is a demonstrably feasible praxis and say that thats sufficient enough for us all to accept it and engage in it.

4029258,0,t3_36nzl0,Can you elaborate on the first question and what you mean by confines? As for the second I think the easy uncontroversial answer is the abolishment of the capitalist mode of production and the replacement of it with socialism. Che Guevara implies this in  Socialism and Man in Cubagt In order to develop a new culture work must acquire a new status. Human beingsascommodities cease to exist and a system is installed that establishes a quota for the fulfillment of ones social duty. The means of production belong to society and the machine is merely the trench where duty is performed. A person begins to become free from thinking of the annoying fact that one needs to work to satisfy ones animal needs. Individuals start to see themselves reflected in their work and to understand their full stature as human beings through the object created through the work accomplished. Work no longer entails surrendering a part of ones being in the form of labor power sold which no longer belongs to the individual but becomes an expression of oneself a contribution to the common life in which one is reflected the fulfillment of ones social duty. ,Socialism_101,crfkdpl,3,t5_2ys9x

When were becoming educated were contributing to our overall quality of life and wellroundedness as human beings so if we take away the steep financial cost its not like we have to consider it an arduous part of life.  In fact since we can also be productive while we are learning and we are also contributing to the wealth of human knowledge and the furthering of our culture I think we should pay people to be students every much as we pay them to be teachers.

How does the withering of the nowredundant state apparatus happen? Do the people focus on making one organ of the state redundant at a time?

7849233,0,t1_d3xpo77,Yes laissezfaire capitalist Libertarian with the big L as in U.S. Libertarian party. The idea of guaranteed livelihood goes back earlier than that Thomas More from in the s citing Raphael.The Swiss referendum called for adding basic income to the constitution as a human right and implementation of a plan to provide  Swiss francs to every adult citizen monthly. You also mentioned libertarians so that was the question I was answeringthe contemporary popular formulation as an alternative to social services.A onetime payment is very different from basic income and I feel were getting well outside the scope of the original question. UBI is a sustained measure that guarantees continued livelihood while a onetime payment says try and make a livelihood out of this against all barriers. Theyre conceptually different and Id argue that a onetime payment is much closer to capitalist ideology than UBI.

10077507,0,t1_dbl2ve9,The gist of it is that once you understand the Dialectical Materialist conception of history you can identify the major force for social change  the reason that Capitalism overthrew Feudalism and Feudalism overthrew Roman Slave Production etc. etc. all the way back and this force is the class. Once humanity began organizing into larger social groups there was almost always an upper class who did not produce and a lower class that produced goods and services for the society as a whole.Eventually the lower class becomes class conscious and stages a revolution or the society collapses due to its internal contradictions which allows the lower class to seize power for themselves. To this point however when the lower class obtains power they reproduce the power dynamic within the old society when they set up the new one usually through the use of the state which they use to legitimize the suppression of the old ruling class and then to reproduce the conditions of the new society where they have power.This is what Marx means by The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.The Marxist conception of SocialismCommunism then is the idea that if you understand what that power dynamic is when the next collapse or revolution comes you can ensure that the unequal power dynamic that gave rise to it in the first place is not reproduced in the new society and people can be truly equal  not in the sense of Bob and Joe are exactly the same but in the sense of Bob and Joe are both valuable members of society and one of them does not deserve to hold power over the other.Ive probably misstated something since Im in a bit of a hurry  Im sure a kind comrade will be along shortly to correct me.,Socialism_101,dbl4c60,14,t5_2ys9x

10999782,0,t3_5x20gi,Marx has a lot of praise for capitalism  he describes it as the most revolutionary social system  forced as it is to constantly overhaul itself in order to escape its own contractions. As such he saw it as unleashing a set of forces on the world which are haunted by their own instability driven to ceaselessly expand production thereby laying the foundations for superabundance. Feudalism in which productive forces were held in aspic inherited by primogeniture and bound up in myriad obligations and fealties was essentially a static system unable to progress in any real manner.He also wrote a lot about the manner in which having smashed the bonds of feudalism in bourgeois revolutions capitalism simplified the whole array of feudal classes more and more into two camps worker and capitalist. This simplification Marxs reasoning went would blast away the obfuscatory veils of feudal right and privilege revealing class society for the unequal and unjust hellholes that they are  leading to greater and greater class consciousness as capitalism extended its reach globally and thence to worldwide Revolution. I think we can forgive Marx for the partial accuracy at best of this prediction writing as he was whilst Western Europe was still an agricultural society and capital had barely begun its march at ascendency across the globe.I dont think theres any contradiction to say that Marx both deeply admired and utterly abhorred capitalism  being utterly disgusted by the violent processes of clearance and dispossession which created the proletariat undertaken by capitalist elites against settled peasants and completely awed by the towering industries built in Germany and England in the first half of the nineteenth century. But at the same time he had no time whatsoever for backwardlooking feudal mummery always looking forward to a new postcapitalist world in which ordinary workers could become captains of their own collective destiny.,Socialism_101,deesjd9,13,t5_2ys9x

11508029,0,t3_647vmm,Socialists are generally supportive if it benefits workers which in some countries it may and generally unsupportive of it in countries where it is unlikely to benefit workers. UBIs effectiveness as with all government programs will be directly correlated with the success and support of its implementation so UBI really comes down to individual countries and their models of welfare states. We can assume that the political climate in Sweden or Norway is much more likely to facilitate successful implantation of UBI than countries like the US or the UK.In Scandinavian Social Democratic welfare states where union density is very high labor power is strong economic inequality is low welfare measures are supported by and provide benefits to workers. In Scandinavian countries labor unions and employers both feel as if they benefit from social programs. As everyone pays and benefits roughly equally Scandinavian countries actually often have a fairly flat tax system there is widespread support of strong social policies and workers greatly benefit. Finland is currently conducting a UBI experiment with  people and I think its definitely possible that well see them in other Scandinavian countries as well in the coming years.In Liberal US UK AUS NZ etc welfare state models itd be a bit more complicated. Liberal models tend to have the weakest welfare states lowest labor density weakest leftist parties and weakest public sectors of any developed countries. Ignoring the fact that UBI seems extremely unlikely to be adopted in any of these countries at least in the near future its implementation would certainly include huge sweeping cuts to their alreadyweak social programs to fund it. As for how it would effect the working class if history is any indication of the future these countries unlikely to try to alter the standard of living for the poor even if they did somehow adapt a system of UBI.,Socialism_101,dg0fq1c,3,t5_2ys9x

11625489,0,t1_dgdqned,gtIm not just talking about ideas but software. You think people should have no authority over the software they create? ....software is an idea. Im not talking about the code no one forces you to release the code but the idea of the software lets use word processor as an example. There are a ton of different word processor programs out there from Microsoft Office to Open Office to notepad. They all have their different strengths and weaknesses the vast majority were written with different code entirely from scratch but they all do more or less the same thing. The word processor is the idea. Some guy somewhere was the first to do it. Should he have the right to ownership of all the word processors created after his?today you can copyright certain functions of software. In a socialist society you would not. This doesnt mean anyone would force you to release the code but if another programmer duplicated the function with their own code they are fine. No socialist state would let you sue him or anything. He is free to create another word processor that looks exactly like yours. You have no control over that. Nor should you. gtTrade is capitalism no? A communist directly told me there would be no trade in socialism. Well a few points here. . Communism and Socialism arent the same thing. . There are about a billion different types of each market socialism anarchist socialism libertarian socialism the list goes on literally forever. . in my opinion  that guys wrong socialism and communism restrict ownership of the means of production but not of trade you can trade whatever you want. as long as its not the means of production that belongs to the peopleCapitalism is the private owning the means of production that is its defining characteristic any other features of capitalism come directly from that. such as the exploitation of the worker but dont definite it in and of themselves. Just because a society has trade doesnt inherently make it capitalism. Agrarian and Feudal societies traded neither were capitalists. Everyone on the left has a slightly different definition of socialism. Each socialist society that has ever existed in the world implemented it slightly different. Thats because were all different people. So trying to tye one specific definition to everyones interpretation is more or less impossible. Same goes for capitalism though every country has implemented their version of capitialism slightly differently. ,Socialism_101,dgdrer9,1,t5_2ys9x

11791840,0,t3_68397u,Oh yeah another thing. At the beginning of the debate define Communism to them because usually they will be constantly changing what it means and it also makes the debate easier if you have something to refer back to. Communism is not about government owning everything its not about loss of civil rights its not about forcing everybody to have everything absolutely the same its not about any these things. As short as possible Communism is a classless moneyless and stateless society where those who operate the means of production are the ones who control them. A Communist society is a lot of things but not what some people often claim it to be. Just make sure you dont fall into any of the changethemeaningoftheword traps.,Socialism_101,dgwn82t,2,t5_2ys9x
