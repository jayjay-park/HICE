252393,0,t1_cf6wks4,Haha its a Bruins blog we are all homers.  I am saying you are wrong for thinking Vanek would make our team better.  I never said the top two lines are untouchable but you dont just throw top talent into the mix and think it will solve everything.  Look at Pittsburgh last year and what happened when they added a couple big names around the deadline.  We smoked them.  Im not saying thats the case everytime but you cant make the argument that it will work.  Vanek is a winger and he just wont affect the game that much.  Our top two lines are playing the best they have all year right now and its crazy to suggest breaking them up just for a big name like Vanek.  You think thats Chiarellis style?  We traded Seguin for Christ sake!  Also just because we are speculating doesnt mean I think your points cant be wrong.

638184,0,t1_cgcru7n,No why would I want to see someone I hate off the ice?I will level with you  I hate him more than Neal because him being a shithead is fresh in my memory. If this were a month out or we were playing the Penguins Id probably say I hate Neal more than anyone else in the NHL. I had a case of tunnelvision going on after this game. How could this not happen to your team and happen consistently from this dude and you not hate him though?I easily hate him more than Ott though because of two reasons he plays on one of the teams I dislike the most in the NHL and hes better than Ott. Ott is an asshole but hes not as good as Subban so his attempts at being a pest are much more meaningless to me. Its adding insult to injury when a person is a pest and they offer a large contribution to their team offensively and defensively.I hope you were being facetious with the race part. That has nothing to do with my like or dislike of a player nor should anyone factor it into how they feel about a player.,BostonBruins,cgct8w7,2,t5_2rmt9

Eriksson and Soderberg work great together and would work even better with Krejci. I dont think well have any problem with the top two lines even without Iggy. Its the third and fourth line that may cause problems. But we have some good prospects. If Loui has to move up keep Soderberg with him. Bring Lucic to the third with Fraser and KellySpooner I like Kelly but if we have to get rid of him for cap I wont be crying myself to sleep. Then we just need to replace Thorton.Were still going to have a great team. Well have arguably the best defense in the league and itll be even better if Seidenberg is there for the full season.

I also think his numbers are slightly skewed from playing on a good team not to mention hes young so I think we could get good value from him. Chara is getting up there in age and it shows on ice especially against the habs. That being said hes a force on the ice regardless of speed not to mention a leader. Id only be willing to part with Boychuck if we got really great value for him. I think hes entering his prime and I want him on our team for that period. ,BostonBruins,cjujla0,2,t5_2rmt9

What really fucked us over was losing Horton without any payback and trying to fix it shortterm with Iggy etc. instead of a longterm solution there was other rumours at the time such as Evander Kane. Without the trade our defense would have no clear director for the future which it now has. Our offense already has a core for the next halfdecade. We were in bigger need of a director for the defense. Unfortunely R. Smith havent been able to deliver as he did last year but with a better winger in the system I think he can light up again.

Chris Kelly was a  before being traded to the Bruins he was a  after. Kings Ducks Sharks and Blackhawks are all huge into advanced stats but so are the Oilers so who the fuck knows. You cant just know stats and suddenly it makes your team better. Players do play the game and yes McQuaid Seidenberg Miller and Krug have all been bad defensively this year. Even with Chara shouldering most of the defensive responsibilities. The problem is there is no second PK pairing if Chara is in the box there isnt a first. There is no spark from the th line. Ericksson one of the most talented players is in a checking line role. Bergeron and Marchand have been one of the best  on  lines in all of hockey the problem is they get sent out against other teams top pairings and are asked to shut them down. They are paying Lucic  million to score as many goals as Mike Santorelli and Brad Boyes. The Bruins are currently a  line team with one of the lines having Paille or Riley Smith completely disarming them. They arent playing well.

Youre petty is hardly a response to the fact that I pointed out the fact that you were making an absurdly pedantic and unrelated point. gtThere you go again. What was it you said You can always tell when someone has no point to be made when they get hung up on pedantic shit like this. Practice what you preach bud.Do you even know what pedantic means? Because I sure as hell dont think so after reading that. I said you literally were missing what I was saying. Being pedantic means youre obsessing over minutiae like my spell checker deleting the d in ahead. See? You learned something today. gtSeriously real righteous. Youre sitting here trying to tell me that you know best and that if I as a fan question what is going on I think that Im a GM or something.You couldnt be farther from the truth. The point isnt that I know best. The entirety of my responses has centered around the fact that PC and Claude have gotten us this far and deserve the benefit of the doubt. You want them gone but why should I take your word over theirs? Thats the thing here. Its not me versus you. Its you versus PC and Claude considering your opinion has to do with getting rid of them. And thats the point Im making. You are some random guy on reddit. They are professionals and they have a really good track record. Its easy to sit here and obsess over mistakes but that doesnt change our situation. Calling for their jobs lacks scope. We are the worst weve been since  at least and were still in the playoffs. Relax.gtI was responding to your asinine statement that Seguin couldnt produce here like he magically gained his talent over night when we traded him to Dallas.Except that I never stated that. You asserted that Seguin would produce similarly here and I asked what younger basing that off of. You responded with a pointless diatribe about how the system needs to be changed. It had nothing to do with what I asked you.gtits time to change the system. They dont have the guys to play Big Bad Bruins style like they have been for the past  years plus.Thats why you build a team. Its not done being built here. The roster will change. Theres no reason to axe the coach and the GM because the roster is different. Thats ludicrous. Like it or not the  team was built through the middle. Before that we just good but not Cup winners.

Its not impossible.But their performance of late has me alarmed. They cant hold on to a three goal lead against Calgary. If and its a big if they miss the postseason there needs to be some changes. I dont think itd merit a wholesale rebuild or anything MTL was rd worst in the league in  sandwiched between a  point season and the lockout year in which they paced at a  point season but the team is clearly not up to it in its current construction and at least one contract above M needs to move to gain the ample flexibility.,BostonBruins,copbs45,-1,t5_2rmt9

He carries a big cap hit but hes well worth it.  Youre not just going to get another goalie like that.  Subban is a rookie who has only played  game in the NHL.  Sure it didnt go well and thats not a guaranteed indication of how hes going to play the rest of his career.  But neither is his prospect status or AHL play this year.  Give it time and see what you got with the kid.  Mean while ride out Rask until he cant play at an elite level like he does.  Unless someone is going to over pay for Subban keep him.

3671142,0,t1_cqagh5m,This season Spooner and Pasta line carried the Bs into a position to make playoffs. They were the teams best pure offensive players not sure how anyone could disagree given the production and limited gamesminutes played.Lucic had an awful year but he has proven in the past over and over he can turn it on when needed he takes gamesstretches during the reg season off no doubt. But Lucic offers what few in the league can a dominating physical top line presence.Obviously you really like Loui but I have watched him play on a line with  and  and neither line ever looked anything close to dangerous. Sure they may not have turned it over and kept a good corsi but I am speaking in terms of a scoring threat which he isnt when playing a top  role. Thats just a fact. Good for him if he can help keep possession. Kelly Campbell Paille and the fribble crew were good at that  years ago and they all got overpaid for it. Keeping a high corsi is important but to be a top  F on a cup contending team you have to also be a legit scoring threat. He already have one less than average scoring threat in Lucic as you pointed out. Cannot carry  in that top . Sure Loui does provide a good net front presence especially on the PP. And I will even give him that he scored some timely goals. But basically what your arguing to me is Eriksson is a slightly more offensive skilled but soft version of Lucic. Ill take Lucic every single day even at his more expensive salary. BUT my point remains if Loui Erikkson is a top  scorer on your team your not a playoff team. Same goes for Lucic. If the Bs go into a year thinking Lucic is going to be a top  scorer they wont be a great team. That is not his role. He was and is the rd offensive threat on that top line and he does dirty work to make  and the HortonIggy of that line better. When I saw Loui on that line he was a passenger to Fn Lucic.. End of discussion. And once again he finished third in scoring because  played only half the season  G  A  P and Spooner only played in  games  G  A  P.Go ahead and prorate those over  games. Krecji only played in  games. HE IS the Bs resident top scorer. I dont care what you say about Iggy or Loui I am talking about what matters the playoffs when Krejci went on  monster runs in those cup years. He has hurt and still had  P in  games. Prorated over  sure Loui has more production but Krejci was hurt. Loui finished as their  scorer this year but he was not one of their top scorers. End of story.,BostonBruins,cqaqfu7,0,t5_2rmt9

They must want a new direction to send Chia out and Sweeney probably isnt going to bring much new since he was PCs understudy. Anyway better find someone good for whichever direction they want because otherwise we might as well have stuck with good decent at worst if youre a PC detractor in Chia and stuck with the formula.Ninja edit in rereading I didnt mean to say Sweeney himself makes me concerned  just the idea that wed loose Chia to put Chia Jr. in and again maybe Im discounting Sweeneys autonomyindependent thinking probably time to do some reading really...,BostonBruins,cqysltx,1,t5_2rmt9

4155315,0,t3_389vp1,I give it a less than  chance we can sign Seabrook. Too many FAs to deal with and the market for defensemen has gotten insane. It would be irresponsible to sign him to the contract he would want. Anything past  years would just create problems for our rookie D looking to move up. Also Mcqauid on the nd pair with Dougie seems iffy. Qauider really cant handle that competition and thats a lot of work to put in Hamilton it could stretch him thin and lower his offensive output.  I would drop Bart drop either Quaider or Miller and put the other on the rd pair with Krug then Seids and Dougie and Chara with Trotman. For games against a strong top line like the Hawks just swap Dougie and Trotman. Morrow would make a good th to filter in. This is a really cap friendly option as Miller or Mqauid will be cheap. Seids can be dumped if he doesnt improve and if he does  mil isnt bad at all. Krug has a good price Morrow is cheap and Dougie is worth whatever he gets mil?. Up front I would love to see MarchyBergeronLoui LucicKrejciPasternak SmithSpoonerGriffKelly and FerlinTalbotGriffKelly.

Id watched every single game with my Dad who got me into Bruins hockey when I was  years old. Id sobered up during the series against Montreal and it became a ritual between the old man and I. Every night wed plop down and watch the game. So when Marshy tucked the empty netter both my Dad and I knew that our long wait was over. We had a feeling since game  against the Habs that it was going to be a special run. Its a feeling that I can cherish forever just being with my Dad to watch it all happen. ,BostonBruins,csvk9tf,10,t5_2rmt9

5044695,0,t1_cuu2afc,Yeah Id agree. Its really time to trade someone. The need for defense has never been greater and we just have too many goalies. We should let Gustavsson and Smith duke it out for the backup role then hedge bets on either Subban or McIntyre and let them get the lions share of starts in Providence. At this point I have a feeling its gonna be McIntyre and Subban will be traded. Just my gut. I think the Bruins like him a lot and the fact that he showed them loyalty may go along way. Plus the NCAA has been cranking out quality goalies as of late. Something just seems safer about him versus Subban despite his pedigree. ,BostonBruins,cuu2snu,5,t5_2rmt9

But hes a top  type player. It would be a waste for him to play with grinders. Hell be back in Providence playing top  minutes which is a good thing.

Last year was injury hell with Chara Krejci Seidenberg and as it turned out Marchand.The core hasnt changed. Yeah Looch is gone but he was always  whether he would show up. Yeah we lost Hamilton but he wasnt the guy everyone hyped him up to be. He showed sign of skill but no hint of dominance.This year they told us right from the start our defense is weak. But we have solid young D that arent ready for NHL quite yet and we dont want to give them up in order to bring a Dman in to start the year as the organization had faith that our young admen would grow into their roles sooner rather than later.Sure the start was rocky. The Young inexperienced Dmen looked it.

My advice stand in the aisle at the bottom of the stairs at the glass and dont sit in the seats. Typically the seats by the glass will be open but if the person with the ticket comes the usher will tell you to get up and by then the area by the glass will be gone.

Dumba is an RFA and very Krug like so no thank you .Vatanen is a great puck moving defenseman  but not sure what his cap hit is so Im not sureBrodin is a good defensive defensman he can get points too but he is known for his defense. Hes the one Im most interested in but Loui for Brodin doesnt make any sense because the Wild need a C not another winger.Yandle caught my eye. UFA at the end of the season on a Rangers team that is struggling with defense. Great Offensive minded guy but no slouch in his own end. To top it all off hes from Boston. Only thing is if we give him an offer when hes a UFA i really think hed come home so its a matter of do you want to ship out prospectspicksplayers for a UFA that will probably sign or wait until the summer to get him.

6761614,0,t1_d0iortt,Lets do some math!. from Loui   from Kelley  . from Talbot  . from Kemp  . from Miller  . from Gus   . million cleared. Plus . from Lucic  k from the overage  . which  .   million dollars in free cap space assuming the cap doesnt go up. Divided between  players. Were not gonna replace Kelley with a  million dollar center. So that really only leaves a hole in Louis spot. Everyone else there is easily replaceable with similar contracts. So just counting Loui Kelley and the Lucic  overage cap space minus k for an ELC for Koko or Griffith or somebody else to take Kelleys roster spot that leaves... million dollars to devote to one roster spot deficit. Now lets look at the RFAs. Krug isnt getting a raise especially if the Bruins buy out his remaining RFA time. So Ill call him a wash. That leaves Morrow whos also not getting much of a raise maybe k Trotman same situation Ferraro hell get a small raise if they keep him maybe k Connolly maybe k if hes lucky. So thats what now a net . million dollar cap space increase which can be entirely devoted to filling one roster spot if they want to? And thats assuming they resign everybody but Loui. If they dont resign other guys that number will go up to say . million to be divided into two players etc. OK now lets assume they spend to the max and Marchand needs a raise the following year. Well guess what! One Zdeno Charas contract will be going down from  million to  million. That leaves  million dollars assuming the cap doesnt go up at all to add to the . million dollars Marchand is already getting. Keep in mind it will likely be a long deal. Do you think Marchand gets . millionyear? That would make him the highest paid player on the team. Unless the market dramatically shoots up or he scores  goals hes not gonna get more than . and in reality hell command just a bit less from the Bruins. Hes expressed interest in staying here and almost doubling his pay will probably do the trick.Now you might be saying OK so the Bruins have  to pay for raises to Ryan Spooner whos deal will be expiring that year and David Pastrnak whos deal will also be expiring that year. Well chances are they dont spend all . million they get this offseason on one player and can either resign Spooner  Pasta who will be RFAs or simply trade one of them because the addition of a . million player or two  million players will mean they dont need those guys. And all of that is assuming the cap wont go up. ,BostonBruins,d0iphio,2,t5_2rmt9
6761829,0,t1_d0ipnar,Its always gonna be a concern. Ideally you take that . million spend . on a top  winger and . on a top  defenseman. Whom I know not. Maybe you trade Seids for a real top  guy not a borderline one like he is. thatd free up another  million. Or maybe hopefully prayerfully lol you develop a top  guy or two in Carlo Zboril Chiller and Morrow. Id be surprised to see the Bruins spend to the cap. I think the most likely outcome is they sign another top  winger or resign Loui for . million or so and stash the rest and look for a bigger trade this offseason. ,BostonBruins,d0iqc1j,1,t5_2rmt9

7680080,0,t3_4jwlea,Let me preface this with saying that I think Doc and Eddie are the best in the business. Pierre should just shut his damn mouth.I have a few issues with Edwards. The homer thing is unavoidable I accept that. Beers is worse anyways. What I dislike about Edwards is what I perceive as arrogance. It all started with the infamous As I was driving from the former seat of NHL power... rant. I didnt like the way he compared Chara running Paciorettyin what if I were a fan of any other team I would have called one of the dirtiest plays in modern hockey to the Boston Tea Party. Another example is when he thought a puck went out of play and then proceeded to spend the next  minutes ranting about how this wasnt gonna count and none of this matters and that goal wasnt scored blah blah. Of course the puck didnt go out of play and they didnt erase the time. So we missed out on  full minutes of play by play because this yellowtoothed yahoo thought the puck hit the netting.I dont like the way he goes after the Habs in general. Dont get me wrong I hate those pompous little weasels as much as the next guy. I just think its too much when he stops calling the game to yell at opposing players who are down on the ice GET UP!Another thing is complaining about the refs. You can be a homer and not bitch about refereeing. Not every call is explicitly to screw the Bruins. Brick is worse but Jack still does it too much for my taste.I dont like a lot of his terminology. Things like tumbling muffin and the eddy of the flow which are just utter nonsense. He tries to use interesting words like Doc but he doesnt have the vocabulary for it. However I will admit that hes a better play by play man than announcers in places like Detroit Philly Columbus. The play by play guy in Chicago is just as much of a homer if not more so. He just looks better because Olczyk is the best in the business. Edwards would look a lot better if Brick wasnt such a fool.tldr Jack pisses me off but Id rather have him than Dale Arnold,BostonBruins,d3f6ga7,-1,t5_2rmt9

8887013,0,t3_51yidp,I posted this on a thread before. Its by no means complete but I dont really know shit all about systems stuff. There are some smart people who could actually tell you whats going on probably. gt Bruinsgt In the offensive zone the defensemen are usually really active. They pinch down the wall in attempts to keep the cycle going. Forwards cycle back to cover them ASAP. Its kind of conservative when it comes to the forwards. Usually the center stays as the third man high but sometimes the center is replaced with a more defensively responsible player depending on the composition of the line. gt Forwards like to try to work the halfwalls and spot the forward lurking in the slot hoping hes uncovered. gt Breakouts have been changed by Claude pretty significantly in the past couple of years. This is mostly a reaction to teams playing a more aggressive forecheck with two attackers. The old bruins breakout formula was using the two defensemen down low and moving D to D to try to open up the weak side winger. Thats been changed up a bit in order to promote quicker puck movement since the D have less time. Weak side wingers are encouraged to overload one side of the ice to try to mess up the neutral zone coverage. Additionally the defenseman without the puck usually moves up into the slot in case of a turnover when the other guy is trying to skate or otherwise move out the puck. gt I think the forwards and D are mostly discouraged from high risk plays like stretch passes and instead are supposed to keep everything relatively simple.gt The Bs have been much more aggressive standing up at their blueline lately trying to prevent controlled entries and induce turnovers.gt The defensive zone is a bit harder to read but for the most part the bruins try to collapse to protect the homeplate area around the slot and keep shots to the perimeter. Wingers are responsible for backchecking hard as the D is supposed to hold their lanes rather than challenge guys coming in with the puck. The center plays really really deep in the D zone but is also responsible for watching the high slot. Ill add something about the PP. PP which gets most of the time is set up in an umbrella formation. There is a net front presence it was Eriksson now itll probably be Backes a triggerbumper man in the slot Bergeron. Hes really the key to the power play. He tries to get open to get off a quick shot as much as possible and a point man Krejci. Responsible for distributing the puck mostly to the guys playing the half wall. Spooner plays his off side half wall the right side and Krug plays the other side. A really common play is overload the strong side and then switch as Krug comes down to the hashmarks so he can get off a shot. If he doesnt shoot sometimes the defense will get mixed up and leave Bergeron open. On the PK I just close my eyes until I hear Marchand and Bergeron are on a  on .,BostonBruins,d7g3ddn,14,t5_2rmt9

9710235,0,t1_da87o6k,Its still not bad. The goal there wasnt to improve on Smiths roster spot. It was to get out from the Savard deal and hopefully not suffer too much of a downgrade to do it. Everyone knew or should have known Hayes was a downgrade from Smith.Smith was also going to be earning himself a nice payday. Sweeney didnt want to commit which fine so he kicked the can down the road by getting a less skilled player in return whose salaryperformance would be more at home in a depth role.I think with that in mind everythings pretty much gone according to plan. Hayes came with plenty of disclaimers on the box and has justified all of them but everyone should have known thats what the Bruins were getting. Some big fat financial relief in dealing Savard  not paying Smith and a plug.I think some homers saw  local kid and started drooling before doing their homework. ,BostonBruins,da9zu7w,3,t5_2rmt9

Doesnt that seem like something Chia wouldve done? I dont think its a coincidence.gt got nothing for EricssonSeveral reasons for this. Bruins were in a playoff spot at the time. If they trade Eriksson thats them giving up on that. No way in hell does Jacobs allow that. Also no one was buying at all on deadline. Remember how dead it was? They werent going to get anything for him. And he clearly tried to sign him again but Eriksson didnt want that. He more than likely offered the same thing Backes got but Eriksson wanted to play with the Sedins. Shit happens.gt reached more than once in the draft Those reaches assuming you mean Debrusk Senyshyn and Frederic are all looking pretty decent right now. I actually dont even count Frederic as a reach since it was basically a second round pick anyways. Beyond  its a crap shoot. You can reach all you want if you have the eye for talent. So far even with late picks Sweeney looks like he knows what hes doing.gt fired the staff of one of the best coaches in the league only to replace them with idiotsIt was time for those guys to go. Our pk was a fucking mess last year. On paper even with the roster we had it shouldve been a lot better. Thats on those guys for not adjusting. I hate Sacco as much as everyone but I give him a bit of slack there because hes only been in for a year and he managed to do some good things with the powerplay last year. I do agree he should be gone. The other guys are fine. Our pk is incredible and Cassidy is helping the young guys to transition. You say the jury is out on Sweeney but you call those guys idiots without even a full season of NHL coaching with this team.,BostonBruins,dbz2g3v,1,t5_2rmt9
10191925,0,t1_dby1u20,gtBasically every single core player on our team is shooting significantly below their career average. Were playing well. The goals will come. We just need to be patient. Every year there are a few teams that start off in a similar way where they are dominating in Corsi but just cant put the puck in the net. Those teams always turn it around. Boston and Florida are those teams this year.Here is my concern we are  games into the season as of Thursday we are halfway done at some point its time to accept this may just be who this team is this year for whatever reason.,BostonBruins,dbzb7ot,1,t5_2rmt9

10619723,0,t1_ddalkab,Its not about winning every single year. Were stuck in the middle yes but itll be worth it. Pittsburgh did it like this too the difference being they made the playoffs those years because they have the  most offensively talented centers in the league except when they play us  goals in  games neverforget. Most of us me especially forget about the big picture. This year has been frustrating as fuck as have the past two years but next year we can see some sort of payoff. Senyshyn McAvoy Zboril Lauzon OGara DeBrusk JFK could all make an appearance at some point next season. Right now yes it sucks. No depth scoring and the D sucks. But we got some great talent that can produce more than pts in gms Beleskey Hayes and Nash combined right there. The only thing we can hope for is our core not slowing down and have the current young players make an impact. Carlo Pastrnak and Vatrano have done great. Might also be surprised that Spooner has ! points  of which are PP points hes sucked and has been invisible but hes putting up points with a trash bottom six . As for the core the top  pointscorers are Marchand Pasta core player now for sure Krejci Krug can debate if hes a core player Id say yes for now and Bergeron. Tuukka has also been amazing. Well at least for the first  games. You really cant blame him though as hes played  out of  fucking games and our defense has regressed. Hes still elite. Yeah well need to acquire a real top dman at some point and hed ideally be a lefty. Kevin Shattenkirk is a righty but he might be too good to pass up considering we dont have to trade anything and hes only . Anyways thats my  cents. Itll be worth it for the next  years if some of the players pan out and everything seems fine for now.,BostonBruins,ddbcehn,2,t5_2rmt9

10752438,0,t1_ddoy1jm,Thats why they need to trade someone with a big cap hit DK is really your best bet. very few teams will take him with that contract and he has to waive his NMC. But ideally you trade Kreci get rid of m in cap space and free up another center spot like you said we are full of em then that works out. But very few GMs would make this deal. i wouldnt mind GL but still i feel like if we sit back and do nothing its going to pan out. With the three game winning streak looking really fucking good during it as well and the fact that we were a bubble team this year anyway be sellers at the deadline. get some picks a few prospects Shatty if you know you can sign him long term after his contract is up.

10753702,0,t1_ddozq3v,gt The Hamilton trade netted  of our very best prospects. People often cite that as one of his bad trades amp I dont get it. Its too early to tell if its a win but it certainly doesnt look terrible either.Thats not how trades work. You judge it based on value ie getting a first and two seconds for what was considered to be a guy who would be top two some day. You could trade your star player for a seventh round draft pick and select the next Brady that doesnt mean you won the trade it means you won the draft. Even then from your perspective the fact that its too early to tell immediately mitigates your point. Those prospects could just as easily bust. gt People also say he should have got more in return but Calgary was very likely to offer sheet him for a st nd amp rdSo you fucking match them. How is that difficult? How is that a circumstance that forces Sweeney to cuck himself out to Calgary and cave and everyone figures oh he did good because he got a second instead of a third. Even if you match you can still trade him. Hes just worth more because he has term. Im not saying Sweeney was in a good position but he got played like a fucking rookie and it shows. Look at Cheveldayoff. Trouba didnt want to play so he threw his weight around. He wasnt budged by smoke and mirrors about an offer sheet from Boston into giving up a player he wanted. gt Senyshyn JFK and Lauzon is potentially a terrific return for a GM backed into a corner.They werent the return.

11779497,0,t1_dgv8ekb,Thanks for the jist of things. I like his way of thinking and definitely agree with getting a solid back up goaltender. I feel like we should go for a good back up and maybe try something more towards an even split in terms of starts. It has clearly been evident that Tuukka becomes worn out and has some real shitty games and Dobby just isnt on the same level. I think another good goalie would help both of them stay sharp the entire season. ,BostonBruins,dgv8rz3,15,t5_2rmt9

11799065,0,t3_68c6x7,The Bruins can make a trade to Vegas in agreement to not selected an unprotected player The Bruins can also make a trade with Vegas in agreement to compensate selecting an unprotected player.We have options. We also have the option of there being better players available then ours and Vegas skims over them which could always happen. But I think the Bruins make a trade with a pick possibly nd round and maybe a prospect in order to protect Kevan Miller or Colin Miller. ,BostonBruins,dgxgqkb,1,t5_2rmt9
