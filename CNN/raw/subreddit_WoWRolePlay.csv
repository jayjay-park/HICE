363286,0,t3_1y959b,| Guild Website qimeng.enjin.comA RP Qimeng  From Unity StrengthquoteiA notice is sent out to all corners of Pandaria and to the foreign cities beyond by way of scroll. A sevenpointed golden leaf is emblazoned above the writing.iIt is when we hit our lowest point that we are open to the greatest change. These are the words of our former leader the rising Emperor Zuchen Baizhou Gentlefist and the words that best describe the history of our land and people.The foundations of Qimeng were laid twelve thousand years ago during a time when pandaren were still slaves under the oppressive hands of the mogu. In this early form it served as a refuge for those who managed to find their way to the safety of the Jade Forest. Over the years it grew into a sanctuary from the vile overlords and then a beacon of the uprising against them. After the fall of the mogu the pandaren took up their tools again of their own will this time to raise the sanctuary into a temple. It was made a home for Yulon the Jade Serpent and her wisdom guided the people in the new era.Ten thousand years later the mists that shrouded our land subsided and foreign armies took to our shores. The mogu reawakened and the Sha broke free from its chains. But we were unprepared scattered across the land separated. The Lorewalkers explored the bloodline of our last emperor and found the closest possible heir in the transcendent Zuchen Gentlefist who took on the title on behalf of his people. Caught between two great and belligerent powers and awash with ancient enemies Lord Zuchen saw the need for a rebirth of pandaren might and common purpose a kind of second empire through which the land and its inhabitants could again secure their own destiny.He gathered pandaren to his side to face the evils tearing at the land and after many hardships and many victories he felt that his role was complete. He called us together once more to tell us that Pandaria no longer needed an emperor. It was time for the people to rule themselves united and strong he said. And with that he vanished into the mists leaving us with his memories and lessons and the family that is Qimeng.Now under the leadership of a council loyal to the orders ideals Qimeng continues toward its goal of rallying the people so that we may all stand strong against the darkness. Pandaria has fallen to its lowest point and the time has come for us to rise. Brothers and sisters we ask for your assistance in this. Help us achieve harmony in our land not only for a better tomorrow but for a better today.Master Nalanfu SyeFormer Teacher of Emperor ZucheniAt the end of the scroll is Qimengs contact information and application procedure.iquotebGuild Siteb qimeng.enjin.com,WoWRolePlay,cfif52a,1,t5_2vpbg
3246061,0,t1_coygatx,Im not positive but its fairly straight forward and you dont have to think about it very long. It also makes sure that everyone sees the same thing so you dont have to worry about if that important paragraph in your addon cant be seen by rds of the population.,WoWRolePlay,coygnnz,1,t5_2vpbg

5855354,0,t3_3vf81x,When I started roleplaying during WotLK I was already a lore junky but unfamilliar with how rp worked so my first character was an orc warrior and just a copy of Garrosh Hellscream. I mean as in really him. I thought that was how it worked...,WoWRolePlay,cxn5ypt,6,t5_2vpbg

7357186,0,t1_d2e356n,As was said below roll temp Orc and Belf toons on each server and go inspect the Valley of Honor in Orgrimmar and Silvermoon City. See which communities offer up more of what you are looking for and make your choice then. Both spots are the major hubs.,WoWRolePlay,d2egmtc,3,t5_2vpbg
7411651,0,t1_d0gyqf6, This.Also Nelf but youll have to work a bit to fit the lore better.Draenei and Worgen are the worst IMHO.Gnomes borderline but youll have to build a really strong back story. Gnomes fit amazing as mages and warlocks but not much else IMHO.EDITI RP as a Human DK in AD EU and had no major problems. ,WoWRolePlay,d2knmgn,1,t5_2vpbg

7966558,0,t3_4nr291,You sound similar to me. One of the other subs made a guild on WRA and I decided I wanted to try to dive in but I personally didnt really know any of the hotspots on Horde side and Alliance side Im just totally freaking lost. Im thinking of trying to go harder at it if I can remake some of my mains from my main server since I actually have stories fleshed out for them.,WoWRolePlay,d4bilzi,1,t5_2vpbg

8140827,0,t3_4qnqnn,You may not.  Its also unacceptable to play a crystalriding interdimensionalferrying space goat unless you actually are one in real life too.  We will require pictures to prove the validity of your hooves and horns friend.  ... its roleplay.  Its fantasy.  Do what makes you happy.,WoWRolePlay,d4v5d5i,6,t5_2vpbg
8762624,0,t3_4zh5nq,Alliance main here from Moon Guard! I have two characters right now Im currently trying to get set up for Legion. Spent most of WoD not playing the game but have been playing since BC and RPdRaided through every other expansion.Neither are very set in stone as far as where theyre going. But I have other characters that are blank and can be messed around with.  If youre still looking for someone to bounce ideas off with or just talk to about RP in general feel free to shoot me a message! Good luck! D,WoWRolePlay,d70zmj7,1,t5_2vpbg
8862838,0,t3_51lvga,Moon Guard and WyrmrestAccord are both good servers for Alliance RP in NA whereas WyrmrestAccord itself is your best bet for Horde RP in NA. Apparently Argent Dawn is the EU RP server of choice.Moon Guard is the more lenient of the two I am told. As in mistakes in the Lore and Role Playing odd and outofplace things are less rejected there coming from personal experience. WyrmrestAccord seems to be the more elitist of the two in terms of Alliance RP though thats not necessarily a bad thing.The two most basic rules to WoW RP in general are one  just dont be a Mary Sue with your character this extends to dont Role Play as the one main character hero with the legendary Artifact Weapon that all quests from Warlords of Draenor make you out to be and two  understand the basics of the Warcraft Lore especially surrounding the kind of character you want to RP as.,WoWRolePlay,d7d6sm2,3,t5_2vpbg
9131610,0,t3_54xpcb,A few days late but I hope you dont mind. Mine is a little bit flowery and gross but I blame it on me mostly doing long forumprivate stuff in the past.Adelard C.Phillips unsheathes a shaking hand from his pocket to pull off his hat and place it onto the stand. His wrinkled wanskinned face is gilded with carefully perfumed hair and his spine is lightly curved into a crescent and thus the frailfigured upmarketedlydressed gentleman supports himself upon an oaken walking cane. Forgive me for being late James he says quietly before setting down beside him.,WoWRolePlay,d89hws5,1,t5_2vpbg

10767039,0,t1_ddqbjea,Yep. I agree with what you say and when I see people like this I assume they might just not know or maybe they just didnt stop to think about it. However sometimes you hit a wall with people that simply refuse both ooc and ic to listen to you.When told someone may want to attack them for it they say and if they do Ill kill them dude you cant kill them all people will help them not you they will help me when I raise them in undeath... Its just silly and immature so I end up doing a simple ignore because its perfectly ok to not know something and be willing to learn. Its also ok to have different opinions in something that isnt lore specified... But when you are just plain stupid... Thats just not fun to have around.,WoWRolePlay,ddqjgmr,1,t5_2vpbg
10923927,0,t1_de6km92,You could be experimenting with Time Magic. In the Legendary Ring quest line for Warlords of Draenor you have to battle with Khadgar and the Bronze Dragon Chromie.  Khadgar lets you choose your role take the hits deal damage or heal them. If you choose healer Chromie focuses on damage and Khadgar draws fire with an arcane elemental. If you choose anything else Chromie uses time magic to rewind time and restore your body to the point where you werent injured. Since Time Magic is no longer limited to Bronze Dragons this might be a good path. ,WoWRolePlay,de6q6j5,3,t5_2vpbg
