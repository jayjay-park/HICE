428146,0,t1_cfoux9q,I havent seen any object in ethereum that really is a contract? Basically scripts can be contracts by their behavior but contract isnt neccesarily the right word for it.I reckon a script can only be a contract if at least one person has a intrinsic link a  to it. Afaictbut is early it can only be abusive between people if there are at least two persons intrinsically linked to.There are scripts with one special party or zero. The dropbox one basically has zero anyone can put more coin in the tank to keep the data storage going. However if the storage is very important to a particular person... Maybe it could be intriniscally linked. It could for instance prove that a blackmailer has incriminating information it could still force a particular person to pay to it. However this is an overly technological way of doing something that could also be done by sending a simple message with a hint. But it demonstrates the principle that if scripts link to people isnt neccesarily obvious.Btw if a script stops without doing anything it is invalid and would not get on the blockchain right? Or should that be a manual thing?,ethereum,cfp557h,1,t5_2zf9m

1732085,0,t1_cjxh1ly,gt So youre saying that Im not being imaginative enough and am simply replicating centralized paradigms on top of a decentralized system instead of taking the full range of what becomes possible.Exactly. We didnt achieve flight by emulating birds but a lot of earlier models were trying to emulate thatlike Da Vincis flying machine. We learned from the birds what could be learnedlike aerodynamics and volume and then we built flying machines million times larger than the largest flying bird.I too have been forced to go through a paradigm shift because of bitcoin and techs like these. I always imagined that a decentralized currency would look like Walmartdollars or Amazonbucks.Same goes here if we could build a protection agency on Ethereum it wouldnt look like NYPD if we could build an arbitration system on blockchain it wont be a Supreme Court on block chain. If we can come up with a way to control in the society through a decentralized network it wont be done by putting government on a block chain.Futarchy is nothing but Democracy on a blockchain. A proper use of Ethereum isnt that we can all vote on which Fast Food chain should we all buy our food from but to eliminate tying of our decision making to each other.gt Although I will argue that centralization is useful in certain contexts and what we really want is not to maximally decentralize everything that we can but rather to figure out how to best combine the different paradigms to maximize utility.Yes I agree but stock market and stock ownership is already one such medium and more decentralized than the system you are coming up with.Stock Market is neither a betting system nor a prediction market. Stock market is a place where people trade the ownership of capital goods. They are not betting on which stock price would be valued higher by others but rather they actually wanna value a more productive capital good higher and less productive capital good lower.Implementing a prediction market on a companys policy makes no sense. If you have money go buy stocks in the company and vote in proportion to your ownership of the stocksmost companies already have one stock  one vote model.If you dont have enough money then you can leverage your positions by going for financial derivativesoptions futures etc. All these problems are already solved with a lot more money spentover time than you possibly can imagine being spent on. In fact most people complain about stock trading being too fastHFT.,ethereum,cjxhshk,0,t5_2zf9m
1788443,0,t3_2f03bi,Abstractgt While several consensus algorithms exist for the Byzantine Generals Problem specifically as itpertains to distributed payment systems many suffer from high latency induced by the requirementthat all nodes within the network communicate synchronously. In this work we present a novelconsensus algorithm that circumvents this requirement by utilizing collectivelytrusted subnetworkswithin the larger network. We show that the trust required of these subnetworks is in fact minimaland can be further reduced with principled choice of the member nodes. In addition we show thatminimal connectivity is required to maintain agreement throughout the whole network. The result is alowlatency consensus algorithm which still maintains robustness in the face of Byzantine failures. Wepresent this algorithm in its embodiment in the Ripple Protocol.Probably not relevant to Ethereum . but thought it might be interesting in relation to longterm scalability ideas.,ethereum,ck4l2r2,3,t5_2zf9m

Do you think I should have to pay a third party to make those transfers e.g. ? It is more convenient it is more efficient and it is faster to use Bitcoin assuming Bitcoin is actually usable as money. If you claim that something like Paypal is faster or as fast  then no because what gets credited immediately in Paypal is an account. This is an IOU.

Anyways could it not work something like this If you wish to subscribe to the Law of dont sell cigarettes to children you subscribe to the DAO some set of ethereum contracts that enforces it. There would be maybe three types of subscribers. Consumers who pay some small user fee to have this law enforced. Businesses who wish to be certified as not selling to children. Enforcers arbiters? who check in on the businesses and receive some pay as incentive for checking in on the businesses.This all seems doable through ethereum if not a massive amount of work and mainstream adoption away and I dont think any of the necessary contracts would even need the full power of a turing machine.

Ripple Pebble Tendermint Bitshares Maidsafe Factom etc all have equally complicated stuff behind the scenes and dont even mention SNARKs....From my personal experience Ive often seen myself initially thinking that some system is so complex its never going to work then actually taking the time to read into it and finally figuring out the nugget that makes it all work and being in a good position to see its merits and sometimes criticize it. My conclusion has been that most major . platforms despite the common just a whitepaper and scam epithets actually are very interesting and quite theoretically sound and although I often am quite uncomfortable with some of their fundamental assumptions I can see how someone who is okay with holding those assumptions can reasonably deduce that their algorithm works okay and so interesting debate can follow on which of our preferred sets of assumptions is closer to the truth.The fact is some things just have to be fundamentally complex with multiple interlocking parts in order to ensure maximum robustness and security.

Humans should only hold ether if theyre interested in development mining or are speculators.  the end user should always be using a derivative app coin like a stable dollar or schelling coin so theyre free to use money as money and not as a speculative asset. ,ethereum,crxiw7f,3,t5_2zf9m

Just trying to find out if theres any way we can make it less ddos prone.

5265909,0,t1_cvkiisp,He addresses Peercoin and notes that it uses PoW in places. For him thats proof that PoS isnt viable. Personally I dont think of that as proof PoS cannot work but rather that Peercoins particular version of PoS requires some PoW to be maximally effective. I have no problem with mixing PoW and PoS if it results in a more effective system personally. And Im honestly okay with strong subjective proof. Its practical enough and it does nothing to compromise the core value of cryptocurrency as a means for uncensorable transactions. I am more of a pragmatist than a purist these days.As for PoS being cheaper Im not sure that it will be once you take into account the opportunity costs of locking up large sums of ether. I agree that you need the process of securing the network to be expensive in order for it to be effective. If it were cheap then it would also be cheap to compromise the networks consensus.But whereas PoW produces negative externalities due to its high use of electricity PoS produces fewer such negative externalities. It also broadens the base of competitors in theory because there is no specialized hardware required to participate.Of course I havent read the authors paper on why he thinks PoW is cheaper yet so maybe he sees something I dont.,ethereum,cvks1en,3,t5_2zf9m

If you just disable all the cores in cgminer or sgminer it can still control fan memory settings for the GPU as ethminer does not have this capability.  This way both programs run but cgminer handles the graphics card with low level control and ethminer mines the coins.and you probably want a stratumproxy as well.EDIT I am guessing you have a V ASUS becasue its the only one I know with  for a memclock if this is the case you really want memclock at  because thats like  mhash per sec,ethereum,cz6uahu,2,t5_2zf9m

6852774,0,t1_d0smdnt,Youre right.The reframing of ethereum as the virtual machine was because of the Crypto trend that everything just gets traded on the exchange the devs didnt want everything else ethereum can do to fall flat on its face and never go into use.This doesnt mean they didnt want it to be traded and used as a currency just that they wanted its other uses to come to the forefront with its adoption.If they had framed it as a cryptocurrency then thats all that wouldve happened only hobbyists and enthusiasts would have gotten into developing trustless software and other applications for it. The wider community bitcoin speculators would have simply thrown it on an exchange. This is the reason it was framed as something larger and distinct from regular cryptocurrencies and this decision has helped to drive its value.,ethereum,d0t2jdc,2,t5_2zf9m

I only tossed in a small amount because I think its extremely risky.That being said the stablecoin aspect is attractive. Tying a digital token to an asset like gold on the Ethereum blockchain could prove to be very successful. The central point of failure scares me but if they prove to be profitable I would hope to see competitors come out with their own DAOs.If crypto is ever really going to be successful as money we need some kind of stablecoin mechanism. This is one possibility. Im imagining a future where theres competing Digixlike DAOs for gold and silver and where people store part of their ETH in these assets as a hedge against price volatility.

You need PR people marketing people a person who is going to run the day to day a few developers to start. You need someone who is familiar with merchants their problems and figure out how your solution will be the solution. Then you need some designers  UX people to design and build a usable interface...for both users and merchants. Then customer support for users and for merchants. Youll need to pay a company to do multiple security audits. Youll need to hire someone who really know the development world to find and vet exceptional developers and convince them to work for you because frankly based on your pitch above you are going to need a lot of help.Oh and youll need all this for each app.You will need to spend a few months putting together a pitch deck and business plan. You will need to do market research. You will need to know exactly what you are going to go to market with and market research showing that people will pay you for this. You will need to estimate how long itll take to go to market and what essential people you will be hiring. So lets say that youll go to market with an MVP in  year.  developers  kyear  marketing  support  helpers kyear Youll take a salary kyear? going to be greedy? Design lets low ball kapp A single security audit before launch k Office? Phones? Marketingadvertising budget? Website? Private github account? Payroll services? HR services? Other contractors? I would say that kmonth is a reasonable but EXTREMELY tight overhead for what you are trying to do. Thatll get you maybe to MVP if absolutely NOTHING goes wrong you are the most excellent leader on the face of this planet your devs are kickass your marketing  customer support team works overtime for free and has unlimited levels of dedication and passion and you gain traction in the community naturally. Oh and lets not forget youll need a Money Transmitters license in all  states.

7210071,0,t1_d1xlk4v,The point of functional programming isnt to eliminate the notion of state that would have made it utterly useless it is to model computations using functions. There are several wellknown techniques for modeling stateful computations.For example there is a functional programming language called Elm designed specifically for web programming. The first example in their tutorial is a counter which is obviously stateful.The type of update function in this example is Action gt Model gt Model which is very similar to what I wrote above.There is no notion of destroying an existing state instance in functional programming language a function should just create a new state possibly based on old one. Or just return the old one if modifications arent necessary.So whats the point? The point is that working with the state becomes explicit and fine grained. E.g. you can easily tell which functions work with a state just by looking at their type.  You can easily tell which functions are readonly. You can pass individual component of a state to a function instead of passing the whole thing etc.In theory it should make it easier to analyze code as it can be broken into separate pieces which can be analyzed in isolation.,ethereum,d1xq8rf,7,t5_2zf9m

Regulating exchanges KYC rules daily limits permits taxes etc etc etc ad nausea.  State engages in smear campaigns against limitedemission public cryptos reporting on their role in crime and anything that can sway public opinion.  Eventually some kind of crypto is created and promoted that is not limited emission and the emission is in the hands of state. Alternatively and much better for the population several competing offers emerge from big institutions sadly big in US equals stateconnected.

Its not a great idea to encourage arbitrary execution. Youre opening the floodgates for all kinds of attacks on users who dont know better. For the time being maybe it would be possible for the exchanges to centrally manage what function calls are allowed to which contracts? Its not a longterm solution but something a bit more restrictive seems necessary to prevent unintended loss. EditThis reply was mostly in response to the implications of EIP  referenced by OP in hisher post. After reviewing some of the responses in this thread Im not sure the criticism applies.

Lower demand for the porn due to saturationrecycling less need to abuse child to produce it.Alternatively you can make artificial child porn lolicon whatever that doesnt involve abusing children. Its likely a competitive good meaning that consumption of the peoplefree soylent green will decrease the consumption of peoplefull soylent green.Generally the more pornography the less sex crime across all cultures and the next best bet is to reduce this is to teach selfdefense but presuming that you are dealing with children or already abused children its a bit late and difficult to do that.The rest follows from fearbased politics and moral crusades.

The payouts are based on accurately predicting the DCW not anything more complex than that. Yes that means that some bettors will get lucky but the market value should coalesce to the markets best guess about the outcome which is all you need to make decisions.So for instance if the market price for the future DCW after policy X is implemented is . and the expected value after policy Y is . then the market believes policy X is . points better than policy Y. In reality the value might end up being . or . but thats the risk you take in any market and why traders can make money by being more accurate.gt What happens if people participating in the prediction market also have a stake in the proposal going through?In theory their manipulation should be noticed by the market and canceled out. Some trader looks at the market and says That looks too high for me. Im going to sell it and make a profit.The paper even suggests that people will actively watch for that sort of manipulation in order to counteract it because someone with a vested interest buying in is a good sign the price is overvalued.,ethereum,d3vv915,1,t5_2zf9m

7888270,0,t1_d42f3en,gt I like the idea and the team but the ROI should not be capped. This is seed round funding so an equity stake andor permanent rights to cashflow should be included in the deal.Agreed the ROI model presented was because we didnt know we still dont of a model to guarantee ownership rather than cash flow.  We proposed a cap of  mm because it is paid out of top line revenue a permanent drainage of that level of cash would likely suck too much capital for future growth.If we can migrate to a permanent equity model to have unlimited upside for The DAO I agree that would be best.  We can design a combined model cash flow  equity.Please let me know if you can think of structure that would seem more reasonable. Example. The DAO gets  equity for  mm investment. The DAO gets  of topline revenue up to  mm cap not  mm to recover original investment. Whenever future cash flows are paid to any owners founders and investors The DAO gets  of that payment. In the case of liquidity event acquisition IPO etc. The DAO gets  of the produce of the liquidity event. The DAO and all founders may be diluted if another DAO or traditional VC invests in a future round. The DAO may have first refusal for all future roundsAs you can see the above is a synthetic of traditional model if we can implemented technically in a trust minimized way we are all for it. PS The  mm cap was also questioned here we definitely dont want this to be an impediment for this deal,ethereum,d42pqej,7,t5_2zf9m

Beyond them simply asserting it there was no legal finding that said they were allowed to do this so it is unknown if that would fly in court. But the thing is In other plain English statements they said splitting would allow you to extract your own ETH from the DAO but not anyone elses. So they said things that were unwittingly mutually contradictory. Given the haze I think a judge would very likely go with the nonfancy plain English definitions of thievery without regard to the code. It would certainly be extremely risky for the hacker to come forward and assert in court that he is the one who took the coins.

Yet I think almost everybody not just the miners view this specific instance as a theft that should be reversed if it can be and it can.I say that even though I never held any DAO tokens I actually only got started with Ethereum a few days before the hack so I didnt even know what The DAO was at that time. But one of the problems is the sheer amount of ETH that this fiasco involved and I support a fork for this situation.I think in the future we should definitely consider implementing far better systems for handling nasty bugs when they occur and perhaps limiting somehow the size of future daos and dapps so that no smart contract becomes an entity that is too big to fail. By that a mean an entity that has amassed so much ether that its failure would result in an economic catastrophe for ethereum.  I dont envision the Ethereum platform becoming one where forks are done willynilly or to attack the network but only when there is a clear and evident wrongdoing that must be fixed. Forks should be considered absolute last resorts in my opinion and the general focus when the Ethereum community moves on from this should be strengthening security of smart contracts.

In actuality all Eth holders benefit in that Ethereum gets positive PR and that an attacker does not walk away with  of all Ether.gtIt reeks of conflict of interest with developers acknowledged as major DAO stakeholders.Unfortunate yes but unavoidable unless we bar all developers from investing in the Ethereum ecosystem which would be worse imo. So we have to live with the fact that when something raises  of all Ether and becomes a major part of the Ethereum network the devs will have a leg within it. They are obviously genuinely interested and want to be a part of the future. We have to then just ask and hope that they act professionally and they have to hopefully live up to our expectations. This is just how it has to be.

8213722,0,t3_4rtpmm,I work in Politics and Government in the states and find the potential reaches of Ethereum into governing to be fascinating. I do have a few points to add to the hybrid system theory. The idea of the exponential vote growth benefits the holder over the trader which is a positive outcome as it appeals to actual participants in the ecosystem and dissuades the most obvious type of tipping the scale i.e. from a whale trading in from BTC and trading back out postvote.What it doesnt seem to completely intertwine is the direct democracy component. Lets look at this for a moment like the US Congress where one branch is proportional by state Coin Vote is comparable and the other is static at two representatives per state Like a direct vote regardless of token holding. The proportionality piece is evident Richer voters get to vote their share and poorer get a smaller share. The idea of balance comes from the time dedicated exponential vote increase with the idea the poorer voters can put their stake on the line for a longer period of time balancing the scales but its not without fault. Richer participants could vote multiple times in different amounts from different addresses with some nominal figure say  set aside for maximum voting time. This would allow that actor to allocate most of their capital where it can be most quickly moved like an exchange while still having a high impact on the vote.Poorer voters like the check to check working class employee might not be willing to use that exponential element if it means locking up what little token capital that they had to lose.   Regardless these theories can be tested in real time maybe not on something as large as the HF but regardless the potential impact of the system is overwhelming and the ability to test it in real time is an incredible use case for future smart contract development. ,ethereum,d549pyg,3,t5_2zf9m

I feel that OO style concurrency is a rabbit hole we dont want to take Solidity down and throwing a mutex in there to accomplish this makes me a bit queasy since were not actually dealing with real objects. The EVM is just running down the callstack right? if so when it encountered some kind of BEGIN TRAN command couldnt it load all the operations for each contract inside of the transaction block into the same temporary execution space to accomplish the same thing? This instead of executing each contracts code in its own memory space before moving to the next ... my understanding of how the EVM works is limited so apologies if thats wrong or doesnt make sense. ,ethereum,d5o05ga,4,t5_2zf9m

8438366,0,t1_d5w2ea9,In making them miserable Im not saying well get rid of them entirely. Theyll always linger around like a swarm of locusts... slowly draining the ecosystem of value. While Id strongly prefer exterminating them I can also recognize how the community lacks the will to mount the more aggressive kind of retaliation that I think would be in our best interest. I seem to be in a minority with that view.Ive noticed a lot you are just trying to ignore them or move on or make peace. Thats your choice of course. But personally I believe this attitude will accomplish nothing. Its a very naive and detrimental approach in my opinion. I dont believe we can take it easy on the ETC folks. Its clear as day these people are our enemy. So in making them miserable all I mean to claim is that well be forced to break their spirit in an economic and social sense more than anything.I doubt well use technical attacks against them. I doubt well waste resources DDoSing and forking them. Rather what seems most likely to happen is that well merely continue to criticize ridicule disassociate and outperform them. At this point the most socially acceptable  politically correct form of retaliation is likely to be a whole sale staggered liquidation of our ETC holdings in exchange for ETH. In this way we can depreciate the value of their chain and increase their investment risks. Thatll have to be an ongoing process. We cant just dump everything and ignore them. Theyre very intent on building out ETC to compete with ETH. They have a lot of support from influential figures in the cryptocommunity and loads of capital to absorb our supply. Thats a shaky threat wed be wise to keep our eyes on. Basically theres too much animosity towards this group to permit them to benefit at the expense of the Ethereum ecosystem. Based on their current behavior and what theyre likely to do in the future well be forced to actively oppose them in the ways I describe is my expectation. Overall I agree with you that they can do whatever they want on their chain and that this will redirect a lot of illicit  immoral projects away from Ethereum further differentiating us from ETC. So in that sense I agree. They can run their scams in their own corner and pump their shitcoin to the moon for all I care. However to think that well just stand idly by and give them an easy time of it is absurd. This groups only aim is to plunder our innovations and hard work and tarnish Ethereums public image. They want nothing more than to destroy us. People who behave in this manner should be crippled and crushed where they stand. ,ethereum,d5wc2i6,0,t5_2zf9m

The ethereum foundation cant sell me a token with a name and then demand that I stop using the name they gave the product they sold me.ETC is not a competing product it is the token people received in exchange for bitcoin in the crowdsale.  ETH is a new cryptocurrency with new rules.  I agree completely with your economic assessment of ETC.  It will lose most of its value over the next month.  Im not sure if it will go to zero any time soon but it has little future.  I own zero ETC.  gtOr do you really think a clone chain relying entirely for development from another community has any realistic chance of surpassing the actual ethereum project? LOLThis is illogical.  Youre misframing how cryptocurrencys succeed.  Its all network effects.  As I said ETC is extremely unlikely to survive but not because its a clone.  Its not.  Its literally ethereum.  Miners mine the most profitable blockchains.  Developers code on the blockchain with the most users or the one they think will have the most users in the future.

If you just want some simple token trading ideas or basic principles of economics etc I can only give you my opinion.  You have to make your own decisions.You dont seem to genuinely want to listen and understand the answers to your questions you just keep repeating the bias you had from the start.People who have been watching us for more than a couple weeks have been aware of and waiting for this fundraising for months.  With this news the price went up from  to where it is now with an overshoot which pretty much always happens.  But thats our fault right?  The  month to next funding round was published in the OP of bitcointalk our blog etc.  The free market decides how much they want to support the continuation of the project and buys accordingly.  They know what stage were in what our plans our and where the technology is going is capable of.  It takes years to get these things off the ground and more have failed because they took their funding all at once than have succeeded.  Rushing things also opens the doors for hacks and meltdowns as we have seen in the past months.You keep trying to box synereo into the completely invented and unproven ways that other startups have done in the cryptoworld and refuse to let any other methods in from generations of other industries learning form how to finance complex longrange projects.  Staggered funding like like this is standard best practices and well known and respected.  The hacker ways were not only oneoffs in history but clearly inferior.  How much money do those others have after getting it all at once to continue the next phase?  What kind of pressure does that put on the early dev team?  Enough to commit suicide?  Yep that happened too.  Then the projects just got dumped in the wild and have not gone anywhere since.  I see no reason for not being proud of the fact that weve chosen better ways for the project to succeed.Creating something new begins in the mind of the person and that is a central domain by default.  Its a long process to become a decentralized organization and you cant just do it overnight or without any control over the direction of the project  things would never be done right that way.  Out of control is not a valid business plan as you seem to suggest.Theres a lot of change when these funding rounds enter circulation doing it the way you suggest would wreak x the havoc you seem to be complaining about.  This way keeps the volatility down and keeps the price from being driven up to ridiculous levels where they would then just crash down much much worse.The last  day average price was  sat.  How is it bad that the tokens are being sold for  now?  I dont see where you are coming from unless you literally mean you just bought your first AMPs at the  hour period before the sale price was announced.  Even then if you have not sold these you have not lost anything yet.

8856748,0,t3_51hpmo,Good piece. Im still struggling with your interpretation of part three of the test though. Yes naturally people invested in the hope they would make a profit. But it was also known that Ethereum whether successfully developed or not has no real value without users. People speculated on there being a proliferation of third party dApps that would increase the demand for ether. These dApps have nothing to do with the crowdsale initiated by the Ethereum Foundation. Evidence of this fact is that the price didnt really appreciate until Microsoft started playing with the platform. Further an average of approx m ETH per month has been mined since the ICO. People had perfect information about this rate of seignorage and had no way of knowing whether demand would outstrip it  just like people buying gold hope global demand outweighs the amount of new gold coming onto the market. On a side note how could this mined ether be reasonably treated differently in the eyes of the law to the ICO ether without destroying fungibility? This is why the Foundations use of the word of fuel to describe ether and many governments classification of cryptoassets as commodities is in my view far more appropriate.I also agree with the top comment here that the debate is academic in any event. Enforcing securities laws on cryptocurrency crowdsales is largely a fools errand. It would require global cooperation on a scale far far beyond what states are able to muster now. ,ethereum,d7cgf8z,4,t5_2zf9m

8916554,0,t1_d7jjeuo,Thanks utwigwam and uvbuterin for pointing this out. During the design of the contract we discussed this topic in depth as well as some of our early reviewers  we indeed acknowledged some of our bug bounty to somebody pointing out a certain aspect of this. This is a very complex field and classical insurers and regulators have invented a plethora of mechanisms to prevent exactly that. For example in most legal systems it is forbidden to bet on someones else life. Imagine someone bets a million on the fact that youre no longer alive tomorrow! For our little experiment our means were limited. To keep things simple and the contracts deployment costs below the block gas limit we choose to simply limit the maximum total payout on a certain risk. This does not limit the number of policies as long as the premiums and the payouts are low. But in average a maximum of  policies with the maximum premium of  ETH is allowed on a certain flight. Youll get a cluster risk decline on your application yes the frontend does not show this yet  this will follow in the next days we apologize on that! If you are impatient you can watch the logs with Mist in the meantime. In a real business application we will engage much more and subtle devices to prevent the exploit of a contract in this way. In my conviction this is even far more difficult to cover than the technical security of a contract which can  in theory  be proven by means of formal verification. To my knowledge little or no research has been done in the field of formalizing gametheoretic attacks and it would be a very worthwile field. Any ideas welcome!,ethereum,d7jn0uh,3,t5_2zf9m

I am not trying to be a stick in the mud here but from the information that is available in the whitepaper it just isnt clear to me that enough work has been put into regulatory due diligence.   ,ethereum,d8n5mzb,1,t5_2zf9m

9393467,0,t1_d96kwkv,gt No blockchain is truly immutable and all blockchains are subject to their underlying human communities. ETCs position that their blockchain is immutable is really a lie. I took the fact that humans havent created a good enough AI to govern a blockchain as an axiom since the technology avaible right now cant create a completely immutable blockchain. The difference between ETC and ETH is the degree of immutability. In ETH it is not clear exactly what event that can create a change in the ledger. In ETC the consensus is that only technical forks are permitted.But the difference between PoS and PoW here in regards to immutability and a fork without consensus is that when the degree of immutability of ETH that runs on PoS is challenged and there is no consensus from what I gather of CASPER the ability to stake the fork that is below  is impossible which will leave the ones who probably are the ones that dont agree with whatever changes the devs have done in trouble. Hence why I said it will be even more centralized.This is in comparison to a PoW solution where if there is a percentage lt who dont agree with the rest where they will just mine on that fork instead. ,ethereum,d96osm8,-1,t5_2zf9m

Financial institutions and financial instruments can certainly leverage smart contracts but of course the rd party has to trust your blockchainnodes or at least participate in the network as well.Overall blockchain tech seems to have some extremely good private company internal uses.

So a node owner will not be able to reconstruct the entire file or be held liable for it  in theory.When you save a file to the network multiple copies will be spread around the network so that if a node goes offline the file is not lost. I believe swarm allows you to pay for a minimum level of redundancy which gets sent to the nodes as payment. Nodes which fail to deliver without signing off relocating the data to another node are punished.Files in high demand get spread around the network more and thus load faster similar to bittorrent.,ethereum,db1nj4b,5,t5_2zf9m

10181565,0,t1_dbxok23,gt Using msg.sender.send when sent to a contract address an address can be a contract or a typical user address calls the default function unnamed function in the contract.So when msg.sender.send is used does it call the default function of the smart contract or is does it call the default function of the contract address its trying to send to?Im guessing its the latter according to the rest of your post but just making sure.Oh man I see what youre saying about the attacking contract being able call the if!msg.sender.sendrefundamount throw and deplete the smart contract since the smart contract will try over and over to send but since the attackers contracts default function uses more than  gas it will always fail and the smart contract will lose a little bit of gas every time until its empty.Is that correct?In the case of this specific smart contract the whole refund function is     Refund ETH in case the minimum goal was not reached during the Token Sale     Refund will be available during a two month window after the Token Sale    function refund          Check if the Token Sale has ended        if !hastokensaletimeended throw         Check if the minimum goal amount was reached and throws if it has been reached        if ismingoalreached throw         Check if the refund window has passed        if block.number gt refundwindowendblock throw         Records the balance of the sender        var refundamount  balancesmsg.sender         Check if the sender has a balance        if refundamount   throw         Reset balance        balancesmsg.sender           Actual refund        if !msg.sender.sendrefundamount throw    So if the Token Sale fails and refunds are available during the refund window the attacker would have to have had a balance then that balance is set to  and THEN the refundamount is sent. If the attackers contract address has a default function of more than  gas then the send fails the attackers balance would be rolled back the smart contract loses the gas and the attacker can do this over and over until there is no more ether in the contract. Yikes.I hope Im getting this right. I do need some more reading on this but thanks a lot for looking it over! Nice name btw EDIT Wanted to add the TLDR from the link you posted.gt TLDR  If you think you dont need to worry about send in Ethereum because you throw when theres a problem you are very very wrong. Dont throw on a failed send. Instead return the remaining balance less any gas consumed during execution of the contract.So since the attacker would have to have a balance in this case instead of just throwing and using up  gas from the contracts balance you would take a proactive measure to adjust the attackers balance back to what it was before minus the cost of the gas so THEY essentially pay for the failed send.,ethereum,dby4xpj,1,t5_2zf9m

Then I have seen a newer number of  ether.gt the more eth i hold the more eth i get from stake.Clarification It is not how much ether you have but how much ether you have staked. The disadvantage with staking ether is that it is going to be locked away maybe for half a year. Staking will probably be done by sending ether to a special contract.gt how will that work by having my wallet open  with either client geth or parity or it needs to be in geth client for stakeI am sure both geth and parity will support stake mining. And it would surprise me if you need to have the wallet unlocked. However you will need to have your computer up and running because when you are designated to create a block you have s to do this. After that it goes to someone else. It may be that you will be penalized if you fail to use your slot but I am not sure. If you have a low quality internet connection POS mining might be a bad idea.It might be possible to participate in pool mining. The tricky thing about this is that you will need to trust the owner of the pool. If they behave rationally everything is fine. But if they misbehave the stake can get lost including your part of it. This is a little different to current POW pool mining.On the other hand an advantage with POS pool mining is that it can be managed through special emitted coins. Owners of these coins get something like an interest rate and you can sell them anytime you want. Such a pool would allow participants to get their money back whenever they want given the condition that they can find a buyer. This economy could become interesting. The profit from the coins would be known well but the value of the coins will depend on the world outside of Ethereum. That is if the general interest rate elsewhere increases the value of the staking coin will probably decrease.,ethereum,dc3d894,3,t5_2zf9m

10808500,0,t1_ddu40lr,Thanks for the feedback.gtOn the other hand there is massive competitionfree demand for a coin that is reliably pegged to the value of the dollar.Yes massive demand for an unlimited in time fungible liquid coins pegged to the value of dollar which is not doable with simple swapforward contracts. What you seem to offer is to create simple contracts between stable coin holders and longers the longers basically buy the volatility of the stable coin holders ETH. By doing so you have indeed created stable assets yes but that are not liquid unlimited in time etc.. And thus it does not address the demand and weve experimented with this approach released working prototypes and faced them with potential users. Id like to have time to write more about this approach and show what weve developed and learned.It is not obvious how to successfully turn a specific contract between two traders stable coin holder and longercollateral provider that backs it into a token with good enough properties to be interesting you need a mature market around it to do that make the stable coin fungible and unlimited in time. In your example you would need a mature enough swap market so that whenever a swap is settledliquidated a new one starts allowing your stable position to remain. So  You need mature market to have good enough properties for the stable tokens You cant start a mature market Stable tokens without the full package liquid fungible unlimited in time dont have a market. Derivatives products without the full package do have a market traders and we want to prove it. With volume on them we can give them the full properties package. From this point we can offer StabL tokens that make sensegt I realize that most people would prefer that liquid exchanges existed on chain but do people want it enough to pay extra to be an early customer? beats me but my gut says no.We think using blockchain as a backend for financial markets offer an alternative solution for traders more efficiency between primary and secondary markets more security lower cost and not extra costs new cool features to explore I think we can create better designed orderbooks.

So it would make sense to price like that gasPrice  minGasPricebased on uncle rates  BlockGasLimit  BlockGasLimit  BlockGasUsed  . With this we would have some auto price adjusting during temporary high demands. On the other hand one could also just rely on the sorting of txs to prioritize higher paying tx since the calculation above effectively just gives you a softer BlockGasLimit.Another conclusion is that miners should optimize there uncle inclusion strategy. This seems to be a low hanging fruit.I also like Martins idea see comment in Vitaliks Blog post about subsidizing transaction inclusion with block rewards.

11041896,0,t1_dejebex,It all depends upon the data youre talking about and how many people have access to that data. The more people who have access to the data the higher the risk of a breach. The longer they have access to the data the higher the risk of a breach. The data itself may be valuable now but of little value in the future. The type of data may be of low value or high value. The metadata may be low value or high value.In the case of patient records you are talking vast amounts of extremely private data. If held on any public service anyone could get hold of them and hold them trying to break them over a long period of time. You expose that data to  state actors and  nonpublic or unknown crypto vulnerabilities. Additionally you expose an increased amount of metadata. Just a single flaw somewhere such as in an RNG and vast amounts of confidential data become public. There would be no going back. What possibly isnt a terrible idea is using a blockchain to track permission and usage of data possibly public and possibly permissioned perhaps which itself periodically logs itself on a public chain.In fact health data is often compartmentalised. That has good and bad points but a benefit is that a single breakage doesnt expose your entire health records. See Ross Andersons free book Security Engineering where he specifically discusses medical records.Note that Im not a security expert Ive had to learn security as a result of my involvement in the space.

Miners decide the limit collectively and can nudge it up gradually by creatingbiggerthanaverage sized blocks.So no Ethereum doesnt have the same problem as Bitcoin.

11139218,0,t3_5yz5jp,I did not do a lot of research into Dash but here are my first thoughtsFrom looking at their Whitepaper and reading docs a little the privacy feature called PrivateSend is inferior to the mechanisms employed by Monero and ZCash. In Dash multiple participants have to require PrivateSend around the same time for their coins to get mixed. I could not find any stats on how often that feature actually gets used. In Monero you can mix in with any  hope this is the correct number outputs you dont need a permission of owners of those outputs to mix with them. In ZCash your shielded value is mixed with the total pool of the shielded value that has been created so far.I did not look into details but from the first glance I am concerned about the fact that the user of PrivateSend needs to deposit a collateral so that if heshe does not cooperate at later stages or gets DOSed the collateral is forfeited. I would check that out in detail.InstantSend is based on the idea that a subset of master nodes gets deterministically calculated from your output and this subset comes to consensus about spending of your output quickly. If you try to doublespend the same set of nodes will be assigned to verify and the doublespend would be declined. But... master nodes deposit of  DASH never gets forfeited so I would check if it is possible to spin up some master nodes search for an output to be spent with them and try to doublespend. No slashing for misbehaving validators like in Casper In their next Evolution version they promise that one will be able to pledge any amount of DASH even less than  DASH to earn some interest like master nodes. They call it savings account. Perhaps that is what makes it attractive now?I also liked their Vault account idea I believe it also comes in the evolution  this can also be used in securing Ether easily. You create a wallet with delayed say h withdrawal which required a secondary key to reverse any transaction within those  hours. If the secondary key gets compromised too you can burn your DASH with your copy of the secondary key so at least hacker does not get anything.If you believe in conspiracy theories you can imagine that someone is buying up lots of DASH at the moment to spin up lots of master nodes and launch a massive attack on their network...,ethereum,deumatu,3,t5_2zf9m

11265332,0,t1_df8u25z,gtThe root of the issue is that sybil resistance cannot be based on something that is ultimately weak to sybil attacks the assumption that an account represents a single user.No what youve stated is the complete opposite of the the root assumption. The article is based on the assumption that a single entity claims to be multiple accounts and attempts to attack the system. That is the very definition of a sybil attack and exactly why these defense layers exist in the first place.The scenario you present is exactly whats prevented. It rests on several critical assumptions.  That you have already contributed something of real value that passes the standards of the community  That you actually receive each others submission to peer review.   That the cost of the attack is worth itLets talk about this. As stated in the articlegtThere are  choose  or  possible ways to choose  peer reviewers from a pool of  so if an attacker manages to get  accounts into that pool the probability of the attacker getting all  reviewer spots is  choose  divided by the total number of ways to do it is equal to    or ..The likelihood that you actually receive each others submission several times on multiple accounts is not only small but the improbability is amplified by the size of the network. An even greater barrier to attack exists in the form of the cost of time and money where youd have to contribute truly valuable content and pass the peer review system with each attempt to receive your own submission. That cost is extraordinary for a single account but now this resource cost both time and money is amplified as you try to do it with multiple accounts where finally the cost of the attack will increase beyond the value of attacking. Finally the attack is made even more futile by the fact that someone can just edit your inaccurate or fake submission with something real provide a reliable and accurate source for it to the community and reverse your fake information.,ethereum,df8wqh2,3,t5_2zf9m

The two most vulnerable pieces that if a computer distorts those its game over. I mean if youre paranoid at the silicon level though still be afraid of anything other than working signing math on paper or on an open source processor. They do exist. Just not that fast and youd still have to trust an FPGAemulation. But for  of people out there hard wallets are going to avoid IntelAMDWindowsMacetc NSAlevelspyware.I suppose a paper wallet is good too all the way up to the point where you need to spend.,ethereum,dgac412,9,t5_2zf9m

11706285,0,t1_dgm99ge,The idea is that GNO tokens can be used to generate WIZ tokens. WIZ tokens will be used to pay fees on Services Layer of the Gnosis platform. Another function of GNO tokens if the fees captured by the Services Layer are not in WIZ but in ETH or BTC then one would be able to enter a market of swapping GNO tokens for a proportion of these ETH and BTC fees.

11707927,0,t3_6721t0,Yes Im libertarian. I find myself to still be the minority even in this space surprisingly. The idea of jobs being taken away and killing people is a bit harsh. The thought that this technology will make humans obsolete is gaining a lot of steam lately. This is of course contrary to all of recorded history. When the Cotten gin was invented  of Americans were farmers. People evolve and move on. The result is net positive. The recent sentiment seems to rest on a belief that in  years there will be nothing left to do. Growth is exponential but we dont live on the moon just yet people in the s thought we would by now. This tech will eliminate a lot of unneeded work in the banking sector. It will allow valuegenerating endeavors to save money.

Brief overview of the picture Not sure I agree fully with it but here it isStrengths Concept Speed Convenience Divisible Global and uses ethereumWeakness DGD is a DOA token not backed by gold Over  year old and no  DGX backed by gold not launched. No rd parties accept DGD as payment at the moment. Only active on  exchanges. Opportunities If the GDX token launches DGD holders will get payed a fixed  of the transaction fee. Eth is fast and better than bitcoin. DGD is listed on  exchanges.  Threats Blockchain is not fully understood by regulators could face scrutiny in the future.
