500658,0,t1_cfx1mxq,as a canadian I think this is a good idea.  You people deserve better than to give yourself bad health care just to feed all the squabbling middlemen who take your loot and then do everything they can to deny your care.  Of course its socialism.  Thats not a bad thing putting the profit motive as the major incentive and unleashing the health hounds on it has not produced a good result.,greed,cfx6fja,2,t5_2qxhv

1625407,0,t3_2cxlz9,Local perspective Market Basket has been by far the most popular grocery store in New England. That is until recent events. In nearby Chelmsford there is a Market Basket with a Stop n Shop across the street. Until recently the Market Basket had a full lot almost all the time while Stop n Shop was pretty much dying. Im talking  cars vs  at any given time for comporable stores. Now that Stop n Shop is always full. The Market Basket in Burlingon  Ive spent  minutes trying to leave that parking lot before its been so crowded. Last time I was in that shopping plaza there were a handful of cars parked to shop at the store. Went inside took some photos of the empty shelves and noticed maybe  customers inside. To say that sales are down  is an understatement I would say down  most likely.                       ,greed,cjk1qlx,5,t5_2qxhv
1831745,0,t1_ck9oa7l,Nice research I had already read the Wikipedia article.  I also read numerous reports on the stores as well. Its nice to see that you can come up with something to support your claims that the article was too slanted to the one side but regardless the workers are happy with him there and when a whole company of workers and a large portion of shoppers boycott that tells you something was wrong. The type of petty money grabbing that is highlighted in your Wikipedia entr.. uh I mean your post is common and the only thing I see that effected the company was the real estate sale little shady but hell were living in a nation that fought  wars that put millions into the pockets of  of the men that had the most control on going to war in the first place so Im not really blown away by the charge on Artie T.My whole comment was that its nice to see workers take control of a hostile situation and getting what they fought for. In this day and age where everything is is one sided in favor of corporations and CEOs it was refreshing to see a situation go the other way. In the end if the workers and customers are happy then thats what matters to me. You can be a cynical dick and dig up dirt and post a dissenting view that doesnt change my opinion or perspective. And no I wont suck your balls Im still working on figuring out how to do that for myself. So wait your turn. ,greed,ck9x3cn,1,t5_2qxhv

5247636,0,t3_3mt6lw,what they say about these guys is you should ask yourself the question did he make his money by giving his advice or by taking his advice?  If the answer is the former meaning he made money by selling his advice as books and courses move on.  This is apparently an attempt to only present the appearance of success which means he has done neither.  Definitely move on...,greed,cvij1y9,2,t5_2qxhv
5255804,0,t3_3mzqs0,Canada Wants To Cut Price Of Worlds Most Expensive Drug US Manufacturer Sues To Stop Itfrom the thatsgratitude? deptThe Turing Pharma case has received widespread coverage but as Techdirt readers know its hardly a unique example of the pharmaceutical industry taking advantage of a flawed system. In fact over in Canada theres another interesting example of the industrys sense of entitlement reported here by CBC News A U.S. drug company is taking the Canadian government to court for its attempt to lower the price of what has been called the worlds most expensive drug. Alexion Pharmaceuticals has filed a motion in Federal Court arguing that Canadas drug price watchdog has no authority to force the company to lower its price for Soliris.According to the article a month course of Soliris costs about  in Canada at todays exchange rates and a mere  in the US.While Soliris is not a cure it can stop the assault by two rare blood diseases on the bodys tissues and organs. Since patients typically need to take the medication indefinitely it can cost tens of millions of dollars over a lifetime.Understandably some Canadian regions are struggling to provide the drug for all the people who need itDue to the high cost some patients in Canada cant get the drug. Only some provinces will cover the cost of treatment and there are different criteria to qualify for coverage in various jurisdictions.The pharmaceutical industry likes to argue that though high such prices are necessary in order for companies to recoup the research and development costs of new drugs. According to the CBC article Soliris has already brought Alexion around . billion in revenues which ought to be enough to cover any such outlay not least because of the following important fact In case of Soliris most of the research and development was done by university researchers working in academic laboratories supported by public funds. I think the public science is well over  or  per cent of the work said Sachdev Sidhu a University of Toronto scientist who is also in the business of drug development.That means that Alexion had to spend less than usual to develop and bring the drug to market. It also means that once more a pharma company gets to build on the work funded by the public but without any sense of obligation to pay that back in the form of lower prices  on the contrary. Perhaps most damagingly the lawsuit brought by Alexion to defend its exorbitant pricing could have very serious negative consequences for everyone in CanadaA University of Ottawa professor who specializes in health law said he was shocked that Alexion would challenge Canadas authority to regulate drug prices. If Alexions case is successful it could end Ottawas ability to control the cost of patented drugs Amir Attaran told CBC News. This is the single greatest threat to pricing of drugs in Canada ever he said Thursday.In the pursuit of high profit margins the worlds dysfunctional drug industry continues to ride roughshod over everything in its path whether a patient trying to survive a rare chronic disease or an entire nation trying to provide decent medical treatment to as many of its population as possible.YouTube Video ,greed,cvjigim,1,t5_2qxhv
6995619,0,t1_d199ekz,Thats not bad. Got my own export business beer and cars making roughly k a month now. Nothing on rental right now cause the market price is too high to enter and the ROI is too low less than  from what Ive seen unless you go for commercial then the starting capital is kind of high but you can hit about k monthly with about  million invested though. But if you entered the market about  years back you could have hit the k monthly now with only about  million or so but meh.Im glad you got a good position in your family business and inherited so much though.Edit Go invest in commodities and hedgefunds instead way better return on the investment.,greed,d19aooj,2,t5_2qxhv
