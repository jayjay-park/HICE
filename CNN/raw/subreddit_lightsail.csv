8039052,0,t3_4p8423,Its pretty crazy how its been over a year since this campaign started and we still havent received our rewards. I wonder how many of us wouldve actually contributed had we known how long it would take...especially since it could take another  months to see the cm of sail. In the meantime people have moved and will continue to move to different addresses further complicating this disaster. ,lightsail,d4jnxwi,2,t5_38875
