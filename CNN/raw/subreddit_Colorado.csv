124005,0,t3_1vhymr,Fucking horseshit.  Its no shock that they dont define what a spill is.  You have an oil spill each time you drip gas off the fucking gas pump but theres just no regulatory agency keeping track of those.  Of course keeping track of spills is important and so is caring for the environment but keep these sensationalizing hacks from getting what they want.  They purposefully leave out any important and relevant information and facts in order to spin their own agenda.  If you are against fracking but have never looked at the difference between it and coal then you are also a deluded idiot.  Of course all carbon fuels arent going to be the greatest thing but fracking and natural gas are FAR less harmful than coal energy.  Also for every  gallons o water used for producing coal energy only one gallon is required for natural gas.What if I told you that fracking is used for water wells as well the HORROR!  And what if I told you that  of the arguments against fracking are complete and utter fucking worthless lies and bullshit?,Colorado,cesjwed,4,t5_2qhkb

Both robbers were killed eleven police officers and seven civilians were injured and numerous vehicles and other property were damaged or destroyed by the nearly  rounds of ammunition fired by the robbers and police. gtAt  AM Larry Phillips Jr. and Emil Mtsreanu entered and robbed the North Hollywood Bank of America branch. Phillips and Mtsreanu were confronted by LAPD officers when they exited the bank and a shootout between the officers and robbers ensued. The two robbers attempted to flee the scene Phillips on foot and Mtsreanu in their getaway vehicle while continuing to engage the officers. The shootout continued onto a residential street adjacent to the bank until Phillips was mortally wounded including by a selfinflicted gunshot wound Mtsreanu was killed by officers three blocks away. Phillips and Mtsreanu are believed to have robbed at least two other banks using virtually identical methods by taking control of the entire bank and firing automatic weapons chambered in intermediate cartridges for control and entry past bulletproof security doors and are possible suspects in two armored vehicle robberies. gtLocal patrol officers at the time were typically armed with their standard issue  mm or . Special pistols with some having a gauge shotgun available in their cars. Phillips and Mtsreanu carried illegally modified fully automatic Norinco Type  Ss a Bushmaster XM Dissipator and a HK rifle with high capacity drum magazines and ammunition capable of penetrating vehicles and police Kevlar vests. The bank robbers wore body armor which successfully deflected bullets and shells fired by the responding patrolmen. SWAT eventually arrived bearing sufficient firepower and they commandeered an armored truck to evacuate the wounded. Several officers also appropriated AR rifles from a nearby firearms dealer. The incident sparked debate on the need for patrol officers to upgrade their capabilities in similar situations in the future. gtgtImage iInteresting North Hollywood Shootout |  Minutes The North Hollywood ShootOut | Los Angeles Police Department Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgvkqp oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgvkqp.

If we went through the process again Id sign it again.Difficult to enforce vs. utterly impossible to enforce is the distinction the governor is attempting to make.  The reality is that magazine ban cannot be enforced. Its impossible.This is because there is no way for law enforcement to know which magazines were owned before the ban went into effect last year and which have been purchased after the ban. Since the ban does not involve previouslyowned magazines it is therefore impossible to sort out who owns magazines legally vs. illegally.Therefore the law is bad and should never have been passed in the first place.  Further criminals dont abide by laws and therefore will ignore this one.  The only thing this law does is frustrate law enforcement and disallow legal purchase of magazines that were perfectly legal to purchase a year ago.,Colorado,cifcf8a,4,t5_2qhkb

I dont think you should try to hike if you are coming from at or near sea level but you can still catch this beauty. High mountain passes close to Denver include Berthoud Pass Guanella Pass and Loveland Pass. Also you can drive up Mt. Evans or of course over Trail Ridge Road which is beautiful but more crowded. Just take a picnic and enjoy at a stop alone the way. For example on the way to Mt. Evans you can stop at Echo Lake.Further away there are MANY options. Two amazing beautiful high mountain passes are Independence Pass and Rabbit Ears Pass.Warning all of this is scary twisty narrow exciting driving.A great simple excursion is to drive to Georgetown poke around cute mountain town ride the narrow gauge railroad if you like that sort of thing requires buying tickets in advance then drive south over Guanella Pass which will satisfy your lust for mountain scenery. You can stop for a picnic by a lake on the way up. Drive back into town on .Basically if you like to explore go anywhere an hour west and get off I. You will discover scenery lakes and cute little towns anywhere honest.Also its unpleasantly hot in town a pleasant  degrees cooler in the mountains.btw theres a fantastic view just outside town at Panorama Point at the top of Golden Gate Canyon State Park. Requires no hiking and is a great view of the peaks.I disagree with recommendations for Red Rocks or Garden of the Gods. Instead visit Roxborough State Park which is about half way between them. Same scenery no crowds. Note very hot no shade. Visit only in early morning or late evening.

Youll start seeing stories about bears and garbage cans in another couple of weeks  bears are in the spring and summer active only at night but in the fall they spend  hours a day trying to find enough calories to tide them over the winter and if theres not enough to eat in their territory they come into town to look for food.   The area I was in had no acorns showing on the scrub oak at all and the edible berries were all gone so were likely to see a lot of bearhuman conflicts this fall. This was near coal gulch up  about  miles from town not far from Perins Peak.  There are several traps in town in places that might surprise you though.  Bears are pretty shy and work mostly at night so you could be living next to one and not know it.

2509519,0,t3_2nrfbp,From WikipediaIn his autobiographical Memories of a Lifetime in the Pikes Peak Region Irving Howbert an yearold cavalryman who was later one of the founders of Colorado Springs defended Chivington having argued instead that the Indian women and children were not attacked but a few who did not leave the camp were killed once the fighting began. He claimed that the number of warriors in the village was about equal to the force of the Colorado cavalry. Chivington claimed Howbert was retaliating for Indian attacks on wagon trains and settlements in Colorado and for the torture and the killings of citizens during the preceding three years. Howbert said the evidence of the previous Indian attacks on the settlers was shown by their confiscation of more than a dozen scalps of white people some of them from the heads of women and children. Howbert claimed that the account of the battle to the United States Congress made by Lieutenant Col. Samuel F. Tappan was inaccurate accusing Tappan of giving a false view of the battle because Tappan and Chivington had been military rivals.,Colorado,cmm4s25,2,t5_2qhkb

You are  times as likely to be shot in the US as any other G industrialized democracy.

7257916,0,t3_4et4xg,So since its pretty obvious what towns in Colorado will get the most attention Ill take your question a different way. Well answer one you didnt ask I guessItd be really neat to have one that labels the mountain ranges and the major peaks. Ive noticed that a lot of people dont know the various ranges and they actually play a key role in why people enjoy certain places or other things. For example Steamboat wouldnt get near the snow it does if it wasnt in a basin before the Gore Range which is named after a horrible human by the way not Al Gore either. So I would in a very biased way love a map of all the primary ranges in Colorado maybe with the largest peak in each labeled. It would give a way better feel for the geography of the region than I think anything else. If youd like an elaboration on the importance of other ranges Im happy to provide I just dont want to leave a book here.

Tesla Powerwalls dont have to be made in the billions to sate  million people with about  million homesteads. Solar panels continue to gain efficiency on top of this. Last I looked a single photon could be used to produce two electrons. Given  more years the reasearch will assuredly produce even better results. Improved efficiency means less panels. An array with  KW storage battery presently costs about  and lasts for  years. Thats comparable if not already cheaper than finite fossil fuel sources. Economies of scale will reduce cost even further. Even if you wanted to stay on fossil fuels it is a total fools errand. There are  billion cars on the road in the world now. Peak Oil has come and gone. Production will never increase again because the whole milkshake has been slurped up and burned.

I can finally explain to people why I dont really consume alcohol and I dont have to feel ashamed that I occasionally smoke pot.The biggest problem with it is that warehouse space to grow is hard to come by so people are buying houses with cash and growing in them. One just got busted a few houses down from me and another it  a grow house. I just saw them carrying in lights and reflective foam board the other day and NOBODY lives there. NEVER cars in the driveway. The problem with that isnt that they are growing. Its that now its a target. A house right next to the second aforementioned grow house was broken into one night and the owner actually shot at the intruder. Nothing was stolen nobody was assaulted. Meanwhile Ive left expensive stuff out on my porch for days and it never gets stolen. My guess is that they were looking for the grow house and fucked up by going to the wrong one right next door.

11105000,0,t1_deqprod,gt The point is while it seems like more lanes will eliminate the trafficI never said this and neither does anybody else.gt it is becoming clearer in recent decades that despite being counterintuitive that is not really true.Absolutely its because youre fighting a paradox each time you add a lane to a highway the percent capacity only increases harmonically.    ...gt Basically you double the number of lanes on I between Monument and Castle Rock? The number of cars on the road will soon double to match.So what do you suggest doing nothing and letting CO swell with traffic? Stress our frontage roads and detours to the point where they crumble under a parking lot of running cars? This will only make our roads even more expensive to fix emissions from idling cars will increase and increased travel times will cost the state money. every minute you spend commuting is time you could have spent at home or at workLA traffic is the result of extremely poor city planning low density zoning and lobbies against mass transit. By your logic we should give up and tear out all our roads and eliminate traffic by depriving cars of avenues to travel on. This is asinine. We have to expand our roads.As if roads produce cars. Give me a break thats completely backwards cars come from increased population growth they have to be driven by people. Its not like one driver can drive two cars simultaneously. In Pueblo widening US will probably be OK in the long run because that place has stagnated. The best traffic control measure therefore is limiting the number of new housing developments or by increasing the citys urban density. people are more likely to walk or take the bus in urban centers,Colorado,deqqqf6,2,t5_2qhkb

11386434,0,t1_dfmlfh8,companies are merging into large oligopolies it wont be long before big data companies become big data company and then other companies will fight over who gets the rights to sell user data as each company gets a stakehold in info they will push to get more info other ways. theyll be essentially the digital version of an oil drilling company once the main supply is out where do they get more?the other problem is what is done with the data companies like cambridge analytica used data from facebook to deliver targeted ads in the rustbelt states causing them to swing to trump they spread false info perfectly tailored to the user they were tracking in order to boost the trump vote and suppress the clinton vote. while not technically fraud social engineering is still based on deception and lies. if a company can do that with just facebook imagine how badly our elections and populace will be manipulated if anyone can buy data at a level of detail orders of magnitude greater than what they get from facebook. well never have a fair election again.the thing to understand is that just because ISPs have been doing this under the table for years doesnt mean that we should just make it legal. what happens to a backroom poker house when gambling becomes legal? it turns into a casino. the main reason ISPs dont have this right and are stealing it is because there is no public alternative if i dont want UPS or fedex i can use USPS if i dont want cable or satellite i can just use an antenna. ISPs on the other hand have actually worked to make a public internet illegal even here municipal broadband is pretty much a nogo. as long as i have no alternative and am forced to use their service they have no right to sell data about me without my express permission.so what happens next say people like me help to setup an encryption network to prevent ISPs from tracking anything could we be sued for interference with their business? is privacy not only dead but illegal? thats what you call rights? the fear of not being able to speak your mind in your own home because the smart TV and amazon echo are listening and will rat you out the minute you criticize the wrong person? need to vent about your boss once you get home? nope now youre fired. thats the america you want thats not freedom its a prison.,Colorado,dfmmsq2,1,t5_2qhkb
