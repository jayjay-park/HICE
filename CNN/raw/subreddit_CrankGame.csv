6743718,0,t1_d0gscgn,Good point. I think Ill have to lower the amount of the speed bonus received the higher it is. When youre making more than one scrap per second its not really scaling properly.,CrankGame,d0guvtj,1,t5_39x47

8157821,0,t1_d4wl8fu,gtIm a bit reluctant to mark far off sectors though. Mostly because the fully upgraded jump has really good range and to make use of something like that Id want to start implementing features that let you zoom inout the map and adjust everything accordinglyI was thinking you would mark the sector you are in and it would appear on a list so there would be no need of zoom out.gtThe main issue Im hearing though is that it takes too long to get from Point A to Point B at times. I think increasing the charge speed could help a lot there.From personal experience it doesnt take very long to charge right now my helm research level is  and by the time the light fades away from a FTL jump its almost completely charged.Edit Oh I just though of something To make it not as confusingannoying to get tech level codes you could make it were the player can gather info on where which sectors the codes could be possibly from encrypted messages.,CrankGame,d4x9xuk,1,t5_39x47
