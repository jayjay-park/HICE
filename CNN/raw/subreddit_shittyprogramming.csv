It might make the code look less like linenoise but it mainly makes it less obvious whats going on because youre hiding information.Typedefs should be used to make type aliases in cases where you have a bunch of functions that work on a datatype where it helps to be explicit that this isnt just any olde int or that you might want to change.At least thats my opinion.,shittyprogramming,chk6all,11,t5_2u9xe

CC just compile straight to machine code.Wikipedia has this to say on Cs namegtThe name C sharp was inspired by musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch. This is similar to the language name of C where  indicates that a variable should be incremented by . The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four  symbols in a twobytwo grid further implying that the language is an increment of C.I have no idea how Microsoft thought to replaceincrement C with a Javalike language that has tieins to a proprietary set of tools.In the Unix world  where CC is king for a lot of projects  C hasnt caught on at all.

3077680,0,t1_cob5tx1,It wasnt true  years ago when the comment was written but nowadays you generally wouldnt take this approach because typically when you pass objects to functions youll define them with an interface e.g. when doing dependency injection so you can typehint them. Unlike for example Go you must explicitly define interfaces against a class for its object to be recognized as a certain type. You wouldnt have code that just expects objects to have a foo and a bar rather youd either typehint it in the function definition or check its instanceof later.All that aside stdClass objects never became anywhere near as popular as we thought they might become  years ago. In practice the array datastructure really a hashmap forms the backbone of most PHP code and later versions of PHP started to respect that more and more e.g. array shortforms in . eg   instead of array . I think we thought back then that wed use objects directly much more e.g. Id define a class with properties public a public b then jsonencode my object directly and get a  b  but more often nowadays youll see jsonSerialize used and your class given a JsonSerializable interface where that method returns an array e.g.    public function jsonSerialize  return a gt thisgtfoo b gt thisgtbaz Of course if youre calling a library that expects things to be passed in as an object knowing how to cast an array can be handy.tldr  years ago we thought stdClass objects would be much more useful than they actually turned out to be but now its better to either define classes with proper interfaces or just keep your data in an array.,shittyprogramming,cogzz1i,2,t5_2u9xe

Question is marked off topic when it may ba a good question that simply belongs to different stackexchange board such as posting software architecture questions to stackoverflow.Rarely questions which are awful get marked as off topic but get closed and removed in a very close order.If you find an off topic question which is highly ranked and has highly ranked answers they are probably going to be correct.,shittyprogramming,d2qqx30,9,t5_2u9xe

7788405,0,t1_d3rghf7,Well yes this is true but the same can be done on a binary computer. Recall that binary supports both s and s which means that any script that runs on unary also runs on binary. So the security is not decreased in this respect.However the security is increased in that an attack on binary which uses all s to essentially turn off your computer because s mean electricity off will not work on unary because there are no s. So while some attacks still work others are no longer valid concerns making the overall security better than a binary computer.,shittyprogramming,d3rh200,5,t5_2u9xe
7881074,0,t1_d41sby4,get and post are for  separate purposes its not really about elegance.  Also I dont know what the original message was but the existence of needing to put a message in get or post is somewhat strange and probably evidence of an incomplete design.  i.e. whatever it is that redirected you to a new page knew what message to show you before you load the next page so why is it waiting to show you the message until after you load the next page?Back to my original point keeping it in the get parameter has certain features like if somebody starts copy and pasting the url to new tabs or other stuff like that and they will still see the message when it loads post wouldnt be able to do that.What would be really interesting is if they dont sanitize the message before displaying it.  i.e. could you put html tags in the parameter?  Maybe a nasty ltscriptgt tag or something?  Something like that would be truly shitty.,shittyprogramming,d41wmuy,2,t5_2u9xe

9671965,0,t1_da3xdez,Serious answer Yes. Exceptions are relatively slow in .net and most other compiled languages because the language has to generate a stack trace which is a slow operation. But Python always maintains some objects that represent the stack so exceptions can simply contain a reference to those objects. Theres a performance cost to maintaining those stack frame objects all the time but thats expected in an interpreted language.,shittyprogramming,da59ti3,1,t5_2u9xe
