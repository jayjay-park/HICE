5467667,0,t1_cwa801c,I have a brother and sister who look quite a lot like your cat as it happens.She is the most placid cat ever. Anything that would mean scratches on a normal cat is just tail swishing and walking away with her.Touching her belly for too long just means she rams her head into your hand as if to say no. please touch this kthx. She offers unlimited head scratching and ear rubsHer brother is the opposite he will get claws out if you annoy him too much,catbellies,cwajny5,3,t5_32a2h
