Go home toss peppers grill them first if you feel so inclined salt start with a little bit add as necessary any garlic or seasonings you like and vinegar in the blender and blend. Taste and continue adding ingredients until desired flavor is reached. Pour via funnel into bottles. If you want a more liquid consistency put a sieve over the funnel and drain into the bottle then add the pepper pulp back into the blender add more vinegar blend and pour through the sieve again. You can get  bottles from the same batch of peppers before the flavor starts to diminish too much.Sauerkraut  Buy a sauerkraut crock and weights as they will save you an enormous amount of hassle and are worth the . Then buy  some cabbage red or green or both and some salt and maybe some jalapenos. Rinse the cabbage then take the first outer leaves and discard them as theyre usually pretty rough. Then take a few of the second outer leaves and remove them whole and set them aside. Then slice the rest of the cabbage very thin. Using a mandolin helps but buy some cut resistant gloves at Home Depot to reduce the odds of injury. BTDT. Then in a very large bowl stir the cabbage and salt kosher canning or noniodized in the ratio of  tablespoons salt to lbs cabbage toss in a few jalapenos if you want it to be spicy. Tossmassage the salt into the cabbage for a few minutes. Youll feel the liquid starting to leave the cabbage and become brine. Then dump everything into your sauerkraut crock. Continue until the crock is full with just enough room to put the weights on top. Then push down the cabbage. A fair bit of brine should begin to appear. Then cover the cabbage with the whole leaves you set aside earlier then place the weights over the leaves. The leaves will keep the loose cabbage bits from floating up. Brine should cover the weights but if not you can make more brine by mixing  cup distilled water and  tsp salt. Add brine until the weights are covered. Then put the top on your crock and let sit for  weeks checking on it every so often. The longer you wait the more sour it will become.Enjoy!,Wetshaving,d2p874t,5,t5_2rb88

I never expected that a  plastic razor would replace my many other and more expensive razors at the top of my rotation. When it first arrived a few weeks ago I had a weeks worth of growth saved up for it and the Fine mowed it down with next to no effort. In a subsequent shave I tried putting the head on a Maggard MR handle but found that with a heavy handle it was much harsher. I definitely prefer the stock handle. Three passes and a BBS result with no nicks or irritation. I received a free sample of the Ramos Gin Fizz scent from utheholyblack. I was honestly blown away by the performance. It was very easy to load into the brush. I used my Razorock Plissoft brush which I always use when trying a new soap for consistent foolproof performance. It quickly and easily exploded into dense and very slick lather. After  passes I still had enough lather in the brush for another pass maybe even . This is an all vegan formula and performed right up there with the best vegan formulas I have tried. Id say the only flaw performance wise was that it was slightly drying but this is relatively minor compared to the overall performance of the soap. I find most vegan soaps somewhat drying.I quite enjoyed the scent as well. I dont usually like gourmand scents but this one was very pleasant. In the jar I mainly got orange creamsicle. Once lathered I could detect a subtle hint of juniper. It smelled so good I might need to find a recipe for the cocktail that it is based on. By the end of the shave it had mostly faded but subtle whiffs of orange and juniper were still detectable. Once I finish off the sample I may pick up a full sized jar it would make a nice addition to my summer scent lineup.I picked up the Floid Blue back in March at Pastuers Pharmacy in New York. I finally understand what all the hype is about. It has a lovely fresh barbershop scent and a nice subtle hint of cooling from the menthol. The perfect finish to a great shave. ,Wetshaving,d2r0s65,11,t5_2rb88

7471645,0,t3_4hpzcd,Welcome!Maggards Razors is a go to around here for people getting started. The company and people are great the products are excellent and the prices are awesome.Their starter kits will run you about  . base price for the basic kit slightly more if you go for the standard kit.I would go with theMR for the razor default option or you can pick whichever strikes your fancy. The V razor head has gotten great reviews.Maggard Synthetic Brush default option synthetics have come an enormous way and they require no breakin and less learning curve in my opinionMaggards Orange and Menthol soap not default but an awesome easy to lather soap that smells great. May not be an option with the starter kits anymore pick something you think youll like the scent of youll be buying more soap soonAlum instead of the styptic default optionThis will get you started while avoiding many newbie mistakes like buying a cheap Van Der Hagen brush and soap set from the pharmacy. Youll also get  blades of two types to try. Their razors are really good great for a beginner not too aggressive and the price is awesome. Trust me the quality is almost inversely proportional to the price.This is how I started in  and I love it.If you want a shaving mug for lathering then I would pick up a chili bowl from your local dollar store.This hardware will set you on the right path and let you branch out into different soaps as you might want to try a few others overtime. You also get to try two different blades. If you find you like one more stick with that for a few months which will require a second purchase which Ill get into below.From my own experience I would plan for a second purchase from Maggards in about a month. There are two reasons for this.You get to know if you really like Wet Shaving. I think you will especially if you map your beard grain and watch some lathering videos. If you hate it youre only out the initial investment and believe me Im sure you can flip the starter kit over at rshavebazaar for almost what you paid for it.You dont NEED any of the things Im about to recommend but if you do find you like wet shaving they will come in handy.nd Purchase ListBarrister ampamp Mann Your choice of soap samples at Maggards from any of their fine artisans These are great for getting a bunch of scents to try without worrying about committing to a full jarpuck of a soap you might not like. Theyre out of stock right now but I highly recommend you pick up a sampler when theyre back in stock once you decide you like the hobby.A blade bank hands down the best cheapest way to store used razors safely. You can go with a DIY option but you want to make it hard to get the used blades back out dont just stick them in a prescription bottle or something.Some more blades from whichever of the two sampler pack blade choices you prefer. Stick with this blade type or a month or two. Enjoy the learning curve. Once youre more practiced you can try other blades. At pennies a piece these are the cheap part of wet shaving which means you get to spend more on broadening your soap collection if you want. I found I loved the Astra Platinum blades I started with so much that I bought  for about  bucks. Each blade will last about  shaves generally. Blades are the most personal part of wet shaving. What works for me may be terrible for you and vice versa. Your Mileage May Vary YMMV a common acronym around here.After the first few months your technique will improve to the point that you can correctly evaluate different blades.TryABlade offers a wide variety of blade samplers once youre ready to branch out.If you travel you can get a brush case. If you want to class up your bathroom check out a razorbrush stand though you absolutely dont need one.At the end of the day a starter kit will run you about the cost of  replacement cartridges give you  shaves and the maintenance cost thereafter is extremely low blades and soap. If you find you absolutely cant stand wet shaving you can flip most of the gear pretty easily. Stick it out for a week or two and I think youll love it.Feel free to ask any more questions the guys here are very knowledgeable helpful and fun.Its a great community of guys and gals. Welcome to the fold.

The only thing I can compare it to is the BampM Glissant.  You can load your brush and just add and add and add water and it just keeps going.  Ive only used this twice now but I have yet to find the breaking point.Due to some lackluster experiences with some well regarded veggie soaps Ive considered myself to be by default a tallow guy.  Saponificio Varesino worked OK Cade rich cream even better but I have never had a really wow experience with a nontallow soap until I used this one.  Its really really good.  That said both times Ive used it Ive experienced a little bit of irritation.  Not with the shaving but simply be being on my face.  Its minor and didnt linger after shaving off the lather but worthy of note all the same.I hadnt used the Floid Blue in a while.  Because its the largest bottle of aftershave it goes in the back of the shelf so I dont reach for it very often.

I won this spectacular brush and thought itd be good to have another synthetic to really see what theyre like. And after two shaves I dont like the knot.Im going to keep using it the rest of the week at least. Its just too stiff and my face not being a slab of beef its uncomfortable to apply that much pressure. When the brush splays it gets more of the soap and water from the middle of the brush and makes morebetter lather to me which is why I like doing it some. Its not like Im trying to lather with the inside of the knot down near the handle.Anyway Scotts working with me on it so once Ive given it a good shot well see.Kai stainless blade again Fine Clean Vetiver puck overall the lather was good but about half the amount I normally create with my badger. Also doesnt really retain water so I have to keep dipping it and working it in. Which to me means I ought to have more lather but whatever. It worked was slick and I got a good shave.

Same results. An incredibly close comfortable shave. Its almost like Im discovering these modest razors for the first time. I cant say that I definitley could tell a discernible difference between the Prewar and Oval Slot Tech. If I had to say anything it would be that the Prewar may have slightly more audible feedback.  I havent used this soap since the June Challenge. It was one of my early artisanal purchases. Its the only Tiki soap I own. The lanolin provides a great post shave feel.  This brush is my least favorite of all of my Semogues. It improved with the addition of two orings placed at the base of the knot to rein in the prodigious splay.

If hes not an upstanding dude then he deserves to get called out. How would you feel if he was a marketing agent for Walmart clogging up the forum with disinformation? Would you just give him a pass because you personally dont have any expectations from the people you do business with? Which is a bit of a dubious stance to try and defend by the way. I do have expectations from the businesses I patronize. As do many people here. Part of what makes Reddit and the internet so wonderful is that it empowers people with the knowledge they need to navigate theworld around them. That is precisely what happened here. Hes fucking with the truth with the specific intent of manipulating the communitys impression of his business. People found out about it and are responding the same way they would respond if KFC was a member of rfood... with skepticism and scorn. The world doesnt need deceitful businessmen nor does Reddit. gt People are calling to boycott him for this. Assuming they successfully boycott him and put him out of business I would not count that as a win for anybody but big businesses that absolutely dont deserve the patronage they already have.This is a weird statement. Its not an either or. There are plenty of big corporations that do great business. There are plenty of independent businesses that do terrible things. The only people who lose out are the people deprived of the information they need to make informed decisions about what is right for them. Anyone big corporation or small producer deserves criticism for trying to obfuscate the truth. But sure hes free to run his business however he wants.

10242208,0,t1_dc4xno3,It is slightly more difficult  to work with than nonmentholated soap. You have to do it at a temperature that prevents sublimation of the menthol crystals which I suspect is lower than some soapers make their soap at. At higher levels it can also affect the latherability of your soap. Anything that is not soap makes a shave soap harder to lather.  For body soaps Im not sure why more dont do it. Mentholated bath soaps are awesome on a long hot summer day!,Wetshaving,dc50ez7,6,t5_2rb88

When I first started coming around here the preorder for Hallows had just begun and holy crap did this stuff sound good. The problem was that I didnt have any extra cash to drop on soap tubs and  seemed insane for soap. After all its just crap that you stick on your face right? With this moronic mindset I let the preorder slip by and then I watched as this soap later sold out almost instantly through Maggards site.Fast forward to Christmas when Amazon was the only retailer still carrying Hallows. I threw it on my wishlist as a hail mary and I told my wife that it would be cool to get especially since it was the first limited edition soap that ever caught my eye. My wife took the hint and she came in clutch. This soap is seriously topnotch and I have no idea how a scent so wonderful can be polarizing in any way. Honestly the only issue I have with this soap is that I am an idiot and missed out on the matching AS.

Its light in color white or nearly white. Consistency is soft very similar to Dr. Jons vol and it loads extremely quickly. It explodes into a quality lather very quickly and trickling in water only improves it  I didnt add enough to break it so not sure yet how thirsty it is. Slickness is fantastic my NEW didnt skip stutter or hesitate it slid right along effortlessly removing hair. Two passes and a small touchup later yielded a BBS shave. For the touchup I just wet my fingers and moistened the area that I needed to reshave the soap had plenty of residual slickness so I didnt need to add lather. Post shave feel is amazing!  I had no dryness happens to me in winter and my skin felt very soft so no post was necessary. Im getting over a nasty cold so my nose isnt the best but I could smell some lavender from the soap and ten minutes after shaving and rinsing off my girlfriend could still smell it on me.

10915123,0,t1_de5l3sr,gt a short loft Epsilon White Fan that could take chrome off a bumperI had the same one. It was a wall of badger lovers version of a horsehair brush. So dense so stiff so not what I had grown to enjoy in my Brown Horse. Fortunately for me it started shedding like mad almost immediately and finally started losing bits of glue attached to clumps of hair. I rightly received a full refund from GampCVieLong. I pulled the knot and the plug was breaking up. It appears that the extreme density of those fine hairs prevented the glue used to form the plug and encapsulate the bundle of hairs from wicking and penetrating upward.Lessons I learned? The older style coarser haired knots in shorter lofts work really well. As I said my favorite brush is my Brown Horse.,Wetshaving,de5tg09,1,t5_2rb88

Blade FeatherPost BampM Cologne RusseI knew going into today that I wanted to use Seville.  I have been craving it since yesterday evening.  I think because the last couple days here have been pretty warm for the season I was wanting something bright and fresh.  Seville did not disappoint today.  The lather was tremendous and the scent really hit the spot.  I knew that Cologne Russe paired well with it so I went that route.  I have a backup bottle of Russe as so I dont feel guilty using it with other soaps.I decided to break out the straight today as well.  My straights havent gotten much love lately and since Im off work this week Ive got the time to devote to that kind of shave.  I did my first pass with the Heljestrand and then a second pass with my Slim and one final touch up pass after that.Slim was dialed into  with a brand new Feather loaded.  I usually set my slim on  or above but I know fresh Feathers can be harsh.  Set on  it was incredibly comfortable.

11798352,0,t1_dgxdieo,gtDid being a vegan have any impact on you getting into soaping?Actually it did. Id been vegetarian for years and when I saw Fight Club I wondered how hard it would be to make a veggie based soap since most bath soaps are made from beef fat sodium tallowate. So when I got home I google soap recipes and figured out how to make soap from vegetable oils and that became a soapmaking hobby that Ive done on and off for years.gtIve seen a lot of people say they prefer tallow to vegan since vegan soaps are more drying. Do you think this has to be the case and how do you work around this?I dont know if this is the case since I havent done tests back to back myself. I know for shaving soap I use extra vegetable glycerin to make sure that the soap is not too drying. One of the differences between handmade and large factory made soaps is that the natural glycerin is often not processed out of handmade soap so theyre likely to be more moisturizing.gtWhat is your favorite vegan soap besides your own?Shaving soaps I couldnt really tell you as I havent really used any others. In terms of bath soaps Trader Joes makes a good teatree scented soap made with vegetable oils thats a good backup when I havent made my own in a while.,Wetshaving,dgxdtqq,3,t5_2rb88
