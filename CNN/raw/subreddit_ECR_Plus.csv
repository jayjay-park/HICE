2453834,0,t1_cmez2g8,I cant recommend hobbes blood enough! Yeah the hana definitely has some miles on it.  It was vaped forward to me by an extremely generous friend who had replaced it with a higher wattage box mod.  This is a picture of the back of it  lol. It hasnt had a back plate since I got it since theres a screw broken off in the bottom thread there.  Its still the most solid and reliable piece of vape gear Ive ever used.  Before this I was using a vamo v until the threads ripped out of the .,ECR_Plus,cmezw4u,1,t5_354zh

2454680,0,t1_cmf3inu,Wow! That is a LOT of cotton! Whew!Alright lets see here... This is a pretty good bank of tips on kayfun building.Here are a few random pics I found of goodlooking kayfun builds via google images.Your particular problem seems to be the amount of cotton youre using and its general alignment. That curvy S shape wick in the Kayfun is to keep juice from bleeding off the cotton onto the deck right under the coil where the air hole is. It tends to get trapped in the juice well or sucked into the coil instead. How you have your wick is providing a direct channel for the oversaturated cotton to drip onto the raised portion of the deck and dump that precious juice out the air hole!,ECR_Plus,cmf3n5f,2,t5_354zh

Temco kanthal is also very cheap on Amazon get maybe  each of g and g and youll be set to build for quite awhile. Pick up an ohm meter anywhere and some Samsung rs from ulapinelupine.

2494319,0,t1_cmk54vi,It tastes a little burnt very slight but still not perfect. At first I was only putting a little wick in there so I tried out a way I saw on here.I put the chimney on pulled the cotton through cut it just a little bit above the top of the chimney. I then took the chimney off and cut each cotton sticking out almost in half with a bigger piece and a smaller piece. Stuck the bigger pieces down and took little pieces and wrapped them around the posts. If you can understand my way of explaining. Still not getting the flavor I was expecting ,ECR_Plus,cmk590g,2,t5_354zh
