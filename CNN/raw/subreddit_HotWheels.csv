Not every single one maybe eventually Ill slowly amass them but not a primary goal but Ill pick them up if I find them or get the supers if its a model I particularly enjoy. Sometimes whatever I think is neat. Kool Kombis anything with the Gulf livery etc.gt How do you know that they are special?Research supply and demand market values etc. Treasure Hunts are inherently more special although basic TH fantasy cars are not worth much more than normal cars. Super treasure hunts and older TH are always sought after. Some RLC and Convention cars are popular and worth a good amount of money. Japanese cars JDM are very popular at the moment and have a good market value which annoys me because of scalpers.There is a TON to learn about the Hot Wheels collectors market and you will continue to find new things you never knew existed for quite a while.

7890346,0,t3_4nc5d9,Im a casual collector and sometimes a reseller. Heck what got me i to the hobby in the first place was buying  old ones to resell. Still have them. Thats how I got so many  Batmobiles  James Bond DBs and so on. In those cases I wiped them out. I have four Batmobiles and six DBs to sell. I go out of control when I see Thunts too. Thats how I have seven Fast Felions I need to eBay.... Keep in mind those numbers are after subtracting two for me to keep one carded and one to open. The only time buying multiples with intent to resell has been beneficial to me was when I cleaned out Walmart of their TH Supras yeah a whopping  the very next day happened to be Kday and I sold it to a fellow collector for  which paid for my Walmart and Kmart haul. Unless you have a booth at a flea market and sell dozens of cars each time I dont see how you can make money selling mainlinesTHs. Shipping will eat just about all your profit. So no more of that from me my TH limit is  or  and thats it. I already left  Lets Go THs already with no intention of coming back to get them. But if I find Supers nah theyre all mine. But you dont have to worry about me scalping them its a once a year occurrence I find a uper in the wild. ,HotWheels,d42y520,2,t5_2sj2w
