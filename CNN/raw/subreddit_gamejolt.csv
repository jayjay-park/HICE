6935604,0,t1_d12eyce,honestly i agree ive seen several fan games with candy and that kinda bothers me as candy is just another fan character like lockjaw etc. i wonder why hes so popular at times.,gamejolt,d12h7an,1,t5_2wgw8
6989619,0,t3_4aolhd,I think receiving ad revenue from released fangames is fine. If this was limited or removed it wouldnt make much sense when you see how much money FNAFbased YouTubers have been making. If there is substantial content being developed and hosted on Game Jolt then advert revenue is deserved and has nothing to do with Scott. If the product itself is being sold meaning you are required to give money to view and play the game then thats a different story.I agree that the game should be complete and playable before ad revenue can be earned. ,gamejolt,d18m5hi,5,t5_2wgw8
