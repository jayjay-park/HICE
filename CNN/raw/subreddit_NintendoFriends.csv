3148692,0,t1_coocqo8,The firstround matches will be randomly generated on challonge but from then on it is seeded so for example the winner out of the first two players A Johnny would face the winner of the second two players B and so on. I feel like I really butchered that explanation sorry  Ill try and explain it better when we have the challonge page set up. Also yes you will have to add the opponent whether you keep them on your friends list after the match is totally up to you. I personally think its a great way of making new friends!,NintendoFriends,coocx7b,1,t5_347xl
