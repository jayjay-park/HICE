I had a visual in my mind of what Believer represented for mejust lyrically and kinda the personal message behind it. And the record also has a pretty distinct sound to it this time around. So we knew that we wanted a certain visual. We scoured and scoured and scoured trying to find something and when we came across his work we were super impressed with him got in touchlove the guyand came up with the artwork for Believer. It basically represents you see this guy wandering the darkness of spaceits kind of sIve always been a huge s nerd,CoolCovers,dg4mglq,1,t5_2ubgq
