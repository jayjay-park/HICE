1826845,0,t1_ck98mw5,Cardiff castle is a funny place  the only original bit is the keep . The old walls would have been ft thick with a hollow core that was back filled with soil an internal bulwark so stop gun powder barrels from exploding the wall inwards . The walls you see now were built by the Earl of Bute and are of a hollow nature with no back fill. Hes the same guy that built Castle Corch also a folly  . If you look on castle street on the East side of the south wall you can see the difference between the old and new wall. ,Cardiff,ck9bqre,1,t5_2rh06

4634043,0,t1_ctenejw,gtWe have never once said that k seems about right we recognised that as a venue and not a product it will be difficult for us to raise money from potential customers are we are limited to those who live locally and who have the money and interest to pledge for a gaming lounge.Oh but you essentially didOk you claim you have a solid business plan. People who sign up to kickstart will just have to believe you but the way you answer questions like the ones Ive brought up does go towards convincing people that youve got a good plan. Anyway Im guessing youre using kickstarter in order to get matched funding from WG maybe?. If thats the case then I guess thats a reasonable use of it.On the Esports stuff.. Im not sure I have thought that  I dont watch a lot of Esports. Id much rather be playing. I suppose I can see it a little like watching football at the pub and I can see youve been active in organising things locally e.g. in GassysKokos so you probably have an idea of the popularity.On young professionals yes.. I think I do kind of see what youre saying.. and I have similar issues finding people to play with  most people I play with Ive met through work or are guys I used to play with when I was younger. Itd be cool to meet others nearby who are playing regularly. That said the biggest issue for me is actually finding the time to play.I dont think youre going to be pushing for huge profits.. but the cost of your fooddrinksetc are going to be related to your overheads rent staff electricity wholesale prices and so on. Thats the kind of thing which is really going to decide if you succeed really  if you can get close to the prices of local pub food or even the posh burger type thing then youll probably be a lot more likely to succeed.I wish you the best of luck but Im not very confident youll succeed many others have failed before  prove me wrong and Ill have to come down and eat my words ,Cardiff,cteouzt,2,t5_2rh06
