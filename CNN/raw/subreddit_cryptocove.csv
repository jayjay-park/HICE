828595,0,t1_cgxl8s0,I was mistaken with my stats Khs was not the average for i it was a peak value but it is correct for  intensity todays ambient room temp is up a bit higher so I have the fan set at  and the GPU temp is C ... At i Im getting . Khs fan at  GPU temp C  In all instances GPU and memory are overclocked  GPU  memclock Day   new driver and I  seems optimal hashing an average .Khs with the temp at C and fan pushing at only  please keep in mind that ambient temp is roughly  degrees cooler todayEDIT  I tried out several fglrx drivers and settled on the latest AMD beta . release candidate  I tried . my temps were lower but hashrate was lower by .Khs so as I read somewhere these betas are better suited for the R series amd cards so I decided to try the latest.  So far the latest beta is performing better than before hashrates are the same yet the temperatures are lower than beta. Id suggest anyone running a R or R card with linux to upgrade to . or just wait till the full release which is just around the corner.On the negative side all of these fglrx drivers have a problem with creating dancing dots on my screen much less with the latest driver but still persistent.  It may be some wear from mining however doesnt show up on winxp or with the regular opensource driver.,cryptocove,cgygof4,1,t5_30nwc
