1745595,0,t1_cjz3eey,Yes I had a lot of chit chat and some more serious things like Skype dates and even looking to visit I was generally left very disappointed in terms of contact and commitment to the idea that you will be dating someone you met online.

I know it sounds cliche but enjoy the journey that is life.  It will be or it will not be.  Ultimately its in Gods hands which applies to both your relationship and things outside of it.  Be confident love her and DEFINITELY love yourself.

3102633,0,t1_cojcxev,How can you have a family without having sex? How can you have sex without being sexually aroused? There are many cases where seeing a naked woman in front of me would not be sexually unappealing. Again I dont know about you but I am not an animal that must copulate with any naked woman I see. I would say that making out is a normal natural and amoral activity that serves one of the purposes of dating that leads to the ultimate goal of a chaste marriage. I hate how some people believe that all expressions of sexuality outside of marriage are immoral because that is wrong and contrary to human nature.

4682918,0,t3_3etvpe,Im pretty extroverted and I tend to go to for introverted guys. But I wont ask them outpartly because of my own fear of rejection lets be honest but largely because Ive learned that I dont want to do the heavy lifting and I also dont want to crazily invest myself in someone and then realize that he isnt quite as interested as I am.I asked out a guy once within the last year. We had been talking for a while and I could tell he was interested in me but wasnt making a move and I started getting a little impatient. It was a fun date and I expected him to ask me out againwe had both said that we would want to see each other again actually. But while we kept in contact for a while he never actually asked me out again and hinted around the fact that he was too unsure about himself and about my willingness to go out again to do it. So...I eventually gave up on him because even though I knew he was interested there was no way I was going to keep doing all the work and I didnt want to have to constantly reassure him that I was interested. If I say yes to a date its a safe bet to say Im not repulsed by you.Howeveryoure right the coy little dance we have to do does get kind of tiresome especially because so many Catholic men in my area seem to have noer confidenceand they so rarely ask us out. There are lots of little signs that we can give to indicate that wed be interested but either were being too subtle or men dont have the courage to make a move.

Problem is that finding a woman that shares my interests and isnt a bloody progressive is a pain in the ass.So is my fiance.  I could give a rats ass about any nerdy stuff.  But you know what Ive taken a lot of time to learn how his games are played.  Id never invest time into them myself but as weve grown together Ive learned a lot despite my dislike of them.  On his end he makes an effort to care about things Im super interested in like theology.  Or stupid girly stuff like doing my nails. One of the times I truly knew he loved me he sat down while I was deciding what color I wanted to paint my nails and helped me pick something.  I dont know if he actually had a real preference but he gave me opinions on what he diddidnt like.  Relationships are about recognizing the things your partner values and learning to value them too.  Obviously doing my nails isnt something super high on my priority list but its an example of how my fiance made one of my interests something that he was interested in.We literally have very few similarities outside of college football and being Catholic he doesnt even like the NFL!.

Im not making the connection as to how that is relevant. We all go to priests and to the Church to get direction on what situations and acts are sinful or not or what should be avoided or not in our lives. This is the job of the priest and why we seek their advice. After all it was a celibate man who wrote Humanae Vitae. And I further dont take what you are saying very seriously because what you accuse him of simply isnt truegtHe seems to forget we are of human nature with souls. We dont have to despise the parts unique to being human. We arent Angels.He doesnt say we have to despise parts unique to being human. Perhaps you should reread whatever he said that made you think this. He clearly didnt state that we are Angels. Im thinking you most likely missed the point of what he is trying to say and you probably missed the point on his comment on breast feeding as well. You really shouldnt rashly accuse someone of confusing people or be saying his words are a dangerous combo of true and false information especially considering above.

Currently trying to decide what my next language would be. I sort of want to branch out of European languages but theres still so many left I want to learn. I like historical dramas so I tend to pick languages with periods of history that interest me. My favorite type of shows are characterdriven period dramas like Downton Abbey or un village franais.

11754000,0,t1_dgs71a0,gt Objectification is using someone as a means not an end. If you are primarily interested in someone as a possible wife you are still using that person as a means to achieve marriage. This cant be completely right though. If you cant use people as means many normal human interactions will become completely impossible. When I place an order at a restaurant I am using the other person as a means to get food.What is wrong if you subscribe to Kantian morality which some people have for some reason tried to make into a Catholic system of morality even though we already have a better one in Thomism is to treat someone as only a means and not also as an end.This means that it isnt automatically wrong to use someone as a means to achieve marriage as long as you are also treating the other person as an end. Otherwise it would be essentially impossible to get married at all because any time you marry someone you are using the other person as a means to achieve marriage in a sense.gt I cant tell you what a turnoff it is for a woman to be windowshopped by a Catholic guy who is obviously looking for a wife with x y and z attributes as if he is shopping for a car I agree but I didnt suggest acting in that manner.gt More so if you use someone as an option to give the appearance that you are a confident selfassured person  thats like playing people against each other. What I said was effectively to imagine that you have many options so you can get in the mindset of someone who is not desperate for any particular woman. The point is not to make them compete. It is to eliminate the tendency of desperation and neediness that is all too common in men who try to be nice.The reason I think it can be a good idea to actually have multiple options is again not to make people compete but because I think it helps discernment to avoid excessive singleminded emotional investment in one person. When we are deciding whom to marry we should make a rational choice and excessive emotional attachments interfere with that process.I am supported in this by historical practice  not too long ago some Catholic schools would expel students who practiced steady dating. The expectation was to socialize with many different people. This helps people keep in mind the essential goal of dating which is rationally choosing a good spouse rather than falling into marriage via an inescapable whirlpool of developing emotional attachments.gt What if that option was actually interested in you as a person excited by your interest and meanwhile you were just using her interest to make yourself feel good? Is that not objectification?I dont advocate stringing someone along for the mere purpose of making yourself feel desired. This is something that I can agree is objectification.gt There is another way and it involves offering your sexuality to God and having it purified so that it can be a channel of superabundant grace and have it be lifegiving.Im somewhat confused about what on your view distinguishes romance from friendships. All of this talk of interest in the person is equally compatible with being friends with someone. I am interested in my friends as persons. The reason I am not romantically interested in them is at least in part because I am not attracted to them. But you dont seem to account for this distinction. You cant build romance on only interest in a person. There are biological and emotional factors that need to be present as well.I agree that interest in the person is a great and important thing to have. But there are other components to romantic interaction and its those other components that I am trying to get at right now. The problem with the thousands of friend zoned men on the internet is not that they are not sufficiently interested in their female friends as people. Many of them are quite interested in them. They fail because they fail to make themselves romantically attractive. Im interested in why that is the case.,CatholicDating,dgscfzs,1,t5_3348n
