9607276,0,t3_5chlqe,I can help you with the art on that Fallout  character. Since I dont know the character it would be great though if you give me some guidelines and how you used certain expressions with your dialogue.  Edit Also if you want you can send me the codes for the image so your stripping animations will be in the game.,spnati,d9xakiz,5,t5_3fgx8

10191071,0,t3_5lhn77,Noticed some of the tag specific dialogue got a bit stale. Anyway to have it be random between targetted tagged dialogue and what the character would normally say?,spnati,dbz7qi0,3,t5_3fgx8
10196989,0,t1_dbzomy6,Its a LOT of work to make a character especially if you want him or her to have replayability. Theres no team working on requests  every modder simply makes the characters he or she wants in the game. Asking them to double their workload to include a character theyre not interested in would mean getting a lot fewer characters added. Of course nothing is stopping you from adding the characters yourself! We could use more male characters in the game. ,spnati,dbzvvgq,5,t5_3fgx8
10198178,0,t1_dbzhj7t,As it is now authors can copypaste in the nontargeted responses in as targeted possibilities to reduce the likelihood of the custom messages displaying every time.I think the greater risk is that the nontargeted responses can get stale which is not a new thing. Best example when playing against four girls one of them will see three others remove their first piece of clothing. For almost character that femalemuststrip is going to be the same line three times in a row. Sometimes more.,spnati,dc00qhx,2,t5_3fgx8

10331732,0,t1_dcf5hjb,I dont really have much time to put into them right now. You are welcome to create images or write dialogue for them in my absence the more the merrier. I just cant commit to anything at the moment. That being said I did have an idea to test out the new features for specific responses. Using the  preset models for the characters from KON! Yui Mio Ritsu and Tsumugi to make a table that really interacts with each other. Itll be a lot of work but I think it could turn out really good.,spnati,dcf5qzv,2,t5_3fgx8
10423727,0,t1_dcjoav9,Update Ive slapped together some code to make it do that and submitted a pull request. It may get into the actual game soon.,spnati,dcplk1s,2,t5_3fgx8

10523243,0,t1_dd02kno,Heres a titanpad for Raven. I think Ive set most of it up right but Im not sure how it works beyond the naked stage.Also is it possible to add more than one animation for each stage like with dialogue or is that not supported?,spnati,dd0x8zt,2,t5_3fgx8
10561485,0,t1_dd55y2c,I dont really see how a character not having the possibility to masturbate again will complicate stage ordering. Could you explain?

10928462,0,t1_de6z0jh,No real coding for the dialogue. Just fill out the behaviour.txt file. It tells you what each line means.There are a couple of types of linesHand reactions Kim will need to have multiple lines reacting to getting a good hand a bad hand or an okay hand. These lines come up the most so a variety is a good thing. She might have special lines for different stages of clothing Looks like you wont be seeing under my shirt this hand or Looks like youll be seeing under my shirt soon... to liven things up.Stripping your character has five lines for each item of clothes they take off. One line is for when they begin removing it one is for after theyve finished and three lines are what they say when they first realize theyve lost the hand and must strip depending on if theyre doing well in the game the last to strip or doing badly the first to strip.  These lines are the ones people pay the most attention to and since your character isnt reacting to anyone else you should react to the clothes instead. Consider lines about the act of removing the clothes This might take a while these jeans are really tight or Can anyone help me with the zipper? or her decision to wear them Gee its toooo bad I wore layers today isnt it? or This is awkward  Im not wearing panties under this or the clothing itself Like the shirt? I got it in Paris. or I didnt realize anyone would be seeing my underwear today so I didnt wear anything fancy..  You can always have lines that show the characters embarrassment too Ill kill anyone who mentions this! or Ive never taken off my bra in front of anyone before....Reactions to other people stripping This is the vast majority of lines. You need two lines to react to other people stripping clothing  one for just beforeduring and one for afterwards. But youve also got to have different reactions to accessories like jewelry minor items like shoes and scarves  they show some skin major items like shirts and skirts  they reveal underwear and to seeing someones chest or crotch area. Theres also different reactions to boys and girls and boys need three reactions to seeing their crotch depending on how big it is while girls need three reactions to seeing their chest for the same reason.  Plus you should probably have different reactions depending on how clothed your character is at the time. They might find it fun to see a character strip an accessory at the beginning of the game but get bored or frustrated by it at the end. Seeing a boys crotch early in the game might be shocking but later on might be titillating.  Knowing their personality really helps here.Reactions to masturbating Youll need a number of reactions to seeing someone masturbate separately for boys and girls.Masturbating Youll need a few lines for your character masturbating  what they say when they start while theyre doing it when they get close and when they finish.Finishing lines Youll need some lines the character says when nothing is happening but theyve lost the game already. You want several different lines so that they dont sound robotic.Victory and defeat lines Youll want at least two lines for your character to say at the very end of the game  at least one victory line if they win although you can have different lines depending on how closely they came to losing and at least one line if they lose although you can have multiple lines depending on who won or how close they came to losing.Its a lot of work but none of it is that complicated.,spnati,de77018,1,t5_3fgx8

11394358,0,t3_62lt21,Hi. first of all I learnt how to take a screenshoot which is a big deal to me.sorry long post comingRecently Ive been lucky enough to have free time  to see a few of my characters finished and in the game. But Ive always been still am very shy to show you progress on ongoing characters of mine mainly because Ive seen people doing a hell of a job with kisekae and thought that maybe Im not near that level. Regardless I present you Arwen I have done the posing but I have a few questions in which I could use some feedbackthe first image is the current modelthe second has her hair in the front on both sidesthe third the hair is coming form the opposite sideWhich one do you think is better? or do you have another possible option.The seventh eighth and nineth images would be an alternative for her hair.The fourth fifth and sixth images are basically the same original model but with a different nose.again which nose fits her better?If you dont know who she is you can google her. search for arwen on her wedding dress thats the model I tried to replicate. didnt put a link because I dont know if Im allowedNote I didnt try to go for a more accurate dress mainly because it would compromise mobility on her arms. Id happily change any detail on her titanpad. ,spnati,dfnj9br,3,t5_3fgx8
