4557693,0,t3_3dgxp0,Most successful skoolie conversions Ive read about online mostly purchased their buses from Craigslist ads or from looking up school buses from the schools themselves or bus depotsthats probably not the right term sorry. The ones from the schools I hear can be in good condition since after a certain mileage they retire the bus but I also have no personal experience with buying a bus so who knows if thats even true. I have however looked at buses for sale on Craigslist occasionally and have seen many around your price range at least in or around my own state but it would be up to you to do the research to determine if the bus you plan to purchase needs much work or not before you build. Hopefully you find what your looking for sorry I couldnt be of much help.,skoolies,ct547fx,5,t5_2y4t3
