11199476,0,t3_5zs99a,Honestly music takes at least  listens before knowing whether I really like the song. So far blossom firebird and clouds are in my top  songs of the album. Its hard to compare this album to Sadnecessary because I have been listening to the latter for  years which is now connected with memories of what I have endured through those years. Honestly I have no doubt that all the songs on this album will eventually connect with my life once again. Thank you Milky Chance for sharing your genius! ,MilkyChance,df1g3n5,6,t5_33h00
