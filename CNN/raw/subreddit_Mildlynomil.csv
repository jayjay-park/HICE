My parents live across the world literally as far away as you can get and have only seen him twice the last time was when he was  months old. And yet theyll make stupid ass comments about how inquisitivebigetc. hes gotten how much hes grown how talkative he is now  and its like ooook you dont even know him you just see like  photovideo every few weeks! And then they have the audacity to ask about when were having a second.....like ok cause you guys will be sooo involved in hisher life right? GAH! Sorry for the word vomit got worked up since I havent had a chance to vent about this hahaha.  ,Mildlynomil,dewzlx2,15,t5_3jinr

11218902,0,t3_605fy8,I have a MIL who can not stop with the cleaning either. One day she decided to take our best knife to the stove top to get off the cooked on gunk. When I asked her what she was doing she said oh I learned this from a show. You have to scrape it off. I couldnt  find any razor blades. Our knife has never been the same.,Mildlynomil,df3ncyi,10,t5_3jinr
11222823,0,t3_5zkkmc,My dad is a one upper. I moved out and not really talked with him since he hates phone and texting hes gotten a lot better with me.  Now when I do talk to him about things hes much better about listening and not oh my whatever is sooooooooooo much worse.  Between my mom and him not so much. Shell come home and say she had a long day and hell go into his speel about how much worse his was. So limited information really helped.,Mildlynomil,df43d3f,3,t5_3jinr
11231484,0,t3_60a5k9,I host all meals.  She cant cook and gets extremely anxious about making food. As a result she used to make the same crappy meal every time. Over processed ham veggies boiled to a pulp and usually plain baked sweet potatoes. Bland as fuck. So I host because I love cooking. I also never ask her to bring food because they even seem to fuck up salad. ,Mildlynomil,df52nyf,6,t5_3jinr

11322189,0,t3_61jqh2,Being compassionate is one thing but at the end of the day you have kids to protect and theyre minors who rely on you so theyre most important. As long as you focus on protecting your kids youll be fine. ,Mildlynomil,dffcn7j,7,t5_3jinr
11348913,0,t3_5zbyt9,My boy was the same  would cry pretty much for my MIL every single time! It was almost comical I would deliberately feed him up and burp him and change him so he was ready for cuddles. My MIL is lovely and I felt so genuinely bad for her. But she really pissed me off when she would comment about how crying was good for his lungs  YEAH NO!! And id give him about a minute to settle and then take him back.,Mildlynomil,dfidmv9,1,t5_3jinr
11369454,0,t1_dfkp2po,If youre a bitch then Im one too because thats fucking hilarious. Reading these stories makes me love my MIL so much. The only BEC thing she does is use metal utensils on my awesome Teflon pan. And shes even getting better with that.,Mildlynomil,dfkpewi,7,t5_3jinr
11527376,0,t1_dg2gfgr,They were newborns.  Dr said no visitors till they would have been at  Weeks gestation.  She was furious because she gotto see them in the hospital and then got told no.  When we asked about her specifically the Dr explained she had a super public job and she specifically cant.  She didnt understand. Or she didnt want to. She ended up getting super sick the first month too.  ,Mildlynomil,dg2moqf,3,t5_3jinr
11624510,0,t1_dgdf2o0,The thing with her is that whether or not you get through to her has everything to do with her mental state and nothing to do with what you say. Youre right that pointing this out would make sense to a normal person and maybe even to her if shes having one of her good periods. But when shes like this I dont even think in terms of getting her to understand. I dont have control of what she does and does not understand. I have control over what I do and say and thats it.,Mildlynomil,dgdnene,4,t5_3jinr
11757118,0,t3_67ojio,Lock it when you are in the guest room or bathroom. Dont answer when she knocks. You have a right to privacy. If they remove the locks dont stay there.,Mildlynomil,dgsp6ev,14,t5_3jinr
11798016,0,t3_68bhjw,Make her explain her joke. Is that supposed to be funny? I dont get it.Or just call out the weirdness. What an odd thing to say.Whichever way you go follow it up with intense eye contact. The key is to make her as uncomfortable as you are. ,Mildlynomil,dgxcg7x,25,t5_3jinr
