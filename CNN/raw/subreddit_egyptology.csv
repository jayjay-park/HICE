6706371,0,t1_d0cy79s,The blue crown was an open triaxial weave with hexagonal holes.A regular open triaxial weave like the one in the photo cant be domed. Adding some pentagonal holes however creates a spherical surface. A complete sphere requires twelve pentagonal holes. The bulbous front portion of the blue crown requires four pentagonal holes.I have recreated the weaving pattern of the front and of the back of the blue crown. So far Ive failed at my attempts to join a front to a back.,egyptology,d0czvz5,2,t5_2qzjf
