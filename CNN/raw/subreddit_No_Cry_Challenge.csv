4840219,0,t1_cu4n2ot,Yea. And just for more clarification in my original comment where I said they shouldve just let the father beat up the killer in a room or something I didnt actually mean that that shouldve been his sentencing or whatever lol. Sort of just my knee jerk reaction from watching the video. Im very happy to know that we live in a society in which we handle serious crimes in a very civilized and  for the most part  just manner. I think the killers sentencing was just as well. Theres just no denying that vengeance is a very strong and real emotion haha,No_Cry_Challenge,cu4nbla,1,t5_35ayw
