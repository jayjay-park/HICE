25586,0,t1_cedshqo,Came here to say this. If youre all about having a cut D consider trying out some that are already cut instead of altering a horn you like the sound and feel of. If you find something awesome and cut sell your current one.My teacher had a great Geyer double and cutting the bell absolutely ruined the sound and feelaccording to him.,horn,cehcg7v,1,t5_2svpc

211410,0,t3_1wi1xf,I definitely think that having played around with my older brothers trumpet when I was young influenced my decision to play it later on before switching to horn in high school following a brief stint on euphonium. Aside from potential damage to the horn I dont see any harm that could come of it so long as no one tries to take it seriously.,horn,cf2ivvo,3,t5_2svpc

2617965,0,t3_2puedc,Depends on your budget and geographic location. If your budget is tight get a used horn from Pope Repair or Houghton Horns or Hornsociety.orgs classifieds or a similar dealer. Youll get a much better instrument for the money.Holton  and Conn Ds are okay horns if youre on a budget. Try to get a Holton made before ish or an Elkhart Conn if you decide to go with these. The Hans Hoyer  and  are also pretty good horns much better than the Holton and better than some Conn Ds imo but a little more expensive. Kruspewrap horns are seeing much less use in the professional world nowadays though. Conn Ds also have extremely varying quality from horn to horn but generally most people prefer Elkhart Conns to Eastlake or Abilene Conns. Abilene Conn Ds are generally considered to be the worst.Yamaha  is a very good Knopfstyle horn for a good price. Yamaha s are also customizable by many wellknown hornmakers such as Patterson and they can be made to play like an expensive handmade custom horn with minimal monetary investment  total assuming you buy a new horn. The Hoyer G is also a good Geyerstyle instrument better than an unmodified Yamaha  imo but it has a very large wrap and doesnt fit in many horn cases. Additionally fewer custom horn makers are experienced in customizing Hoyer Gs than Yamahas.Im not a huge fan of Hans Hoyer s. The gold brass version is slightly less awful than the yellow brass version but Ive had a horrid experience with each one Ive played. Kings Eroica and Fidelio are handsdown the best horn in that price range. If on a budget you can get one of these used for around . Paxman horns are generally extremely wellmade. The  and  are the most popular professional models.Alexander horns are the most popular professional horns in the world everywhere except for the USA. The  their signature model is very good and the  isnt bad either. Some people say that the quality control is poor or that the bad ones are sent to the USA to sell but personally I have not had a single bad experience with any modern Alexander horns I have played. Older Alexanders are pretty hitormiss though so try to get one made after ish.Rauch Hatch Atkinson Berg Hill Kortesmaki Schmid Atkinson Lewis Drk Otto Khn Sorley Cantesanu and others these custom horn makers make VERY good GeyerKnopf horns at a VERY high price usually around . Theres also often a long waiting list I think Karl Hills list is  years or something ridiculous like that. Theyre expensive but all of their horns are wonderful to play on. Lastly if you can nab a used C.F. Schmidt horn for a good price it will be an EXCELLENT horn probably the best you can buy without going to a custom maker. Schmidts are not recommended if you have small hands though since the piston thumb valve is uncomfortable for some people. EDIT Dont get a Conn if your hands are small. The bell throats are huge you might have trouble playing stopped without a stop mute and the thumb lever to pinky hook distance is pretty wide.,horn,cn0b1jz,6,t5_2svpc

3283374,0,t3_2xox2d,Every band is different. I have friends in most of the DC bands and they like it. I have friends in some regional and academy bands as well. Every one is different depending on the commands conductors personal and the individual. In my opinion an audition is an audition and a job is a job. Yes we would all love to be in a first rate orchestra but when my pay and benefits outweigh  of the orchestras in the US is hard to say no. Here is a link to military pay scales. The pay doesnt include medical benefits tax free allowances like housing and food and the pension plan. Unfortunately traditional military pensions as they are now may be done away with in favor of a k type plans that will help short enlistments but hurt lifers.The navy band in DC as well as the other premier bands start at an E pay rate. My advice is take the audition for the experience and if youre lucky like I was you may get a job. Edit for example presidents own dont go into work unless they have a rehearsal concert muster  or some other collateral duties. My band we go in four days a week and have a daily muster and if we have rehearsals we rehearse and if not we do administrative or collateral duties.The bands have all started touring again after the whole sequestration mess but travel is restricted dependant on the branch. A lot of my colleagues play in regional orchestras around the area. ,horn,cp2j53e,9,t5_2svpc

3910764,0,t3_358n44,Caruso might be a bit too advanced. I would be afraid that you might injure yourself if you try doing those exercises without a proper range to begin with. I think your best option from the little I know of you is to start with scales. Every day play all of your major scales ascending slurred one octave starting on middle C and going up a halfstep for each new key until you cant go any higher. Then do the opposite for the low register start descending on middle C and go down a halfstep for each new key. This sort of work is a great way to expand range and be sure not to stop after you get to a high C or whatever mental barriers you may have. Go at least to the high C or wherever you can without straining or forming detrimental habits and keep at it each day until playing up there is second nature. It takes time and effort but the sooner you start the quicker youll get to wherever you want to go! ,horn,cr2299t,6,t5_2svpc
