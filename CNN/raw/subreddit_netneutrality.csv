4382534,0,t1_csjkfdv,gt Filing false stock reports is a crime. Got any evidence that TWC did that?Now youre just bring lame. Go READ! And to hell with the stock report its not useful to your argument at all. Theyre not technically filing a false stock report but they do shuffle resources internally between different departments and General Ledger buckets to make some things look better than they are and other things looks worse waay before stock reports enter the picture. Big businesses do that. Look at ATampT and their shenanigans with claiming to be a common carrier and fudging the books to make their wireline departments look unprofitable soas to get federal subsidies then rolling those subsidies into other noncommon carrier departments and pocketingdisappearing the cash.Seriously theres no lack of quality information. I gave you a head start link. All you have to do is stuff your ego or pride or take off your blinders or whatever you need to do to ingest and process information that may be uncomfortably contrary to your worldview.gt OpenConnect isnt a CDN. A CDN includes BOTH the caching hardware in this case the OpenConnect appliances and the network infrastructure and hosting which Netflix doesnt want to pay for.Yes OpenConnect most certainly is a CDN. Netflix supplies caching hardware IF the ISP wants to use it internally AND Netflix pays to park their data right outside the door of most every ISP see link above. They also pay for the network infrastructure to connect all of their CDN components around the world. Thats a CDN. Just like Akamai.gt Thats simply not the way the internet works.It is not the job of the ISPs to provide free hosting and services for anyone who asks.I... I have no idea whats going on inside your brain. I say The ISPs customers are paying for and demanding a level of service for access to any content on the Internet and you respond with It is not the job of the ISPs to provide free hosting and services for anyone who asks?lol that is such an oddball off the wall nonsequitur response I dont know what to respond to it with.gt    Who is the ISP distributing content to? Their own paying customers. That is EXACTLY the ISPs job!  gt Then why did Netflix use Akamai and why did they build their own CDN as you claimed?wut? Your reply is...... my comment was..... holy shit are we conducting two entirely different conversations or do you just not possess enough fundamental knowledge to hold a conversation on the same level?  Your reply is utterly disconnected unrelated and has nothing to do with my comment.Netflix used Akamai to move their data closer to their customers by storing it in Akamais regional datacenters all around the world. Later Netflix became large and profitable enough that they found it to be economically feasible to host their own data servers around the world. Netflix is doing the exact same thing Akamai was. Except Netflix is not hosting data for hundreds of thousands of corporations and businesses. Theyre only hosting their own.gt Youre arguing that Akamai should not exist and that ISPs should provide a service like Akamai for free correct?Youre mental m. Youre a fookin looney. ,netneutrality,csjnbv9,1,t5_2r8ig
5212147,0,t3_3m9swa,It is extremely unlikely your ISP is throttling Youtube and Netflix and the evidence you present here does not come close to demonstrating it. First have you seen the Netflix ISP ratings The highest speed on any ISP is . Mbps. Yes including the  Gbps Google Fiber. Either Netflix or their transit or CDN provider not the ISP is rate limiting their content probably because thats all the speed they need to stream. Secondly the VPN only shows you that your VPN can get the content from a closer server or a less congested transit route. ,netneutrality,cve992m,3,t5_2r8ig

10635197,0,t1_ddcx940,Any mb datacap subscription is basically a mb datacap subscription. That means that the end user is a person who only streams music. I still dont see the big problem with letting ISPs target these consumers as long as theyre not throttling certain sites.But... in the end this is a very American problem. Comcast and a lot of other ISPs have monopolies in their respective zones which just doesnt happen in a functioning democracy. Telias suggestion was fine. Even if they started up a Spotify Telia all theyre doing is what Apple is doing favoring their own ecosystem in front of others.In the end I see a lot of damage coming from not letting people surf the top social media sites for free even after the data caps are up. In this particular example I would say the argument but what about social media site ? doesnt hold a lot of weight.And thats essentially the only argument Ive heard against this subscription plan.,netneutrality,ddcxtr4,1,t5_2r8ig
