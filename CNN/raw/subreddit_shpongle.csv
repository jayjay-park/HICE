3221940,0,t1_covod73,Oh man! I heard about that show and even considered makin the trip up. What a shame. I drove to burlington this past weekend with some friends for the first show of the current tour and then we decided to follow him to Rhode Island. Totally worth it. Ill be tree April rd and it will be wonderful! The first two shows were in quite small venues so I cant wait for a huge party. ,shpongle,covygij,2,t5_2t32u
