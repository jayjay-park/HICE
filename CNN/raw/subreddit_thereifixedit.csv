6432938,0,t3_43rbri,I made a  way splitter just like this in my parents attic in about .  I wanted cable but my dad wouldnt pay the cable co to put in the outlet.  It worked great for about a year until it corroded and I had to cut back the wires a foot and fix the splice.  Worked for another year or two.  I think I fixed it  times before becoming a cable guy and visiting my parents house and fixing it for real.  Splitter worked great but probably leaked RF like crazy.,thereifixedit,czkpcqz,9,t5_2se3l

10035153,0,t1_dbf3tpo,Automatic or manual trans? I have an auto and its shifting late and hard. I did some research and it looks like I just need to back out the pressure modulator adjustment by a half turn so Ill give that a try but the main questions I have . Mine is injected. Is there anyone left out there who either rebuilds or sells rebuilt injector pumps? Mine is fine now but Im looking to the future and want to start stockpiling parts or sending some of the more esoteric parts out for rebuild.. Have you looked into the CDI ignition mod? For about  you can get a CDI module that sits inside of the distributor cap and takes the place of the points plate. Has a hall effect sensor and ignitor in there. You never need to reset dwell or timing. Ive been thinking of dropping on in but I wanted to gear from others who have used them.. Info I can give... My brake booster was shot and NO ONE sells rebuilt boosters. There is a place in SoCal that rebuilt my booster and also bored and sleeved my master cylinder for . If you need your booster redone Ill dig out the name of the guys who did it for me. ,thereifixedit,dbflv0p,2,t5_2se3l
