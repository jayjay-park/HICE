11306597,0,t3_61co1j,Honestly it depends on what kind of position youre in.  There have been v and even v situations where I have managed to clutch thanks to my teammates giving callouts from Valk cams.  When you have the intelligence on your side I highly suggest playing aggressive if you can.  On the other hand if there isnt any sort of information to help you the best you can do is maybe hold site and get some picks or try to get lucky being aggressive.  Just never feel bad for not clutching.  Its not your fault you were put into such a horrible situation.  ,SiegeAcademy,dfdl3i2,3,t5_3jojv
11309269,0,t1_dfdvowo,Personally I would say stay in obj or very close. Your slow so you cant make it back quickly. Use the drone to relay information. And not blast every bad guy you see. Pick your shots. ,SiegeAcademy,dfdvzv8,3,t5_3jojv

11418495,0,t3_62zm4a,He really is just another sledge. Dont get me wrong I absolutely love buck he is by far my favorite attacking operator. But he plays just like sledge only he has a shotgun that can kill people easily if needed. You want to create your own LOS. Whether thats taking out walls between you and the enemy or shooting the ceilimgfloor above them out. Also if you want to make vaultable holes with his skeleton key make sure that you are standing far enough away from the wall. If you are too close to the wall the hole will not be vaultable and you will need to waste another shot or two. ,SiegeAcademy,dfq9wen,21,t5_3jojv

11527336,0,t1_dg2m05z,If you step back a little and aim slightly above the mirror then it should land somewhere between the middle of the doorway from servers and the floor. It may sound difficult to get it right but if you try it out you will see that its actually much harder to mess it up,SiegeAcademy,dg2miuc,1,t5_3jojv

11568436,0,t3_652pvv,Throwing a nitro behind them leaves them in a really risky situation specially if you are with teammates. If you dont immediately detonate but start shooting you might be able to kill him if his reflexes make him point at the nitro expecting it to detonate.,SiegeAcademy,dg7ada0,1,t5_3jojv
11617296,0,t3_65qa2l,Toggle lean and bind them opposite of the leaning direction. So instead of Q for lean right bind it to E and vice versa. Reason being when youre strafing left for example you dont want your ring finger or whatever to have to hit two keys. While holding A your index finger is then free to press E to lean left and vice versa. Takes some getting used to but it makes moving and leaning not as clunky. ,SiegeAcademy,dgctx4i,5,t5_3jojv

11663327,0,t3_66et23,I would suggest A. Always aiming at head level if not already and B.  Possibly practicing drop shotting in THunt going prone on a dime might help Bc prone sensitivity is lower but you wont sacrifice sensitivity when not drop shotting. I had this problem when I played console and it kinda turned me away bc PC was just easier for me so gl,SiegeAcademy,dgi1x4y,2,t5_3jojv

11726646,0,t3_67bkf4,If you learn the maps really well sledge opens up a ridiculous amount of flanking routes. You can go almost anywhere and fast avoiding choke points where defenders tend to camp. ,SiegeAcademy,dgp8uwz,2,t5_3jojv
