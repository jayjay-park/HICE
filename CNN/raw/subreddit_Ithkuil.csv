1755955,0,t1_ck0h9ch,Actually I provide the morphological and semantic analysis of this word in the June st  entry on the NewsUpdates page of the Ithkuil website.As for my fluency as Ive said many times I am fluent in Ithkuil morphology and syntax but not the lexicon or the morphophonology.   So I can map out the morphology of a sentence fairly quickly but then I have to tediously look up all the rootsstems and pour over the affix tables just like anyone else.jq,Ithkuil,ck0hv06,1,t5_2txjd

7269286,0,t3_4eup2y,Ilaksh had a beautiful script and very distinct from anything used by other languages. Theres lots of room to think about artistic usage and how differently wed have to read and compose written language using it.Edit It seems like the Ilaksh scripts diagrams could be interpreted without any phonetic knowledge whatsoever. In that case is it really a language as we know the term?,Ithkuil,d24guut,1,t5_2txjd

8546207,0,t3_4wtqc7,I have started creating a font with Ithkuil characters. It is a Unicode font with the characters encoded in the Private Use Area. Theres also a .cin IME table that facilitates the input of the characters. A big part of the written system modifiers has not been implemented yet as I see no other way to do it than creating tens of thousands of ligatures for all possible combinations otherwise it does not look good enough to be usable but all the basic characters and diacritics are available Secondary AspectModality characters are encoded as diacritics meant to follow the basic Case character. More information can be found in the README file in the repository.,Ithkuil,d69ui5s,2,t5_2txjd
