Theres narcomans homeless and Roma  groups that are associated with crime. While it doesnt have higher criminal index than many others its very high on violent crimes and sadly I must say my friend was recently attacked there. The neighbouring Karlin for example actually has higher index of crimes in general in comparison but it looks much nicer since lots of it was renovated after the  floods but Im biased cause my mom lives there and is satisfied with the district.Oh yeah now that I think about it you might want to consider flooding areas. Maybe not for renting but definitely if you planing on buying.

You dont need winter tires during winter if the weather conditions are good temperatures are highly above C and theres no chance of falling snow or roads getting slippery because of ice. Once the temperature drops they are mandatory though and you cannot drive without them. Its obviously the case nowadays but if it was eg. th November and it was C outside you could still drive with summer tires.,czech,cxigl22,2,t5_2qiht

6189939,0,t1_cysyfuw,gtMaybe you should check dictionary before attempting to sound smart. Definition of mainstream is The ideas attitudes or activities that are shared by most people and regarded as normal or conventional. Wiki is NOT a dictionary. Judging from what I hear from people around me and general internet discussions Zemans views are mainstream as hell. And as I generally dislike Sobotka kudos to him.gtAlso did you read it after you wrote it. It implies that going against majority is not bravery. In my book it is almost the definition of the word.No going against majority that has no power and just following European and media mainstream really isnt bravery its cowardice and treason in case you are a PM and it is a question of the highest national interest. And opinion of majority of people is daily labeled as farright nazi brown islamophobic etc. in basicaly all mainstream media and by elites which are the subjects that set what is deamed convetional and normal in public discussion. Zeman gets shit for his opinions which you consider mainstream everyday while Sobotka is praised and defended by media even when his fucking email account is hacked. It is beyond me how is it possible that media dont call for his resignation after showing such incompetence and endangering national security he can be now easily blackmailed and media simply ignore it. Hopefuly it will change after today and he will resign  today hackers published antiterrorist materials from national security council.gtAnd honestly there are plenty things for which our media can be criticized not adding to the masshysteria surrouding this crisis is not one of them. So far they reported pretty much everything save the made up cases with minimal bias one way or the other. hahahahahaha you are killing me please stop. Literaly every single opinion peace on idneslidovkyaktualneihned is dumb proimigration propaganda and reporting is heavily skewed as well. They were forced to objectivy report on Cologne because the censorship in Germany was uncoverd but even now their opinion pieces are like damn nazis now they will use the rapes that have absolutely nothing to do with muslim immigrant to futher their agenda.gtthose filthy elites who are selling us out argument. Pepa z depa knows more about politics and muslims than those kavrna people who spend years studying the problems. Or people who we voted in the office in first place and represent the majority of us. Well majority of those who bothered to vote.Muslim immigration wasnt subject of any elections they have no mandate nor support of majority in this regard stop pretending otherwise. And pretty much none of those elites studied immigration or islam their only qualifiation is arogance and contempt for common people exactly the same kind you showed right now.gtOnly thing Zeman is consistent in is representing his average vulgar pubgoer voter baseI dont want to destroy your reality but according polls when it comes to immigration Zeman is supported by more than  od population. I recommend you to read the leaked emails from Sobotka thats the best proof you can get.  In there traitors of the nations  Gabal Novotny and others  are discussing strategy of propaganda and manipulation they want to launch in order to change public opinion on refugees so they can bring in as much as posssible. According to them the antiimmigration opinion is widespread in ALL levels of society including people with degree. And according to the latest poll for idnes Zeman has the biggest support even among people with degree. Deal with it honey.,czech,cyt8bq8,2,t5_2qiht
