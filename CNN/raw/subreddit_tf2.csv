Furthermore the unmentioned ranged advantage can benefit the users combat ability greatly especially as a slow moving class who is challenged in melee combat anyway and in ways compensates for the minor damage reduction.There are two potential changes that I see fit for making the Disciplinary Action less advantaged in combat Increased range only registers on teammates if technically possibleOR  Reduce swing speedBoth would help in making the weapon less capable offensively and more centred around utility as the weapon was originally designed to be.,tf2,cegd4sm,1,t5_2qka0

64370,0,t3_1uu9w6,I love this idea and I think the stats fit it relatively well but it would need some kind of boost for people to use it over a flamethrower. Maybe have it so that enemies on fire take minicrits? Or make it a primary and take off the bad stats? I dont know but its a bit underpowerd right now. Also I love the design.,tf2,celrb60,8,t5_2qka0
64978,0,t1_celtj7r,True but I think Valve might actually sell more paint this way.I think a lot of people would be willing to buy  paints for a hat but not  of the same hat and  paints. Those people are only buying the one paint. So this would triple Valves paint sales for those people which is probably the majority of players.Would that make Valve more money than the current system? I dont know. Maybe there are lots of rich players buying  of the same hat and painting them all a different color. But I personally doubt thats the majority of players. I think a lot of people exist in that frugal  middle ground between not paying anything at all and spending endless supplies of money who are willing to spend some money just not on lavish stuff like buying numerous copies of the same hat.,tf2,celtt1k,17,t5_2qka0

88898,0,t3_1v414f,I think the weapon a tiny bit overpowered with it requiring a  ammo deduction per shot because anyone with mediocre aim can consistently land  damage hits. I would like to see the ammo deduction raised a little higher maybe to  ammo so that its not a complete upgrade to the default Shotgun if you have even the slightest idea how to aim. Right now it acts as an endlessly shooting shotgun that stings just as much as the default.You really have to focus on shots slightly outside of melee range though any more and youre wasting ammo. But since you shouldnt be using any secondary beside the Pistol when youre running Widowmaker it doesnt come up short. Ultimately its only downsides are occasionally having no means of self defense when youre building but usually your team will be protecting you and most Engineers who run the other primaries are used to that anyway.That out of the way its a really fun weapon and Im really glad the Engineer has an aggressive weapon without completely changing the class. I still stick to the default Shotgun though because I feel a tad bit guilty using a weapon I think is overpowered and because my Shotgun is strange.,tf2,ceojt1o,1,t5_2qka0

Brand new cant tell the difference between enemy and friends quickly.  Exhibited here the heavy who walked out.  Spies are essentially invisible to these people at all times.  Initiate  Still lacking standard reflexes but will be able to tell enemies apart.  Not too good with spies yet and may catch a few suspicious ones.  Rarely though.  Middled  Your typical  casual tf player.  Can tell the difference between spy and friend Regularly and does a pretty decent job at killing.  Perhaps  kills per life as heavy.  Advanced  Their spydey senses tingle whenever one is directly in front of them.  Frequently turns around to catch spies JUST about to get a backstab.  Has pretty good sense of their surroundings getting  kills as heavy per life.  Expert  You know the one.  The sniper that always headshots you while youre wiggling around in the air.  One that can successfully headshot you as a disguised spy.  Hell it seems like he knows where youre going when youre cloaked.  A backstab is landed on this character extremely rarely only when he underestimates you and tries to round a corner after you.  On average gets the same kills as Advanced but seem to be far harder to kill.  That domination emblem is annoying you too.

159983,1,t1_cewlcne,The Family Business does not compliment the Heavy because his main source of damage output is the Minigun and the Shotgun is only really used to dispatch lone enemies while getting into position you dont need a larger clip to do that. The Reserve Shooter compliments the Pyro more than it does the Soldier its easier and more reliable to puff people into the air with a compression blast than a rocket and the extra switch speed sees more usage on Pyro. Still the slight increase in burst damage isnt enough and the Reserve Shooter is inferior to the Shotgun. Different classes have different needs and wants and allowing every class to equip this Shotgun isnt the right approach imo.This is how Id like Shotguns to be balanced Reserve Shooter is now a Pyro exclusive weapon. Reserve Shooter now deals  damage against airborne targets instead of mini crits. Family Business now has  less clip and has  base damage. Added the Patriots Sidearm. A Soldier exclusive Shotgun with the same stats as the previous Family Business.,tf2,cewnljn,-8,t5_2qka0

Yes new players are probably going to get more kills with rollers than directs but in no way would they think There is no reason to learn to get  times the damage from this weapon by aiming it. How i would think about it is the stock adds another style of play that good players know how to abuse to block escape routes bouncing pipes off walls and the like. A crutch would be a grenade launcher which increased roller damage and reducing directs damage.  For me what confirms the LnL as a crutch is that it teaches you to aim with the quicker speed of pipe. I know some Demos who can only use the LnL because they cant get many kills using the pipe launcher despite that being the better weapon. I dont see how a weapon like that can be considered anything but a crutch.,tf2,cey5bcx,1,t5_2qka0

Thats fine in PvP and its rewards you for landing airshots which is nice but dont even think about using it in MvM.

226898,0,t1_cf47ks3,gt Lets start with rockets. If you have any amount of intelligence as a soldier you can play around airblast. Its really not that hard especially considering airblast and rockets have the same firerate. One miss on the airblast and you are done for.Nope. You treat Pyro as a robot here forgetting that human reflexes can be pretty amazing. I know a Div  Pyro who keeps killing Solly from the same HL team. That means something. No not that Solly is an idiot.gt Lets see Jarate Milk bonk Spycicle Chargincharge Being a pyro airblast and healthkits. All ways to be immune or to put out fire.I think that you havent seen sketcheks Pyro play. Critkilling Demoknight wChargin Targe with Axtinguisher and etcetera.In order to pull out the milk and jarate you have to either react in a speed of pyro or strafe good. Most likely the strafe does as much as delaying the kill. And as a Sniper youd have to pull out a miracle sniper shot or critkill with Bushwacka assuming the thrown Jarate has hit the Pyro.Most of the other ways are only possible within a second or two of burning somebody. And there are A LOT of cases when nothing extinguishing is around.gt Lets see pills. Pills have a faster firing speed unless these are being lobbed from a distance its unlikely you can negate them all.You can predict the first time you see a fired pill and then just proceed to move backwards. Should the enemy go after you you know when hell fire.And not to mention some pyro use the lying pills to grenade jump on them and kill the unsuspecting target.gt As a solly if you find yourself being ready to be hit by an axe while on fire your best bet is likely rocket jump. More often than not its unexpected and will get out out of range. Even if its unexpected Pyro can just turn your way and try to hit you the final time. And you know what happpens when you add a lag compensation to that right? A kill. Because the Solly even at full health is burning it will kill him in a second after hitting him with the axe. Or instantly.gt As a heavy you can survive a hit from this weapon. If you are over healed  hits is what it takes. However it makes little difference. If you are ambushing a heavy with a minigun you have the advantage. THats the point of the mini gun.Heavy in HL for example has a primary role of protecting the Medic. If something is hitting him then its not as important as something hitting the Medic.Besides thats the problem with Heavy. Pyros not really planning to even hit him unless its a terrible pub player.gt A scout really shouldnt be caught in the first place.Bullshit. As a Scout you also focus on closecombat so an airblast is unavoidable. But muh double jump  its not really something people remember on pub. Airblasting forces Scout to pick another position to attack thus giving your team time to kill him.gt Engie has his sentry guns. Even if you are useing minis a pyro will have a hard time dealing with it. He does have the homewrecker but then hes not useing axemailbox and there is no problem.Havent seen Pyro killing an Engie unless hes a combat engie and he overextends.gt Its unlikely a sniper will be caught in this trap either just due to positioning. If he does he has Jarate. Time it right and you will put yourself out piss on the pyro and set yourself up for a nice mini crit possibly a crit if you are using the bushwacka.Same as above. Besides who times anything when they are taken by surprise. Either a really skilled person or a lucky guy.gt and lastly spy. Spycicle really has little drawback especially if you have any remote skill with your revolver of choice. Really though a good spy should be able to out maneuver a pyro anyway. Unless you are caught from a pyros flames while invisible you certainly have the advantage with superior range and trickstabs if the pyro isnt paying much attention or isnt wise to those tricks.Thats the thing. You assume that Pyro plays on the pub level. But most likely he doesnt. Youre more than forced to use the revolver youre bearing.Oh and by the way. Activating Dead Ringer extinguishes you as well.,tf2,cf49k8y,1,t5_2qka0
227026,0,t1_cf49k8y,gtNope. You treat Pyro as a robot here forgetting that human reflexes can be pretty amazing. I know a Div  Pyro who keeps killing Solly from the same HL team. That means something. No not that Solly is an idiot.Its really not that hard to hit a pyro with blast damage or to throw off the timing of the majority of pyros. As soon as that pyro misses  airblast then its not to hard to kill him. If hes good enough that hes not missing a single one AND can manage to maneuver himself to avoid or reflect any rockets that can deal splash damage to him AND you dont have a shot gun on you. You should likely rocket jump away and return to your team because you must be alone at this point.gtI think that you havent seen sketcheks Pyro play. Critkilling Demoknight wChargin Targe with Axtinguisher and etcetera.Ive seen videos of this. yes its possible. No its certainly not easy. If you think for a second this is an op weapon because of this your out of your mind.gtYou can predict the first time you see a fired pill and then just proceed to move backwards. Should the enemy go after you you know when hell fire.This really doesnt make it OP now does it? At this point youre using your airblast as a means of escape and not as a death blow. No problems with puff and sting if the pyro is retreating.At those longer ranges you should be using your stickies anyway. At that point you can get the air detonations fairly easy. A charged shot from a sticky is also hard to predict and moves faster through the air. It shouldnt be too hard to hit a pyro with an air explosion.gtAnd not to mention some pyro use the lying pills to grenade jump on them and kill the unsuspecting target.Unsuspecting? Really? When youre staring right at the pyro. Not buying this one bit. You may be caught off guard a bit but worst case you switch to stickies and drop them where the predictable  landing spot will be. Near you. Use this to jump away and deal damage to the pyro at the same time.gtBullshit. As a Scout you also focus on closecombat so an airblast is unavoidable. But muh double jump  its not really something people remember on pub. Airblasting forces Scout to pick another position to attack thus giving your team time to kill him.I hope your joking. Yes if you get caught up in a battle at close range the pyro has the advantage however a scout does have longer range then pyro. You can pick him off with your secondary if need be. Worst case you attack from another angle. Not a problem for a scout. Lets say you dont have your pistol as your secondary. Its most likely bonk or milk then. Escaping a pyro even at close range as a scout shouldnt be THAT hard. Putting yourself out or bonking to avoid afterburn will save your butt and you live to fight another day.On top of this even if you are not getting kills it doesnt mean you arent being a good scout.  You should be using your speed to move through flanks and harass players. Getting a kill might mean you have less points but as long as you are annoying the other team and picking up health packs you are being of value. If a scout forgets his double jump on a pub that is  his problem. Your mobility is your strength as scout if you dont make use of it that is your fault as a player. That is a ridiculous argument to make.gtSame as above. Besides who times anything when they are taken by surprise. Either a really skilled person or a lucky guy.I do. It has nothing to do with skill but with experience. The only way to survive an ambush is to remain calm and not flip out. You learn to deal with ambushes. A new player will be taken advantage of but an experienced player will have delt with this enough times to know how to react properly. Ive pulled off plenty of jarate combo kills on an ambushing pyro in my time. Not that hard if you dont freak out. It wont mean you survive every encounter or every ambush but that pyro is likely not escaping unscathed.gtYoure more than forced to use the revolver youre bearing.Im not quite sure what you are saying here but if what you are getting as is that you are forced to use the revolver because you lose the knife that is true. But the revolver is quite a powerful weapon that many people undervalue. Even watch Stabby Stabby videos and hell constantly talk about the value of the revolver. And if you are reliable with the ambassador even better. Once you are exposed your revolver is your most reliable bet. Lets say you are using your stock knife. That is my preference after all. You can attempt to trick stab but any savvy player wont fall for that. Trick stabs are desperation moves and should be reserved as a last resort. Its unlikely they will work on anyone who is thinking unless they are inexperienced.Yes it does i forgot that one. Thank you.Im not saying its not a powerful combo it certainly is. Airblast is a powerful and annoying mechanic. But it fits well and makes the pyro a very versatile class. Without airblast pyro is only a ambush class which is majorly outshined by scout and spy. Spy effectively removes obstacles such as buildings and can instantly kill valuable pick targets such as medics and engies. While still having his revolver to fall back on to finish targets off and deal damage from a safe distance. Specially with a  accurate shot upon first shot fired.While scout deals massive damage at close range with his scattergun and can fall about to his quick shooting pistol from a distance if need be. his speed and aerial maneuverability make him perfect for harassment as well. You can close distance and avoid alot of fire from enemies.,tf2,cf4a1kl,1,t5_2qka0

247825,0,t3_1wwie0,Im assuming you use the normal loadouts for each class.ScoutLearn the range of the flamethrower stay out of it utilizing your faster speed and running away and shooting. You have to be close enough to deal good damage but make sure you never get lit up by the flamethrower. The flare gun isnt that much of a threat when you can do about  damage a shot while firing much faster. Pyros wont have as good aim with the shotty as most scouts so you should be able to kill them if they use that. Pistol is great before they get close nobody can dodge hitscan but you can dodge flares.SoldierYou can either get up in their face and fire unpredictably i.e not as fast as possible because that is PREDICTABLE and easy to airblast or use the shotgun. Again try not get get in flamethrower range where they can combo you. You have an advantage in shotgun duels but a good rocket is better if you know they cant switch to their primary fast enough. If they are WM or not aware a rocket to the feet does wonders.PyroWalk backwards it deals more damage and use the shotty if you really want to win the derpy pyro battles.Demoman WM pyros can easily be dealt with by putting a sticky far enough ahead of them you can det it right before they step on it. Otherwise spam pipes from long rangebehind cover to take full advantage of you firing faster than the airblast or just MM stickies. Stickies are more effective if you know how to wait until you have backpedaled far enough away from the airblasted stickies before detting.HeavyPoint and shoot. They should be a high priority despite you being their counter as their burst damage can really hurt if they get close to your fat slow body. If they are abusing cover to use flaresquick shotty shots if you are shooting them or someone unimportant spin down and walk to where you can shoot themthey cant shoot you or  if you are shooting a greater threat or you really want hurt who you are shooting just tank it and tell your team to take care of it.EngiePyros really shouldnt be a problem. Sentries can rape them and the wrangler solves the problem of airblasted sentry rockets. If you meet them alone treat them like youre a cautious scout and retreat back to the safety of your sentry andor team.SniperIf you are aware you should be able to see flares early enough to dodge them. This should be the only danger of pyros if they get close you have position that is either too vulnerable or too hard for your team to support.MedicBe aware and communicate with your pocket. If all else fails run and fire needles.SpyDont panic. Seriously just act like theyre another enemy. If you have the dead ringer pull it out when the pyro is airblasting.TLDR Play smart. Be aware. Stay out of flamethrower range where any decent pyro will inevitably kill you.,tf2,cf6fv84,2,t5_2qka0

Sure youll have a stunned engineer next to the active sentry but if you move to attack him youre still dealing with an active sentry with no damage on it even with a dead ringer youll lose a generous portion of health before you can get away. Also punishing engineers for something inherent to their class removing sappers isnt a good gameplay mechanic. Wouldnt the engie notice that the sentrys health isnt decreasing or that its still capable of shooting?This would make sentries a hard counter to spies theres no longer anything a spy can do to take down a sentry other than shooting it from outside of its range.

The variance in damage is the damage falloff on the explosive radius which is expanded per explosive headshot upgrade and the damage is boosted when you chain multiheadshots because when you see that  damage around the robots you tried to headshot it shows combined damage from two multiheadshots activating their Explosive Headshots.  The close range damage of the fully upgraded Explosive Headshot assuming the robots are bunched together is  damage in the radius with falloff the further the robots are from the base headshot.  With Projectile Penetration getting multiple headshots in one shot basically adds a multiplier to the Explosive damage you perform.,tf2,cfcunue,1,t5_2qka0

A few other server chains did this Nighteam being the other famous one.  Anyway these servers were making enough money to seriously clog up the quickplay button until Valve took matters into their own hand and changed quickplay such that A by default it would only connect to official Valve servers and B added an option such that instead of auto joining a server you get a list of  viable ones. These changes were very definitely aimed at shitty chain servers and hopefully its working.

362605,0,t1_cfibfqe,The FoW and Buff Banner are useful in conjunction of each other. The FoW is better for marking giants and can save the Banner for later use. As long as the Scout can manage to mark the target it doesnt matter if he ends up dying. The Soldier has to worry about staying alive while he has the Banner active. The Mark of Death is also independent of how much damage you deal and how far away everyone is from the Scout meaning its quicker to activate and team mates are more capable of dodging projectiles. Clumping together with the Banner could be dangerous especially against the stronger giants. Oh and it doesnt cost the Scout anything because it isnt necessary to pour money into making it one of if not the only scout melee you want to use. The Banner is good against overwhelming and continuous mobs of robots as well as being extremely effective against tanks. A Soldiers own firepower combined with at least one of the damage oriented classes during a buff is extremely effective at wiping waves. The fact that it can basically used indefinitely against a tank makes it nearly a necessity for tank destroying. It takes a little bit of time for the Buff to wear off to deal the little damage it takes and activate the it again as well as make the soldier a vulnerable target so it isnt really wise to use it without having put time and thought on when. It costs money to upgrade but it can last extremely long as well. Both have their uses on a team. Why wouldnt you want both anyways? Damage is damage.,tf2,cficlpv,10,t5_2qka0

You are and especially as a spy the only one to know what your intention was. Just be realist with yourself and work on what you think you should not what other think you should.And also not getting backstabs doesnt make you useless. Sometimes I get so much attention from some of the ennemy team that They lose time for their objective My team has more time to prepareAnd Im pretty sure during all that long time chasing me they were thinking something in these lines omg what a try hard he wont get any backstab ever.I may got  points for all that but I greatly participated in making them paranod and less focused on the actual objective.I hope I helped you,tf2,cfki6o3,7,t5_2qka0

Having been a counterrevolutionist RED Heavys father was killed by unknown causes. After the death of his father in autumn of  the Heavy was deported to a Northern Siberian gulag along with his mother and two sisters. The Heavy and his family worked at the gulag for three months until it was burned to the ground some time in December  and all of the prisoners had escaped. It was later found that the guards of the camp had been tortured to death. Evidently the Heavy is still in contact with his family and uses his mercenary wages to provide for them as shown in the comic Bombinomicon.,tf2,cfmnfxl,44,t5_2qka0

Managing to get a headshot from any direction with a pistol is challenge enough for most from what I have seen. Now consider the chances some random person will be able to kite you as scout and simultaneously muster a back of the head shot if we are assuming the same skill level as the aforementioned spies on pubs. You also forget that the pistol is inaccurate after the first shot and would be unreliable unless the user waited to regain said accuracy and all that assumes most people even know the pistol has such a property. Put this weapon in the hands of most players and they will be worse than useless. The only thing average players would be able to do with this would be to crush opponents who run exclusively in one direction  in a straight line who dont have audio and are incapable of turning to face their enemy.,tf2,cfn997p,-1,t5_2qka0

But full health just means youre a normal heavy. Dalokohs is actually a buff. A lone dalokohs heavy will defeat a lone sandvich heavy. Its pretty handy for the ninja heavy strategy if you plan your attacks around having a healthkit to reach afterward.That said it is a worse option than the sandvich almost all the time.

500546,0,t3_1ztrfv,It could potentially be the pyros greatest weapon if just one of several aspects of the game were slightly different. If more classes had and used items that applied wet status if more maps had water if when teammates extinguished eachother or themselves it would also apply wet status if bleed was considered wet status or if pyro had a secondary that applies wet status.Any number of very slight game tweaks would make this weapon reliable and lethal but as it currently stands its just an excuse for some players to sit underwater for the entire match which is the opposite of helpful.

522948,1,t1_cfzob21,gt Problem is once people are set into a class most of them arent gonna change just to counter a single engieMore completely they shouldnt have to. Yes counters are a thing. This is important. But you can avoid your counter. You cant avoid a gunslinger engineer because theres no incentive to build sentries in intelligent spots. They just get dropped everywhere. Because of this a single gunslinger spammer will make scout and pyro and a few other classes unplayable just by existing. Thats bullshit and I still dont understand why Valve cant see that.Sentries dont counter scouts exactly. They create no scout zones. This is why bonk is a thing. It doesnt allow you to operate within a sentrys influence but it will allow you get past it. But level threes are an investment and therefore cant shut down an entire map for a scout. They have to be placed well and guarded. Minis are not an investment and can therefore be placed anywhere at all. They do shut down the entire map for a scout. Theyre a mistake and Valve is too arrogant or blind to admit it and fix it.,tf2,cfzpqhy,-1,t5_2qka0

678045,0,t3_21wwet,My tips as a fairly good sniper would be as followsMovementIt is extremely essential as a sniper that you move all the time. At no point should you be standing still unless you can be assured of your safety spawn. Enemy snipers especially in pubs will target you and more experienced snipers who understand the value of countersniping will go out of their way to demolish you if youre standing around.Another important thing with movement is that you should change your sniping position often. Even if or especially if you do well in a spot you should move because respawn times are short and people you shoot will come back and overpower you. Dont be the sniper that sits in the same corner all game and just increases the killstreak of his opponents.WeaponsMy personal preferences for rifles are the stock and bazaar bargain depending on the skill level of my opponents. Bazaar is great if youre landing your headshots. I use the SMG which has a major role in intimidation as well as for finishing off headshot opponents although an unscoped bodyshot will do the same. The SMG works best when you cant be assured of support from your team. Jarate is a support weapon. Melee doesnt really matter I find the shiv and stock to be most applicable in pubs though.TrainingTry playing sniper only servers for a bit but bear in mind that the skills you learn there arent really applicable in actual games. The best thing you can learn there is quicker reflexesI recommend playing some pubs and putting yourself into situations where you have to kill or be killed. Sometimes you can get a kill on a opponents merely because they underestimate you and expect you to run away.,tf2,cghcebh,2,t5_2qka0

Soda Popper has a DPS of  when factoring reloads in while the Baby Faces Blaster and Scattergun have a DPS of  with an infinite clip. With the regular clip of  the BFB only has a DPS of ..This means the Soda Popper is actually much better at sustained combat than thought and its super fast firing speed also means that its great for hitandrun tactics. Even without Hype the Soda Popper feels like a satisfying weapon to use. Without Hype its unfortunately not to great at dealing with highhp classes as you dont get  Shots per clip. Otherwise its superior to the BFB in Burst and extremely long combat.. MobilityIf you have the HighGround and you see a Soldier what do you think? Crap hes going to Rocket Jump up to me. If you see the Scout what do you think? Hes grounded hell have to run into the house and up the stairs to get to me. Isnt that so freaking unfair? Uh who is supposed to be the fast guy around here. Thats right. Me! The Scout! Well wait and see the reactions there will be none since theyll be dead of that stupid Sniper when you turn into a freaking bird! Whoosh! And dont forget you can ingest CritACola which pretty much makes you as fast as a BFB Scout. They speed boost doesnt effect a fully charged BFB Scout. Sure you dont have a Secondary but with CritACola your primary will deal enough damage to bust you out of either situation. Give em da jukesAny Soldier worth his salt will still have trouble fighting a TripleJumping Scout. What will happen when he fights the SextupleJumping Scout? Exactly hell shoot his Rockets completely miss and then realize hes using the Gunboats. If he is using a Shotgun you still have a height advantage and an airborne target who erratically jumps everywhere is much harder to hit than a grounded target.. Hit and RunLike the Baby Faces Blaster its extremely hard to escape from or catch up to a Soda Popper Scout. Are you seriously going to try to be as mobile as a Bird? The Scout can take flank routes and cut you off from places you wouldnt expect and can fly up to the escape route that was previously only accessible to the Soldier and Demoman. And if hes using the Winger possibly to places that werent accessible to anyone!,tf2,cgj3zmt,9,t5_2qka0

I have to agree and disagree with them on this one though.On one end theyre stopping people from only posting their videos which are monetized but they wont ban you if youre not the creator of the content which stops people from basically spamming their content without ever doing anything else on reddit than making a profit.But on the other end thats what makes reddit stagnate so often. Its making a dent in the OC on subs made for OC while encouraging more of memes reposts and shitty circlejerk posts. Shadowbanning is also pretty extreme to be honest.

780335,0,t3_23392v,Pretty sure each and every classes have counters to each other. Obviously pyro is the soldiers HARD counter.Lets face it you will be countered in a v situation no matter what youll do. Pyro is known for their burst damage in close quarters flanks and at chokes. Oh you pulled out a shotgun? Let me ram this flamethrower and this axe up your freedom hole. You may win in a DM situation but you will always not win in a class situation. The best way to play this situation is to escape. And escape to your TEAMmates.The magic in doing better in TEAM Fortress? Play as a team! Grab a scout or engy or tell sniper to focus pyro. Or dont go alone when you know a pyro is coming your way. In competitive I doubt a solly would go charging at a pyro let alone he is probably with medic and combo. gtDoes anyone else agree with this? How would you balance out the matchup? Please dont suggest that its hard to reliably reflect and therefore balanced I play against pyros who can reflect  of direct hit rockets.I disagree with you. From the sound of it if a class counters another class then it is unfair Exaggeration on reflecting direct hit rockets.. If a pyro beats let say an Engy in a v situation would you called that unfair?  The match between you and that pyro is supposed to be unfair to the soldier side because the pyro is suppose to counter projectile classes. You dont hear a demoman complain because pyros also counters him. I might as well complain how the engy is overpowered against scout because he builds minis thus needs some balancing. How would you balance pyro? It is already balanced enough that is why you dont see pyro running to mid in s albeit if you are good you can run him in iron leagues.,tf2,cgsz7sj,6,t5_2qka0

Why is there no more payment methods and will we see more in the future? Does outpost understand that it doesnt feel secure for the customer to enter their cc information along with all personal details DIRECTLY ON THE SITE?

881363,0,t3_247lnj,It took me nearly  hours but ultimately I got several unusuals and I didnt have to pay for any of them. Long Story AheadI started giving away hats to random kids Id see in servers you know the type new a name with a bunch of numbers in it profile pic is a glowing pic of one of the classes. If they were friendly and without hats Id send them a trade and give them a hat nothin fancy just a craft hat or some such though I tried to always pick nice ones. Every time I did it always seemed to really make their day so I just kept doing it. For me I could spend the equivalent of  a day making a bunch of kids happy because a stranger on the internet was generous for no reason.However I decided I wanted to try to scale this up. I started a trade server and I pretty much just poured my money into it. I had raffles really often giving away dozens of hats to whoever was around. Id find the nice traders and overpay them for their items just because I hoped theyd be successful.Really quickly I started to get a following. People hung out in the server all the time. My friends list grew to hundreds of people. With all this attention came lots of highrollers. I started to see people with inventories like treasure rooms. People who had backpacks worth thousands of dollars. These guys generally got to where they were through being stingy but they liked me because Id never done a single deal in bad faith Id ardently worked to make sure I treated everyone fairly and was a nice and pleasant person to all. Several of these highrollers after seeing me be nice to others and seeing that I could be trusted started giving me items to give away. With sponsors the community exploded. By my count at its peak the community had tens of thousands of unique players connecting every month. For doing all this for being nice I was given gifts some in the form of unusuals. I now have two unusuals Smoking chieftain and stormy attendant as well as a maxs severed head. At one point I had nearly a dozen unuasls but I gave them all away. Last time I checked my backpack was worth several hundred dollars.The sad thing is that it couldnt last. Life got more busy and I couldnt give so much of my time or money to the cause anymore. Though I started all that as a way to have some fun and make people smile it attracted a lot of people and became a chore. I tried to keep it up but I didnt have what it took to keep it fun and friendly. Ultimately it caved in under its own weight the server shut down and at this point I dont really even play TF anymore.Im glad I did it it was fun while it lasted and I dont think Ill ever forget it. But like all things even the good ones this to had to end.,tf2,ch4gq10,38,t5_2qka0

I went on classifieds and found quite a few for under two keys and then many many more for exactly two keys. But I went to outpost to see if I could find a deal. Instead I found three people selling for three keys two people for four and then everyone else for two. And its like that on most items since why would you try to price competitively as long as your bumping gets you to the front of the page anyway.

A squishy average speed and immobile class with less damage output than a Scout and if he overextends and commits against even half skilled players he will be shut down in an instant. This is why Gunslinger Engineer sticks behind his team in competitive and holds the objective.

The items dont have to be of the same class so it can be better than just scrapping using the tf crafting system.  In general when people want to buy specific items they have to pay  full scrap even though it SHOULD only be worth half a scrap.  This is how scrap.tf makes its money.  Its pretty hard to sell individual items though but you can try on sites like tfoutpost.  A great trading tool if you ever get serious about trading is trade.tf  It automatically sorts trades from various trading sites and gives you the ones which are the best deals.  You have to pay  key a month for the service but you can potentially make much more.  Good luck with trading and I hope I helped you!,tf2,ch8ttk5,3,t5_2qka0

Even if you later sell below standard prices you still make money.The problem I have is that in general quick buyers ask absolutely stupid prices no one would ever sell at. Ie  of backpack.tf prices.

What you want is a way to keep your free metal from losing value and as more metal is constantly created its not going to stay at a flat rate especially since its free.   years ago you buy  key and trade for  hats today you buy  and can get an easy  so IMO buying keys is a better deal than ever. Of course if you want to buy all the fancy cosmetics for free your going to have to invest more time and effort but its free. There isnt really a metal sink that could work without devaluing something else the best bet would be to add some choice to the type of hat crafted when you actually use metal this way more people might choose to make their own hat. ,tf2,chp2nzi,2,t5_2qka0

An actually competent parent will do their own research about whether a game is appropriate for their child because the ERSB is quite strict about their ratings Im not saying they shouldnt be strict however as it could cause complications if they were to loosen up. Team Fortress  only includes the occasional cuss word and any blood included isnt very realistic looking. There arent any sexual references and the only thing that could be an issue to kids could be the community.In addition I doubt you have ever listened to ERSB either because most people never do. I personally have played a game of every single ERSB rating before their recommended age including E which you are supposed to be  and I know  of the students of the students who own video game systems or PCs that can run games have played M games before they were  the other  only play Madden FIFA and whatever the NBA game series is. So ERSB isnt reliable for anything and they should not be listened to by wise parents or children but game rating should instead be left to individuals.,tf2,chs8ocg,0,t5_2qka0

1135574,0,t3_273kkx,Pyro.I dont mind the ones that set you on fire and then switch to a melee weapon to take you out as that kind of takes timing and skill but when a pyro just wms at you and kills you in a few seconds with no skill involved it really annoys me.

Not really but I just wanted to say something.The KritzkriegThis medigun can easily devastate an entire team but the main problem with it is that your healing target gains absolutely no sort of invulnerability meaning that they have to make every shot count otherwise its lights out.The QuickFixIs your team almost constantly on low health? Then this is the Medigun for you! The increased healing rate means you can quickly jump from one healing target to another generally making you more effective. And the increased healing balances the  Overheal quite nicely against classes like the Heavy. and the Ubercharge even overheals yourself which is a nice bonus. Unfortunately you sometimes get those bastards who will explosive jump solely to make you fly off a cliff.The VaccinatorDo you find yousrelf never being able to build Ubercharge? Or are your patietns dying too quickly? Or do you just want to be a bastard and pocket a DDS Sniper? Then this is the Medigun for you. The damage resistance is godlike especially with the way that it negates all crits of the damage type you re resisting against. And those miniubercharges can be perfect if you want a quick escape but dont want to use up the entire charge. And I personally find the . overheal rate almost negligible Final VerdictThe Vaccinator is the God of MedigunsIf Im playing seriously this is the medigun I always use. No question. The resistances are just so damn useful.,tf2,chz4jyh,4,t5_2qka0

If you dont want to go through the motions of reading my post here.gt Your definition vs my own.You were arguing against my position and I already defined the terms I was using. You do not get to redefine them for me. P.s. If you think Pyro is so great against Scout you should try playing Pyro in HL.gt MGE.If a Spy and a Heavy MGE the Heavy should win. Does that mean that the Heavy counters Spy or change the fact that Heavy is extremely vulnerable to Spies ingame? No. Because MGE is not representative of real play or real time counters. There is no improvising in MGE and very little catching an opponent off guard. Its v DM. The only reason Soldiers generally beat Scouts in MGE is because theyre running pocket Soldier and Scout will never have the element of surprise or be able to play opportunistically. If Soldiers ran anything other than the Shotgun in MGE the outcome would be very different. Still this is irrelevant for the reasons I listed above.gt The scout HAS to flank the heavy in order to win which is why the heavy is a counter to him.The Spy has to flank the Heavy to win which is why the Heavy is a counter to him.    The rest of your post was egregious strawmanning. Try harder next time if you want me to take you seriously. If you look back at how I defined a counter class youd see that it is perfectly in line with Engineer vs. Scout. A Scout will have a distinctive disadvantage in the vast majority of situations by virtue of the Engineer always having a gun up or teammates closeby. It is not in line with Soldier vs Scout or Heavy vs Scout. You do not define my terms.,tf2,ci0siks,1,t5_2qka0

1190172,0,t3_27qz7l,If you dont have a lot of time to commit you can still absolutely be on a HL team. A lot of Iron teams only scrim once or twice a week. Some teams dont even scrim they just play matches usually Mondays nights in UGC.What I would do is make a post in rtflft explaining what youre looking for including how many nights a week youd want to commit. Expect a scrim or match to take . hours including warmup waiting for everyone to show up and the match itself.You also might try posting the same thing on the UGC forums.I would not recommend being a sub. Even if you can only make  of matches and scrims look for a main position so that you will be able to play when you are available. A lot of times subs wont get to scrim and wont get a lot of matches.,tf2,ci3ihgb,8,t5_2qka0
1190884,0,t3_27qswc,Yes Heavy is easy. However TF is a very balanced game and the Heavy is not op. Hes a class in a game which has some pretty good balance and design. If you have a goal and find Heavy the easiest way to get to it so be it. Personally I find Heavy boring but do you know what my main is? Engineer. You literally sit behind a massive gun that shoots for you. Thats it. Personally I find that almost if not just as easy as Heavy. However that doesnt mean Im a noob for maining him. One could argue that all Demos have to do is hold m and spam m or all scouts have to do is spam space bar and m yet these classes are considered somewhat high skill at least in comparison to Heavy. If they dont want Heavies they can go find themselves a v.

1226549,0,t1_ci7kmrz,Not exactly. Apparently the attribute ingame applies condition  disciplinary action when firing a flamethrower and slightly pulls forward. Even if it did not apply this condition movement speed and a pull while firing would not create as many problems as a suction would. Youd only have to account for generally one direction and one entity a slowdown when moving back and a speedup when moving forward.A suction would have to account for sucking underneath a player to drag them down above a player to drag them up behind to drag them back or slow down their move speed or in front to speed them up if they are running forward etc.  if you are reading this send me a pm many things the engine has to account for and that doesnt even count multiple entities if you sucked in a group of players at once.Interestingly enough the person who tested this FlaminSarge mentioned that you move forward at a greater speed when in the air which is pretty cool.Edit Judging by the lack of response of any kind I have the conclusion that people hate reading.

1237623,0,t3_289ook, Dont build in a place just because its popular. Consider the tactical advantages and disadvantages of the hold. I.e. Sniper sight lines places where Spies may decloak health ammunition where you could be spammed from where the enemy team will push with an Uber to destroy your gun. Everybody is a Spy until they have demonstrated otherwise. If theres a Heavy a Medic and a Sniper and the Heavy is shooting his Minigun with the Medic healing him then the Medic and Heavy are not Spies but the Sniper could still be a Spy. If he scopes in or takes a shot then youll know he isnt a Spy but if he doesnt then dont trust him. Spy check him if he comes near your buildings. Turn your game volume up and dont listen to music whilst playing. You need to be able to hear Spies decloak and if youre attentive you can hear player footsteps including the footsteps of cloaked Spies. Be observant. Check the scoreboard occasionally. If youre playing CP or are on PL  CP Defense and your team has significantly less players than the enemy team then it may be worth backing off instead of attempting to contest the enemy team by yourself. If youre fighting a Spy check the scoreboard before and after killing the Spy. If you dont gain a kill from killing the Spy hes feigned his death. Look at the health and ammo crates after killing Spies or when teammates arent around to see if they disappear. Dispensers and Teleporters are very important with the Gunslinger equipped too. The only two Koth maps where its permissible to not build teleporters are Nucleus and Harvest due to excessive spawn camping.,tf2,ci8uklc,1,t5_2qka0

He also cant stab you which makes the enemy sniper have a much harder time dealing with you since you will usually have a buff and demoheavy spam to support you making you an even more valuable target which he cant do anything about with your razorback.

Yeah you guys can say change is a good thing but that doesnt give Valve a pass for putting out a shitty change.

1263870,0,t1_cibptzh,The pyros meta really hasnt changed that much. The new axe means the pyro really needs to focus on its streangth as an ambush class. Which is really the two main ways the pyro succeeded at. You either get around and look for spots to suddenly jump out and kill people or you play the pybro and watch the back of the Medic and his pocket or assist the engie. Keep in mind if you are playing pybro with the engie its not just about spies. Your job is to watch the sentrys blind spots. You need to airblast rockets and stickies away from the sentry air blast ubers away from the sentry air blast players that are trying to corner the sentry into its line of sight and so on. Exampe with the demo the Demo is the hard counter to the engie. no other class can take down a nest faster then the demo man can and with his arching projectiles he can take care of a nest completely out of its line of sight. The most common way to do this is with stickies. Before the change you can  stickies and take out a sentry. Now with damage ramp up they will have to do  stickies or do the  stickies and wait the  seconds. This gives the pybro and engie more time to deal with the demo and his stickies. On the flip side of the meta the demo man will have to rethink his weapon choices. While his stickies are reduced in damage at first his pipes are not. And  pipes will take out any sentry still. Honestly it will do it faster than the sticky launcher will. So the demo can take a moment to set up his attack set stickies between him and the sentry attack the sentry and when a pybro engie or anyone else attacks kill them with stickies.The other meta change I am REALLY hyped for with the sticky launcher is sticky jumping. If you ever watch high end demo play you will see sticky jumping and pathing is huge. You have to plan it out so youre picking up health and still moving a long. Demo sticky jumping is also much more damaging than soldier rocket jumps are. The new nerf is actually beneficial for that. This is going to allow lower skilled demos to jump more often and higher skilled jumpers will be scary fast and have a larger health pool when they get to their destination... and watch out for those pipes. A skilled demo man knows them uses them and will finish you with them.  will make people question pushing the demo and  will kill everyone except in specific situations.So the meta has changed some but not much.,tf2,cibsuv4,3,t5_2qka0
1263906,0,t1_cibqefh,I agree with you. I took the last few years off TF and just started playing a couple months ago but I was under the impression that the stock flamethrower had been given a damage buff at some point to make it more viable but youre saying it was nerfed? Thats strange why would they do that? Why give in to the whining special snowflakes?Its really weird how people bitch about the stock flamethrower calling it the wm and when I ask them how I should play the class they tell me I should be doing puff and sting with the axtinguisher and the flare gun as if that isnt an OP combo. Ridiculous. Also has the airblasts range always been so large? It feels way too easy to get out of most situations by airblasting someone and running away with the Powerjack plus with the Reserve shooter...All in all I think theyve done some weird and not correct things to make Pyro viable. I just dont understand why they allow the Degreaser to be better than stock as it clearly is when every other classs stock is always the clearcut best option.,tf2,cibt045,1,t5_2qka0

Team mates shooting through the trap or if youre by yourself spam some pipes so they have to make a choice Stay back hit the stickies and take pipe damage through direct or rollers or push forward hope you move faster or can take more damage than the trap can hit you for and get that demo down. Often if people are shooting at an enemy they think less about traps and more about the threats in front of them.The other thing with traps is to be smart with them. A tactic I frequently do is set an obvious trap up with a second trap less obvious location. This way they focus and think they clear things with the obvious one then fall to the second one. ,tf2,cibudqk,2,t5_2qka0

This isnt a case of nb not knowing what to do this is a case of our team lost so instead of assessing our mistakes lets make the new guy do impossible things and then blame him if we lose. Why the fuck would any newcomer ever want to play that?This isnt a case f strategies and tactics. I love that. Im good at it. Comp TF is a club where everyone has changed the rules and customs not because of competitive play or to see who is the best but because they specifically want to artificially alter what is acceptable become masters of their own little game and exclude newcomers and so they can feel superior in their own little club. Anyone who says otherwise is naive. Thats why people are freaking out over this update. Yes Demo was integral to comp play but they restricted and altered the rules so much that they cant handle what should be an obvious balance to the game. They changed the rules and are upset that Valve crashed their little insular party.I know Im probably coming across as butthurt but Im not an idiot.

However I think a nerf along the lines of a firerate rampup would accomplish more than the accuracydamage rampup. For one there is a more discrete way to note when the rampup actually takes place and secondly it would be a little bit more intuitive and realistic.I disagree about the variance in loadouts. Tomislav is pretty much completely irrelevant now. Brass Beast still heavily heheh cripples the Heavys already limited mobility. Nataschas extra ammo is a move in the right direction but its just so impaired and the slowing mechanic isnt worth it. The HuoLong Heater might seem like a useful utility at first but it absolutely chews up ammo and the fire ring doesnt actually stop Spies and any competent Spy jumps over it anyway. However every minigun is still better than every shotgun at shortmedium ranges. The only advantage the shotguns have is mobility.,tf2,cigszxu,7,t5_2qka0

1335722,0,t3_29dcl7,Use this blog Hes a top tier Demoman who writes articles on things such as sticky traps making space and dealing damage. Really helped me step up my game. As for your nades the nade launcher is really used for selfdefense and creating space. So its really vital to be sure that you hit as many pipes as possible when a scout is in your face. As for damage look for lots of heavily populated groups. Creating space is always useful because your team can come and clean up the enemies when there is space. Something I like to do on wide open maps is fire  nades Lotta people are scared of rollers then when the enemies are retreating lay  or  stickies behind the nades to make sure that that space is protected. If anyone wants to improve upon this just reply I just made this up and it usually works for me. Believe it or not there is a lot more to Demoman than sticky spamming. ,tf2,cijvvhw,2,t5_2qka0

You just cant be cocky and stupid. Making key picks is still perfectly possible. If not at times easier for the spy than other classesThe IW and CnD are actually already very quiet there is no need to make them quieter.Spy already forces people to play extremely inefficiently and with silent decloak it would be horrendously unfun for newbies because they wouldnt know how to counter it. There would be nothing to associate with the backstabnormally theres an uncloak sound or an oddlyacting disguised person. But here thered be nothing.

1390036,0,t3_2a1afa,For Pub play try Blutsauger Normal Medigun Offense Kritzkrieg Defense and Ubersaw.Atleast thats how i dont have any problems in Pub and i main Medic. Also you could be a bit more specific why you feel like you fail? I mean its not even possible to heal EVERYONE so you shouldnt feel like you make a mistake if you dont. Also you die of course you do. As a Medic you are the Target  for atleast if they know what they are suppossed to do with there classes Scouts Spy Sniper. Thats like  classes that want to see you dead. I highly reccomend just Jumping alot Crouching. Always be aware of the Situation you are in  learn your maps where the Health Kits are where you can escape. Always have a Plan B to leave when your healing target dies.Thats why i use the Blutsauger i just walk backwards and most pub player just die because they run in the syringes and i get fully healed during that.Also in my Opinion the QuickFix is way to situational the Uber can easily be canceld by a Headshot Stickys Crockets and many more things.And the Amputator well of course you will die when you use that Taunt you are not Moving at all and you are sooo easy to hit as a Scout as my second i love when a Medic just stands there and tries to taunt heal run in  meat shots run back away and the team didnt even notice most of the times.Another thing why i use the Ubersaw is to get quickly rid of annying tryhard scouts and with that even fill your Uber. Also its great if a Spy tries to dick around you can kill him and get some uber of it Of course only when he isnt in disguise.You can be pretty agressive in Pubs and be succesfull with it if you know the bascis if combat in TF Like when to run how to dodge etc.TLDR Movement and Situation Awarness always have a plan B.,tf2,ciqita2,22,t5_2qka0

1404636,0,t1_cisc9x5,Well thats what happened. Everything else was nerfed.Minigun and Sticky Launcher were heavily nerfed to make them ineffective to use when ambushed less effective to throw out at close range. These two weapons were some of the hardest for a pyro to deal with even with a successful ambush. The nerfs made it MUCH easier for pyro to approach them but axetinguisher crits would have been too easy to get so it was nerfed a little to minicritscrits depending on the angle.Consequently the Sticky Launcher is also one of Heavys worst enemies huge and high damaging clip negates Heavys advantage in health so by nerfing air stickies Heavy was largly buffed in survivability so his minigun nerf was a fair tradeoff.The nerfs made sense as a group doubling as buffs to everyone else to diversify class roles but since the SL nerf was reverted entirely for review they make less sense. Until they come up with their SL nerf the balance of the classes is going to be off. Heavy especially got the shortest end of the stick. Demos are stronger than ever.,tf2,ciscnl4,1,t5_2qka0

Theres a demo around the corner better check for stickies Theres a sniper better jump when coming around the corner so I do not get headshot. and similar for DotaThat is something I miss when playing CSGO. You do not counter your opponent you just need better aim reflexes and skills associated with reflexes.So I guess the point is people are not all the same and TF is a shooter that already is pretty close to Dota.,tf2,cisgnr5,2,t5_2qka0

1428761,0,t3_2ahzg8,I dont think Valve should be obliged to offer any servers in ANY particular region reasoning being that they have a free Source Dedicated Server client that is available to everyone. On top of that most modern regions have good quality game hosting services.You should look at creating community servers in your own region and supporting them via a community coffer. I dont think its Valves job to support smaller isolated communities when they provide the tools to do so for free.That being said I do believe that MvM Mann Up servers need a more equal distribution globally so that international players have a smoother experience. This is purely due to how the loot system is controlled by Valve directly for MvM. Regular gameplay servers on the other hand?

1503506,0,t1_cj4o7eh,A Spy is good for picking off unaware or slow targets yes. If the enemy is dumb enough to try Heavy Rushing theres a good chance theyre not smart enough to pay attention to whatevers behind them. One person notices them and theyre going to fall over. This is based on skill levels of course  a godly Spy would get the kills without even trying and the Heavies would eventually get angry and go Pyro whereupon theyd continue to stab them and then laugh.A Phlog Pyro needs to do some damage first similar to how the Spy needs that first kill with the YER. If the Heavies notice the Pyro then yeah theyre going down. If the Pyro gets that wonderful Mmmph Bar charge with the correct positioning they can deal heavy damage to all the Heavies in a couple of seconds roughly  DPS unless someone wishes to correct meA Spy would be able to take them out one at a time which is still quick but leaves a small chance of the Heavies noticing the Spy and killing him. A critPhlog Pyro would be able to reduce all the Heavies to ashes at the same time with the same risk that the Heavies swing round and reduce you to Swiss cheese. One instantly removes them from the fight one at a time another reduces everyones health exceedingly quickly but runs the risk of not killing anyone if you position yourself wrong though this is also true of the SpyIt also has the added benefit where if a Heavy Rush cant handle the Pyro they cant swap to the Pyros hard counter in a fit of anger because theyre already the Pyros hard counter!,tf2,cj4qks1,1,t5_2qka0

Nothing Valve could ever do to refined would change that in the slightest short of creating a crafting recipe to make a key which absolutely will not ever happen. A loose tie between metal and keys like OP suggests would do nothing but raise the price of metal to match it. It wouldnt do a single thing to the price of keys themselves they would remain at ..The upfront cost is . but once its in the economy its value is determined by economic forces of which the original cost is one. Keys commonly sold for . USD each between players at one point so its disingenuous to say that key value in terms of USD is a constant.

1560187,0,t1_cjbhevi,All Ill say is that if a person cant get very far before being killed theyre less inclined to learn the mechanics if they arent having fun in the game. Random crits can give someone a chance to not get blitzkriegd by someone else whos stomping everyone.The critchance damage caps at  for  so both players could shoot people for a short while and still have a low chance of landing a crit. With your comment about Someone already doing very well doesnt need more help doing well? Valve has said in their ingame dev commentary that crits were developed to allow someone doing good to do better. That they also give newbies a chance to survive a fight is a bonus.Melee weapons have a moderately high damage already and their crit chances are also pretty damn high   base boosted to  at full damage dealt. Thats why people going ham as it were tend to go on pretty big rampages before dying   damage strikes lays out all but two classes if they arent overhealed and can defeat an overhealed Heavy in three strikes two if hes being fired at. If you want to convince people to get into melee range without random crits you can boost the weapons default damage  so a melee does  damage or something.And you keep going on about these tutorials. TFs tutorials teach basic gameplay mechanics like shooting people knowing what range to use which weapons and knowing when to reload. It also teaches Engineers building basics but thats all they are  basics. You learn a lot more in regular games than you do in tutorials and if new players keep coming up against someone thats got years of experience under their belt theyre not going to get the chance to learn.,tf2,cjbucab,0,t5_2qka0

It is against the sites rules to be consistently posting your own content and nothing else For reference I will post the list of whats probably spam and whats not from the sites FAQgt Its not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way but you should sort of consider yourself on thin ice. So please pay careful attention to the rest of these bullet points.gt If you spend more time submitting to reddit than reading it youre almost certainly a spammer.gt If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a sites that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way and additionally if you do not participate in discussion or reply to peoples questions regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get you are a spammer. If over  of your submissions are your own sitecontent youre almost certainly a spammer.gt If people historically downvote your links or ones similar to yours and you feel the need to keep submitting them anyway theyre probably spam.gt If people historically upvote your links or ones like them  and were talking about real people here not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you  congratulations! Its almost certainly not spam. But were serious about the not people you asked to go vote for you part.gt If nobodys submitted a link like yours before give it a shot. But dont flood the new queue submit one or two times and see what happens.Bolded is what likely applies to your case when it comes to this list.This is a warning that previous spammers of very similar or the exact same nature have been shadowbanned from the site and that you are coming quite close to this fate yourself.Shadowbans are different from normal subredditonly bans which will usually have a message indicating why so at least in this subreddit other subreddits may vary with their procedures unless a persistent raid on a thread is in progress. Shadowbans still let the user post links and submit comments but they will automatically get flagged by the spam filter and wont show up unless a mod approves them. To the user they still exist but to everyone else they dont. Shadowbans will have no notice if one takes effect. This type of ban is redditwide.Normal bans from a subreddit on the other hand differ from a shadowban. With this type of ban the user cant even submit posts or comments at all. Normal bans always have an automated notice but a mod can opt to give a reason as to why through a comment though this varies from subreddit to subreddit. This type of ban only applies to a certain subreddit.Further action could be taken if this type of behavior continues.,tf2,cjdj18h,3,t5_2qka0

Havent gotten into it yet but I do hope to someday. TFCenter is really good practice though besides that I like to play on Nucleous and Badwater a lot.Im not sure what Im maining yet atm. I took a  year break in  and then got back into it when MVM started. I majorly play Scout A friend of mine even recently gifted me a Strange Pro Scatter with Demoman and Soldiers killed parts bought it on the market for  dollars Steam Market is a strange place. but I play a lot of Sniper and Spy though Id say Im better at Sniper between those . Ive basically been switching between the two when Im in TFCenter and when Im in pubs I usually play Spy.And for all  I have them all killstreaked out except Scout as I dont know if I should just use Ham or Boston Basher yet I also plan on Pro kill streaking their Primarys but I dont have the items or monies to do so atm Unless my friend or some random strange will be generous again.I love this game to death I hope to continue playing for years to come.EDIT Fixed some typos and added some other stuff.,tf2,cjg5a97,1,t5_2qka0

1615163,0,t3_2csnwi,TF was originally designed for v play but if v or v saw more play and more people supported it Valve could redesign it competitive in mind. I think they just dont see it viable because not enough people play competitive or follow the scene.I think its a bad argument that v scene cuts v of the classes on purpose. v scene cuts them because they are the weakest classes. In Dota if there were no balance updates the metagame would get stale fast with maybe  heroes picked because the pro scene would see the others not worthy and its hard to invent a new meta without a balance update.Valve can easily buff the weaker classes. Give engineer  more health? Give Heavy a bit more DMG? If they wanted to support competitive TF they would do that. Valve however balances the game according to v pubs because thats where the biggest playerbase is. If only a little cared about Dota competitive scene you could see Riki nerfs because thats what pubbers think is OP.

1615877,0,t1_cjit2ym,i knew i should have just ignored this obvious bait threadgtYes... You can.No... You cant.gtBe skillful and avoid the shot altogether or dont walk by the crit sticky or shoot it. Dodge the rocket. Its hard to do but a skillful player should be able to do it.so in other words be more skilled than my opponent and dont put myself in situations where they could potentially hit me even once and i should be easily able to avoid crits.lets say im a scout and my team has put a shitton of damage on the opposing demo whos currently at around  HP.  hes retreating around a corner and its my job to clean him up before he gets health and comes back to stifle our push.  i know i can take  pill or sticky to the face and survive and that he wont have a chance to fire a second.  i also know that if i dont go in right now hes going to get that kit and then my teams work will have been for nothing.so i go in he hits me with a pipe but i tank it and finish him off or at least thats how it should work.  but no i went in and he hit me with a pipe but it was a crit pipe killing me instantly. im sure your response to this hypothetical will be one of two asinine dismissals  either you should have had better movement and not gotten hit by the pipe or you shouldnt have charged in like that knowing he has the potential to get a crit on you and kill you both of which lead back to my original point that you conveniently ignored in lieu of suggesting that everyone just get better or avoid all damage forever in case they get a random critgtits either play the whole game expecting random crits and just never get involved in battles at all or just play the game regularly and sometimes get annoyed by undeserved random crit kills neither of which are any fun for the players.so i either dont commit for fear of getting crit on slowing the game down making it more stalematey and less fun to play  watch or i do commit and hope either my opponent is nighincompetent so they dont hit their shots at all or that luck doesnt fuck me in the ass and give them an undeserved crit kill making it more aggravating to play.sure in a world where my movement is good enough to never get hit by anything random crits dont matter but how bad are the people im playing against compared to me that cant land a single shot?  even invite scouts get hit by pipes and rockets sometimes the difference is they know how much damage theyll take every time and can factor that into their assessment of situations while factoring crits into an assesment of a situation leads to either welp better stay back cuz he might get a crit or welp better hope he doesnt get a crit and commit.  neither of these options bring anything good to the table and neither of these options have anything to do with skill.,tf2,cjiujez,3,t5_2qka0

1619316,0,t3_2cuu7j,Play around with your sensitivity even if youve already done so. Generally take what feels perfectly comfortable to you and kick it down a couple of notches to make it more precise. After that play around in walkway to get used to maneuvering and basic aiming with your new found sensitivity play around in pubs to further cement it. After a day or two you should see improvement. In regard to stabs though all that can be done for that is to play Spy and truck through it. Once youre landing stabs  of the time from behind the target regardless of how theyre moving start to play around with what angles you can land your stabs at. It helps immensely for trickstabs Which are more useful than many players will tell you though I agree its not something to start with or even something necessary to be a good offclass Spy and is just helpful for general Spying.

I think the phlog is perfectly balanced despite the damage reduction a heavy aiming at you for  seconds is still impossible to survive.

Taunts have their special place in loadouts now you can equip up to  taunts at once. You can hifive people you can dance with them you can play rockpaperscissors with them you can flip them. You can do this with people on the enemy team as well if you play RPS with a guy on the other team the loser explodes. Generally there are many more taunts  theres shadenfreude guitar solo directors vision lazy engineer fucks lying down on a chair demomen drinking grenades...Its kinda strange telling you but there are unusual hats theyve been in the game for as long as I remember but since they added in  you probably dont remember them. Those are special hats with fancy particle effect on them that you get from crates . possibility. Theyre super rare and cost wads of cash IRL.Theres like  hats or something and the economy is pretty much ruined. Wouldnt even bother.Your average scoutGameplaywise the best weapons got added while you were still playing. Most of the ones after that are usually balanced and all but absolutely uninteresting. Weve gone a full year without no weapons at all which got fixed two months ago. Other than that not much to speak of. Halloween events just get more and more fun every year last year we got spellbooks with Bioshocklike powers where we could throw fireballs and shit at each other by pressing taunt button anytime that was awesome.Theres also coop now. You join a team of  players and beat the shit out of robots. Robots drop cash use cash to get upgrades spam robots with infinite rapidfire rocket launcher. Revive people with a medigun make force shields.There are killstreaks. Those are cosmetic weapons with colored sheens on them that count how many people you kill in a single life. You get them from beating robots with a special ticket you buy from the store. Theres a super low chance of getting a golden weapon.,tf2,cjld9fp,1,t5_2qka0

1671845,0,t1_cjpvx2c,Apparently the first few iterations of the map featured a lot of unique stuff like RED being able to damage the train directly like in the Stop that Tank custom mode but it was supposedly too confusing they experimented with a lot of unique ideas not just the train and in the end Valve rather wanted them to make it more simple.Fine by me we havent had a new AD map in a long time and the train health carrying over from one stage to the other makes it unique enough in my book. BLU are rewarded for capping quickly  and punished for taking too long in stage . And the health lossreturns is a variable that can always be adjusted.,tf2,cjpwc1c,3,t5_2qka0

The biggest things I hate about stickies are how huge the blst radius feels how widespread spam is and how rare traps areI could count on my fingers the amount of time Ive been killed by traps.

1754479,0,t1_ck0ah8i,Thanks for the feedback!  First off on the damage I dont feel the master blaster or pipeline powerhouse are too overpowered for their tradeoffs. The Blasters low clip size and fire rate keep it from being a long distance harassment tool and the Powerhouse cripples the engie slightly making mircomanaging metal and buildings much harder while being able to have a strong firearm on hand. As for the Pyre you and many other great people have made suggestions on its buffing as unlike the eyelander it wouldnt be difficult to max out its cap and become a force to be reckoned with. Im making changes to it now to to make the increasing factor be flame RANGE instead of health. Starting with  the normal flamethrowers range and then extending all the way to . What do you think about that? Im currently adjusting the Double agent to have decreased accuracy between shots like the ambassador as to prevent beyond close range constant bleeding. As well the Hidden hunter from what people have been suggesting will be made to only give  seconds of bleed on FULL charge. As for the Cardiac arrest I am adjusting it to have only a  second stun to make the attack interval significant and prevent stunlock. Even if the medic does try and constantly harass a player pelting them with  damage hits they can easily overpower him in the .s window provided.,tf2,ck0b64n,1,t5_2qka0

If people found a way to completely cancel the spinup on the Minigun would you start arguing that minigun shouldnt have any spinup time?Sniper isnt every other class so I dont really see how the function of other class weapons is relevant to the function of snipers weapons. No other class can instantly kill someone from across the map sniper trades his ability to fight at close range to be able to get picks at very long range. Thats a balanced trade. Sniper has lots of chances before a fight gets into close quarters and nobody can really fight back at that point. Players who manage to get close to a sniper should be rewarded with a favorable fight. ,tf2,ck2zzj5,1,t5_2qka0

1828637,0,t1_ck9io35,I hate to be nitpicky but mini sentries take .s to deploy. I think that having lots of Engineers on the enemy team is frustrating if your teammates arent willing to adapt whether theyre using big sentries mini sentries or both. Its called Team Fortress  for a reason. One player cant handle  Engineers. I consider myself to be a pretty good Demoman but there have been times Ive been playing AD Attack and have had to watch in awe at my teammates just throwing bodies down a corridor for  minutes straight. Ill destroy one or two sentries then Ill respawn and its back to square one. Sometimes your teammates are like onions in that they stink and make you want to cry. Personally Id like to see some more unlocks which make big sentry Engineer viable on AD Attack and CP. An unlock which allows the Engineer to haul buildings without a movement speed penalty would be sweet. The Eureka Effect could also be pretty awesome for CP if the penalties were revised. P.s. Those Engies using the Gunslinger on KotH Harvest need to step up their game.,tf2,ck9jk51,0,t5_2qka0

Air surfingstrafing movement flanks routes DM positioning when to push vs hold and die and how to play mind games. How to support your team passively without being useless the more WM pyros you have chasing you around last while your team pushes forward the better.

But this one means What do you think will be the next item up in the line of cosmetic items to be turned into a misc?Demo only has  Shaman MaskThis means that the Demoman class only has one class specific misc cosmetic which is the Mask of the Shaman or Shaman Mask.so do you think hell get some misc love soon?Because any item turned into a misc tends to make people feel all happy wonderful and lovely I thought it seemed fit to relate the act of Valve turning a cosmetic item into a misc with something of love.

It has decent damage against players and buildings alike without the pressure of having to get headshots stabs or saps for it to be effective.. The Ambassador is great if you can reliably hit headshots. I personally dont like it because I tend to get carried away with trying to get headshots and forget my purpose as a Spy.. LEtranger is a utility revolver. Dont expect to get as many kills with this as you would with another gun. Its useful for maintaining cloak and staying cloaked for extended periods of time.. The Diamondback is a good option if you cant get consistent headshots but still want to do large damage from any distance. The problem is you have to stab and sap before this gun becomes viable.. The Enforcer needs some fixing. Its actually a very good weapon in terms of raw power but its a terrible weapon in its design. Use this if you are a dirty scrub.Personally I only ever consider the Revolver and LEtranger but thats just me.,tf2,ckjw86l,8,t5_2qka0

Sprays can be turned off. You can mute players this also blocks text chat.So the smart parent can do these things but you gotta face the facts.This is a rated M game children should not play this. if you are a parent just stick them with Portal  if they are desperate for an FPS go with Red Crucible  Dont take this wrong but the game has no gore blood is minimal and here is the part where i may be critisized  of the players speak spanish from my expirence.,tf2,ckn63bd,4,t5_2qka0

The back scatter is more like a stealth type of playstyle where you sneak up on enemies and hit them when they dont see you.  Force of nature is can push the bomb into a pit or juggle bots around. It can also make you more mobile with its third jump. Soda popper is awesome for money collecting and escaping. the rapid fire like the force of nature can be usefully for taking out giants and tanks but only if you have the upgrades for it the short stop it very underestimated since its unlikey you will be missing a swarm of bots the dps will be higher than the stock scatter gun.  the design of the shortstop as well will allow you to keep a safe distance from a horde of bots and still be able to collect money and put out good damage.,tf2,ckscodf,1,t5_2qka0

Maps with ridiculous single entry chokepoints with  or  sentry nests behind them.  If they are being pocketed with the sentry gunfire assisting them they can completely shut down access utilizing airblast.Pyro has one of the lowest DPSs in the game and the shortest range.

Heres a handy guide That whole channel is gold for improving your art.Tip  To get rid of grainy shadows right click your viewport select progressive refinement settings and choose the following Depth of field  Override  or . Higher  higher quality  longer render.No motion blur this will cause your still image to become blurry unless you hand posed your model and created no additional motion.Subpixel Jitter AA on. Tip For camera settings if you want just your characters to be in focus use the focus plane to intersect your image then drag the aperture value up.Tip If you want your subject to pop out a bit use volumetric lighting behind them. Its an option for standard lighting and the options for it are mostly straight forward under the animation sliders.Final TipParticles are a bitch but they can seriously improve your shots. I unfortunately dont have any immediate resources for particle effects but google Im sure can help.Apologies if you do not want this at all.oh also imgur sucks in terms of image compression making it look terrible and I recommend exporting as tga then using something like paint.net to convert to png quality jpg.,tf2,ckvedpr,2,t5_2qka0

Combine with Two Fangs skill from Zero use the proper Legendary class mod and you can spit out the whole magazine in less that one second. Crazy!Also I love Jakobs but the best Snipers Ive found were Dahls. If you can handle the recoil you land a whole burst as critical hits a lot faster than Vladof. Also you can just unscope midburst and have a single shot with an asfastasyouclick rate of fire which is also the case if you hipfire. good to know that Zero has skills that make hipfiring snipers accurate,tf2,cl4w0pi,1,t5_2qka0

2132324,0,t3_2je2y3,Basic rule of economics things are worth as much as you or anyone is willing to pay for them be it keys or metal. As more metal is introduced as people earn drops and keys are consumed by uncrating the value changes. This makes people who dont want to spend money sad because their metal gradually becomes less valuable. Now basic rule of TF economy crafting is inefficient and is incredibly unlikely to profit you. It mostly exists I believe as a way to remove metal from the game. I would recommend crafting your extra weapons as you get them into refined metal ref and no further. If you wish to profit by trading and Im not a serious trader so anyone should feel free to contradict me use price compilation websites like backpack.tf to assess the value of your goods and that you would trade for then find people on trade servers or online who are willing to buy for a little more or sell for a little less than standard either to get an item quicker or if they couldnt find it anywhere else. Heck one guy I saw on a trade server payed  times what a taunt was worth because he wanted to get it within the next  minutes. Dont expect this process to be fast impatience often leads to poor trading. Im not exceptionally knowledgeable about trading but its an hour into the post and nobody else has commented.

The hat in question? Lasts  hours. The mods never said to stop making the trade. They closed it because it was a relisted trade.The thing is that his first trade even relating to Secret Saxtons was closed on September rd.

That means that the game gets decided by which team has the better scouts which isnt really fair to the other people playing the game.  Sure the other team could run heavy or sniper but heavy slows your team down too much and would probably lose to a scout unless the heavy knew where they were and sniper is too inconsistent.

The point of the Minisentry is to give you that little extra punch you need to be able to fight Soldiers and Demos on even footing. People who spam Minis are annoying but they arent really using the weapon to its full potential.I almost always default ShotgunPistol with the mini. Pistol  Mini is more midrange DPS that most anything and using the mini as a distraction can let you do some deft Shotgun work up close. Even a soldier wilts after a meatshot or two and you have  at your fingertips.I dont get the Engies who spam it honestly.

It can be easily removed by hitting it with your wrench on the ground Or maybe any class melee could remove it? but it will give spy the opportunity to strike against the engis before they get rid of it possibly killing all of them and either letting the sapper slowly kill off the buildings or help it by shooting at the buildings.,tf2,clslnr4,1,t5_2qka0

A good pyro can give a spys disguise some legitimacy draw attention away from him protect him from other classes it can really work out well. As much as I love grinding spies into dust underfoot I also enjoy being the backup muscle lookout and chaosbomb just waiting around the corner for one.Spy goes in and if he doesnt get dead does his sapping starts causing problems and my job is to come in right behind him and make those problems worse to finish up engineer nests before sappers can be destroyed to buy him enough room to get away or into position to get backstabs on all the other players now focusing on the advancing wall of fire chaos and buckshot.A pyro in the fray grabs oodles and oodles of attention more than most classes I think and I personally cant pressure players into making mistakes and panicking generally causing oh shit! moments with any other class like I can with the pyro. A good nasty one can do his spy so many favors by sucking up all that attention right when the spy needs it anywhere but on him.Next time youre playing a pyro follow one of your spies. Hang back from him a bit and when youre coming on the enemy try to look like youre chasing him keeping him just out of range of your flames.

Non mains would often choose to play spy rather than engi hence why you see more spies than engies doesnt mean all the spies you see are spy mains but there is a good chance most medic engis you see are medic engi mains...,tf2,cm4ugfy,5,t5_2qka0

At one point the system glitched out and steam essentially took  from me and didnt put the money into my steam wallet. I called up the bank and they had the  put back into my bank account. this bit the  being returned to me was about a week ago. Today when I booted up my client I get this message! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! SOME ONE HELP ME!!!!How you can help me Tell me specifically what I should dosay to steam support in order to have this mess fixed!

2451809,0,t3_2nlvyq,I dont know if this makes sense but I see a lot of lower level players saying the soldier has the main job of destroying minis.  there are often positions which make it difficult for the soldier. also the soldier is much better controlling the flank so if a mini is out in the open I dont think a soldier should be the one who has to leave the flank to use  rockets to destroy it when it could be easily taken out by another class.,tf2,cmeqwa0,5,t5_2qka0
2452548,0,t1_cmetq1b,i agree. i think a new gamemode should be added where your weapons cycle automatically. Once you get a kill with your primary it switches to secondary. once you get a kill with secondary it switches to melee and so on. Also medics should only be allowed to heal in short bursts and not continuous beams because skill right? it takes no effort to latch your beam onto someone and just run behind them. engies builds should all have auto destruct timers and metal should ONLY be gained by picking up enemy weapons. that way engies are forced to not camp their builds and actually kill someone sometime.

Your weapon is powerful but needs nearly point blank for effective damage. So all the unlocks have been counter to that original purpose.Soldiers and demos can juggle you scouts can dance outside your range snipers are far outside your main damage area and heavies outdps you with almost double health. It requires SKILL to level the field.But I can see where youre coming from.

Anything thats been used on an item loses value since it comes with an item that the buyer might not want. People usually increase the value of an item by a quarter to a half of the tools original worth which changes depending on the item and tool but is usually pretty consistent meaning that items with a lot of Strange parts will be worth more but not as much as youd think.This reminds me of one particularly dim trader who Im still not certain whether or not he was taking the piss who wanted to trade their uncraftable Holy Mackerel for a craftable one and a Name Tag or a Refined I forget on the basis of its already been named. The name was something stupid like The worlds bigest dik. He was convinced that the name tag added a lot of value to the item whilst everyone who replied was saying No it doesnt the name is shit and youre terrible at trading and naming.

I havent actually gotten involved in any of it besides TF Centre which hardly counts. What Im wondering as a bit of an outsider is what exactly Valve could do to improve competitive TF? There are rumours of a competitive matchmaking mode being added which seems like it could be a good first step for players looking for a more competitive experience from the game. I could see how that could be a launch pad for players interested in more serious competitive play. Is this what were talking about? Or are we maybe talking about a comp scene under Valves direction? Maybe a Valvesponsored league with tournaments events and LANs? Maybe have something like Blizzcon? It seems like there are a lot of possibilities.I guess what Im getting at is that as someone whos watched comp TF closely from the outside for a while I totally get what Langes saying here but Im curious as to what exactly could improve the situation. I know Id love to have a more diverse and thriving competitive community I just dont know how we or Valve make that happen.,tf2,cmqoumz,3,t5_2qka0

2571926,0,t1_cmua1m6,People hate the pyro for the same reason people hate Scout.The class tactics are annoying to fight in the case of MqM its often because the weapons are cheapawfully designed. Ever since they buffed the airblast to completely remove enemy momentum the player being airblasted has no control over their movement at all. So it might as well be a Sandman or Natascha with pyro.And M on the other hand is continuous damage that is extremely powerful so players think it is newish to use it. Even more so since players hate getting killed by continuous damage. Id honestly rather die by a crit phlog pyro than deal with an MqM pyro because with M its also a fault of the enemy for getting killed whereas with M the enemy has no control.,tf2,cmuaf5j,1,t5_2qka0

2594702,0,t1_cmx3kp7,You know why we have to act like its ok? Because of the Sun on a Stick. And the neon annihilator. And all the other content they actually thought was good enough to add and then turned out to be either crap or something so close that it might as well be.Sure youre always going to find that one person that just swears by one of the crappy underused weapons. But that doesnt change the fact that there are plenty of weapons that almost never see the light of day and rather than beg for rebalances and tweaks the community begs for new stuff instead.Like the last content update. The one with the tide turner not sure if it was actually the last one. I would have liked it so much more if they had attached the turning ability to the boots and just never put the TT in the game. Then people would have to make a choice of full demoknight or still being able to use a grenade launcher. But instead they put the TT in the game and the turning ability on boots dont matter anymore making them one more thing on the list of items nobody uses.So yes gamechanging content is nice and purely cosmetic updates are a bit of a drag at least I know from the start that cosmetics are going to be useless. Throw in that the only content we really know was done was the map which I will agree was dropped for stupid reasons and I really dont know why more people arent getting mad at McVee for getting everyone hyped up about new weapons.,tf2,cmx9jb5,1,t5_2qka0

I mean its sort of sad if you like watching those player play but if you enjoy playing the game play the game. Who cares if people think its dying?

2620638,0,t1_cn0hf3w,Trading for items you want doesnt make you a cheapskate. Valve implemented trading for a reason. And uhhh dude you realize that a key burned is a key burned? Using keys is all that matters. When crates are worth unboxing keys get burned and Valve makes money. The end. Whether they go through  or  hands before theyre unboxed doesnt matter. Valve has been raking in cash from TF for ages but pours it back mostly into Dota  and CSGO. Theres not even an actual TF team anymore. Its like  or  consistent bug  content testers and a training ground for new talent. Once someone has spent their time working on a quality TF update they move on to another game with an actual team. Valve determines how they redistribute their funds. Just because TF is making them money doesnt mean theyre going to be listening to their foundational players. They just have to keep pandering to the masses who play TF occasionally during events and buy keys and go back to playing other games. Prior to Dota  and CSGO being the top games on Steam TFs cash flow seemed to work more towards quality content. Its been a solid . years of meh updates. Wishful thinking pally.And buddy I like probably nearly everyone in this sub have been playing this game for years. Between buying crap from the Mannco Store to buying the orange box to giving my friends upgrade to premiums who are now hooked on this game to buying shit on the SCM to promoting TF content on public forums.... theres no deficit of TF players willing to throw money at Valve and I nor many of those who are a little bit unhappy lately with Valve are no exception.

I think the new game mode is fun for  minutes but after those  minutes I had no desire to ever play it again.  Finally Im just kinda confused for why this was considered Smissmass.  Putting aside the cosmetics which we get every update anyway this really could have been a demo specific update and that would have made sense.  Is Valve trying to say that Demo was the only class that needed those major changes?  Im happy that Valve hasnt abandoned TF but its clear that its on a bit of a downward spiral.

2643591,0,t3_2q7f1c,I trust Valve first and foremost. Asteroid and Cactus Canyon were like experiments to try the beta access of certain features and hey asteroid turned into one of my favorite maps especially designwise so far at least!. While I agree that this game mode should have been included in the EOTL update rather than Smissmas youll have to remember youd be getting this instead of snowplow and I REALLY dont know which option would cause a worse reaction.The thing with snowplow not being released is most likely related to it being a communitymade update they expected the community to work out all the kinks before it was released. They werent going to allocate their personnel to work on it cuz they have other projects like Mannpower.STAR makes several valid points especially regarding the alphaness of this mode and its powerups and maps. About the Expert players recommended I dont think theyre talking about it being difficult to understand pleasedontkillme but about wanting experienced players to play it and give their feedback which at this point is probably more valuable because they know what the game is capable of. Are newcomers also a good idea to have feedback? Yes but not so early in development.As for it being released so early I really dont know. Maybe the team had an idea and really wanted the community to provide the rest of the feedback? Its no lie that the tf community has been very... nitpicky... in recent times regarding updates. They probably wouldnt want to screw this up.these are just opinions anyway,tf2,cn3nekg,4,t5_2qka0

However I can support a team know when to cut them loose and let them get themselves killed instead of me with them and how to keep people healed up.  Find what youre good at.  Even if youre complete shit in TF chances are there is something in the game youre good at.  Maybe try out the support classes in MvM.  Scout is essential for his money gathering and ability to use mad milk and a fan o war to slow and crit mark enemies.  Engie is essential for his ability to deal absurd amounts of damage at a consistent rate and supply the team with heals and ammo through his dispenser.  Medic is essential in his ability to keep teammates healed and overhealed pop uber at the right moment and provide kritz and the shield.All three of these classes are not exactly close combat confrontational classes and some teams can make do without some of them but its not often a team wont have at least  of them.

2667558,0,t1_cn6r7qq,This falls into the broader category of why do people hate others not playing the meta in MvM. Usually this issue shows up in Mann Up servers so I will answer to that situation.When someone chooses to do Mann Up instead of Boot Camp they do so looking for loot and to take the entire thing more seriously. Mann Up can take a while even if you do it all on your first try so people can quickly loose patience and run out of their limited time to play the game. Because of that running into people who are just doing Mann Up who arent good or who are just joking around can be insanely frustrating because usually it means that they will have to keep retrying waves.Because you dont know how good the randomly assigned player is youre safer just assuming they arent very good. The meta is so popular because you dont have to be a great player to do it effectively. Its as fool proof as you can get so people who want to finish tours want to play as safe as they can.Sniper isnt an easy class to play and many times newbies many of whom play sniper in very different games like CoD or whatnot will try it out to disastrous results.Because of this unless you can prove yourself as very competent at sniper very quickly usually by having a lot of tours already completed youll get people getting pissed at you pretty quickly.,tf2,cn6rw04,3,t5_2qka0

I just got a g for xmas its good but it has a few flaws. The scrollwheel is metal and you cant be that accurate with it its fine for me because I have mwheelup and mwheeldown bound to weapon slots so i can just scroll wildly but if you use the scrollwheel to choose between all of your weapons I wouldnt recommend getting the g. You also cant really press the scrollwheel down for mouse while moving it around much. I also grip my mouse quite hard with my thumb and the g has three thumb buttons which make it awkward to hold for me anyway. I am getting used to that though. The sensor is pretty damn good and you can tune it to specific surfaces unfortunately Ive done that a few times and I occassionally still get that annoying thing where your screen spazzes out a bit and you spin around for a second not sure how to fix that.

He has more base health has passive health regen is a bit faster than a sniper his bow does not need to be drawn back to fire full power which removes two downsides to huntsman. Before you go on about something someone would say consider that as I play sniper Im aware of his use on the battlefield and thus where at some point another class would be able to overshadow his effectiveness when given his OHKO characteristics.Look at ambassador spies which was brought up above me by uKoozii. Those with good aim basically become snipers who can disguise as enemies and avoid death with the dead ringer. Those right there are two pretty good reasons to choose playing that class over sniper who now only has overspecialisation in the headshot department. This is why we shouldnt give classes abilities outside of their specifications and why people are annoyed that classes other than pyro can set people on fire. ,tf2,cneax7z,2,t5_2qka0

What I am thinking of is a weapon where you right click it takes  seconds for the heavy to build a nest he is incredibly vulnerable during this time. Once hes in his nest he has a slightly beefed minigun and he is surrounded by a nest with  HP. You cant backstab him or headshot him and the damage goes to the nest. Engineers can repair the nest. If the nest blows up it kills the heavy. If the heavy wants to leave the nest it takes him  seconds to pack up. Again during this time he is vulnerable. ,tf2,cnejvwq,1,t5_2qka0

2760454,0,t1_cnhup43,Scout should Switch Last Wave Im sick of you noobs using your stupid Refund to try and make missions easier by having the most OP class for every single wave and such. Maybe if you didnt waste all your money on Resistances and play Jizz Scout you wouldnt need to switch to win. Scout is one of the most fun classes to play. Why would you want to switch from Scout to Heavy one of the most boring classes at the end of a mission?Bonus points if it was a wave with tanks and or a boss both of which Scout excels at killing and they switched to Sticky Demo.Meta Damage Expectations Apparently the public views classes damage potential as something like Tier  Heavy Tier  DemoEngie Tier  Soldier Tier  SpyPyroSniper Tier  ScoutMedicIts actually more like Tier  SniperDemo Tier  HeavySoldierPyro    Meta Tier  Tier  EngieScoutSpy     Meta Tier  Tier  Medic     Meta Tier  Tier  Rocket Jumper Soldier    Meta Tier  Depending on the mission of course.At any rate NO it is not acceptable for a Soldier to be outdamaged by an Engineer in most MvM missions. By the last waves of any mission all classes except Medic should be doing more damage than Engie. The only reason Scout and Spy are in the same tier as Engie is because Engineer starts off with higher DPS but finishes with less. For most missions. It really depends. Which leads me toUsing the Same Meta for All Missions Not all missions are the same. Strictly speaking Mecha Engine has a different meta than Gear Grinder which has a different meta than Two Cities but they all keep the ScoutEngieHeavyDemoTank KillerX structure. And currently people keep trying to use the Two Cities meta in my opinion the worst of the  in ALL TEH MISHUNS. Its doable of course. No problem. But if youre looking for the easiest way to win nopeer!Running Medic on a mission where most robots are meleewielding andor very weak and the only reason you should die is from getting shot in the back by flankers who will have already kill any Medic hypothetically standing behind you...Running Soldier on a mission with no tanks where a nd Heavy or Demo would easily be superior...Like I said sometimes doubleScout is literally more effective than the meta. The Two Cities meta ignores tankbusting because Mannhattan has no tanks and Rottenburgs are puny. Scout is a very versatile combat utility class and an amazing tankbuster. Have one Scout  focus on money and have the other focus on giant and tankbusting. Chaching.Votekicking It is very very very rare for votekicking to have a point. Unless a team is so bad its completely beyond hope one of the many situations where votekicking is pointless there are generally one or more players doing MORE than their share of work on any struggling team and MULTIPLE players doing less than their fair share. Getting rid of one guy wont solve anything. Hes just a scapegoat. It is very rare to have  players doing EXACTLY as much as they need to and one dud holding them back. Usually its like  duds a couple OK players and one guy picking up the slack for the duds.Also its hilarious when noobs with hundreds of tours on an easy mission feel the need to preemptively kick players they dont think will do well because theyre so insecure about their own abilities often rightly so. I was just on Empire Escalation today.  tour Demo.  players with  tours.  tour Gibusvision Heavy. The Demo sat AFK and refused to play until the wave was failed and he could kick the Heavy. With a tour Demo you should be playing Empire Escalation with  people. The fact that he actually cared was pathetic.Also there was a tour player who was complaining about having two Demos on Hamlet Hostility. One was a Demoknight me. He was like Were going to get CRUSHED before he even realized that I was Demoknight not tryhard Demo. One guy left the second the wave started. We won the wave easily with  people. Demoknight had highest damage. tour had lackluster performance. I left because I cant stand whiny noobs who cant act their tour number.,tf2,cnhups8,6,t5_2qka0

2769705,0,t3_2rsodu,gtAll other mediguns are GREATExcept the Quick Fix since that generally forces Medic into positions he wasnt designed for and it halves overheal. Its never quite going to be as good as Stock or Kritz since choosing a particular kind of damage to block always makes you fare poorly against teams of different classes. For the purpose of one on one it already currently works amazingly well frustrating pub players all over as that one Engineer frantically tries to look up teamwork in the dictionary.If the Medic flubs his lines of course thats always going to end poorly. If I mistimed an Uber or Kritz Id be punished the same.

My point is there were still many ways the charge could be countered.  Demoknight was really only OP when a charger knew when to charge and from what direction.

And if the demo has consistent aim with pills regardless of airblast he will land at least  of those shots on him and open a window for him to escape with the targe and form an action plan to surprise the Pyro.I dont like using the sticky launcher for anything other than traps and jumps.

Skullcutter takes  melee hits to kill gaunt or  hit hits but has a very hard time avoiding damage from gaunts.

I heard backpack.tfs prices were outdated or off and I currently use TFOutpost to look for hatsBackpack.tf is a decent start but the best thing to do is look at what the current ones are selling for usually on TFOutpost.gt What Steamrep is how to use it and overall how to avoid scamming and lowballingSteamRep is simply a way to help make sure youre not going to be trading with someone who has scammed and been reported for it in the past. For any trade of reasonable value gt keys? Id check the SteamRep status of the individual. Knowingly trading with confirmed scammers will get you in trouble so dont do it.A supplement to SteamRep is TradeRep.org which will show you the SteamRep status of a player as well as hisher standing in other communities. gt Any other advice or reliable and informative sources you can think ofrtftrade is a great place to ask questions or advice.gt I considered some factors which determine an Unusuals Worth The  factor is what you plan to do with it resell or wear it. If you plan to wear it its all about your preferences and after than just make sure youre getting a decent deal and youre not going to take a huge loss if you decide to sell it down the line.If youre just trying to buy and resell then there isnt a specific order of factors. It will be different for each hat really. You can learn general trends of effects by looking at backpack.tf.Finally you need to link your Steam Profile in order to post on rtftrade. Instructions should be on their sidebar.,tf2,cnn00zt,7,t5_2qka0

2853798,0,t3_2ssg6x,Ironically as a Soldier main I find myself having a much easier time when offclassing except when it comes to a particular class hard counter.When Im Scout I can do just as much damage with the Scattergun airborne opponents arent an issue disengaging is a matter of zipping away and I scoff at close encounters because my weapons only out to hurt the opponent.When Im Pyro I can sustain my attack more easily puff and flare is highly effective and requires next to no finesse and a pretty linear combat approach and I can heal and overheal from combat. When things get hairy I can push enemies away directly counter projectiles and I can huff it onfoot well enough.When I Funslinger I relentlessly harass with minis and a steady shotgun and when I need to get out in a flash I tend to give people the choice of taking the sentry or me.Meanwhile as Soldier sure I can fling myself around a lot but at a cost to health and potential for immediate damage. Sure you can burst damage pretty well but you also need health and a rocket for any kind of mobility or youre up a creek. Not to mention that while close encounters makes it easy for you to hit your mark it also makes it just as easy to succumb to your own splash. So with other classes I generally feel a good baseline of flow while with Soldier theres a strong high peak and a really low dip immediately after. ,tf2,cnsh72o,1,t5_2qka0

2888280,0,t1_cnwdrbm,Hmm well as Heavy on a Payload map I usually end up going one of two routes. Im either the cart Heavy who sticks to it like glue and is the tank of the pushes or Im the sneaky Heavy who uses a GRU to get behind enemy lines quickly and rip through things. For the cart strategy if I know there are good Snipers on the enemy team I unrev and stick to the farside of the cart from them till Im out of their sightline. That doesnt always work though so I do a bit of a waggle left and right movement randomized while randomly crouching to throw them off. Though if theyre a great Sniper youre pretty much going to die unless youve got a Vacc Medic on you. And regardless of what some people say longrange sprays from the minigun will hurt them slowly and usually make them move off to a different spot. For the sneaky Heavy tactic Ill go weird routes that no one goes through at that point like for Thunder Mountain stage  Ill go the left route out of spawn and go up and around to get behind the enemy. Or up and around the spiral on that same map wait for them to be focused at my spawn and slowly walk up while firing at their backs. Works great to take down the sentry guns if you aim at the top of them while they have to aim at your approximate midsection and can block some of the bullets with the ramp.Now for Spies  are we talking good Spies or bad Spies? If theyre a bad Spy you can tell by how theyre moving aka going towards someones back. If theyre a good Spy its much much harder to tell. What I tend to do and drive Spies nuts with is randomly spin around while firing if Im on the cart and fire behind us. Its usually enough to give you the outline of a cloaked Spy and unless theyre good to make a disguised one move off. Either way if you see them you can focus on them and rip through them. I can bet that somewhere there is a professional Heavy player that would read this and cry with laughter at how bad I am at Heavy from this but if I have a good team the strategies above usually keep me ok from Snipers and Spies leaving out those times when there is a pro playing or a small swarm of DR spies.,tf2,cnwefky,3,t5_2qka0

The issue with ugc is that there are tons of teams that want to start competitive but for some reason or other cant pull it off be it because a couple people on the team are lazy as shit and dont show up for practice or because nobody wants to go through all the coordination with ugc and setting up a server and whatnot.tldr Im a crotchety med main who has had very bad experiences with competitive.,tf2,cnzhcz0,11,t5_2qka0

The Reserve Shooter is banned in competitive so theres not much point in practicing with it in pubs.However the Flare Gun deals  damage. If you somehow manage to hit two flares on a long range target then it will deal an extra  damage and thats very helpful but most Pyro playstyles would make much more use out of the  instant close range damage of the Reserve Shooter. You can even hit two RS shots on one airblasted target if you aim right.Sure some Pyros would use the Flare Gun anyway but the Pyros with playstyles that would benefit from the Reserve Shooter benefit too much.Also afterburn is only used for getting flare crits. It does pitiful damage and can easily be extinguished.,tf2,co7ltfp,1,t5_2qka0

It happens. It happens even that you get  tour noobs. Heck the other day a  tour pyro couldnt kill a milked super scout because he kept juggling him. What the actual fuck. Or  tour airblast pyro fucking up my back stab on giant meds.I was talking when you have one or two noobs. Soldier has a massive carry potential on big rock so much he almost practically has the cave alone if someone gets the tanks. Good Soldier spy and tank pyro can carry a less than stellar  other people.  cities is far easier and much more forgiving yet what I was trying to say is that double and triple digit tour ppl get freaked by one or two noobs and not the entire team.,tf2,co8qbcn,5,t5_2qka0

Each division was  people and we had  guy guarding our intel. I led the Vent squad. After we had cleared the vent of any sentries some of my squad kept going through there to keep it clear and some of the Spawn team began going through the hallway alongside most of my squad and the Hallway team. We eventually managed to destroy all of the sentries and take their intel.  minutes later we had won the round. The lead engineers were raging over chat the entire time.

Basically it forgoes the need for chainstabs by planting a small bomb that can potentially take out a group of weakened enemies clustered togetherit can instantly kill any class its attached to and any class extremely close by when it goes off which you can accelerate with an additional suicidal melee hit or more favorably taking a step back and shooting the enemy will be severely weakened. However planting the explosive leaves you incredibly vulnerable since the explosive doesnt immediately go off and the enemy can still prevent the instant death effect with the aid of a teammate or the Vaccinators bercharge the explosion on the victim still does six times the enemys current health in damage multiplied by the critical hit modifier just healing someone with the Vaccinator will not be enough to totally prevent death without popping a portion of your ber.If its a bad weapon idea or incredibly unbalanced its because I spent all of five minutes thinking of the stats for it.

3109335,0,t3_2vqviu,Well you might want to keep your distances. Back when I played Heavy I watched plenty of Heavy POVs and spy frag vids where I noticed one thing a Heavy typically jumprevvs into the spy trying to deal as much damage as he can not knowing this is the easiest way to get trickstabbed. As a Heavy you must jump back as soon as you see the spy approaching you but not too far so that you can still deal tremendous damage. Youll be picked off from afar most of the time by his Ambassador so just think of him like youd think of a Sniper deadly only if you dont keep them in check.Soldier and Heavy are the slowest classes in the game so unless you have excellent reflexes its going to be hard not to get trickstabbed. Id recommend watching xXMLGGETTRICKSTABBED spy frgs to understand which ones are the most common and how to avoid them. The second you melee a Spy who has taken interest in the class youre giving him a free kill through a matador stab.You could just try to surprise him too by taking unorthodox routes. A good Spy is like a good Sniper deadly if left unattended but not as much of a threat if your team is aware.,tf2,coka4qm,2,t5_2qka0

Though the ability to mix it up as engineer is a useful skill and understanding howwhen to mix it up but generally speaking if you look at the top level engineers. Most of them run the exact same spots almost every game.This is because there tends to be only one great spot on each point and maybe a few good spots. Against competent players running any gimmicks tends to fail more often then not. So you tend to play it safer because you know the great spot will work.Its not to say dont try to mix it up dont try something new.

Ah I still remember old noob me a unique named Tomislav and nothing to wear but a Genuine Artillery Cap. hours later Ive owned  heavy unusuals and a Strange Festive Minigun. I dont play Heavy much nowadays though I intend on playing more lobbies as him but whenever I play Medic which is a lot more often than before I always make sure to keep the Heavy alive because I know how crucial his presence is and how strong an overhealed Heavy can be.Yes its a noob class. Yes it requires virtually no dmbased skill but it takes a lot of knowledge of the game and map positioning to be a good Heavy and even more of that to be a great Heavy better than the others.,tf2,cowmuz6,3,t5_2qka0

3245567,0,t3_2x8gih,Try not to fight good soldiers at close range unless you are ambushing them.Good soldiers wont bother feeding rockets at mid range unless they can dodge the reflect around a corner or something. The only way to get them to shoot at a comfortable reflect range is by swapping to your secondary hitting them then swapping back to your primary after every shot immediately in case they try to beat your weapon swap. Works very well with flares. Itll usually result in a retreat if you get flame damage on them.At very close range reactions dont matter as much as timing and mind games. Pay attention to the soldiers that bait out your airblast and then fire. They require special care. The soldier has the advantage here but usually wont get out of the fight without taking a lot of damage. If you can set him on fire then back off a bit to help with the reflect that works well. When ambushing at close range expect a rocket about half a second after he sees you.Count rockets. If he fires  without killing you or preventing you from closing the distance he is in trouble.Remember soldiers running shotguns. If a soldier pulls out a shotgun you want to be in close range as quick as possible. Even with less health you have the advantage of being able to airblast him and circle around him while degreasersecondary comboing him. Powerjack finishes might be possible here.Try to spot times when he has time to fire one more rocket before dying. At this time he cant worry about baiting your airblast. Hell get that rocket off as soon as he can because he might as well do what damage he can before death. This makes for easy reflect kills.,tf2,coyet5h,2,t5_2qka0

3268234,0,t3_2xjd1g,You have to adapt to the fat mans speed and be a lot more defensive than you are when you play Scout. Theres a whole different pace for Heavy you just overcome it by relying on your team. If your team is awful and even if you have a good medic people on the other team will easily be able to kill you.Also where you play is the question. Theres a huge difference between pub Heavy and HL Heavy. Youll be subject to spies and snipers in both but HL requires you to be way more defensive and to absorb damage you just cant lone wolf.BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS! Honestly I cannot capitalize on how crucial awareness is. If youre not aware of your surroundings the enemy spy will know and he will make your life a living nightmare. As Level said a good heavy is one who knows what he can do and what he cant do. Even at medium range you take time to begin dealing considerable damage which is why you need to be supporting your teammates.Heavy was the easiest class to play when I began playing tf thats why I chose it. Im not someone who lives off action and adrenalin I just wanted to lead my team to victory and Heavy seemed like the perfect class to do so.People think of us heavy mains as noskill noobs... maybe.

3342104,0,t3_2yfkf6,Im pretty sure worthless sacks of shit dont have the balls to type out their struggles to a crowd of Internet strangers so dont let yourself think you are one.My first and only girlfriend of about two years left me four months ago to take a break from relationships and began hanging out with the person she left me for all the time even though I have to see the two of them most of the day In a room with them right now and for about two months I was a complete and utter train wreck. Even though he ended up leaving her less then a month after they started going steady I still had no way to cope with the horrible feeling I felt inside besides TF. One day I was feeling particularly shitty when I loaded up plupward and went pyro. I walked out of spawn when a hatless medic ran up to me and started healing me. The entire game the guy pocketed me as we nearly singlehandedly pushed the cart through the entire track. He said nothing during the course of the game until he was lit on fire by an enemy pyro and about to burn out. He yelled for a medic a bunch of times and appeared to give up before I airblasted him. All he did was say Danke Comrade! And nod but I almost teared up. Then after one ber and a bunch of powerjacked sentries the cart was almost to the end. Our team was fighting their team was fighting the I was low on health and the medic ran towards me. The cart was moving up the track pushed by me. A Red Demoman was firing... At me. I saw it the medic saw it time slowed down. I had  health.  ammo in my degreaser. No time to switch weapons. I thought it was over when I see the medic jump in front of the pill and gets blown over the edge. I switch to my RS and finish off the demo right as the cart goes over the edge and explodes. I cheered and looked at the chat just in time to see my medic friend say thank you pyro and while it isnt much Id be lying if I didnt say I was bawling my fucking eyes out getting a little chokes up as I type this. I love this game and everyone in it.This would be the part where I tell you to keep your chin up and keep fighting but I can personally attest to the fact that its really not that easy.

3378043,0,t1_cpdaf5w,Copy and pasting models from the workshop and slapping on generic effects is lazy. Out of all the weapons youve mentioned how many are useless? Many of them are so situational that they never get good use. Reskins dont take effort at all.Their balancing techniques are abysmal. They let certain classes like Scout and Demoman in the Limelight while they leave Heavy incredibly gimped. It takes Valve an eternity to fix bugs. Theres nothing remarkable about that.The community keeps the game running. If Valve didnt open the Workshop new weapons would likely cease to exist as the majority of new weapons are taken from the workshop. So yes. Valve isnt working hard as they should.

Its effectively a straight upgrade from Stock.With the Stock you are not a frontal assault class like you are with the Degreaser. You need to flank and ambush to compensate for your lack of instant switching. If you have a Shotgun use it. Its effectively a second primary for Stock Pyro. Use your flamethrower to keep people away from you then pump them full of lead. Or if the situation allows it WM them until they die. Try to avoid Heavies and Scouts as your lack of instant swaps will prevent you from killing them without ample warning.TLDR with the Stock Flamer youll be more passive rely more heavily on your Secondary and Heavies are a threat even in close range.,tf2,cpj7ud1,1,t5_2qka0

I play scout a lot and let me tell you there is planning. I always consider the situation where is my team and how much can I take and lots of improvisations while actually fighting. I agree with you on the sniper it doesnt feel to me like playing vs. a player direct. I love being engineer and dont mind fighting against them. the mini sentries do make me miserable. I am either a power class who has to deal with this and there is no down time its not fun for me to shoot an obstacle instead of players. or I am a scout and this shuts me out of mid fights almost. ,tf2,cplj2vx,1,t5_2qka0

Either it needs to be nerfed with switch time or it needs to lose its ability to set people on fire. Actually.... if you made it airblasting only or really expensive to flame with and kept the switch speed then you could revert the axtinguisher since you make it so expensive to use that people would probably need to shoot at range to puff giving the target plenty of time to defend from a sting.That said I almost think that wouldnt change anything either.

If I am so wrong please tell me what replaces those .As you said currencies are only worth the trust people have in them. No one has trust in buds anymore. They were once regarded as pure just as keys are. Now buds are not considered pure. Every key we invested in buds through trust is now gone.To put it more clearly There are now k earbuds that people will no longer accept as currency. If you are a person who still wants to buy hats and you still have  earbuds how will you get more keys if say the value of earbuds dropped to  key? The only thing you could do is trade your  earbuds for  keys. And the same would go for every other k earbuds. Previously those earbuds could be used straight up as currency but now they cant.

And since you only need to charge it to HALF to put piss on an enemyit can easily fuck up charging enemies since they get damage AND piss. Alsothe quicker charge rate makes it faster to make damage. This is useful in Sniper v Sniper moments as you can aim the body and in less time he can make a bodyshot out of youyou can coat him in piss. A second bullet and hes dead.But theres no headshot!The fact that there is no headshot isnt a very big problem actually. If you make someone fall under the effect of pisseither he runs awayeither your second shot kills him. This with the Jarateyou basically become a danger to ones survival. No one is safe from your pisseven if its close rangemidrange or farrange. This is a very nice loadout in cp but in alot of games as you can follow your team and aid them. People dont expect a SSso they dont search far to find the provenance of the piss. Makes a nice surprise effect.,tf2,cq27aq9,7,t5_2qka0

3743573,0,t1_cqiyyyd,First of all how is it an unfair argument that I generalize that classs playstyle? Yeah Toptier snipers are good and friendly. But youre not playing with them most of the time unless you are a strict comp player only or play on a great server which then I agree with you. Community servers snipers are a pain. Pub snipers are worse. And OP asked why does the sniper get so much hate so any argument is valid. I dont know if you play league but its comparable to Riven mains. They have the highest leave rate in the game the players tend to be toxic and they all have a selfish playstyle. This doesnt apply to all of them obviously boxbox would be a toptier sniper in this case but it still ruins the experience for lots of players.In regards to what you said about the items I still believe some are crutch items. The jarate is a team item sure. But when you pair it with a bushwacka you get guaranteed crits on melee attacks. So how do you deal with someone who not only is good from afar but a strong duelist? You also mentioned that its hard to counter a spys shot while using a razorback. It is I said that. But the thing is that just because the sniper is far away doesnt mean he is alone. He is usually right next to the engy and if its a payload map maybe right next  to spawn.And how can I tell my team to just focus sniper? You cant all just aim to kill a supprt class thats half a map away. Theres other priorities too depending on the game mode. You should never focus too much on one thing that would leave space for the enemy to emphasize on your weak points.,tf2,cqizq83,1,t5_2qka0

They do about  damage on average which is very little in a game of burst damage. Against players with good movement you wont be hitting many directs. The Loch n Load makes hitting those direct hits easier because the faster speed while also making them more deadly with the extra damage.People dont use OP weapons because a lot of the time they arent playing to win. If people played to win they would use weapons like the Baby Faces Blaster Beggars Bazooka Reserve Shooter on Pyro Loch n Load etc.The upsides on the Loch n Load far outweigh the downsides of it thus making it a virtual not direct because there are downsides upgrade,tf2,cqyef11,2,t5_2qka0

Uber if you have it bail if you dont. On that note pop it dont drop it. Every time. If your health drops below  you are probably going to die on the next shot. Its better to save yourself and keep your team healed than to die because you didnt think it was the right time to use uber.Also this is something I see everyone do when capturing a point and there are clearly no enemies in the area you dont need to wiggle your character.

3934815,0,t1_cr4sy4r,SpygtThe Spy hailing from an indeterminate region of France is an enthusiast of sharp suits and even sharper knives. He relies on stealth and trickery to aid his team. Using a unique array of cloaking watches he can render himself invisible or even fake his own death leaving unaware opponents offguard. His Disguise Kit lets him take on the form of any class on either team allowing him to blend in while behind enemy lines before stabbing his unsuspecting teammates in the back. In fact a swift backstab with any of the Spys knives will kill any foe in a single hit  provided they arent under the effects of any type of invulnerability or immense damage reduction.MedicgtThe Medic is a Teutonic man of medicine. While he may have a tenuous adherence to medical ethics he is nonetheless the primary healing class of the team. Although the Medics Syringe Gun and Bonesaw arent the greatest weapons for direct combat he can typically still be found near the front lines healing wounded teammates while trying to stay out of trouble.autotfwikibotrRequestABotcommentsmtcprequestanautowikibotfortheofficialteam by ukuilin,tf2,cr4syc1,-1,t5_2qka0

4072513,0,t1_crkfqkf,Its pretty minor. It lets you abuse corners a bit more effectively although probably less than backburner as a psuedospyknife. Essentially I want stock in this loadout and I think NN is a straight upgrade albeit a small one. I also really like the kill icon.I need to talk about the whole Degreaser vs NotDegreaser thing a bit.In Highlander youre usually going to be playing a pretty relaxed support role. Even my active support loadout is basically staying on the combo and chilling out its just a bit more damaging when your team pushes. That support role is made up of spychecking tagging scouts with flames to help push them out reflecting projectiles airblasting ubers and trying to harass the sniper. Quick weapon switch only helps vs the scouts but not by very much and even less so as the scout gets better. Also chipping in a little damage as you get the opportunity but not chasing people down or roaming muchThe point Im making is that for that particular support role I value the little bit of extra damage and the afterburn efficiency more than the quickswitch. As a result Im saying Yes the shorter barrel is worth it compared to a longer barrel. What Im not saying is The shorter barrel is so great I will give up quickswitch. Im giving that up for other reasons primarily damage.,tf2,crkhrps,1,t5_2qka0

4126047,0,t1_crq8txx,Technically youre right  because it has no power its not OP. We have a word for that as well Broken because it breaks the pace of the game.Fundamentally youre wrong however The Razorback is broken and this is a sniper main saying this! and heres why Youre punished less often for lack of situational awareness. Situational awareness is a key part of all classes but few more so than support classes medic sniper spy engineer because Spy is a hard counter to medic sniper and engi and spy needs it so he doesnt uncloak in front of someone inadvertently. Because youre punished less often for it you dont learn as much from it. You remove a hard counter to yourself breaking flow. Sniper has two hard counters Other snipers and spies. A sniper that has a great vantage point decent aim a decent reaction time and good situational awareness can easily shut down an entire push and demoralize the enemy team. How do you counter this? If you try to snipe them youll probably wind up dead. You could always go spyma e your way around the enemy team and go in for the st oh wait theyre using Razorback. At that point youre out of options  either capitalize on using a soft counter assault classes or go Amby and hope their reaction time is slower than . seconds and that their teammates dont see youLiterally the only downside of running Razor is you lose CQB viability  which is hardly anything if youre like the sniper in the second bullet there.,tf2,crqleqj,2,t5_2qka0

TF on the other hand left most if not all of its competitivetocasual basis behind in TFC and designed TF to be entirely for casual play.CSGOs difference in matchmaking and casual is stakes.

4207589,0,t1_crzjp0n,s players dont need to be hyper aware of spies at all times because spy kind of sucks in s. It is slow during transitions and often falls behind so you cant run it while pushing or retreating often and during team fights it is complete dead weight. The best time to run spy is during stalemates and then teams are actively paying attention for spy. Low player counts make it easier to keep track of your teammates. Everything moves so fast that its easy to notice slow moving spies. It just sucks.So when someone with years of top level s experience walks into top level HL and has to deal with the best spies in the game all of a sudden they are going to be worse at it.Also constantly turning around to look for spies is tedious. A lot of s players find that boring and some will demand that their pyro deals with that. Its obviously kind of a dickish thing to do but thats obviously a sacrifice some teams will make to have international LAN champions on their teams.,tf2,crzuq6p,1,t5_2qka0

Is that a surprise? But are you saying youd gimp your chances at fighting any other class so you can maybe have an advantage in Shotgun fights against other Pyros? Anyway since when do Pyros even get into v Shotgun fights on a regular basis?Youre cherrypicking a case where it only works on bad players and then saying the gun is better. Ill give you credit if you can give me more cases where the extra  shots really help. Ill give mine for the Reserve Shooter Scouts Soldiers Demomen and pretty much every class in the game lose a lot of mobility unless they want to be taking MiniCrit Shotguns to the face. A puff and shoot combo can pretty much almost instakill any light class. The Shotgun can also kill them pretty fast if theres no enemy Medic or a Health Pack but then you have less margin for error and youre screwed if they have overheal. Combined with reflect explosive damage Airblasts and the RS can seriously fuck up a Soldier or Demo. Theyre stuck next to a guy with a Flamethrower and Shotgun and they cant escape because theyd have to Rocket or Sticky Jump to do that. Extra damage at long range MiniCrits arent effected by damage falloff Faster weapon switch allowing you to try other Flamethrowers Although the Degreaser is still great since its weapon switch speed is still fasterGive me some real applicable scenarios for the Shotgun and we can have a real discussion.,tf2,cs49zd6,1,t5_2qka0

On Eotl everyone just took their time to complain about ducks and too much cosmetics forgetting about the SFM that was there which in my opinion isnt that bad as people made out. On Smissmas everyone complained about the Panic Attack but forgot about how we finally got a Festive Shotgun which  of the sub asked for before the update dropped. Hell we even had a map workshop after so much asking and complaining  yet all people wanted to talk about was how trwalkway is unplayable.Im not exactly generalising everyone here but thats what I see nowadays  mostly negativity.

Broke heavy and made demo so useless some s teams switched him out for heavy. Made his stickies take so long to prime that they had no point. Literally took the game backwards. Update Scream Fortress  Useless. Reskinned a terrible map and added gimmicks and terrible jokes. Update End of the Line Mediocre video and then a ton of money grabbing. Useless. Update Smissmas  Terrible weapons. Gamemode where I either roll or get rolled. Totally RNG what powerup Ill get. Ive gone on killstreaks to the max allowed on this map. Terrible terrible gamemode and useless weapons. They have added nothing of value in the last one and a half years. Your misplaced optimism does nothing to improve the quality of the game.

Maybe if a male character was flamboyant and a fashionista it would make sense to make him gay. But other than that it doesnt make sense to me to have a sexual preference be a personality trait just like having a certain job wouldnt effect your personality. It would make more sense to write a character as gay from the start as suddenly changing a character with something that doesnt matter like sexual preference is just asking for people to claim you just wanted your characters diversified as a writer who didnt plan on adding something that didnt add anything to the story wouldnt add it in at all. If its to put Scout chasingHUEH HUEH CUZ HES FAST Miss Pauling to rest thats just lazy.

Ive spent hundreds of dollars on unusuals overall and I wish I could take it back and spend that money on something else.Furthermore I would not recommend buying an unusual with low funds as odds are youll get bored of ityoure only buying it because it has an unusual quality.As stated by ufortredr nobody gives a damn about your unusual. All I get with a  keys unusual a secret to everybody toque mind you is nice hat every once in a while. But you know what? This doesnt matter to me because I wear it for myself.Someone I used to play with made quite an interesting analogy unusuals are like a girlfriend you can rush it and get a bad one or you can wait until you have what you truly want. That being said its all up to personal preference.If I could spend the money Ive spent on unusuals again in tf items itd be on australiums since these have a better resalability should I ever find myself in dire need of money and incur a minimal loss.,tf2,csf5we7,3,t5_2qka0

The inbetween usually results in the SFMer being scammed.The guy had so many australiums and wouldnt even give me a dollar for three hours of my time.

I met some nice guys on rtf last year and they helped me reach premium because of the rude guy.tldr in the SFMposter community youre discouraged to charge low because many people can and will try to take advantage of you its best to either charge high or make them for free. its slimpickings in the SFMworld and people will surely and easily get madbased on how the worseSFMer reacted though youre somewhat in the right but its best not to ask many people at once,tf2,csjzuhp,5,t5_2qka0

Another example and one Im probably going to get flack on Mini sentries. Since their introduction years and years ago you were never able to repair them you had to go out and find a dropped gun and pick it up nuke the mini then replace it.Some of the changes Im glad to see for example the Battalions Backup being fixed and the Shortstop buff but its a but of a change for core concepts with certain weaponry to be changed.,tf2,cspxsqa,1,t5_2qka0

Id rather take down an enemy then merely hold them back.Well you arent always in a position to bomb in after the enemy. If youre low on health or outnumbered or theres no valuable target to give your life for or short on ammo or waiting for your medic to get ubercharge... why would you bomb in? Sometimes area denialspam is all youre in a position to do. You arent capable of killing literally every single targetgroup of targets at all times under every single condition so when you arent in a good position to bomb in spam is the only thing and the right thing to do especially with the black box. If I had a nickel for every time I was running around with low hp and got back as much health as a medium medpack grants from firing off  rockets casually Id have a lot of nickels.While were at it bombing into clusters of enemies like people capping or pushing a cart with the black box has been nerfed into oblivion as well. Big shame there.gtAnd if the enemy is good my spammed rockets should not hit more than one enemyWhat makes you say that? Even in the highest levels of v and highlander HL especially soldiers catch multiple enemies in one splash rocket very often. Doesnt matter how good your enemy is they need to cluster to be near a cart they need to cluster to be healed by a medic they need to cluster to stand on a cap point they need to cluster to move through a choke point.

Ive never claimed one should spend his life or days trading you could do it for a few hours and with the right decisions make a lot of money.But probably a lot less than spending that time you know playing the actual stock market or doing something that makes money IRL.gtLet me put it bluntly I dont give a shit about what impresses you.Fair enough but does that mean you think that passing the bar becoming a doctor or starting your own company arent impressive?gtIt isnt even remotely relevant as to whether trading items in a fp game that has a huge economy makes sense or not. And keys are highly representative of real life money lol you can sell them for two bucks a piece anytime any day.sure...but you are spending time trading video game items and probably not playing the video game while doing that when you could you know trade in something real. with larger margins. that could pay your rent.gtYour second statement is flawed as hell but apparently you seem to be too driven by anger to make senseInteresting. Lets do the selfquoting thing againUp to THOUSANDS of dollars? Oh my that changes everything! Thats like rent for a month in my area. I should quit my job and play TF!Flawed? In what sense  grammatically? Logically? Its called sarcasm bud. Here you go with the takin shit serious again.gt youve sarcastically said that you should quit your job to play TF all dayAh good to know you can recognize sarcasm after all!gt since its so remunerative but one can spend a few hours and never install TF to tradewhat does not having to install tf to trade? that just makes it sadder not better. go invest in a company find a niche to make some real money.gtYes its objectively flawed and youre speaking out of your ignorance regarding trading.told Objectively though? I read your whole paragraph and I have yet to see this...flaw.gtYou keep repeating your bad argumentsPretty much the only argument Ive made so far is if you want money get a job. Everything else has been me having fun with you. I typically find jobs a good resource to make money from but what do I know?gta job is a job while trading can be no more than a simple hobby you spend no more than two hours on everyday with proper investments that issounds like a job one with short hours but a job nonetheless.gtYoure the sad person here for not being willing to acknowledge the importance of trading in this game and how lifechanging it can be. Beautiful. thanks for this one really made this all worth it.gtYoure also making yourself look like a bigot bound and biased by his beliefs A bigot? Bound my beliefs that trading tf items is not a productive use of time?gtunable to think logically who cannot defend himself without making fun of the other partylol wut on multiple levels heregt I suggest you go to sleep and write to me when you wake up aka when youre done slamming your keyboard in anger as this isnt what Id consider a reasonable logical human being to write.You actually think Im angry?

4504201,0,t1_csyefp0,For me its more of teaching the class. Instead of someone who just goes WM teach them more about airblast and other ways to play and experience which you like. Ive talked to someone who WMd and they actually didnt even know about the airblast feature. From what I hear now hes a Pyro main. And I honestly agree that players should be able to play TF the way they want. Hence why TF isnt forcing you to even buy the contract ticket in the first place. In my opinion its a sign that youre going to commit. Mann vs. Machine isnt something you can just do in  minutes and immediately get the lovely Australium you have to work hard for it with dedication. I however do like your system of additional contracts without rewards. And perhaps these can be marked on your Coin you receive.

4528420,0,t1_csqef5x,You almost had me. I was almost ready to agree with you that maybe Spy isnt so bad if you Spycheck ready enough that I didnt respond for ten days. Indeed in my own games this discussion has helped me become a better checker. But then I saw this.Watch this entire video without skipping to another tab without even pausing because Im that angry and tell me the Spy is a fair and balanced class. Look at . Practically the whole team had gone Sniper and Pyro in their rage they were flaming everywhere with the objective forgotten but he was gone and kept returning for stab after stab. You simply cannot shoot at the enemies guardingpushing the objective in front of you and the Spy behind you at the same time unless you have a dedicated Spychecker who will be otherwise useless.ArraySeven uses the Blutsauger in public servers and the Crusaders Crossbow in competitive play..And fighting is dangerous so run. Fire a couple of shots and then cloak. You will get away and if by some miracle you dont you will cause paranoia. Sometimes hell be facing behind his buddy just to watch out for spies good hes a smart Medic but hes only delaying the inevitable. Wait until he turns around to heal that burning Demoman. I cannot stress this enough they will always stop checking their backs.By out of sight I implied out of hearing range or at a time covered by the sounds of battle.Although I can see that the effectiveness of Your Eternal Reward would be hampered by communication I think it would be about as effective as the other knives after the first backstab. Does it not bother you that excellent communication and supreme effort are required to counter Spies?I think melee is useful against the unskilled Spies I commonly encounter and maybe if you can stay outside Spy melee range with the Demomans swords and the Disciplinary Action. Otherwise any Spy who can trickstab will indeed  matador stab anybody who tries to melee him. See here. It is dangerous to come within melee range of a Spy regardless of skill. I am not a very good Spy but I have performed a matador stab accidentally.The skill required to be a good Spy is rightclick   hold w turn wait rightclick hold w again click until youre caught rightclick hold w repeat. The rewards are instant kills. Instant kills. I cant scream through a computer youll have to settle for bold. Even if I get just  kill before Im caught and killed I am satisfied because thats an enemy that would have taken my team a lot of firepower to bring down whom I killed with a single click and I caused distraction paranoia and anger along my way.But suppose you cant even manage that. Ive heard tell of a Spy camped out near the enemy with the Cloak and Dagger relaying enemy health and bercharge to his team. Imagine that a Spy doing actual Spy instead of behind his normal overpowered instakill self. This takes zero skill and has a moderate payoff in helping your team.Coda I decided to look at some competitive Spy play on YouTube expecting failed life after failed life. But no they stab regularly they sap occasionally they headshot and it looks just like a normal time playing as Spy. One commenter even said the Spy was playing terribly even though they had made MVP.,tf2,ct1fzp9,1,t5_2qka0

4542866,0,t1_ct38j9i,I agree with what you said about mobility detonatorscorch shot are pretty weak in combat and I hadnt thought about how effective movement is for the other classes. But the detonator can get you behind the enemy where the backburner is useful if the crits actually register.I understand your points I guess against players of equal skill pyro is pretty weak against the power classes unless he gets them by surprise or manages to airblast projectiles... which is another thing.Reflected projectiles exist. Noncrit  damage  how about minicrit?A good pyro will not get beaten by a scout in close range. Airblast takes away any mobility and scout is very squishy without it. Scouts can dominate pyros if they stay out of range but the second a scout is in a tight corridor with a pyro pyro should always win assuming he is using a decent combo weapon.As I said before the movement options help him get behind enemies. Obviously that takes away a secondary but still...Also you can click the mouse button for a split second switch to axtinguisher then finish them off from behind. Works better if you are walking towards them since the flame particle will still be travelling while you are switching weapons.Either way youre probably right. I do believe the axtinguisher nerf was still needed since  consistent guaranteed damage on a melee weapon wass not fun to play against enclosed areas. And Im  not even against pyro  it is my second most played class and it is a lot of fun but looking back  damage feels almost as undeserved as a random crit... you lit them on fire congratulations!,tf2,ct397km,1,t5_2qka0

If Amby needed a slight nerf to balance it Id suggest an additional  damage reduction if shooting while disguised like the old Enforcer. This would make it so someone who seems to be on your team isnt doing  damage to you before you can even spycheck him.

As of now i have  hours I did leave Team Fortress  for a while to play league I racked up  hours on league sorry Gaben it was too fun.Ive now come back to TF and am playing more thanks to this new update and im trying to get some money back from the game. I did get lucky and found a Professional Killstreak Rocket Launcher Kit from MvM thankyou Gaben. To me it looks like TF is coming back to life with these new updates including the weapons and taunts and balances so ill probably play more. Im also excited about the upcoming mm update but from now on its TF full time and going back to league every now and then to retain my diamond league each season.

Snowplow is both TERRIBLY designed and TERRIBLY boring to look at.Not only does it have RIDICULOUS Sniper sightlines it also has a BUNCH of good Engie camping spots without much of a counter.  While the sniper works both ways around for the most part the Engie bit highly favors red and it only gets worse as you go further in. Usually on Snowplow you are inevitably going to lose first as an Engie there is just no feasible way on any of the rounds to keep your sentry up then mid is an OK hold but then last is where you can just spam sentries and win.Then theres the health mechanic which is a glorified timer that doesnt really help you tell how much time is left and quite honestly is a bit annoying to deal with.But lets give a BIG round of applause for the fact that everyone and their mom was mad that it didnt make the cut and can now experience why it didnt instead of a different better designed  prettier map could make the cut instead!,tf2,ctny1xl,15,t5_2qka0

4724237,0,t1_ctpz8yw,Borneo is definitely his best work and the vast majority of it is good. I think Sean just dug his heels in on the final point and said No! We cant make this enjoyable! dont you dare! We must have a grindfest where Engineers will all set up and nobody will ever get anything done unless they push and win before anything can be set up!. The rest of the map is really enjoyable though and the entire thing if played in a competitive format would be great. The issue is its in a pub where theres no Medics no Demos worth their salt a load of terrible Engineers Spies and Snipers a couple of Scouts and a soldier that will occasionally shoot his feet.And when I say Egypt is pretty bad I mean that as in compared to Junction it is the holy grail of maps. Approximately half of Egypt is really fun to play. The rest is just the vertical cliffs directly outside the Attackers spawn and the tooopen final point that cant be shot into by the defenders without being massively exposed.Really the issue with all of Seans maps is that theyre in the official rotation. They would all play much better in v or v formats and would likely be very enjoyable but since I dont play v or v I play Valve Servers I end up playing these maps in a situation in which they are absolutely atrocious to play on.,tf2,ctq133l,11,t5_2qka0

Alright Shotgun aim. Practice using the Shotgun as its a great secondary that translates well into other classes. Shotgun makes Pyro vs Pyro and Pyro vs ChargenTarge Demo a lot easier. Spycheck everyone. If someone hasnt done anything to indicate they arent a Spy and theyre reasonably closeby Spycheck them. I dont expect newer Pyros to always kill the Spy when theyre using Dead Ringer andor Spycicle but igniting a Spy should alert teammates and force the Spy to retreat at the very least. Dont just walk forward. Strafe left and right and jump unpredictably. Dont walk straight into Pyros that are backpedaling and firing off their primary. Use your secondary instead. Extinguish teammates.,tf2,ctuu9f2,7,t5_2qka0

4827263,0,t1_cu2yran,the pissgun is still a sniper rifle i just lacks the headshot quality and instead injects urine. the bow is a sniper rifle without the long range sights. They change how Sniper plays but he fundamentally stays the same hanging back and pewpewing people.whatever weapon we give the heavy needs too keep him in the big threatening constant pressure range.current weapons allow him to do this either by slowing down the enemy or increased damage alongside with a defensive boost. This means with these weapons the heavy can apply pressure but still be hard to take down. the tomislav allows for more focused firing and mobile heavy applying pressure to a target rather then an area. Finally the heater is basically a standard minigun but with an area around it that makes it hard for people to go near heavy an alternative form of defense allowing the heavy to control  areas his immediate one and the one hes firing on.I would say it needs two things  no clips basically you have a single number of Now we could have specific types of pressure the guns focus on an antipush gun that allows the heavy to defend a point by holding back enemy movement long enough to allow allies to come in would be neat. effectively it would slow any momentum coming towards with a larger and larger movement penalty as you close to the heavy and slows down projectiles allowing enemies to escape backwards or go around it but not towards the heavy. Im thinking a big dumb jet engine with lower damage that constantly shoots bits of debris. while not a minigun in the traditional sense it will still function as the other miniguns by spewing damage at an interval but having a secondary function.,tf2,cu30lie,1,t5_2qka0

4830967,0,t3_3h1prs,I think a lot of people overlook the Bison just because its a little bit of a weird weapon and the Bison Masterracers out there always claim it to be the best noncrutch weapon in the game but I actually kinda like it. You just have to start thinking backwards from how a Soldier normally thinks Shotgun for up close and Rocket Launcher for ranged. The Bison actually has less damage rampup AND falloff than most guns so it does a pretty impressive longrange amount of damage even nearing or matching a long range rocket. With its infinite ammo the Bison lets you do minirocket damage at long ass ranges and has the chance to penetrate a LOT of targets even more than your rockets explosive radius might reach. That also allows you to save your Rocket Launcher for medium and close ranges where itll do a LOT more damage. Its a fun little weapon to try out I think and it allows you to play Soldier just a bit differently than normal.,tf2,cu3heow,35,t5_2qka0

And without a giant fix i dont think that the game will survive many more big updates.And TF is way easier to learn for beginners. There are no Items to buy and no complicated stats as in DotA Im not complaining!.

But nobody cares about it even the higher tours on the server. He is free to underachieve with garbage upgrades play style  Just because he is using a Meta class and loadout.

Unintentional but that buff exists already.Also your balance has damage through the reload time and damage from the  so I dont really see the point.

4906635,0,t1_cuczxrh,And the difference is in the intentWere used to console wars where people argue which console is best. Its a toothandnail fight with people scoffing at each other for liking the inferior console.I have never in my life encountered a PC gamer who scoffed at console users. The filthy console peasants I assure you is sarcasm that again spawns from the GLORIOUS PC MASTER RACE joke. PC users are not telling you your console is inferior to be jerks about it theyre telling you it because its true. Again as I said name something a console can do that a PC cannot. Only one user has attempted to answer and has given statements that simply arent true or that he responded with well actually you could but it might be more work. At the end of the day a console essentially is a PC but its a PC with very exact specifications that cant really be modded or changed easily. If I want better graphics on my PC I can buy a damned graphics card. If I tire of the Xbox  graphics....well uhhh guess I better wait for Xbox one huh? If I encounter a gamebreaking bug on a PC game I can either manually fix it with console commands or use mods to fix it. Sims  ANY Bethesda title from Oblivion to Fallout  to New Vegas to Skyrim. These are just some games where I cannot imagine myself trying to play them without the ability to mod in a fix or manually fix a problem. Id rip my hair out. And if I played those on a console? Id be shit out of luck. I cant do anything but hope they patch it and unfortunately companies dont patch as often as they should. Theres a difference between people talking shit because theyre trying desperately to validate themselves as superior and people talking shit because its true and theyre trying to point that out to you to help you. You dont see people using the word elitist in religious discussions for example because while religious debates are annoying as hell all parties involved sincerely believe their belief system to be the right one and are only trying to help the other parties by teaching them why theirs is right. PC is essentially the same except without the theoretical parts religion has tied into it because we can very very easily look up specs for a PC and for consoles and quickly see that the PC is numerically and capabilitywise superior.  I have nothing against consoles or console users but now? Im  years old and if I were to ask myself if I should get a console the answer is lolwhy? I can play any game I want on my PC with better support. The only console that does a fabulous job of retaining a nice exclusive lineup and a unique interactive style is the Wii U. It would be both difficult to get a PC to function like a Wii U and it might hit a point of expense where its cheaper just to....yknow buy the damned Wii U. Aside from that I have no motivation or reason to buy a console and not to sound condescending because I ABSOLUTELY do not mean it this way but I think we need to admit that consoles are more kidfriendly. When youre  years old a computer has tons of options and files and possible errors and stuff and since dad is hiding tons of sweet hot raw farm sex porn on his computer hes actively discouraging you from messing with it too much and making it sound scarier and more complex than it is so you might be scared or intimidated by using it. If your computer says UNEXPECTED ERROR jello.exe WILL NOW TERMINATE then you probably call mom into the room to make sure you didnt break something. A console? You turn it on and press play and theres no breathing room for you to screw up with. The game says this is what you get and thats that. Meanwhile mom and dad get more access to the PC cause they dont have to surrender it to you when you want playtime. I think this is how so many of us grew up on consoles but as you begin to understand a PC better and better you really just see how and why a console isnt neccesary at all really.I hope the context of my post makes it clear that I like the vast majority of avid PC gamers have no interest in shaming or humiliating or scoffing at console gamers. Hell if you were to offer me a free Wii U right now Id accept and be thankful because as said yes I do think thats an example of a console with some things to offer that a PC cannot offer so easily. Some might hate what the Wii U offers but hey thats personal preference and taste and none of us can claim our opinion is superior to anothers. However until a console DOES do something to set itself apart from a PC yes a PC is going to be objectively superior because itll be able to do everything a console can do and more. Thats just fact. ,tf2,cud0nwc,4,t5_2qka0

There are no soldiers who can use splash damage to knock him off course as he jumps.. His target is not a scout who can skillfully double jump to dodge the incoming caber demo.. He does not get sniped while in the air bodyshot or otherwise.I dont think this weapon is uncounterable even if the demo is really good.

You have to know what to expect from each individual player on the enemy team because pubs stand for every thing the comp meta isnt.gtbut pyro holy fuckI guess I sorta agree with this but pyro is balanced in sorta the same way as spy is. Teamwork will shut down a good pyro just like it shuts down a good spy honestly this is the fault of balancing based on the lack of individual player skill and lack of teamwork in pubs.

If theres any variables that change it they would be more like how many aussies there are and that recently dropped basically to balance it so they dont lose money but people see it frequently enough that its still enticing for people to go after.  Similar to that of a casino or lottery.From my experience  your theory is just idle speculation  comparable to saying you have better crate loot if you have the crate and key on a certain pagetile or if you get the key a certain way or if you have a normal version of the hat..

And thus guarantee the enemy kill alongside with the person who youve tickled.Assuming an enemy has  health they have a very reasonable chance to hit you at least once if you spin up right behind them.

5039610,0,t3_3jz5lp,Initially after the Gun Mettle update I thought the Vaccinator was utter trash. Well it was until they patched the slower build during setup time. Heck the shield being active even after switching weapons is awesome. Its way better than solo Ubering when in need. Plus Vac Ubers are expendable. Just farm a single Uber from a hurt teammate and youre good to go.Its a very tanky medigun that gives the Medic a skill indexing option. Your patient is very hard to take down especially when you can now stack Ubers of different types. You can make the derpiest of WM Pyros do excellent work for you by just keeping them alive with Ubers. I do find clueless FPs working the best with Vaccinator since they have no fear and can make the most use out of my Ubers. People who know the game on the other hand tend to instinctively avoid damage although they could have just stood right in front a Heavy and still win.Crusaders Crossbow  Vac is pretty much the Medics version of Wrangler  Rescue Ranger or even better. Just tank damage all day. Perhaps this screenshot wasnt a very good representation but this combo or the Vaccinator itself is rather fun to use and still pretty viable. I didnt have much trouble building the Ubers. Its now my fav medigun again!Im a fan of weird fun sets that work decently well like the Spyro set.

5051412,0,t1_cuupxlu,A lot of practice. I personally have a fair amount of experience The big thing is strafing if you cant strafe well its really hard to get kills because you need to predict their movement a lot further in the future. Id suggest jump maps. After that figure out whats best for your situation. Soldier on the spire of Badlands? Jump almost straight up. Enemy across from you? Use a wall for the initial jump and pogo. Typically you want to be going as much horizontal as possible it gives more time to hit. Also aim to land next to them. Landing on top really lowers your chances of getting the hit. Its still possible dont get me wrong but you want to land on the side. Also keep in mind the delay of the hit with the shovel. It takes a bit for the animation to get to the point of actually hitting so incorporate that into your jump. Again its all practice after a while youll get it.,tf2,cuuvxg0,3,t5_2qka0

5124142,0,t3_3l5iob,I team switch fairly often but only when Im playing with my SO. Team strength isnt a factor at all just one moves to the team with one less player to rejoin the other. Were fairly conscientious and not playing to make anyone feel bad so its not as jarring as some other groups Ive come across who stack and are shit talking assholes. That said I dont feel like I owe anyone anything when I play.  times a team wont kick their hacker  times the enemy team wont even call the vote to  times the griefer or guy who is AFK three rounds is allowed to stay  times someone calls a vote scramble when their team is evenly matched but theyre not winning or their roll was stopped and they just cant get the last point.

5158737,0,t1_cv7sz30,Spy was a tank though you could tank in so much damage still use ammo pickups while cloaked survive headshots and crits. I think that taking that off is better because Spy isnt meant to be able to tank in so much damage it encourages playing in a smart way it pushes you to think Oh wait who should I kill? instead of going for a random kill on the gibus sniper there are consequences to unveiling your true form in front of  soldiers now before you could survive that but any player who installed the game  days ago and thought that spy was fun had it way too easy going. Its a get out of jail card when you play it intelligently dont toss yourself in random situations that can prove to be detrimental. The DR was more meant to be a tool you can use to get a kill and survive after doing so now you have augmented speed which is great if your movement isnt predictable which allows for more intelligent plays instead of just tossing yourself in the enemy combo and still surviving that spy shouldnt be able to do that.,tf2,cv7tipx,8,t5_2qka0

5167485,0,t1_cv7h614,My advice is this  Start preempting every single movement from Blu if your on Red and on Blu have where you placed those traps in mind.The main thing to do is also to just watch the strats from various higherup teams and see what Blu does particularly on pushes.  MOST pushes from Blu will either have a slight push on the flank or will be all in on one point and then start getting your team and yourself into the habit of rotating as fast as possible.Also buddy system IS KEY for this map Med should ALWAYS be with a combo member Engie should have someone with him at most times Demo and Heavy are together at ALL times or with someone that does a similar job Sniper and Spy are pretty much exempt and then Scout and Solly.  You are likely going to be the one from the combo to rotate on flank as demo.  If shit is getting hairy run as FAST as you can to your healthpacks or to resupply.  And if they call med is X then your entire combo should go to X to cut them off and the flank  engie should be able to take care of your primary hold.Main thing is to delay and dont die. Yeah getting a pick is cool but get three or four before you die if ever possible.  Dont chase hurting is fine if it delays them even a second but always be ready to hold your ground.,tf2,cv8vf2f,3,t5_2qka0

Please refer to this guide as posted by blackdove Removing modern malware can be a pain in the ass as they become more sophisticated.After you have made sure your system is clean change all of your passwords. Make sure they are all different and complex. Dont use simple words found in the dictionary. Either make them easy to learn hard to guess or use a random combination of letters numbers and symbols. What i do is i write all my passwords on a piece of paper and that is the only place where i keep them.Make sure you activate two step verification with mobile phone such as email and steam where possible.

A good demo using the sticky launcher can wipe out large numbers of the enemy team at one time especially the combo.The sticky launcher has one of the highest DPS in the game and should not be ignored in favor of the regular grenade launcher.

5221520,0,t1_cvex8ss,Spies are also THE worst class for taking out multiple targets.  Spies strength is that he can pretty much say You die now and in exchange he dies quickly after.  Even if you managed to chainstab two engies AND sap both sentries at least in this picture you have another two literally  feet away that can just shoot him if their sentries dont get him first.Demo is way better because it only takes  stickies or  pipes to break a building if hit as close as you can in most situations.   Lochs will also break a building any pretty much anything near it will take damage or die in both situations.Soldier CAN be a good choice but he has  ammo and has to be close with his shotty to do much damage to a sentry.  If he uses Direct he has to use an entire clip to take down two sentries alone which isnt that helpful when demo could just stop all their operations.Think of this before you play spy to counter a bunch of turtlegineers  Can you safely and within the respawn time take down the engies and all three of their buildings each?  Could you potentially do something different to help your team a bit more such as coordinate saps or headshot weak classes at the dispenser to make number advantage?  Most likely no on the first one maybe on the second.  Would you be able to do either one with demo or take out multiple sentries  buildings in a th of your total ammo without risking death?  Basically can you get into a distance where you can actually shoot pipes  stickies that will do damage to sentries without them being removed or moved.,tf2,cvfdvdx,15,t5_2qka0

5312272,0,t3_3nrrm3,I dont really have it happen to me that often TBH. I did have one dude raging at me once while I was playing medic with a few friends. Sorry bub I know my friends are good and from what I saw of your positioning and game sense it didnt impress me... so Im gonna keep prioritizing my friends and giving them uber to wreck things instead of using it to save your dumb ass.I mean its not like I go asspocketing all of my friends and never heal anyone else. Im not an asshole I heal everyone but I obviously prioritize based on the situation and who needs to stay alive. But if you want an uber? Show me that youre worth it.I do see it happen a lot to other medics though and I usually get off my ass long enough to use the mic and tell whoever is raging to fuck off though because insulting a medic is the fastest way to lose one. One time I was spending a lot of time protecting this medic as pyro and he ended up giving me an uber to go destroy sentries with. Cue some idiot raging in chat that the idiot medic should have ubered him the demo instead. He built the uber he gives it whomever the hell he feels like it bro.

These weapon tiers help the economy TF has been a testing ground for other game for years they tried something in a different game and it worked so theyre being transferred here.

5469465,0,t1_cwarj8f,A lot of people make that argument. I think it would be true if random crits were truely random. Imagine playing dice. If the dice always rolled  and the better player always gets a  for skill the better player always wins. But if occasionally you can role a  or a  at least sometimes the worse player will win.The issue with this logic is random crits are not really random and play without random crits still contains a huge amount of randomness. Your chance of a random crit ramps with damage. Random crits can also be used in non random ways. If you lay down a random crit sticky you can make a smaller trap and use those other stickies else where for one of many examples. A non random crit huntsman can sill randomly head shot you. These factors lead me to think they actually hurt new players.Looking a Muselks deaths they do not appear to happen significantly more often by random crits than how often random crits happen. Its not really enough data to show they help or hurt new players more than experienced ones. We would also really need to know how many people died because of Muselks random crits and a larger sample size. But it does show that it is not clearly a massive benefit to new players.,tf2,cwarxzz,2,t5_2qka0

It doesnt help that I generally build my med like a scout and get healing mastery late game tanking damage for ubers and using those for reviving if my team cant learn to dodge of get behind my shield. Ive even heard  tour players say health on kill is dumb and told lower tour players to refund it.  Sure its not as useful on heavy as demosoldier since burst damage has a higher probability of dealing last hit but I would say all three of those classes should have  ticks in HoK by the start of wave  in most cases then focus on resistances and maximizing DPS,tf2,cwdle96,1,t5_2qka0

Limited ammo and fire rate applies sapper when it hits a building and fires a projectile in an arc? You could use this to both fight an engi who is coming at you but also to sap a building with the first shot.

I just remembered and added a third example of community servers causing Valve to change things halloween gifts and how Scrap.tf servers and SourceMod plugins created by uJessecar have caused Valve to rethink how gifts work.Its easy to see why Valve hates community servers especially when so many server owners do things that Valve would consider bad.Also I should quote something I said later in this discussiongt Also I should state that even though Ive used Scrap.tf as an example in this particularly negative discussion I do like and use Scrap.tf. Im not trying to purposely badmouth Geel or Jessecar either even though it may look like it.gt Fact of the matter is theyre pretty damn good at what theyve done and theyve created a great site...but at the same time theyve made some controversial decisions which were not known to be controversial at the time Im referring to the duck spawning primarily as we didnt know the mass spawning was DDoSing the steam servers and I personally take major responsibility for that mild DDoSing as I was the one who pushed out a rapidspawning plugin,tf2,cwnnfya,4,t5_2qka0

5603660,0,t3_3ruvro,gt My fiance and I are an interracial couple. Often in server chat private or pub you will see racist remarks.Ignore them.gt We do not have a good report function and sadly no good way to log hateful text other than screenshots.Again.gt It is unfair that some people live in parts of the world where racism is normal and just how it is and then in TF it carries over due to edgytrolltruly hateful players. It takes people out of the experience and turns into a civil rights debate mud slinging and eventual quittingother harassment via messages.Two things   Are you playing with people from Angola? Because normal and just how it is is a phrase I have heard NOWHERE in the civilized countries in relation to racism aside from being uttered by actual racists which Im sorry to inform you is a small and vocal minority dont project happy thoughts from your echo chamber.  You dont argue with trolls thats how the Internet works. If you argue with them they win because they get off on arguing and use logical fallacies. Much like you did in point  actually.gt We need a way to better eliminate this from our community as a whole be it chat filters or something. It is not fair that people who face oppression in real life cant even play a videogame and have to be reminded of atrocities behind many peoples comprehension.The only thing I can think of are profanity filters but unless your experience with the Internet is not very developed you couldve seen how easy it is to circumvent them. The human brain is a creative machine and regular expressions wont solve the problem. The only possible solution is to install a position for real life people who monitor chat on every single server ingame so you are safe in not being offended. However it is a crazy in terms of ethics and nonsustainable in terms of finance idea.gt Some of you edgy kids will say whatever in the comments and get downvoted but I am curious about those of you who understand what I mean what your experiences are and how you have dealt with hate in chat.The groups you have listed overlap Im sorry youve missed that in your projection. I have indeed been told to fuck my mother to go die to shoot myself e.t.c. You know what I do? I mute and ignore them because I am not selfrighteous and feel the need to prove everyone on the Internet who hates me wrong.gt It simply isnt fair to see racism in this game especially when one of the main characters is of color and Valve is very careful to make sure no racial stereotypes are included in his character.What relation does this have to your argument? Why is it important that one of the characters is black?gt EDIT I understand that oppression and bullying like this will happen outside the realm of race but this is the most common sort of hate I see that is outside the confines of the TF universe.If this is the most common thing you see it is because you are deliberately focusing on it.

5616012,0,t3_3rzsdv,You completely wasted a ref on serebii.  That is an example of one of the players that is the very reason I dont like Two Cities and wont play it unless lobbied with at least  other people to control the kickvote.  People in that tour think you NEED to run their shitty meta and will kick you for not playing a class dictated by it or in the case of madbad high tours that still are shit at the game will idle in spawn to let the wave fail and leave.  You dont NEED certain classes you dont NEED certain loadouts  I and many other players have beaten most the official missions at Advanced and Expert with class setups like all Scouts  Pyros  Snipers etc.If you want tips on how to get good at MvM I have a guide that will outline the basics of each class and suchTo answer your questions There are no loadouts that you absolutely have to use in MvM  there are good weapons and there are bad weapons Not at all.  Good players that know what theyre doing especially wont need it.  If you know what each class should be doing you wont be relying on it at all. There is no single class that is the most important in MvM  they are all equally good.  Especially PyroSniperSpy despite what Two Shitties noobshits think and all  together in decent enough hands will make games insanely easy Metafags and Boot Camp noobs.  The former will bitch whine and complain about not having the right class setup or if they are the majority of the players on the server they will kick you before you have a chance to prove yourself.How goodbad a weapon is is largely based on its damage outputcapacity to do damage.  Damage is very important in MvM  higher DPS  robots dead faster and tanks and giants do exist.  For example you should avoid using the Tomislav on the Heavy since you get a straight  lower firing speed which is basically lowering your DPS and the upsides are irrelevant as rev time is not nearly as important in MvM and the extra accuracy is pointless as you get the maximum DPS as Heavy at pointblank range where accuracy is meaningless.As for metafags these people will play the same class setup for every tour over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and will throw a shitfit when someone plays outside the meta class setup.  What point is there in calling this a game if you cant have fun as all the  classes you are allowed to pick from and what point is there in playing the same thing over and over  you may as well just uncrate loot instead and trade for what you want if you want to repeat the same process repeatedly for loot.  The worst part is that these people have almost no understanding of the game mechanics and I usually end up outright outdamaging every last one of them and carrying their sorry asses Reddit is a bad place to be asking for advice on MvM.  Go to the Steam Community forums in TFs MvM subforum and read the posts there.  You have users like sigsegv there who actually know the games code and such who will have much much better gameplay advice and wont tell you that you should be limited to only playing certain classes loadouts etc.,tf2,cwt7y8i,1,t5_2qka0

5629963,0,t3_3s7f4q,Scout Sniper and Spy all have the same health and have different abilities. Scout is faster and can double jump his primary forces him into close range situations and his pistol is a good cleanup tool. Sniper has a rifle that can headshot players for instant  damage or charge stay scoped in for a bit for the rifle to charge up which is measured by the scale on the right hand side of the scope for up to  damage headshots and  damage bodyshots. He is one of two classes that can headshot the other being Spy ONLY WITH the Ambassador revolver. Doesnt work with the regular revolver. Spy is a class that can instantly kill any class by stabbing them in the back. His revolver is a decent escape tool as it fires quick reloads quick and has okay damage. Dont be afraid to use the revolver its a mistake a lot of new spies make when they mess up a stab and they keep trying to go for it even though stabs that arent backstabs only deal  damage while the revolver deals  damage and fires faster.The spy can also sap The Engineers buildings just walk up with the Electro Sapper in your hand and click on them. Sapping a building makes it unusable until it is fixed and damages it until it is destroyed. As a spy you can also disguise as the enemy to trick them or to get past Engineer sentries. The Engineer is a very unique class He can build little machines such as a sentry that shoots enemies a dispenser which gives health and ammo and teleporters which take your team to the front lines using metal. Metal is collected through your dispenser ammo boxes or the resupply cabinet. The max metal you can hold is  and you can use metal to build upgrade repair and in the case of sentries resupply your buildings. Repair buildings by hitting them with your wrench while having metal and them having took damage. Resupply your sentrys ammo and rockets the same way. And you upgrade the same way as well. All of the interaction with your buildings is done mostly with your wrench. To upgrade a building it takes  metal each upgrade and every building has  levels. The level  sentry has a slow rate of fire and only shoots bullets. The level  sentry has a really fast rate of fire but still only shoot bullets. The level  sentry has the same rate of fire as the level  but this time has rockets that fire fast and deal a lot of damage. As an engineer Spies may sap your buildings. You can fix this by yup hitting your buildings with your wrench.Pyro and Demo have  health which while  health difference might not seem like a lot its the difference between taking  headshots to get killed and taking  headshot like a Sniper Spy Scout or Medic. Medic has  health. Pyro is possibly the most aggresive class in the game because Pyro has the only primary weapon that actually doesnt even work at a certain range. This primary is the flamethrower. The closer you are to the target the more damage youll deal with it but remember that  health isnt a lot for a class that is that aggressive so play it safe and ambush people from hiding spots or airblast them using right click. The Airblast pushes enemies back reflects enemy projectiles rockets grenade pills arrows etc. and extinguishes teammates that are on fire. If you just run at a player whilst holding W and left click you might get the kill but youre also going to die. It probably goes without saying that setting a player on fire does damage over time until it wears off they collect health get extinguished or jump in water. Demoman has the grenade launcher and the sticky launcher which is a controversial weapon. The sticky launcher has  stickies that can instantly kill any class if they are placed or can be spammed to deal damage. Just be wary of the reload time and range of it. You can shoot stickies farther by holding left click and charging them up. It makes them shoot faster and to a longer distance has no effect on damage. The grenade launcher has  grenades or pills which deal  damage each on direct hit but when not a direct hit they bounce off walls and such and become rollers which deal less damage and dont explode instantly. Use rollers for artillery fire like spamming onto a control point or rolling them down a slope. Use direct hits when you can as  of them can kill any full health class nonoverhealed which Ill get to later except for Heavy. You need  to kill Heavy as he has  health. Use stickies for traps and detonate them with right mouse button or when enemies are too far for your grenade launcher to accurately hit you can spam them which takes a little practice. Im gonna go over Medic now Medic has the syringe gun which while may look terrible actually has the second highest DPS damage per second in the game second to only Heavys minigun although it is very hard to fire. If you manage to keep the syringes on target you can be very efficient in close quarters combat. That being said a Medic can defend themselves quite well so dont assume youre hopeless just because youre support.  The medic also has the medigun which heals people. When you heal someone up to their normal health you can keep healing them and they will get overhealed which means their health increases up to . Overheal deteriorates over time and with damage. When you heal enough people your ubercharge meter will fill up. When that meter is filled pressing right mouse button will make you and whoever you are healing invincible for around  seconds. Use this against strong teams or sentries to take them out.Soldier and Heavy are the tankiest classes in the game with the Soldier having  health and the Heavy having  health. The soldier is basically the middle ground between all classes he can defend an area with his rocket launcher kill scouts with his shotgun rocketjump to vantage points and you can even unlock a parachute for the soldier that will slow your descent while in the air. He is a good class for beginners. Heavy is very very slow but his minigun does a lot of damage in close to medium ranges. He is very good at controlling an area and ambushing since he is slow but does great damage and has a lot of health. Just watch out for snipers that are too far away for you to hit accurately as they can take you out in  headshots and your slow speed makes it easy. An overhealed Heavy has a whopping  health the most in the game.   Thats a basic description of every class for you and some tips.  Remember Play the class you want to play on a server. There arent any rewards for winning a normal match no EXP or leveling here although you can get random drops sometimes. Just enjoy the game how you want whether thats dancing the Conga or being the th sniper on a team.

The mode you talk about where you could stop and let momentum carry you down and you would just dangle there never really worked.  It proved to cumbersome.  for me at leastYou have momentum now just prace space bar mid stream and you will continue flying at their trajectory unattached to the hook.slightly off topic does anyone else wish the grapple would pull you harder around objects?

Scout Soldier Demo and Pyro are the only classes that can hurt themselvesgt Demo also jumps   just fine. This gives him a clear advantage over everyone but Scout and Soldier in terms of mobility. Also the Soldier needs to sacrifice  of his firepower just to get airborn.Thats the Sticky Jumper as in the weapon that makes you not have the sticky Launcher. You dont have a point here. If that demo did that with stock hed be dead because of self damagegt Also the Soldier needs to sacrifice  of his firepower just to get airborn.Naturally but he doesnt have to sacrifice half of his health to get airborn though.gt I still see Demoman doing to bulk of the damage on average and while I clearly on have a laymans understanding of the competetive scene the numbers are at least on my side here.In Highlander this is true simply because there are  people you have a good chance of hitting something or someoneIn s its rare to see a Demo top damage now. You can even see Scouts out damaging Demos sometimes.gt Rocket Launcher Damage. Can fire four times before reloading can fire once every . seconds. Does less damage.Sticky Launcher Damage. Can fire eight times before reloading can fire once every . seconds. Does more damage.Demoman is also the most common recipient of Kritz charges and we both know why.You are forgetting the arm time on the sticky launcher making it . seconds before being able to actually do damage. Not to mention the Sticky Launcher has the slowest projectile in the gameSticky Launcher does more damage at mid range because thats where Demo is strongestRocket Launcher does more damage at close range because that is where Soldier is strongDemo is the most common recpient of kritz because he can manually detonate his stickies not because he has more loaded than a Soldier.gt Heavy is universally panned in competitive for being such a giant slow target that needs a Medic pasted onto him for the entirety of the match to do anything. Sure hes a better tank but thats really all he is good for. You will rarely see Heavy played in a s match over a Demoman.Just like a Pyro is good for is airblasting shit.You see heavy played alongside Demo in s. Want to know why Heavy isnt run full time in s? Because he is to slow and lacks mobility to keep up with other classes such as Scouts and Soldiers.gt Also while its not super reliable all you need is a couple of DR Spy kills and you can obtain a higher maximum health than Soldier.Really reaching for points now?gt He can cap points at  times speed which gives him a distinct advantage over  other classes the only other classes able to do this being Soldier and Scout.Give the Pain Train to everyother class and the only one that you would see it used on is Pyro. Not a valid pointgt Pyro is obviously the best at obstructing Ubers but Demoman is by and large better at it than Soldier   who would otherwise need to land consecutive airshots at just the right angle.You proved my point with this one. Pyro is clearly the best hes not the only option thoughgt He certainly does seem as strong as I think he isHe seems as strong as you think because you are looking at everything wrong. Theres a reason Demo mains are extremely hard to find in comp. both s and Highlander and its not because hes to easygt Why else would comp leagues universally give a cap of one Demo and one Medic while being pretty lenient on the rest of the class restrictions? Hes the most powerful class.Answered this in my other post.,tf2,cx4tv6s,1,t5_2qka0

5753126,0,t1_cx9zydy,Pyro is the Spys counter if the Sniper was killing Spies faster than Pyros could there would definitely be something very wrong. Flare or Reserve Shooter combos are also pretty efficiently countered by Spies packing the Spycicle or the Dead Ringer.Sniper is a longrange class who theoretically is only effective in long range but in practice the Jaratewacka combo allows him to be effective far and close. Sniper is ridden with items that let him circumvent his weaknesses and that contributes to his imbalance in HL right now. DDS lets him survive headshots. Jaratewacka lets him consistently melee crit. Huntsman lets him fight at close range. Razorback lets him avert backstabs. Machina lets him hit multiple targets.So the point of my post is that I believe its an unfair distinction that Sniper gets so many powerful weapons which circumvent its weaknesses while the Pyro isnt allowed the same even when the Axtinguisher doesnt actually fix its weaknesses because you still need to get right up in their breathing room.,tf2,cxa8awr,2,t5_2qka0

5759029,0,t3_3u0zdt,Here are some assorted bullet points on the balancing of Heavy Here is the Gravel Pit Developer Commentary on the Heavy from Keith Huggins  gt With its wide field of fire the Heavys Minigun lets players who dont have great twitch aiming skills still wade into the thick of combat. To make up for this reduction in the value of the players aiming skill we amplified the importance of other skills. For instance the wind up time before firing and the Heavys reduced speed while firing forced players to anticipate both the start of combat and incoming enemy attacks. Heavys counters are Sniper and Spy. When a Heavy is dominating my team I switch to these classes. Even the best Heavy in the world can barely move while firing and must look at what hes shooting. Shoot his head or stab his back. A mistake made by a Heavy is much more severe than a mistake made by another class because a Heavy cannot retreat. He must stand his ground and hope he has enough health to tank the focus fire.  For example I recall a time on plupward when I had just won a costly battle against many enemies. My health was low but I knew the fight was over so I spun down to eat my Sandvich. Lo and behold a Scout appeared from the staircase below me. I couldnt spin up in time and he killed me.And here is what to do as each class In general a Heavy cannot be killed by running straight at him as you would in normal combat. Thats not how he works. Hes a lot like Engineer in that he shuts down nonsense. Scout You pose no threat to him until you catch him by surprise at pointblank range. Luckily you have the mobility to get within pointblank range. You can run away if you fail he cant. Its very effective to attack him a few times run away before he can retaliate and then return when he isnt spun up to finish him off. Soldier Good positioning is important to defeating a Heavy. Youll have to use cover and unleash all your rockets plus maybe a few secondary weapon shots. Pyro Heavy is your hard counter. Nevertheless there are still things you can do against him. An ambush while hes not spun up is always effective but it will take you about three seconds for your flames to kill him. In direct combat the best thing to do is light him on fire airblast him away all but the best Heavies will have a hard time tracking you midair Shotgun or Flarecrit him midair and run. At long range you can Flarecrit him repeatedly and kill him in four shots. Demoman Similar to Soldier except you have a much higher damage output. Just use cover keep spamming and dont let him close the distance. If youre using a shield youre doomed. Heavy Be the first to fire. Engineer A Heavy who jumprevs against your Sentry can kill it faster than it can kill him. But if youre present the fight is much more even. The Wrangler will work wonders against a Heavy who is attacking your nest if you have the sense to switch to it and not just keep whacking your Sentry. If youre alone youll have to use the Scout tactics with less effectiveness if you have a Shotgun. If you dont just run. Medic Why are you fighting a Heavy? Heal someone and let them kill him for you. Sniper Shoot his head. Spy Stab his back. Make sure hes shooting at something first.,tf2,cxayn3a,5,t5_2qka0

Someone somewhere will write it and share it with the community.Though if someone chooses to use a desktop app in place of the mobile app they are making their steam account more at risk.

5802855,0,t1_cxfr2ho,I think the reasoning for making Hellstone a clusterfuck was to prevent stale matches where a bunch of sentries guard a chokepoint and the cart doesnt advance at all which happens very often on pubs.Hellstone has a pretty strong bias in favor of blue. Bosses destroy any sentry nest red tries to build and red cannot block the cart without getting stunned. Spies can get spells that make it possible to take out even well guarded sentry nests by themselves.None of that may be fair or balanced but it does mean that usually the cart will advance throughout the entire map even if blue isnt that good a team and has no coordination. That keeps things interesting and unpredictable and gives everyone plenty of time to run around hurling spells at each other.,tf2,cxgedrv,14,t5_2qka0

5805002,0,t1_cxgnu9r,Forgive me if I didnt do a good job explaining it its very late here. i guess early now haha But the problem is that the unusual effect wont be on my head. For example when I taunt my unusual effect wont be on my hat but rather fifty feet in front of me floating in the air. After the taunt it will fly underground or be frozen somewhere around the map. It also frequently stays there floating if I die. It is very rare that my unusual effect is actually on me rather than a few rooms away. I know its not a problem with my install or system because my friend can also see it as well. An example would be just earlier today we were playing payload on Thunder Mountain. He can see my unusuals particles floating by his supply cabinet in his spawn even though Im on the other team at the other side of the map. It teleports all over the map and is almost NEVER on my head. Like I said Ive had blizardy storm stormy storm disco beatdown and Miami nights unusuals and this has never happened before. It seems to be prevalent with the subatomic effect I have now as Ive never experienced this before. ,tf2,cxgnykn,1,t5_2qka0
5805389,0,t1_cxgorzy,It doesnt seem very fair at this point in time any player you see in the game who is firing their weapon on your team is  assured to not be a Spy.  If you add a weapon with these conditions into the game now everyone who fires their gun could still be a Spy whether they are or they arent. Even Spies who dont waste their Primary Slot with La Ruse would benefit greatly from this weapon being in the game and it would make him a lot more powerful.        Think about how effective it would be in a pub where at most two or three people use a mic and the rest of the team is completely silent. You cant ask your teammates if they are a Spy you have to Spycheck which is now basically impossible.  I see a friendly Soldier running at me clearly expecting to be healed and he shoots a rocket at me. Alright cool lets heal him hes not a Spy. With La Ruse even if there isnt a Spy using it in the entire server I have to assume well he could be a Spy so I have to physically run through him before I can heal him.  What if youre an Engineer with your shit being sapped and their are people clambering around firing their weapons wildly every whichway you only have  shots to Spy Check better hope your aim is perfect and you happen to hit the right guy.  What if youre a Heavy and that same Soldier runs at you again and you have to come to a fucking crawl and track him for  seconds before you know for sure that when he gets close to you you wont die instantly. And you have to do this every time someone just might be a Spy.  Without the mental state of hes good he fired his weapon most classes are going to have a very difficult time Spy checking it would be very annoying and having to nudge Spies is just asking to be trickstabbed or set up.      So say this weapon has been in the game for years and everyone knows that simply firing your weapon is a waste to prove you arent a Spy because La Ruse lets Spies do this anyway. Now nobody even fires their weapon to prove they are on your team. Everyone just walks into each other or uses Pyros fireJarate or something else that would be a dead give away. Even Spies running complete Stock weapons would have a huge advantage simply because La Ruse is in the game. Its like how when I kill a Spy I check my ammo walk into the kit he dropped and see if hes actually dead even if he turned out to not have been using the Dead Ringer.,tf2,cxgpozi,1,t5_2qka0

5825930,0,t3_3v0s3d,Pyro is a shortmid ranged class and as such it really shouldnt be worrying about sentries. But if youre alone..Manmelter is bad. The lower firing speed makes it take forever to get rid of a sentry and by then the Engineer should be back to repair if he isnt already turtling next to it.Scorch Shot is pretty good. If the Engineer is turtling you can fire next to his sentry like on a wall and hell take the damage from the flare bursting. As long as he doesnt have a dispenser he should be dead after a few shots. This leaves you and the sentry so just keep shooting it after hes dead. If its an unguarded sentry then just keep unloading from a distance. Itll break eventually.Flare Gun is OK but only if you have an angle on the Engineer and can hit him from around his sentry. The crit when hes on fire means you can take him down in  shots depending on whether or not he has a dispenser. This leaves you and the sentry and a decent amount of shots can destroy it. If its unguarded just keep shooting it.Now heres another choice The Detonator. This one is good if you know how to time the airburst. You can damage both the sentry and the Engineer at once if you time it right killing him quick and doing a decent amount of damage to the sentry at the same time. If he keeps taking damage hell likely retreat to recover letting you keep shooting it. ,tf2,cxjazej,5,t5_2qka0

5873960,0,t3_3vptcj,So Im not  sure but from what Ive seen it goes something like this. It is not only weapons that are dropped from the item drop system. You can get weps crates cosmetices and a few things like your description tag. Its just that the weps drop at the highest rate while it is much less likely for you to get any of the others. The Item drop system does not care about backpack quality but it kinda does take into account playtime depending on what you are talking about. For example you can only get a maximum of  items a week and each item usually drops at around a steady rate of  minutes of playing. If in a week you do not get all ten item drops then the ones you have left will carry over to the next week and give you a chance to get them then but the items carried over are capped at . So theoretically if you had only gotten  items one week then played for approx. ish hours the next week you could get  weps the next week. But if you only played for  hours for two weeks then the max items you could get the following week is . I hope this helped. If you want an better explanation just go here.,tf2,cxplw5v,1,t5_2qka0

5886515,0,t3_3vvs9e,gtEnforcerInteresting idea but I dont like the reset on reload mechanic as it forces people to use manual reloading and as such would be the only weapon in the game to change between powerful and neardirect downgrade depending on a minor option change. Just give it a maximum stack maybe  and decrease the time window to keep the bonus.gtPBPPPair it with the Candy Cane for instant death from a pill or a direct rocket but the ability to get  health by finishing an enemy off with the gun and grabbing the health pack. Pretty good and the no falling damage is nice itd also go well with the Soda Popper or FaN.gtSoaSThe minicrit mechanic seems a little bit much but I guess its intended to pair with the CritaCola. Personally I think taking  damage every halfsecond after a single swing is a bit silly even with the increase in damage taken from the Cola. Landing a minicritsecond attack spells death for Scout Engie Sniper Spy and likely Medic. The Gunslingerlike hit combo is pretty neat though.gtSteakThis looks good aside from the full health kit thing. As a Heavy you could just carry this around and save your teammates from even more certain death a pair of Heavies in a pub with this could toss it to each other and have ridiculous sustain barring a Sniper or Spy. No Medic needed each Heavy has essentially  health plus whatever resistances his minigun gives.gtManntreadsSomeone doesnt know what a hard counter is. This is interesting though it makes juggling much harder but you also cant escape through knockback either. I think the speed boost should only be  though because as it is there you move faster than stock Demoman. Although maybe thats intended?gtVaccinatorI dunno this feels like more incentive for a Medic to pocket a single person whereas the current Vaccinator pretty much says heal everyone for maximum ubers. If I had to change something about it itd be the resistanceswitching thing maybe by pressing reload and selecting say  for bullet explosion fire melee yes I know melee cant be blocked against right now.gtCaberYes. Its no longer an easy delete whoever you hit but at the same time it destroys Snipers and Spies who generally dont do well against close combat and fighting from the front respectively while still only killing Scouts who dont react welluse their double jump too early. I do hope that the enemy is launched in a slightly different direction from the Demo though hitting someone with the melee in the air is just stupid and ensures a kill on Medics as well rather than just reducing them to pitifully low health.gtPhlogBefore looking at the idea in detail Ive heard pulling things in doesnt work well in TF due to how things are calculated. Statswise I dont think I like having to use the taunt key to activate Mmph  having the reload key for example as an option would be nice since altfire is being taken up by the Better Short Circuit. Im not a fan of the extra explosive vulnerability especially since Soldier and Demo are already really good at shutting down a Phlog if they know how to aim at all and since the crits have been turned into minicrits. The projectile nullification thing is cool I like that it stacks based on how many projectiles it destroys. Im not sure how the extra absorption cooldown would work but it looks like this idea started with what if the Phlog was reworked to read Soldiers and Demos shit on you even more now?,tf2,cxr97ri,2,t5_2qka0

5918633,0,t1_cxuirdo,To be fair virtually every class does that in response to complaintsThe general response we see from Valve is that the side screaming the loudest frequently wins balance wise. As a result trying to compromise while the other side is yelling about how broken something is makes it likely the other side is going to get what they want.I like to say I main Pyro and its my favorite class but any time the games close Ill frequently swap to Demoman or Soldier because both classes are easier to have success with. So to take something away youd at a minimum need to add something or nerf several other classes to balance the loss.The will likely annoy soldiers and demomen and the former is a pain. Why is it a pain? Because people already dislike how the class wms. If you increase the flamethrowers damage directly people will complain how the class became more nooby as noobs dont M. You could change the way the particles travel to make it more skillful but the Pyro already has lag issues and cant actually see his particles. You could keep the current damage but also add a weakness to fire damage on hit that would ramp up the damage for hitting reliably but youd still likely get wm complaints.You could add a mobility slot for items that allow you to move in different ways or new mobility capabilities but youd likely end up moving the class to a point where you arent that different from either the soldier or the scout.The Pyros HP or mitigation could be raised but thatd lead to increased success for WM and I believe that may have hit balance issues in the past on the backburner. I never could find much gameplay footage of it actually in action. Plus people arent fans of the Demoknight or the miniguns having high mitigation. Speed would also hit wm complaints as it would marginally amplify the flamethrowers range and damage as the particles gain velocity from the players motiondamage is dealt based on lifetime remaining so if particles go faster with the same total lifetime they will do more damage  and it would make enemies easier to catch.If you wanted to be more specific you could give the Pyro  Speed when they havent taken damage in the last  seconds. That would allow the class to rollout or flank more quickly but once direct combat was engaged they wouldnt be better than they are now.Finally Im not sure the problem is worth fixing. Learning to airblast took me around  hours on walkway. Im still not particularly good at it for anything beyond stock rockets grenades and sentry rockets.  of Pyros I run into my solution to kill them is shooting rockets at them unless Ive got a group of people on my team behind me. Most of the time theyll either miss on the reflect miss me on the reflect or become so oblivious to my team someone else will kill them. As for the Pyro stunning your motion the Pyro needs to be at close range with you for that to occur. Why does your class deserve to be able to get close to the Pyro and get away scot free? If you tried whatever maneuver you just did against a heavy youd likely be dead as the Minigun deals  DPS at point blank.,tf2,cxvgq25,3,t5_2qka0

5986354,0,t1_cy480ko,I do agree the phlog can be not fun to play against but I never really had a problem with the old phlog. The thing is that if the pyros cornercamping the phlog isnt really all that different from before. If a pyro can get a lot of kills its usually because the map itself isnt very good and has too many choke points. I was playing with it earlier and in Badwater I couldnt do anything because there was too much open space. I tried it in Dustbowl and got  dominations in  lives and  level. I dont like how now theres absolutely no risk to using mmph though. Hell I even used it to body block an uber a couple times. Usually took about half an uber to get rid of me.Basically my point is that the phlog was really only useful in certain maps. The changes Valve did was pointless because it doesnt really help make it more useful in the other maps while making it even more powerful in those maps it could be used.,tf2,cy4cbwe,5,t5_2qka0

This map which is Ashville  Coalplant I believe is VERY Sniper heavy and pretty not fun if you dont have a good sniper.,tf2,cyamwiu,5,t5_2qka0

And how were they supposed to know they would somehow become untradable.gtValve is under no obligation to anybody to put a bandaid on your booboo.It was VALVES booboo and they put a retroactive bandaid on the problem which screwed over customers that bought the items under the pretense that they had the tradable and marketable attributes set and could be resold.,tf2,cyc042x,0,t5_2qka0

6128780,0,t1_cylzcb7,I played Heavy in Highlander last year Iron obviously and I have no complaints about how Heavy has to be played beyond the aforementioned cornercreeping being problematic and the fact that you have to waste ammo to be effective in a fight.Ive won v Heavyoffs during a match where the other one had a Medic while I was  HP and he was overhealed and I still won because I had been firing longer Admittedly he probably sucked as well but come on. I dont see a problem with that but the fact that you effectively need to burn ammo and alert your presence to anyone that yes you are in fact around the corner is fucking stupid.Thats why the Tomislav has become such a powerful tool now but you still need to fire to get the fucking damage bonus so even the silent spinup becomes a moot point.,tf2,cyma1l3,1,t5_2qka0

6146663,0,t1_cyo7f6h,gtHad I played pyro I probably could have been much more useful.Practice Soldier or Scout? Maybe try not only playing Pyro? Learning multiple classes is an essential part of the game. Why do you think the comma button exists? Midgame classswitching! If you are only good at Pyro then thats not the games fault. Thats your problem.Simply put practice other classes. Play Scout or Soldier in pubs. Do jump maps. Do something to improve your skills on these classes. You need to put some effort into one of the generalist classes. You may ask Why do that when Im good at Pyro? Because if you play Pyro your team would be better off replacing you with a Soldier main. Your teammates need to put extra effort into their play to make up for your lack of Soldier skills. Playing Pyro doesnt solve the problem it just puts a lazy patch over it.gtYou said it yourself. s and HL are different beasts. You are cutting  players from each team in s and there is no class requirement. Thats a vastly different game than HL.This is perfectly fine. Its good to have the gamemodes be different. If s were more like HL then people would simply stop playing HL and former s players would be upset. That would be bad for both parties.gtYikes s is even more screwed up than I thought.Not really. It makes the gameplay more interesting and forces players to utilize alternate classes. If you dont switch to Pyro Heavy or Engineer after losing mid your enemies will probably be able to capture the last point. If this snowball effect never occured then there would be absolutely no need to switch class at all and s would be even more stale.,tf2,cyob7h8,0,t5_2qka0

6156913,0,t3_3zuz3m,Yeah. Lets nerf sniper to hell and lets let classes like Spies Engineers and Pyros prevail. A sniper is a key instrument in any team because it punishes the enemy for showing themselves too much and is a necessary evil. Think a bit. You seem to hold some hatred for sniper but imagine if there were no snipers how engineers would have a much easier time how medics would roam everywhere without much fear how pyros could just PJ across sightlines how spies would focus down the combo even more. Youre sanctioning people for building a good muscle memory that rewards them later on which is unfair. A good sniper will counter another good sniper. Or a good spy will also counter a good sniper if planned well enough. Sniper as a class alone IS overpowered. But sniper VS other classes is far from overpowered its a compensation. Players shouldnt be able to go wherever the hell they want a roaming soldier shouldnt be able to rocketjump and take out the enemy med without anyone stopping him just because. I think bodyshooting is lame so Id be fine with bringing down the amount of dmg on a bodyshot although it can be beneficial on a very long range because its not all THAT easy to aim. What I find fucking ridiculous is that youre acting as if all snipers land all their shots all the time thats like saying soldier should be removed because he can bomb you and kill you with  rockets! and soldier takes much less skill than sniper on the aim leveljust my  cents.,tf2,cyph63e,1,t5_2qka0

6277269,0,t1_cz2vb8y,Phlog is a classic crutch weapon. It can prop up a less skilled player but is less effective  hindering in the hands of someone more experienced. Imo from how Ive played pyro  if I can get them within fire range and closer I should be punishing them anyway using stock I use it for the skins. Phlog crits makes it much snappier but the lack of airblast makes me completely vulnerable from projectile spam. With stock I can often capitalize on lazily lobbed projectiles with reflects back at them. With phlog you have to scamper. ,tf2,cz35krq,1,t5_2qka0

6307476,0,t3_41zccr,The degreaser was never overpowered. A critical flare deals  damage. A rocket deals  base damage. Critical flares just allow pyros to deal the exact same damage that soldiers can dealing by pressing M and pyros have to pull off a tricky combo to do it.Likewise its hard to argue that the axtinguisher or anything else requiring a pyro combo is overpowered. Sure a surprise melee crit isnt fun to receive.

6327257,0,t1_cz8twyr,gtWeak to most classes? What? Your only enemies are Lvl  sentries and since the axtinguisher nerfs Heavies. For everytjing else theres a solution in your kitScout.Sniper.Demoman.Engineer. Heavy.Thats most classes and surprise surprise youre weak to most of them as a Pyro.Heavy and Engie are obvious.Scout can stay out of range of your flames and still do roughly  damage to you with his scattergun  you dieSniper shoots you from anywhere that isnt close range  you dieDemoman excels in midrange you excel in close range. Demoman fires both Grenades and Stickies faster than you can airblast them.  you diegtI still get to topscore consistently with DegFlarePJ.Now may I ask where exactly you topscore consistently? If its in pubs that means literally less than nothing. You can topscore as ANYTHING in pubs if you arent braindead. Ive done it without fucking disguising as a spy using the Kunai. Its nothing to be proud of.gtYou got low dps? Maybe but you get good burst damageenough to take out most squishy classes in a fraction of a second you can reflect the enemys damage onto them you have a way to lock down targets consistently  if you still have trouble taking out your enemies sorry its only your fault.No its not maybe. The Pyros DPS as a close range class is far too low to be reasonable.Ah yes our  burst damage that requires two weapons to pull off and leaves us in a massively dangerous placement if they arent a  HP class or a medic. Do you know what else do  damage and dont leave their class in a situation where they may die? Grenades and Rockets. Both of which have a higher clip size are easier to aim and more reliable than the flarecombo. But naaah our burst is amazing! Thats why it keeps getting nerfed. Right?gtThe pyros biggest threat are laggy soldiers but thats not a real class right.Laggy soldiers arent even a problem rockets dont lag just the player. If you have issues with laggy soldiers thats on you mate.gtGod why the fuck does it seems that most other Pyro mains are whiny bitches that cant even properly play that class and instead need to cry themselves out on reddit or spuf how super bad their class is. Honestly if you cant handle it play another class. Maybe its because other people arent ignoring that the class is flawed in numerous ways in a pretty bad state and blessed volvo isnt doing anything do address the issues that makes it worse than it should be? I dunno man maybe its because other people actually understand how the class works on a fundamental level understand that flame particles are broken to fucking shit understand that afterburn is next to meaningless and understand that the class needs a serious overhaul?Nah its just because were all bads and we want the Pyro to be overpowered and easy. Yep. Thats it. ,tf2,cz8u920,18,t5_2qka0

6329750,0,t3_428shq,Interesting idea. I dont believe Valve would go for it but its worth a shot after a few tweaks. It would be nice for something to counter Medic healing in pubs considering how powerful a competent Med can be in pubs. I think this might be a bit too powerful in comp however as a pyro demo combo could wipe a whole floor of classes. I would recommend a side nerf to afterburn so it looses effectiveness if the pyro dies so you dont just have pyros running into enemy combos lighting them on fire dying and then having the demo just kill everything that cant be healed. That would make it less of a rinse lather repeat process.,tf2,cz94fv7,2,t5_2qka0
6330380,0,t1_cz90b6n,I dont think a weapon needs guaranteed ways to be countered without listing running away. Retreating is a viable strategy that is necessary in most if not all strategy games. If the phlog gave crits  of the time then your argument would probably be valid. However the Pyro first needs to build up a meter then take about half a second to taunt to begin unleashing criticals. This gives enough time for people to runprepare to take them down. If your class cant deal with it its not because it isnt balanced. You should be able to analyze the situation and act accordingly.  If that means run then run. And maybe alert your team with an X while youre at it.But thats just my opinion. Im no gaming expert.,tf2,cz970ob,1,t5_2qka0

I want it to have a  v  format but not the stale and boring clash that happens in every single game.How I PERSONALLY want it is how i think valve will implement it. A v format with no weapon bans where people change their loudout and classes to deal with certain situations.Now i know im not extremely seasoned in the tf comp scene.

6365899,0,t1_czd7xrg,Not sure if this deserves its own topic or not but I dont get the fixation with whether or not something is considered to be fun.  I see people mention that minis are not fun that Natascha is not fun that the puffnsting is not fun...  Much more rarely do I hear people complain about a sniper headshotting you across a map being not fun or getting facestabbed being not fun.  Hell there are lots of other things that are not fun toosticky traps  sec respawn times pubstompers with dedicated medics seriously I would like to see a way that if a medic is healing only one player gt of the time they get split onto different teams and cannot team up again for  minutes and so on.Seems like the most bitching about no fun comes when whatever it is slows down a mobile class.  So why is those classes fun more important than that of other less mobile classes?  Is it because thats already the comp meta?  If comp had somehow evolved to be a slower paced game would the idea of what is fun and what isnt be different?  ,tf2,czd8drx,6,t5_2qka0

6366966,0,t3_42u9ai,Sniper is overpowered unfun and annoying. Removing him would better the game nerfing him would be better though. Pyro isnt a fun class to play now. He has no skill ceiling now. Reflects combosminus RS and chaining were giving him somewhat of a skill ceiling and an edge. Now he can barely combo fast enough and would just be better to M. Reflects are there but reacting quick enough and making them worth it isnt there. You cant chain together attacks cause of the lack of switch speed.His  greatest melees got nerfed for no reason. Powerjack given just a  health on kill and cant over heal? For what reason? Nerfing the Axtinguisher into this mess of a weapon even though it was mostly used in a skillful way?

Suddenly everyone and their mother was using it. I specifically recall seeing players using it preGM and even using it myself it was never a very powerful weapon but it had its uses. The best use I ever found for it was giving a Soldier with it and a few kills every Kritzkrieg uber I got. That random dude and I wrecked the enemy team. Other than that I remember enjoying it as a different play style though found other weapons more powerful.

BECAUSE you cant expect some random person with no experience to understand or evaluate it with credible detail. If you honestly cannot see past that because you think that the engineer who builds at last on cp maps will offer useful feedback then I hope whenif you get beta access you get paired with these types of players so you can be the one who has to shift their attention away from TESTING the purpose and explain every detail of how to play for them. ,tf2,czgri2w,0,t5_2qka0

Hence a lot of teams dont do it because they dont want to play at a disadvantage.This doesnt mean Pyro is banned. It means Pyro is not recommended but still possible.The same goes for other classes though you can get away with using Heavy Engineer and Pyro for defending a last point.Edit Id actually argue that v is similar to pubs.

Also affects enemies on payloads and Engineers. Hitting bleeding allies cauterizes their woundThis gives the weapon another small situational buff. Plus there are not many counters to bleeding in TF right now like there are for fire.

But after an hour of playing and more than enough wins and points scored to max out the contract the meter refuses to move past .

Supposing that you directly jumped with  stickies onto the balcony that would make you a pretty easy shot to line up for the sniper. With this method you have much less time where you are exposed for being shot and you are harder to hit because you are doing an unexpected jump that includes more strafing.,tf2,d00dpv9,18,t5_2qka0
6585461,0,t3_45vejf,I have said these things few days ago I think on another thread but Ill quote them here just in case so you can add these to your guide.Bind moveup or movedown to a key and you can move slower on land. You can even slow down while using conga mannrobics or katkozy kick that I cant write. You can move even slower by binding into mwheelup and mwheeldown forward.You can drown yourself and recover all hp once you are no longer fully underwater. This can be used with help of dispenser medic or friend throwing lunchbox items to store the drowned health from the time you were drowning when you are no longer underwater. Kind of hard to explain with my english skills. Youll regenate hpsecond and lose hpsecond if I remember right when drowning. You cant stack health regenation from multiple drownings. Maybe some day we will find way to exploit this regen for real infinite healing.Atomizers rd jumps damage count as bullet damage. Found out when Scout triple jumped while I was using Vaccinator with bullet res. when damage your healing target took still healed you. So basically free hp healing DWith Tide Turner you can cover larger distance on flat ground if you jump charge and strafe in a little curve that looks a bit like caka flattrimping as I found and named it Hard to do but can help you get size of  demomans more distance covered to barely reach someone. Expecially useful if you are on higher ground to let you trimp in the more commonly known way a lot further that regularly.,tf2,d00hoaw,45,t5_2qka0

6587355,0,t1_d00k4b1,Sorry just wanted to make a response to your other statement you made before which I initially missed but makes me unreasonably angry.gtIts truly an ambush weapon now and its challenging but fun to useIts the exact complete utter opposite. Pre Tough Break Axtinguisher required Pyros using it to hit their enemies from behind to access  damage if hitting from the front it would only minicrit for . It was an ambush weapon through and through based on attacking enemies from above or behind to surprise attack them.PostTough Break Axtinguisher is a steaming pile of no skill no reward. You can hit enemies from any angle with it no backstab or ambushing required to get your crit. However the crit it does only deals  damage.The rework removed the distinction between a skilled Axtinguisher user who could get behind people unnoticed with a class who cannot turn invisible and an unskilled Axtinguisher user who charges at the enemy and mashes  and M. In turn it also lowered any usefulness the weapon had as its damage is so poor just WMing gives more damage anyway.,tf2,d00opso,1,t5_2qka0

Mentioning free in something regarding an artist making something for you is one of the easiest ways to not get someone to do something haha. Ive had people try to commission me for art for  for a full body full color picture and although my art isnt the best my time and effort on a picture like that would be worth more than that and although I know not everyone can drop money on a commission but some of my friends who are artists have to make a living off them while they search for jobs. So yeah I really suggest that you always be upfront with the price range youre willing to pay even if youd like it to be free and be prepared for them to take the highest price you offer. Sometimes they wont and maybe if they like the idea enough they WILL do it for fee but thats something that should more or less be up to the person who is actually going to make it.

6667035,0,t1_d08og56,Gonna run through your points one by one.gtIt doesnt take less skillNo...skill is a vague word that doesnt really mean anything except what you intended so its a yes and no.  Can you put skill into anything?  Yes you could even master the flamethrower particles and do x better than the average pub pyro.  The issue is that and I want to make the statement that Im not saying pyro is op or bad Im just going through some arguments the same ineptitude and lax swinging of the crosshair by a scattergun scout nets  damage but from some  ping pyro whos never touched a computer before same with heavy can kill a player who doesnt respond immediately and accurately.  Its why they are great classes for players new to FPSs.  A large cone of constant and reasonable damage is ideal for someone who doesnt understand shot timing and aiming yet.gtClasses like Engie Pyro and Heavy certainly take skill but more in the way of positioning timing advances well and having good gamesense in general.Thats literally every class.  Every class can and does use those attributes though might need them less than a class like pyro which is limited in range.  Sure scouts can run really fast and players struggle to hit you but you could easily just walk into an instant death situation if you dont have positioning timing and good game sense.  Snipers GET TAUNT KILLED all the time for lacking those.gtEngineers constantly worried about Spies Snipers Im skipping a couple that are engy specific good escape routes uber pushesAll of those are every class again.  Spies and snipers are honestly the two classes that will cause everyone constant pressure since you cant hold still and have to constantly turn around and listen closely.The pyro I am talking about is not the theoretically difficult better playstyle of pyro.  Im not saying its unskilled in general Im saying the flamethrower will kill very effectively at close range in the hands of someone who has no clue what they are doing thats why its annoying.  Im at a level in my play where I almost never die to pyros but I remember how it felt before I had almost k hours and just wasnt prepared around common surprise corners or watching spawns or gathering more layout information.No one wants to go down easy.  Putting any preparations aside lets be honest after dying if you rage youre definitely not sitting there thinking about their whole process of getting to where they were and timing we get upset because they just looked in our general direction and melted us.  They instantly cover our screen in red and fire and our health drops very rapidly and consistently giving us time to react to that its happening but sometimes we dont have enough time to do anything about it.  Gets a time to be invested in the fight but not to win assuming its a surprise like a lot of spawn phlogging corner backburning or just a sneaky pyro.  It felt like a fruitless struggle unlike a crocket or a snipe where its over right then and there.To recap My point was NOT pyro is upsetting cause it takes no skill in general it was that in the moment you get attacked Wm pyros are just looking generally at you and melting you like theyre bored and you get enough time to respond and struggle but you are often already beyond winning.  Those are the feelings that although bypassable through greater levels of skill and preparation truly result in rage.,tf2,d08xglv,-2,t5_2qka0

6780692,0,t3_48m0w3,I think the lack of Highlander is kinda good in a way. Matchmaking is supposed to introduce new players to the comp scene. Its not supposed to be a substitute for TFCenter. Its meant for those with NO competitive experience.That said Highlander is too complex of a gamemode to include. Locking every team to  of every class turns the game into something widely different to any other form of TF. Its like a completely different game at that point. HL doesnt play out anything like regular TF does unlike any other format which at least tries to be more like the intended game.When MMs goal is to attract new players to comp putting them in a weird alienated format is the worst thing to do because chances are theyll be thinking Well competitive Highlander is too weird for me. Ill stick to pubs where things are more normal. Many players would have this sort of mindset and it wouldnt help the comp scene grow at all.However Valve is smarter than this. Im glad to see how Matchmaking is going so far as Valve probably knows how to make their own v format that is like the one we have now but doesnt rely on weapon bans due to rebalances being perfect for casual players to jump into what is essentially a more objectiveoriented pub but with less players.,tf2,d0kvjiq,13,t5_2qka0

Now that you can throw a smoke from one side of the map to the other you can effectively block of one portion of the map for a very long period of time.

On the point of pros switching over  Has any pro really said something along the lines of Im going to play Overwatch competitively even though its in a closed beta and anything is subject to change? It doesnt seem real that an unreleasedunfinished game already has a horde of a competitive scene.  I dont think Valve is going to abandon a game because another one stepped up to the plate and TF is too old to be living in any games shadow. Overwatch is another MOBA played like an FPS.

Its going to be as much a waste of time as getting a halfhour ban while you go and do something way more enjoyable and your score is exactly the same.See this is why Valve needs to try and make personal score affect ranking in some way. If youre absolutely carrying your team and you still lose because the other five people dont do jack shit you shouldnt go down a rank. Likewise if you win but you didnt get any kills didnt do any healing didnt cap anything and didnt even get an assist? Your rank should not go up.,tf2,d0svu9c,2,t5_2qka0

6910050,0,t1_d0z682e,Good comment man. I would like to add something. The level we see the pros play at thats the meta that will be established at the high highest ranks in comp. These are the games that should set the meta. If the highest ranks can go sniper or demo or engine and roll a round or make it impossible to lose at least then changes should be made. But how will those changes affect the lower ranks? Ill be honest this idea of mine made a lot more sense like one minute ago when I started typing and Ive lost my train of thought. Basically the meta at the lowest rank will be insane and weird only limited by limitations. The higher ranks will be the real meta real comp with the real balances. Will the mean low ranks will be imbalanced? Can a pro take advantage of something like the direct hit that most new players cant use well? Does any of this make sense or should I take a nap ,tf2,d0zkoy5,7,t5_2qka0

6933406,0,t1_d12872v,ProjectilesgtProjectiles unlike hitscan bullets do not travel instantaneously across the map but rather at a preset speed differing depending on the projectile and are often subject to engine physics. Projectiles use a large hitbox shared by all classes to judge contact the same as that used by melee weapons other players and the environment. The damage of a projectile is usually determined by the distance the target is from the attacker upon collision or alternatively from the spot said attacker was at upon death. Many projectiles have unique properties which differ depending on the weapon. Projectiles are not affected by lag compensation. autotfwikibotrRequestABotcommentsmtcprequestanautowikibotfortheofficialteam by ukuilin,tf2,d1287f4,1,t5_2qka0

7145740,0,t1_d1qe4zy,It would disallow something scouts do better than anyone else and thats capturing objectives. In pubs as we all know hardly anyone actually plays the objective talking about valve pubs they just casually waltz by it enough times that it ends up being captured. Meanwhile in MM and comp youre there to play seriously and if youre playing scout capping points aside from flanking and getting picks is one of your top priorities and if suddenly can only cap a point as fast as a slow ass heavy or literally any other class not running the pain train well if that isnt a deterrent to use the critacola Im not sure what is. Plus if you think about it in a way it gives even more reason to use the paintrain on demo and soldier to help compensate for a scout running critacola on your team.Essentially this would be more of a fix for the critacola in official MM than it would be in pubs since having balanced weapons in the official competitive format is far more important than the often goofy and silly environment that is pub servers.,tf2,d1qe930,-6,t5_2qka0

7150609,0,t1_d1qvpj5,Thats not a real downside. Sometimes youll be hitting people with your melee weapon anyway even if it was the Bonesaw. For example on urgent last point holds in enclosed spaces or when ambushed by a Spy who failed to stab you.And in this case the Ubersaw is just rewarding the Medic massively for what he was already going to be doing anyway.Medic has  movement speed. Hes the second best class in the game when it comes to hitting people with a melee weapon. Sure survivability is an issue due to low HP but if your main aim is just to hit someone so you can pop an Uber immediately its not difficult to catch up you outpace every other class but Scout.Medics getting saws is a rare occurrence against good players sure. But when they do it changes the course of whole games. And thats why OP is suggesting a slightly bigger downside than .s swing speed for that powerful ability.Edit What do you know downvotes.

I began playing around  hours but a sizeable amount of those hours were spent playing jump maps because they were fun. I dont actually recommend competitive play to everyone. Its not for everyone!

7286707,0,t1_d26fdh1,In my experience matchmaking just means putting in a room that needs another player. CoD and Halo have ranking systems that goes up as you play just as a way of keeping track of how long youve played. It never had any effect on who you played with or was a very reliable method of judging skill. One of the Halos I cant remember which Reach maybe? had a TrueSkill system that went along side whatever rank you got with experience. This system quantified your skill based on how well you did in every match and it would go up and down. The game would try and match you with players of similar TrueSkill ranking but it often bogged down the process and took so long to find rooms that people stopped playing. So that was taken out in future installments. To my knowledge thats the only game to actually matchmake based on skill. ,tf2,d26g74z,2,t5_2qka0

7422298,0,t3_4gy38h,I know Medievals a silly gamemode that doesnt really warrant getting upset about but those stairs in combination with the ammo pack below them just allow trickstabbing DR Spies on BLU to do the same tired routine over and over.Feign death pick up ammo pack run upstairs bait RED to chase you trickstab or fall down behind them from the upper ledges feign again pick up the ammo pack thats five feet away run up the stairs again...rinse and repeat its literally doing the same routine on a tiny space over and over often with no way to die as long as you manage to keep picking up that ammo pack. Which isnt hard when youve got a huge damage resist invisibility speed boost and no way for most enemy classes to deny you that ammo.Really grating Id remove that ammo pack that allows them to keep doing that forever. I understand its a meleeonly mode and youll always have DR Spies practicing matador stabs out in the open but at least theres no ammo packs outside and they cant always stay alive indefinitely.But BLU spies that manage to get past the courtyard and up those stairs then proceed to camp the same tiny space for ages with no desire to cap or do anything else... annoying and lame as fuck.If youre on RED try picking that ammo pack up as often as possible as a SniperMedic to deny them feign death fuel or try and bodyblock those stairs to prevent them from going up them always a good laugh when theyre trapped in the courtyard.

7437950,0,t1_d2nmsa7,Actually yeah. Battlefield has always had a huge focus on large scale combat IIRC excluding Planetside  Battlefield has had the largest maps and largest player capacity having  times or more than most FPSes on the market at their max. Its also arguably more skilled based than CoD and also has a huge focus on destruction with Bad Company  having almost every part of its maps destructible. Battlefield has also had a class system for quite a while as well. Dont forget that Battlefield also has like fifty different vehicles.Im not saying theyre polar opposites but CoD is significantly lower in scale and arguably skill compared to BF.,tf2,d2nnaq1,3,t5_2qka0

7440689,0,t1_d2mu0n5,Demolition Casual and Competitive both have mediumlong respawn times medium for demo mediumlong for casual and long for comp if you die at the start of the round but you should only be dying at the start of the round once every  rounds. If youre dying too soon and too often the best advice I can give is to focus on the fundamentals of shooting stop burst jitterstep stop burst rinse repeat and to not play quite as aggressively. Either use your nades to help yourself out or take more conservative positions. Demolition is v on a small map and Casual and Competitive are v and v respectively on a midsizedlarge map depending on which one you play and all have the same mechanics of either kill all enemies or blow updefuse the bomb.

7446976,0,t3_4hajfh,Any SpySniper loadout is good provided you have a Huntsman but Ill hate you forever for using those classes in medieval.Pyro benefits largely from the Backscratchers bonus and the Powerjack can be decent since the speed will help you in melee combat. Sharpened Volcano Fragment isnt that useful even in this mode since theres an incredible amount of medkits lying around from dead players.Soldier is great with any banner but my favorite is the Battalions Backup. Since random crits are such a huge factor in melee combat making your entire team critimmune can be a huge gamewinner. As for melee the whips ridiculous range is nice when fighting enemy players and if you slap a teammate beforehand the speed bonus will most certainly help. Zatoichi can be good if an enemy is using it but its a doubleedged sword. On one hand if you hit them first thats a free kill health and a charged banner. On the other the weapon does not have random crits and you can be oneshot yourself. Equalizer is bad but can be fairly humorous.The Holiday Punch is ridiculous if you feel youre getting random crits all the time. You can stun an entire point if you get lucky and youll probably secure your team a round if you do it. KGB is for godmoding your way through the point by killing everything in sight before they have a chance to retaliate.Milk on Scout is obvious as a musthave but the Guillotine can be useful sometimes as its a free damagebleed ranged attack. Sandman is great for being a jerk and the fish can help you detect DR spies. Fan o War if you dont feel like killing anything but want to help your team destroy a particular target such as a banner soldier or a medic.Thats all Ive got. I hope Medieval doesnt overrun the other modes  Ive hardly seen special deliveryplayer destruction and when Im in those two modes someone usually calls to change to Degroot.

Then it was patched to cost  if you deleted a projectile and  if you didnt.Then quite a bit later it was briefly the dumbest weapon in the game firing for  metal regardless and deleting all projectiles for free.THEN it was given the penalty of costing more for each projectile that you experienced.Now it can M for  metal or it can delete for  allowing it to be the stupid one everyone enjoyed running around zapping FP heavies with and a somewhat balanced version of its original effect.The best use of it Ive found is to allow you to stay on a cart deleting spam as it comes in and even if its not all of it it can be a significant amount.  roller or sticky versus ?

The practical effects of stringing together very long chains of jumps or bombing in a la a s match is debatable at best in a public environment. The shear extra mobility is nice but I find Ive always used it more to escape shitty situations than in any offensive capacity. Because of the unpredictable nature of pub players the lack of meta holds and the lack of emphasis on bombingsaccing the use of the gunboats as an offensive weapon is hard to achieve. Conversely the shotgun actually works better in pubs than in s. In s youll very rarely survive more than a v and even that is a pretty rough challenge. In pubs taking on   or  vs  scenarios and walking away isnt uncommon. The extra ammo of the shotgun starts to actually come in handy as well as the presence of pyros and the . chance one of them is good making hitscan fucking nice. So yeah learn where health packs are play more passively and focus on taking drawn out fights against multiple enemies and the shotgun actually becomes way better than gunboatsgunboats are more fun tho people see my speedshots and disconnect in fear,tf2,d2u0w0s,2,t5_2qka0

7526202,0,t1_d2xg0z2,Its mostly because Overwatch has a much greater emphasis on teamwork and class balance than TF does. One sniper alone in TF can suppress an entire team if they were skilled enough. One Widowmaker in Overwatch cant stop an entire team. Genji can deflect attacks DVa can block them Mei can build a wall to obscure Widowmakers line of sight plus the tank classes such as Zarya and Roadhog who can sponge damage and Reinhardt who is the tankiest character in game.The difference between Snipers in TF and Overwatch is that in Overwatch having a long range advantage over enemies isnt as big of an advantage towards certain classes.

I love both for different reasons and Im not condescendingly mocking any competitive format. s is more entertaining fastpaced and easy to watch but HL also exploits the capabilities of each class and how every class can work with each other as well as allowing everyone to play their favorite class without being that one guy who sits on last.Someones gonna say HL is repetitive its not wrong but s is definitely repetitive as well.

Im on my phone atm but once I get home Ill be able to answer fully.I got that scorching casemaker for cheap but I paid enough and didnt lie in the conversation to justify it to not be called a shark. As far as how I felt about it? No remorse whatsoever. He got items he liked I got something I liked. He also made a big profit if you fact in that it likely cost him only a few keys to get the hat in the first place. When this happens with no manipulation or lying whatsoever trades can be done regardless of price imo. Convo logs can be found hereOutpost rules state you must pay a bare minimum of  of an items value in order for it to classify it as a shark if they have less than  hours. This guy had less than that meaning Id have to pay  or below to have that accusation have any weight.Lets just say I could have done worse but I paid what I felt was more than comfortable over the rule. Definitely my best deal in forever.,tf2,d3erevt,1,t5_2qka0

So because of that lack of serious stuff rules are naturally more lax but the moment the update lands anything not update the update wont be able to compete at all with the actual discussion.

7873910,0,t3_4n3ypo,No its not. A lot of people on pubs however will think that the only secondary a Heavy should have is a Sandvich or Dalokohs bar mainly because its the Heavy meta in Highlander. Even if theyve never actually played Heavy and arent in competitive these people will get salty and treat you like shit if you try to carryuse a shotgun even though a shotgun is a completely and perfectly viable option for Heavy.But Heavy has the minigun its like a huge automatic shotgun he doesnt need a shotgun as a secondary! some people will argue. Those people are idiots because the minigun has some huge downsides compared to the shotgun. The fact that they all have revup time is a big one and another is the fact that you slow way down to use it which essentially makes you a giant sitting duck. If youre alone youre fucked and even if your team is with you you can still be fucked in a pub because most Valve server players are really shitty and dont know how to work as a team. Taking a shotgun along is good for people getting used to Heavy or just anyone whose team is too stupid to help them and watch their back.

My yo GTX  can max out the game.The artstyle of TF is cartoon so they will never add some shinny shaders.It sure lacks of props and thats most likely the reason why people complain about the graphics but in the end you cant say it look gross.Keep in mind that the game is yo in case you didnt realized TF team recently updated a lot of cosmetics and it looks like they are not done yet so they are trying to improve the visuals of TF.Anyway Im here for the gameplay not for graphics.Add some props and warm colors and voila  ,tf2,d4eil3a,1,t5_2qka0

8080650,0,t3_4pw82q,Okay this is the last beta so Im going to dump my hot sticky load of feedback here and now. Valve needs to find more ways to fight abandoners. Now rather than simply leaving in pre game theyre leaving in the middle or towards the end. One way to help with the latter would be to make abandons considered a win for the enemy team but not a loss for yours if youre already one full round in. STOP FUCKING MATCHING ME TO SERVERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET! At least make sure most of the people attending are from said region! A lot of settings are locked for no reason. Valve should blacklist settings as necessary rather than allowing a select few via whitelist. Make good settings default such as max FOV and quickswitch. Those are both practically necessary to playing the game seriously in any capacity.EDIT And  Make it register abandons more accurately I cant tell you how many matches Ive lost because the game didnt register a player disconnecting as an abandon. Im aware theres a grace period but they were gone the whole match. I dont know what it is with the weird connection failures where youre forced to abandon but it desperately needs to be fixed along with the other random reasons why you cant join. So damn many hackers. We are in desperate need of a counterstrikelike overwatch system and some form of paywall on matchmaking even if its as small as only allowing premium players.

Ive said in another comment maybe Im just on at the wrong times maybe the competitive update will reignite the community again. Also I got it wrong.  hours for  years. Riiight before the uber update. Almost  hours is quite a lot for me considering job school and other life. No other games of mine even come close. I was talking about GMOD in a negative light. Going on any public GMOD server is hell. I dont want TF to be like that. Same with CSGO which is a better comparison.I will come back on after the comp update and hopefully this post will be completely unnecessary for me.One thing I want to say is I know Im not the only one who thinks this. Not in a long shot. Im seeing posts and videos left and right talking about who killed TF so many people obviously think its dead. Most TF youtubes quit a year ago.

Now they update the game like CSGO where its just microtransactions that revolve around the competitive scene and some game balance stuff here and there.P.S.

8186826,0,t1_d505dxd,Halos current numbers seem to hint that they only bought the dieing comp scene some time but you are also ignoring a key issue halo is a console title that costs roughly  per player so microsoft by sponsoring a  million dollar tournament is actually profitable to a degree so they can actually make there money back to continue developing and promoting the game because a growing esports scene means more people play and more copies of halo  sold.Now If valve invested money in tf and attracted more players they would get.... pretty much nothing because tf is fp and there is no competitive edge to be gained by purchasing anything within tf. This is also probably why dotas prize pools are fueled by its own microtransactions and not straight out of valves bank account.Sure valve could host a tournament but with little to no advertisement promotion or awareness outside the tf community beforehand it would almost certainly be more than its worth to valve in terms of profit thats why valve seems to spend more time on weapon skins crates and campeigns because they are easy profit its not that difficult and costly to pick some hats out of the workshop and slap some textures on a weapon and they know that the whales will eat them up regardless.

The conch would take away heavys main weakness slow movememt and give him a passive sandvich and health by shooting which would allow him to soak as much damage as he wants to.     The buff banner would be straight up stupid since minicrits dont have damage falloff. Imagine getting sniped by a heavy with his minigun from a mile away.     The battalions backup would be op as well. With a medic up your arse you would essentially have  health and critical immunity with the banner active. Now imagine this paired with crits or even a quick fix and you would be invulnerable except for spies I guess.     Even though this sounds like Im completely against this idea I actually like it a lot.

8219425,0,t1_d54pvqk,gt Every other update seems to introduce another predatory money grabIts worth noting that this is what turned a lot of people including myself away from Smite. In season   there was the oddessy event that put a lot of exclusive skins into the game skins that could be bought for a limited time during the event and then could only be gotten through chest rolls also included was a bunch of limited edition collection bonuses that were really cool and the event was deemed a success. Then Season  last year rolls around and half way through we got an event called summer of smite that basically functioned as a mini oddessy and was to raise tournament money again deemed a success. We also got a season  oddessy which had some drama over some skins not looking too great but it was generally considered to be successful. Had it remained just these  events per year things wouldve been fine but shit really hit the fan this year with season .At the start of season  we got the rising dawn event to celebrate the release of the japanese pantheon it had a good reception as it was seen as something worth doing an event over. Then about a month or two later we got yet another event called escape from the underworld which was passed off to be a springeaster event but really had nothing to do with either of those things. Then about a month later we got yet another event called viking invasion which apparently had something to do with dreamhack but by now weve caught on that its just cash grabbing. And now the second  summer of smite has released and seems to be purely about generating hi rez money. Basically if TF were to get more frequently updated it would not be hard for them to go down this route which is something to be feared as these events often give you nothing to enjoy if you dont foot the bill. also sorry for rambling at you about smite for  paragraphs.,tf2,d54zfq6,1,t5_2qka0

8234460,0,t1_d56u0o8,You got eyes on you mate? Didnt you see the other threads saying that they want pubs back? Why did you feel you need to create yet another one? BECAUSE I WANT MY OPINION TO BE THE LOUDEST thats why. People who love the update arent going to create repetitive threads about it they are going to be busy playing it. And this is where you annoyed me. You couldve sent your letter quietly but instead you decided to create YET ANOTHER thread where the same people say the same things. I guess the best I can do is send a letter to the tf team as well. Casual was released in a broken state cant argue. But lets imagine it was released in a working state people able to choose any map and join within  seconds. Pretty much what the old pubs were eh? If it came out like that it wouldve placated a lot of people. Casual is pubs now. Its still  v  you can play whatever the fuck you want and you dont affect other peoples rank if you fuck around because there is no rank! XP is a fun little addition there is no actual benefits to it. Have you played casual yet? No one said that they must win because of XP or leveling up. I am yet to see people talk about XP and leveling as if it is an actual incentive. Have you seen a lot of it? People just try to play their best and thats really the biggest most positive change. People didnt try to play the game and that what was broken and in a way this update helped to improve on this. I dont think you understand how big and positive THIS change is. When people didnt try to play the objectives it just stagnated into boredom.The casual mode has no strings attached.This has nothing to do with comp. The problem with having both is that the tf player base is TOO fucking SMALL. Did you ever play past  PM on a weekday? You wouldve seen that a lot of the more niche modes and less popular maps like Freight really struggled to get populated and you would play with a not entirely full population on the server. So now we have people going into comp some into mvm some into community servers some into casual and you want to divide the small population further into valve pubs. That simply wont work we dont have enough players. that would create hellish queue times. We arent csgo  we cant pull that off. And btw they did say they would remove the penalty so you can leave casual as you want as well. ,tf2,d56v2tw,2,t5_2qka0

Obviously. I never claimed otherwise. I know what someone means when they say yall aint got none too. Doesnt make it correct. Im tired of hearing people say that Valve removed PUBs. This is part of the narrative problem I was talking about. You say the removed the pubs just because dicking around and not playing the game is a noticeably less attractive option in the pubs as if thats what made it a pub. As if thats what defined the pub experience. And that attitude is precisely what the problem was that lead to all this.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspValve did not remove pubs. Valve made pubs more competitive.gtWhen there were Valve pubsampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThere still are Valve pubs. Theyre just more competitive.gtthey were always full so by saying there is no demand to them you are talking out of your ass again.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspI never said theres no demand. Maybe you should reread what youre replying to. I said that if the demand is so high you shouldnt have any trouble standing up more community servers. I said get together a community have everyone pitch in a buck. I said that if you do that  if you put together a community for all those deposed players outside the US get them to pitch in a buck and you still cant stand up some servers? Then the demand really isnt all that high.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspIve been donating  a month to Firepower so I could play in a somewhat competitive pub environment.gtNo one ever called for that to be removed Valve didnt have to remove them.

Of course this is his purpose...when I mean playstyle I mean another way to do this. Pyro is cool Ill say but I do think part of the reason heits winning is because plenty of nbs are just favoring himit because heit is naturally the one of the easier classes to learn and play at least when it comes to just pressing W and and holding down M. Of course I dont think all pyro players are bad...you certainly seem to be a respectable person and having an unusual just kinda shows you arent new to this. Heavy has a fair share of obnoxious players too Ill say. Pyros gotten the Pyromania update though with a couple new things from that so I thought Heavy kind of deserved it.

8271484,0,t1_d5awv58,My heart dropped the day they released the notes for the update. I read the bit about removing pubs in favor of casual and I couldnt understand the celebrating. I hate being called bandwagon for saying this because Ive thought it from day .Im trying to give the update a chance. I really am. I played casual again today. Queue time wasnt that bad i guess. Then its snowycoast. I hate that map. Fine Ill do it real quick. Oh hey we almost won! Got to the last ramp! Next round they push to third cap faster than we did and boom its just over. No chance for a hero defense no chance to actually win from behind. Not to mention that the teams were pretty badly unbalanced skill not numbers but not so much that it was a quick death. I just wanted out but I didnt want to get penalized not sure if they removed those yet or are just planning to and again trying to give it a chance. Then at the end of all of that I dont even get exp for my rank... I cant even comfortably play my main anymore scout because unless youre actually good at it Im not that good in general youre mostly deadweight on a team. The whole atmosphere of the games is different and I fucking hate it. If I want that environment Ill play Overwatch. Seriously OW is x better at the casually competitive games. TF just isnt that for me and i cant enjoy it.Im also sick of people saying that my concerns are irrelevant because of community servers. Aside from the oftcited mountains of trash servers most community servers I play on have either serverside lag or are inconveniently placed for me to play on them not to mention the awkward populating and lack of map variety since theres now a divide between most people in casual and the few who venture into community servers. And theyre fucking hard to find if youre like me and not used to working the server browser. I only have  hours into the game which I know makes me casual or whatever but dammit I love this game too and I dont like what they did to it. They mangled the part I found the most fun. I was psyched for comp so I could try it when I was feeling tryhardy but now I cnat even open the damn game anymore without just feeling sad. If community servers miraculously manage to deliver the same experience as old pubs Ill return but even fixing casual mode wont be enough for me. Its just makes it a different game entirely.,tf2,d5bhtbq,1,t5_2qka0

Simple. Soldier is designed as a generalist. This doesnt mean that he should be overpowered hes not but simply that he should be good at almost everything. His toolkit as is currently is fine for this purpose. Soldier is designed and balanced well simply because he has a low skill floor and a very high skill ceiling. This means that terrible soldiers like me with only a grasp of very basic RJing can do reasonably well but good soldiers i.e. highly accomplished RJers etc can do extremely well. This is good game design not bad.EDIT jesus fuck wtf is with the changes to the black boxgtBuilds a damage charge for a special attackSpecial attack is a heat seeking rocket right click and hold while aiming at a target for  seconds then the next rocket fired will chase after them.Heat seeking rocket will only travel in the air for  seconds then explode.Heat seeking rocket can be redirected with a flair.stats replace current oneswhy tho its literally a straight upgrade,tf2,d5d86jp,12,t5_2qka0

I mean the more extreme way to look at this is having different systems and outside sources are also unfair but this is uncontrollable outside of lan tournaments Honestly the only time where fps limiting makes sense is in tournament environments to me. But my definition of competitive is to minimize differences in hardware amp software to compare how well the player can do with the given software. Yes to answer the question looking for anyway to increase your fps is equivalent to cheating in a competitive environment.

If he uses them to try and escape hes as fast as the pyro but he still presents a large target and if hes seen anything that hits him will negate falloff damage cause of minicrits and he will most likely die.

8335773,0,t1_d5j6wq4,gt So can Medic and your estimations are based on very optimistic assumptions about how good a person is at aiming syringes.Theres a much larger area within which a Medic can achieve his maximum DPS because he doesnt need to be hugging the enemy. Lets face it in MvM unless youre a Sniper aim doesnt really matter from a DPS point of view. You cant miss giants and tanks and a missed shot against one robot will likely hit another. You dont realise that the Pyro has a huge damagefalloff  range ratio. You obviously cant be within hugging distance all the time so your DPS suffers.gt Sniper does have incredibly high DPS but its much more skilldependent.Im sorry I thought we were talking about players who werent mentally defective. Of course if were talking about the lowest of the low then a Pyro will be more effective than a Sniper but if a Sniper can aim reasonably well in MvM which isnt hard you fire every . seconds missed headshots can still penetrate and trigger a headshot and headshots stun robots in a large radius making them easy to kill then a Sniper is far more effective than a Pyro could ever be.gt First youre assuming that the Sniper is being buffed  of the time.Getting a buff banner charge is trivial  rockets. credits in nothing on the Big Rock missions Caliginous Caper and the second half of Empire Escalation and Bavarian Botbash.gt it entirely depends on the aid of a Soldier. Its not a single class doing the damage on its own.Its perfectly reasonable to send the Soldier after the tank particularly if  he is using the beggars. Its not as if the Soldiers only used as a buff banner generator. He deals damage as well. Hes not doing anything that he wouldnt already be doing were there no Sniper.Hitting multiple targets at once with a Pyro only works at very close range if the robots are bunched up together in which case the Heavys  projectile penetration could do a better job. The Pyro is indeed like a combination of the Heavy and Scout yet does neither of those classes jobs very well. He needs specific bandaid unlocks like in PvP in order to be viable because hes an inferior class. The one and only disadvantage of the Scout in MvM is that he had little AoE power which to an extent can be offset by having very good aim and oneshotting robots onebyone. As well as having the largest health of any class he has amazing tank DPS giant DPS has the burst damage to oneshot  classes has the mobility to completely avoid damage whilst simultaneous dealing damage and provides a lot of support with mad milk and the fan. The Heavy can withstand huge amounts of firepower whilst dishing out just as much and from a distance where he can retreat if necessary. Hes a godlike giantkiller very good robot  killer and average tankkiller. Then we have the Pyro whos a very good tankkiller and average at killing robots and giants.gt Lay low for a few seconds until some of the bots aggro something else.Thats the problem with Pyro from a DPS perspective he cant always be dealing damage and when he does hes average at it. As any other class one can almost always dish out damage.gt In spite of all youve said Pyro is the only class Ive ever seen break  damage on Botbash. So it must have SOME use.Anecdotal evidence doesnt prove anything. Being on a team with dribblers one could die over and over again and still do massive amounts of damage if his teammates are doing the bare minimum. That same Pyro could probably have done  damage as a beggars Soldier.But as Ive said before its ok that hes an average class because any team of  players with half a functioning brain can complete any mission except Mannslaughter which requires  of a brain with ease so to an extent it doesnt really matter whether one runs inferior setups.Btw I cba replying with long messages explaining why pyro is the inferior class so dont expect any more responses.

You can see because the dev team even said it here.This is why listen servers are always set to .

Fire is useful for hitandrun tactics and for weakening or finishing off an opponent if the damage from the weapon alone is not enough to kill them. This allows attackers to score kills even while dead as the fire damage may finish off a wounded opponent.autotfwikibotrRequestABotcommentsmtcprequestanautowikibotfortheofficialteam by ukuilin,tf2,d5vv6m3,1,t5_2qka0

What you do is you both equip Uber saw and heal until you both get Uber.  One person then ubers the other medic who then starts meleeing with the uber saw.  As soon as the uber is about to run out they switch and the one whos meleeing starts healing and ubers.Basically while one of their ubers is being used the other is restoring theirs with the uber saw.  The reason why its strong is if you have a constant source of melee targets and nobody is just running away you can effectively both be invincible forever.  The problem stems from that as soon as you dont have enough melee targets and you both run out of uber you become extremely weak and easy to kill.,tf2,d62v6rp,2,t5_2qka0

8560192,0,t1_d6biqhp,gt You moonball aka shoot it very very high and itll land somewhere in the enemy choke. I cant say Ive had this happen to me in s since its banned lol but before season  in highlander Ive seen this used in lobbies a lot and its really dumb to enter a midfight and get moonballed and going ok well I guess Im not playing this roundIts a oneinamillion hail mary shot that by definition the Scout cant follow up on.gt The power of the sandman is that you arent the sniper youre the scout. Trying to compare the pick ability of a sniper to a scout from a distance is of course going to be skewed in favor of the sniper thats kind of the point of the sniper class. The fact that sandman gives the scout the potential of a long ranged pick and can be compared to sniper in this way should send up red flags everywhere.The effective range of the Sandman requires that the Scout operate outside of his intended range. Hes neutering himself with a nuanced playstyle that has no pick potential at all without a teammate to specifically follow up on to a lesser effect.gt Are you trying to argue that because the enemy scout switched to the sandman a melee unlock that the enemy medic now has to play as if the other team has a sniper? That the presence of a switched unlock is enough to completely change the enemy medics playstyle?gt I suppose we could agree to disagree here but I seriously dont think one unlock should affect positioning that much.It would be a bad TF player in general who didnt accommodate the loadout choices of the other team. What are you supposed to do if they switch to kritz go Oh well just keep trucking and ignore it?gt A single medic pick at MID means that your team will probably wipe them since they dont have heals. You cap mid and second for free and you now have very large uber ad to push last with which usually leads to a round win assuming like i said you dont fuck up somewhere which of course could happen but is a separate point entirely.Youre making a lot of baseless assumptions that the Scout can hit the Medic that the Medic is on the frontline that the Medics team cant protect him that the Scouts team can force the pick that the Medics team wont retreat that the Scouts team will be able to push uncontested that the Scouts Medic will be able to hold uber that the Medics team cant make a pick etc etc.You cant just knock up something so contrived with so many intricate variables and point to one tiny possible variable to conclude that its inclusion makes the whole thing wrong.gt Youre right that a single frag doesnt automatically guarantee a midfight but immediately stunning a player means essentially you are down  v  right off the bat which is miles worse than if after an extended midfight you lose one player. Starting out a midfight a player down is quite a different scenario from losing a player around halfway through the midfight.At the very most a stun is seven seconds long. If a team cant delay engagement around a defensive choke far enough from mid to get the necessary stun distance for that long then it doesnt really matter what the Scout was using because theyd most likely end up winning anyway.gt Youre also greatly overestimating the pistol. Most invite scouts do not have higher than around  pistol accuracy and a lot of prem scouts think hafficool and i think starkie as well? not totally sure use winger over the pistol on maps other than granary because pistol is just so unreliable with the random spread and whatnot. Even clockwork used the winger often when he played.The pistol how its used in the stale meta or the fully explored potential of the pistol in a meta where more flexible strategies are appreciated? The Winger is picked more because it offers greater utility with its access to more flank routes they both have the same approximate ability to harass at range and clean up low health enemies.gt What I mean by optimum playstyle with the sandman is that you literally pretend it doesnt exist except in stalemates where you have opportunities to just shoot and pray or entering midfights where you can again shoot and pray. Just basically situations where you have downtime you can shoot the ball every other situation you pretend you dont have it.So in situations where A teams are stalemated for whatever reason B the Scout isnt poking the flank C the other team isnt taking advantage of the weak flank presence D the rest of the flank isnt forcing a pick E the combo is out in the open F the Scout avoids every other situation where he pretends not to have  health then its optimal?gt My point is that it is possible to hit things with the sandman and even probable on some maps with very narrow chokes and open areas think snakewater mid. Obviously there are many variables but it is hard to deny that it is in some way shape or form an immediate advantage that your team possesses upon entering mid. The weapon is not reliable in the slightest Ill be the first to admit that its just that removing one player upon entering mid is SUCH a huge advantage in s and I think me and the majority of the competitive community believes that is not the type of potential a melee unlock should give to the scout.The Scouts ability to possibly shut down a single class for a few seconds is incredibly facile compared to a Demos ability to hold down a choke or even a Soldiers.If there was some form of public polling to substantiate that claim then that argument would have a whole lot more weight behind it. Anecdotal evidence isnt.,tf2,d6bln96,1,t5_2qka0

Just because your skin color is simular to somebody elses does not mean you are the same person and this might be my own opinion seeing how the interenet has evolved not playing a game because the characters are not divers enough is stupidt.

8690590,0,t1_d6rk2jx,Unfortunately you may just have to drop your team at least for now. Basically for the next little whilemaybe this entire yearyou need to figure out a groove for doing your schoolwork and extracurriculars. Once youve figured out how long that takes you each evening work in some pubs with friends if you have time. If you dont thats unfortunate but you can certainly take pride in your dedication to schoolwork. You may have time for TF on weekends. If you do end up with enough time for pubs each night figure out if you can fit in scrims instead and reform your team. Be sure that they know there will be nights that you simply cant play due to homework load as there will probably be for everyone. Try to grab a few substitutes for that purpose and see if you can get everyone moderately familiar with multiple classes. If that ends up falling through dont worry about it. Organizing anything at any time is hard so if youre able to regularly play pubs thats a worthy achievement on its own. You should be focusing on your schoolwork. Thats the right thing to do. If youre seriously taking all advanced classes and just regular math then it sounds to me like youre doing fine. You can always improve yourself and get to that higher level of math next year so have hope and work hard for it. If you want TF stuff for your birthday then get TF stuff for your birthday. Video games are a perfectly reasonable form of relaxation. If you find your parents disapproving you can turn off the blood and gore and perhaps explain that games arent really violence so much as they are a gentlemans competitionthere isnt any death or killing in TF only challenging your opponents to be better. Hopefully that helps. Life is an endless ocean of mystery and unforeseen consequences all we have is each other. ,tf2,d6rya6l,2,t5_2qka0

8718656,0,t1_d6vgnhw, off is a normal price for quick buying Unusuals  keys off a  key hat is  off. So I had a guy approach me with his  key hat and offered it to me for  keys I accepted. I then turned around and found a guy that offered  keys on it and might want to buy it for that price? Is that shady? No. He approached me and gave me a price which I accepted. The same happened with you you gave him a price which he accepted and he made another item offer. You could have just taken the pure and gone on your way but no you have to accuse some innocent trader of sharking. Is this touching on the fact of defending quick buying enough for you?I am just sick of toxic shits exploding on innocent people for no reason. Classic response is what does that make you? Someone who is going after one of those toxic shits that is what it makes me. ,tf2,d6vgzt6,8,t5_2qka0

8787138,0,t1_d73v76j,So you see the writings on the walls then. TF is great I love it. But Im always surprised at the community here when they complain Why doesnt Valve do more for its nearly  year old game and less for the one that has a thriving esports community. The answer is in the question.Look at this right quickIn the last week during i TF has had a max of a little less than k concurrent players. If you look at the more in depth data thats almost double what its been. We can agree thats a lot of players though.In the same time period DotA a game I dont play and honestly dont like had . Million concurrent players. There hasnt been a month in  that the concurrent player count for DotA has been under a million.Businesses do not make business decisions based on whether or not something is profitable. They make the decision on whether or not something is more profitable than other things that could be done with the same investment. Valve is a slightly different company than many conventional ones but even if people are choosing which product theyre wanting to improve or invest in theyre going to often be drawn to the one thats newer more likely to be in the news and has a larger player base.So it makes a lot of sense to invest  into a cosplay contest that promotes the game thats currently their hot shit over investing it in  for the best players in the entire world from  continents keep in mind that theres more than  continents in the entire world  although the best in the world may be from these  continents.,tf2,d742dhn,55,t5_2qka0

Whereas when its on Pyro its simply MQM watch people die.In the end The Reserve Shooter needs a balance between the classes that would end up making it a Pyro focused weapon amp a tricky gimmick for Soldier which it should not be considering it was released as a Soldier Shotgun.ORThe Reserve Shooter should be split into  weapons like the Equaliser was.

8844337,0,t1_d7asryr,Degroot I know some users who play on high ping that swear off medieval immediately apparently with gt ping australians mostly melee is a ridiculous gamble. Kinda defeating the point of the gamemode unfortunately. Nucelus I agree mostly  the spawn camping on some koth matches I saw were maybe over the top? The arenanucleus version however is amazing Id wager not many people remember it but arena mode is great when teams can split apart but  minute into the round the cp brings the remaining players closer together  in this case physically with bridges that span the death pit!I watched your top  worst maps list as well it confuses me a little that you rank goldrushdustbowl so low when it seems you prioritise people focusing on the objective together without wandering astray. Maybe is that for you the gameplay experiences get stale too quickly? I guess comparatively I like those experiences because I mained Demoman Soldier and HWG for a long time each  which resonate well in spam. I also think doomsday has some essence of good gameplay but maybe that teams dont tend to hang around in an area long enough that you feel teamplay ever comes about. Or maybe if it does its right at the end when the rocket launches off ending the round instantly.. I wonder if it took multiple rocket launches and a new rocket ejected out of the ground into the holder that rounds might feel bettermore balanced or would that be too repetitive.Also I like Watergate also but I feel like at the moment it has some small issues like sentry placements at mid sometimes dominating the area or sometimes it seems one team will shut out the scores completely. On KOTH maps sometimes the timer gets shut out also I mean where one team gets their clock to zero when the other team hasnt even capped once but KOTH map rounds are also about half as short  minutes on average compared to PDs  minutes probably meaning that the objective feels less important. Maybe also DM in KOTH is less important I got some feedback on WG that people sometimes liked when they could be stupid and go demoknight when minisentries are on the field and that dying didnt feed the enemy team as much. So I made watergate and there should be an update in the development pipeline at valve that hopefully will fix some of these issues. One of the changes is that when a team leads in scores their spawn times will then become double that of the trailing team   seconds vs  seconds spawn times are regularly always  seconds. This is what KOTH does. I can make it more exaggerated later if need be but I wanted to see what would happen with this change first among others of course. ,tf2,d7aypjw,1,t5_2qka0

Not to mention that many Sniper Rifles would have to be rebalanced  the Sydney Sleeper would be unable to burst jarate the Bazaar Bargain would be a complete downgrade and the Classic becomes a straight upgrade from stock.Plus nonSMG secondaries would go from frequent use to neverused since  damage pointblank every . seconds is pitiful at closerange and with no mobility options using your Primary in anywhere but longdistance goes from somewhat of a hailmary to just killbind itll be faster.Also the change would strongly encourage the boring style of Sniper where you sit scoped forever because thats the only way youll be able to oneshot anyone.

You can copy paste that into the url bar and it will take you to the router password screen most of the time some routers are weird and the default username and password is admin password. Doesnt work for ALL routers but you can just look up your router.. See above router settings can change your IP from dynamic to static and vice versa. Just google how to change to dynamic ip. Generally your IP is dynamic by default and to change your IP address you can just reset your router.. ISP  Internet Service Provider IE the person you are buying your internet access from.

Casual is meant to be taken for fun still though I would had preferred quickplay to stay so these critrelated moments can cause this unexpected joy and unexpected rage I admit from a casual experience.Random crits may had been a bad way to produce this effect but its what we have what weve had and by now what Im used to having and Id hate to see them go away from the current casual way of playing the game.,tf2,d7rjcq9,2,t5_2qka0

At distances above  I think hammer units projectiles like rockets travel towards where the crosshair was pointed.It has nothing to do with the viewmodel itself as if that were the case projectiles would not just appear from the right of the crosshair but they would originate further down under the crosshair.

9135540,0,t3_55cexf,Honestly I have great gamesense on just about every class but zero mechanical skill as any class. I still bump walls as scout I cant rocketjump even though I know HOW to perform ctaps and syncjumps air pogoing is for wizards I cant airblast to save my life and I cant aim at all in general.Im pretty decent at Heavy Medic Engineer and Spy to an extent as they require somewhat less mechanical skill and Im decent at corner and matador stabs as theyre more positioning than raw skill. I know how to fake uber I know great teleporter spots and Ive become desensitized to decloaks behind me as Heavy.,tf2,d89zv87,3,t5_2qka0

9143576,0,t3_55hd1f,It is probably the best Scout secondary but a must have? Most Scouts dont even use the freaking thing properly Support Scouts scoring  to  points in an entire mission is a good indicator that he isnt using milk very effectively. And most class balances you see these days benefit little from milk healing since there already is a Medic. I dont think there is an item you must have. Although the dead ringer comes very close. The slow down upgrade isnt really special on its own almost all classes have upgrades or weapons that can slow robots too.However there are some weapons you should NEVER use because they cripple a core function of a class. Like the huntsman no explosive headshots the direct hit big splash damage nerf etc.,tf2,d8b0i58,1,t5_2qka0

The tip is to let the gibus go first. Its more contribution to the team than can be done otherwise.Hey do you think there should be a score mechanic in tf that rewards damage tanking? Very vague but basically muscling out a lot of damage in a certain time period and surviving and being rewarded for that with score or maybe a temporary boost similar to the way random crits work with damage output.

When you start running them you start getting to know the issues faced by them and then you have ideas on how to improve the classes or the mapmode itself to make it more fun. The popular counter arguement is but this has already been tried  yeah in . The tf of then is wildly different from what it is now.

9594152,0,t3_5caofe,If using the Crossbow which you should be doing if you play noncombat medic you can speed up your heal rate by crossbowing a player before switching to your medigun and healing them. Prioritise your heal targets based on whos taking damage. If nobodys taking damage heal burned or lowhealth targets first. Heal multiple people. When not overhealing a player your ber rate is increased.Never push too far away from your team even if youre bered. Many a medic has blindly followed his pocket into battle ended up on the other side of the map from the rest of his team and gotten killed as soon as his ber wore off. Dont overextend unless youre confident in your pockets ability to wipe the other team.If surrounding teammates are all at high health always overheal the players who will be roaming the map away from you first roaming scouts and soldiers need as much of a buff as they can get.When bered stay in front of your pocket this allows you to block the knockback your pocket would be taking and allow him to easily take out your foes.Those are just a few tips.,tf2,d9vobxz,1,t5_2qka0

9609344,0,t3_5cm7sk,I have complained about this until I am blue in the face. In every single game there is an issue due to the games inability to fill empty player spots quickly enough resulting in imbalances of varying significance. Sadly this is just one issue since MYM. I can only assume the solution going back to what we had before MYM would constitute too great a change. They cant admit this was a poorly thought out poorly launched update which is killing this game. Perhaps there are no full time TF devs left. Perhaps they are all working on other projects. Perhaps TF was such a big success that there are still many players and the impact is inconsequential for them. Who knows but in all candor they are not treating like a game which matters.,tf2,d9xjqip,5,t5_2qka0

9626746,0,t3_5cuk2z,People in TF have gotten the wrong idea because the weapons we got that have had stunsslows are OP or have low counterplay.There is nothing inherently wrong with the concept of a stun or slow if it has intuitive counterplay is balanced from a weapon and class perspective and doesnt last too long.Unfortunately weapons in TF that bear stuns and slows have not done this. Natascha and Sandman have low counterplay being impossible and difficult to dodge respectively Sandman is overpowered as its stun outweighs the HP you lose and Nataschas slow is perpetual and stacks up rapidly from any distance while Sandmans stun can go as high as seven seconds.Some will tell you TF is based around movement abilities but this has little basis in fact and does not make stuns inherently bad. Pyro Heavy Engineer Sniper are all very low on movement abilities and Medic and Spy have other things as their focus too. Only threefour classes are really based around their movement. What Team Fortress  is really about is the differences between classes and how it makes an objectivebased game interesting. Interesting movement is the domain of only certain classes and the focus of the whole game is not movement.Since a stun or slow that has good counterplay and isnt imbalanced is difficult to implement though its better to just steer clear of them.As for people complaining about knockback nearly everything in TF exerts some form of it and always has its why juggling is possible. Those people need to get over it.,tf2,d9zp0j0,3,t5_2qka0

Dgt A Medic that is not healing is a pointless Medic this is why the Crossbow is dominating since you can heal with it.Exactly but... A dead Medic is also a Medic not healing which is a pointless Medic. DSure on paper the Crossbow may sound really nice being able to heal your teammates but... in public servers the amount of protection you have as a Medic is... very close to zero.I mean I only use my crossbow with my friends and Blutsauger anywhere else unless my team looks competent enough to know the basics of throwing a sandvich to the Medic.

Of relevance is the observation that on occasion the aforementioned characters execute musical interludes featuring lyrics which most commonly describe the intentions of the characters along with the contemporary action taking place onscreen. One such musical interlude bears the title We Are Number One and is sung by the primary antagonist of the series who bears the moniker Robbie Rotten along with his doppelgangers.

9775104,0,t1_dahexha,You cant be serious. Reddit and TFTV communities are a relatively small portion of the player base. So since onehalf of this smaller portion of total players which tend to be more aware of the game in general granted have played comp  at least a few times  that justifies changes to the entire game which is mostly populated by people who just want to jump right in and have a good time.To make a comparison Comp sixes format is like Soccer with no Goal tendersHeavy Engineer and half the players on the field. Very exciting for a relative minority to play and watch but not really how most want to experience the game.Thinking like this is what got us the MyM update. Which needless to say has been poorly received.The numbers do not lie. The Facts or FACTS are that the majority of the player base do not like the competitive format.If you want to continue being pedantic on this point research the exact numbers of the playerbase that play TF normally the numbers that play comp regularly then get back to us with what form of play contains the larger percentage of total players. Id do it but Im pretty sure what the answer is so Id rather not bother.Regarding you other points Youre calling a class with an enormous amount of soft counters low movement speed no mobility options outside what two melee unlocks that let him move about as fast as a soldier or demo man one of which you insist nerfing will in turn balance the whole class. Somehow. inbuilt reaction lag  I.E. Spin up on their main weapons then a rampup to full damage on top of that  and pitiful range on those weapons not to mention the FACT that you can counter that rd best DPS in teh gaem omg by breaking line of sight with a wall or other obstacle for Jesuss sake....Overpowered.Well O.K. Lets for the sake of argument say that the Heavy is in fact overpowered. Which to be fair he can be in a disorganized pub environment anyone skilled is OP in a disorganized pub especially with a good medic Everyone is kind of OP with a medic though andor again with a medic in a game mode with lower player counts comp sixes since two of Heavys hard counters  Spy and Sniper  arent run in this version of play normally.Alright weve got our OP Heavy whose claims to fame without a medic are being a slowass that can take an extra rocket or two and if youre stupid enough to fight them in the open at close range when theyre ready for you being fully capable of shredding you at close and medium ranges.Your argument is that an unlock the Gloves of Running Urgently and not the other facets of the class and game design fuck those make the class overpowered and render other unlocks redundant. You call for a nerf. Here is a link to the TF Wiki page for the Gloves of Running Urgently I want you to pay special attention to the patch notes.This weapon has already been changednerfed several times. Its been completely overhauled at least once. It has a holster penalty lets make the heavy react SLOWER thats the ticket and marks you for death giving you much lower effective health for a long period.Im not sure what youre trying to accomplish here. If you lower the movement speed then you have an arguably inferior version of the Eviction Notice It already has a holster penalty. You already take minicrits for a lengthy period if you use the weapon. No one will use it if it has a total health penalty because that health is so important for so many of the reasons Ive listed before.Please educate me oh great one. My twenty years of playing Team Fortress nine years of playing TF specifically   the bulk of all twenty years as a Heavy mind you  have not prepared me sufficiently to understand your wisdom.,tf2,dahzxho,5,t5_2qka0

People who complain about the Phlog are either A Not paying enough attention to the game. B Bad at the game. Or C On one of the few unstoppable Phlog maps CPHallway for one DustbowlIll quote myself from another post recently about the Phlog.gt The Phlog is the literal embodiment of the definition Ambush Weapon. Because of its definition being as such I would argue to give it a damage boost. Maybe . Making this weapon even more of a deadly flank than it currently is. But thats just me. I already do things like this with my mates on a regular basis.gt I dont understand why people call this weapon OP. It clearly has its strengths Tight Quarters amp Flanks and weaknesses Open Areas amp Linear Routes If people get killed by this in its strengths that means you just gotta be on higher alert look out for it more and raise your awareness. If youre killed in its weakness then youre just bad.gt If you cant shoot at a short ranged psychopathic mute walking at you or in your general direction who cant do anything to disrupt you shooting at them then you need to get good at the game.,tf2,dap77k9,2,t5_2qka0

Loch could hit  HP players and had the bonus projectile speed making it very broken. they toned it down to  instead of  so it wouldnt be able to hit anymore but people still complained for some reason. so it eventually got into the state it is in now.Phlog was only really annoying until tough break. but the Janitor decided it was in need of a buff for some reason so it was buffed to have no damage penalty and give uber plus the crits making you a bulldozer so then they nerfed it instead of reverting it making it shitty and just annoying again. only dumb and oblivious players really fell for the PreBuff phlog. the damage reduction when taunting was kind of stupid though since you could survive telefrags.,tf2,daw6zc9,49,t5_2qka0

9967302,0,t1_db60oax,Or how about the shield absorbs  of damage and the engineer can repair it through the shield? That would give the sentry gun  health effectively. This would easily be taken out by  well placed stickies or  stickies if in a rush and soldiers could quite easily spam the sentry as well meaning that the sentry could go down quite quickly if focused in fewer than a couple of seconds. This would still encourage an engineer to try and repair the sentry with the rescue ranger as an engineer would be able to keep pace with a single soldier firing rockets at the sentry as the rescue ranger would effectively heal  damage per bolt at close range however as soon as the sentry is focused by two or three enemies it would be destroyed quickly. The little bit of extra health would also still potentially allow an engineer to pull back the sentry after taking too much damage and repair it before bringing it back out into the open. Something that sixes wouldnt worry about anyway since there are not really any safe spots for an engineer to set up a sentry to be repaired on the last points of CP mapsAlso a  shield would make nice round numbers which I like.

Over time he gets more serious about how mistaken all the snipers on the team are going from No to Guys change classes please to all chat This team gt.gtThis is the apex. At this point the chart reverses and the player starts caring less and less about how many snipers are on the team going back through each stage until he reaches your rough estimate of k hours although as I said everyones different in how fast they go through this chart some k hours players might even be on the other side of the hill at the first just a pub where he says Eh its just a pub no big deal.

10171402,0,t3_5lmlba,Its honestly stupid. A large portion of rtf has shown that we dont really care about the outcome of the awards since it is a glorified popularity contest that people only really took a part in for the free trading cards. But because of a few shitposts we now have people across all the subreddits of the respective games taking offence and pushing out petty uninformed andor cheap arguments at eachother.In that thread linked alone there is plenty of arguments made that either paint the tf community as toxic or poor.gtIf there was an award for Game you play if you cant afford anything better TF wouldve won.gtMeanwhile tf adds more and more shit and is extremely toxic to newcomers meanwhile the skyrim community is pretty welcoming IMO.gtTfobligation to play or consider your moneytime already spent a waste.gtSkyrima story that you can impact and mold around your character with each playthrough being unique.,tf2,dbwzg6l,30,t5_2qka0

10357465,0,t1_dci0xjz,We are nearing on the biggest prize pool to ever be presented to a tournament and your focusing on the few teams showing up and still stating our pug systems and lobby systems are dead even though they still clearly have an active player base.Your first point of the same small number of teams showing up to the lan is partly true but since I the same teams have gone through losses of players to which you stated earlier is an effect of overwatch complete roster changes or addition of NEW PLAYERS. So I dont think you can hardly call them the same teams sure they still have the veteran players there but its not a copy paste from the past.Now your second statement about the communities which I interpret as tfcenter etc. pugchampmixchamp for both na and eu are still full of players every night that I go on there. Faceit which was just recently conceived has become a new home for a lot of the new comp players as well as top tier players. TFcenter is shitty tbh I never liked it so you got me there however it did have quite a few lobbies up the last time I checked.So as you can see your definition of dead should be changed to struggling unless you truly believe that our scene is quite literally over and has nothing going for it which simply is not true.,tf2,dci2uzp,1,t5_2qka0

Take away the nearmeaningless  extra HP if you want making it just an alternate sandvich with bonus of overheal and healing whenever malus of less burst healing.Buffalo Steak as it currently exists is absolutely a suicide button COMPLETELY useless even as a jokenovelty and needs a total rework. However I disagree with your proposal as its based on trying to accommodate nonofficial competitive league items bans and team comp meta. Succinctly fuck that shit. The insistence on such a rigid meta completely driven by only a third of the games classes is one of TFs biggest problems.I would say simply removing the damage malus altogether would be a worthwhile experiment. I suspect it would still remain one of the less equipped Heavy secondaries with only that change. If we did want to then give it healing it could certainly be something more interesting and behaviorencouraging than a simple direct weakhealovertime. Maybe a healpercentageofdamagetakenovertime take the damage as burst but then heal back a percentage of it automatically over a fixed interval rewarding higherrisk plays against highburst enemies.,tf2,dcxf5fh,-1,t5_2qka0

10630680,0,t1_ddcg9ut,Let me address your pointsgt The flamethrower will do  afterburn in addition to the .Im counting direct damage which mind you is giving melee weapons a better chance. Not only would I be wrong as that would not be true damage numbers when against another pyro but the Degreaser deals only  damage a tick causing only an additional  damage per second. I omitted afterburn so as to keep it simple.gt You are holding a swap speed penalty against the melee weapons but not against the flamethrower.Most of the time you walk around with your flamethrower out. You airblast and deal direct damage with the Flamethrower. With a melee mesides the Powerjack you would rarely have it out and ready to use. Alternatively you might airblast someone in the air and switch to the melee weapon. Also like the previous point I made the Degreasers switch speed is different and so to keep it simple I only included the direct damage.I included afterburn with the SVF because that was a specific perk of that weapon over the other melees.P.S. I am trying to disprove the myth that the axtinguisher is still good and viable and so I choose data that I feel is relevant and I want to include to prove my point. I am lightly cherrypicking but to keep it simple and to strengthen the case I omitted switch speed for the Flamethrower o People on the internet arent always  open and honest!gt Melee has an attack delay of .s so if you are swapping to a melee and counting the swap penalty it will take .s for the first melee hit to land. As a result the DPS on all of them should be higher Ignoring the fact that the swap speed would be longer for the axtinguisher and shorter if you are using the degreaserHeres how I calculate dpsAttack Duration . seconds    .. x dmg   . The damage dealt averaged over a second is equal to . damage per second.Switch Speed . seconds.    . dpsThis was altered with each weapon.gt This also ignores that melee gets far more random crits than the flamethrower.Random Crits are a bullshit mechanic and make the infographic more complex and convoluted which goes against the point of the graphic. And anyway Random crits arent on every server.gt The Neon Annihilator crits for  not ...x.xcritIts just a coincidence with the numbers.,tf2,ddch2eh,9,t5_2qka0

I remember as a FP finally being able to get a fair amount of kills and becoming a decent rocket jumper was the best feeling in the world but Im reaching the flatline sadly...Also the reason FPs often get a lot of dislike is because theyre often new  newish and often cant be trusted too much a lot of them seem to be brainded sadly... not all of them.  You and a bunch of other FPs seem like the opposite.People who arent very dedicated to a game likely wont spend their money on it Or something to that effect.  source KrunchyNaut.  Essentially FPs often dont have much experience and havent spent any money on the game.BTW Id advise digging into Metas the lore theories and such.

Insulting a players skill level that you never met because they like a character.You insulted mine for liking how the comp community worksAnnoying to talk to because you said exaggerations about how I should pick on disabled people.

If you see a teammate thats hatless no cosmetics it might be a Spy disguising as a Class your team doesnt have. If youre not able to pass through a teammates body its a Spy. If a teammate is walking with enemies and theyre not getting shot at its a Spy. If you see a tiptoeing Scout making the occasional jump without double jumping its a Spy. If you turn a corner and a teammate looks at you a begins to run away its a Spy. If a teammate is mysteriously strafing towards your back while maintaining his gaze on you its a Spy. If a teammate is ignoring everything and it walking directly towards the nearest friendly building its a Spy. If a teammate that you know is behind you shrieks in pain TURN THE FUCK AROUND! Only Engineers can stand on their own buildings. If a nonEngineer teammate is standing on a friendly building its a Spy. If that player is a different Engineer its a Spy. If that Engineer is the owner of that building its probably not a Spy but check him anyway. Spies like to hide in corners and lowtraffic sections of corridors and open areas especially on top of props. A Spys disguise drops if he fires his Pistol or swings his Knife. If a teammate isnt firing their weapon when they should be its probably a Spy. Spies can use their Sapper under a disguise. Every class has a unique hand gesture when placing a Sapper. This gives the Spy away to whoever is paying attention. If a Spy died from practically no damage then he didnt die. He feigned death with the Dead Ringer. Listen carefully for a loud electric decloak noise. Dead Ringer Spies like to disguise as their own teammates. If an enemy died mysteriously from practically no damage it might be a Dead Ringer Spy. Listen carefully for a loud electric decloak noise. If youre chasing a Spy around a corner take the corner as wide as possible and keep your back to the wall. Hes trying to cornerstab you. If youre chasing a Spy up a flight of stairs take it slowly and keep your head up. Hes trying to jump over you and stairstab you.,tf2,ddo1mc9,2,t5_2qka0

10746449,0,t1_ddntdlv,Bullshit. I spent  on OW lootboxes at Halloween and didnt get a single skin or highlight intro. Just sprays player icons and voicelines with  or  emotes. Plus Overwatch costs  upfront so the microtransactions feel like a waste of money. When I spend money on a TF crate I get something which I can use to make myself unique even if its not what I wanted and supporting the devs of a free game Ive put thousands of hours into. In Overwatch I get at best skins which make me look the same as thousands of other players and I give even more money to a giant corporation whose game I already paid quite a lot of money for and get nothing of value in exchange. I know Valve is also a giant corporation but I love their games and this one was free so I dont mind supporting it.,tf2,ddoexk7,4,t5_2qka0

10762894,0,t1_ddq3btk,gt If they want that slot to not be worthlessIts not pointlessIt has its occasional uses. Out of ammo on all weapons or when you need to reload and its quicker to swap to melee or when you encounter a Vaccinator Medic and his pocket at close range or if youre Gunboats Soldier and want to hit someone at close range without damaging yourself.The fundamental purpose of melee in FPS games since Doom has been a backup with unlimited ammo so that you always have an option other than killing yourself. In Doom it was the Fists in Quake it was the Axe and in Team Fortress Classic it was the Crowbar. They were all pretty weak weapons and killing someone with them was a funny humiliation.Because does stock melee actually desperately need to be more than that? Its not a skillful method of attack it doesnt have very much counterplay and it has poor hit registration see Demoknight Spy facestabs. What Im saying is I think stock melee is fine just fulfilling that simple backup role. Other melee weapons should be balanced around it rather than stock being balanced around them and they provide enough interestingness as it is. TF is already a very complex game and adding further complexity to the stock melees will have little benefit.,tf2,ddq42r8,2,t5_2qka0

10923223,0,t1_de6mohy,gt just that nons players have legitimate complaints as to the class roles in sAnd I disagree. Being upset that your favorite class isnt forced into the game isnt a valid complaint. You can complain that a class is shit and not being played but thats an issue that has nothing to do with the format. Pyro just isnt viable period. s players arent some evil boogeyman that took him away from you.gtTF should be the best game it can be.You realize thats subjective right? I dont think that forcing people to run spy and pyro to mid will improve the game. You might. The current s formatmeta is pretty close to my ideal comp tf. Sure theres room to make the offclasses more viable and fix some of the issues that cp has but as it is right now its pretty good. There is no objective metric you can use to measure how good the game is.gtIm guessing that no comp mode similar to s as it is now will be able to succeed well see some significant changes before any growth.Thats absurd. The reason why the competitive scene is in the state it is isnt because lol s sux just scrap it but because valve ignored and actively went against the competitive scene for eight fucking years. Yes if they balanced for s chances are the format would look a lot different than it is today but that doesnt make the current format bad. Suddenly changing the competitive format to appeal to  low gravity orange fullcrit players will not only be pointless and wont actually help much to attract new players but will be completely rejected by whats left of the core playerbase. What reason would a s player have to play a gimped gamemode without a whitelist or class limits that are in place to fix valves horrendous balancing? Do you think that these things are in place just because they hate pub players or what?The entire idea that s are to blame for the relative failure of the competitive scene is just ridiculous considering its the only thing that even created the competitive scene and kept it alive in the first place.,tf2,de6nkhi,1,t5_2qka0

We can change pretty much anything about it.Soldier kept his rocket jump despite it totally defying all common sense because it was fun and people liked it. So Valve made it work. They even added Gunboats to make it work better.gtValve needs to do a better job of pushing people towards the real classesgtreal classesOkay fuck off with this bullshit. Let me give you a checklist for whether to determine a TF class is a real class  Is it a humanoid form on the class selection menu? If you answered yes to that question then the class in question is real.gtBeing good at an off class is like being able to juggle its funny it takes a lot of time and effort to learn and its uselessThen the simple solution is making the class not useless.In real life we dont have the ability to make juggling a useful skill so that the people who enjoy it can always make a living.In video games we can decide to make an underpowered class useful so that people who enjoy playing it can.

The fact that players are all funneled down three fairly straightforward routes keeps the action moving and the close respawns mean that theres rarely a lull. Turtling doesnt really work since one good push will usually be sufficient to cap but at the same time an opportunistic scout will have a hard time easily getting the intel. I do wish it had some changes though. More health kits a catwalk or two bridging the main room and maybe the whole map just being stretched out a bit. I dunno its fun.

I wasnt sure if there was a TF Weapons subreddit and Ill use that next time.There were a couple of other buffs I wanted to include in the stats such as giving the Pyro a movement speed buff to encourage hitandrun while Afterburn is active. But adding more to that weapon description would make it look messy. The  damage penalty is to discourage WM and the last thing people would like to see is another WM flamethrower. Also the napalm effect would supersede the normal afterburn effect.Perhaps the shortlong range flame could be a toggle with the Reload key so the Pyro still retains his airblast utility but everything else would need to be changed again.,tf2,deswzcf,2,t5_2qka0

11132155,0,t1_dettign,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,tf2,dettijp,1,t5_2qka0

Most of them are shit trade minecraft servers andor have stupid plugins that drain your enjoyment on the server with MicroFascist Admins that kick people for no reason. You get bombarded with ads and some community servers play gimmicky gamemodes like Deathrun or fucking Slender Fortress. Not saying these are bad gamemodes but if I want to play the game normally I wouldnt go there. Anyway most of the Normal community servers are empty as well. So the only servers that are left are Skial Servers and even they arent that good.Quickplay and to a lesser extent Casual gets people into normal games with normal players that dont have any significant advantage over other people apart from their own competence and skill. Casual has even got little features that drag you back to it like the pretty little badges at progressively look better when you level up and go back to shit tier once youve changed colour meaning you will want to spend more time trying to make your badge look pretty again and therefor more time in Casual. The stat card at the top is also another feature that drags players in. Both of these features mean nothing but they still get players playing in Casual and away from the shithole called community servers.,tf2,df4qu8a,0,t5_2qka0

11351244,0,t3_61wopz,I think its important to teach each classs strengths and weaknesses as well as how to play them. Class matchups are also important.Scout Teach the player how to hit enemies while moving. Have them steal intelligence or cap a point where they need to use their mobility and flanking to succeed. Have there be a little area to practice moving around with the Scouts controls and double jumping. Explain the weapons simply and their strong and weak points. E.G. Your scatterguns shots spread out over distance. By attacking at close range you can deal more damage with each shot. Use your pistol on longrange enemies to deal better damage. Finally explain how the Scouts abilities influence class matchups. This is needed for every class.Soldier The current tutorial is pretty good but could use a nice rocket jumping section. Have two or three obstacles to rocket jump over. Up a pile of crates over a gap etc. If a player struggles have a bot show them while text explains the basic button combos. Turn around  shoot a rocket at the ground and jump at the same time. I think this is enough for new players as strafing and everything else beyond that are too advanced. Tell them crouching in the air can make them go further.Pyro Focus on ambush. Have the player take flank routes to attack enemies from behind the side and above. Possibly attack engineer buildings around corners or above them. Talk about target priority and how fire affects certain classes like the Pyros immunity to afterburn and the Medic healing slower when they are on fire. Introduce the compression blast and use it to push a target into a friendly sentry guns line of fire or off a cliff. Have the player practice reflecting rockets to kill the soldier. Explain that this works for almost any projectile Finally teach them how to support their own team by extinguishing teammates that are on fire and teaching spychecking by igniting an enemy spy so a friendly Engi bot notices and kills them.Demonstration Man Current setup is very good but similar to soldier it needs a little sticky jumping section. Teach the player how the stickies deal selfdamage if you are too close but you can use this to your advantage. Have the player use the right amount of stickies for the situation at hand to avoid taking unnecessary damage flying too far or blowing themselves up.Heavy Fairly simple class with stock IMO. Teach the player about revving up the minigun when entering an area with enemies to mow them down quicker. Have them use the shotgun to finish off enemies.Engineer This one is good as it is. Maybe have some shotgun and pistol target practice? Antispy tips would help too. Too many FP engis dont know spies exist.Medic Takes place in a combat setting. Explain the various functions of the medigun and mention his weapons. Explain and make the player practice healing overhealing building and using ubercharge. Teach target priority. Sniper Teach player how to find good sniping spot. Tell them to M and click heads.Spy Pretty good as it is.,tf2,dfin56r,1,t5_2qka0

You have to take a few turns to maneuver into backstab then you can get one maybe two crits per turn and then you aggro the mobs and have to retreat to cool down for like the next  turns or maybe even become unable to retreat at all so you have to sacrifice the unit and wait forever for respawn.

There are still almost constant imbalances in team number often significant. It might not be so bad if we still had auto balance which acted in  seconds but instead we have the voluntary system. So we wait as they ask people nicely to switch. I have seen people say they never liked auto balance but now they miss it.  The game had been honed over  years when MYM was installed. It was great and it worked. Features like scramble were there for a reason. Many people are unhappy and many have stopped playing.,tf2,dgajwbw,-3,t5_2qka0

Its decent enough where it stands now imo its not too lethal it shouldnt be because its ridiculously easy to apply especially when used with a detonator but it still is enough to discourage enemies from pushing immediately. It serves its purpose well enough.Degreaser would go back to almost being a straight upgrade. Damage penalties are negligible since your secondaries are far better suited for actually killing people because they have burst damage.

She takes on this nice balance of being a sassy enigmatic and is a breath of fresh air from all the other heroes who have boring as fuck  dimensional motives.gt Reinhardt is neat but like I cant help but feel like hes just the generic Old guy trope put into large ass power armorFucking fight me. Reinhardt is one of the few characters in Overwatch I will defend as being well written and good. I am ready to catch some down votes for this but I think Reinhardt is the character Heavy should have been. Yeah I fuckin said it. On first glance Reinhardt is just loud and optimistic old guy but upon closer look he is much deeper. Reinhardt is a relic of his time. Think about that. People in Overwatch find cars with tires to be laughable yet Reinhardt still babbles on about shit like glory honor and perseverance. He wields a fucking hammer and shield in a time where people have figured out unthinkable amounts of progression in weaponry. Reinhardt is very arcane and naive in his ways and ideology. Despite what was destroyed in the past Reinhardt cannot move on. Reinhardt refuses to change in a world that constantly changes. As seen in comics it is even seen that Reinhardt suffers this to the extent of even perceiving the world differently from everyone else. In Reinhardts mind he will always be that valiant knight with an uncontested sense of righteousness and justice. Reinhardt would rather die than change. This is both the beauty yet fatal flaw of his character. Not to mention his design is fucking baller easily recognizable and contrasts heavily with the rest of the cast. Or the fact that he has an amazing voice actor that perfectly portrays his character. Or that he is one of the most well designed characters in terms of game play and perfectly fits and complements the speed and pacing of Overwatch.So yeah! Reinhardt is amazing and you shut your dirty whore mouth.gtuh oh right the Australians you got road hog and junket too radiation crazy weirdos who are evil I think?Junkrat is a solid character imo. Hes kinda just a bargain bin Joker but even that is good considering how amazing Joker is in general. Also Junkrat has one of the best back stories along with having one of the more memorable voicelines in the game. And Roadhog is a rejected Mad Max Fury Road design.Also you forgot Symmetra my dude. But dont worry everyone forgot about Symmetra.Yeah those are about the only OW heroes Ill defend. The rest are either mediocre at best poorly written or are fuck awful. But really they all pale in comparison to TFs characters. Except for Reinhardt and maybe Bastion. Theyre cool.,tf2,dgw51hq,5,t5_2qka0

11794262,0,t1_dgwwwem,Do the radius and deviation really matter when youre spitting out so many rockets so quickly? I suppose its random whether or not you land an airshot with it so you cant stop a bomb with it.It also used to be banned in nearly all forms of comp prior to its radius nerf since it essentially guaranteed a med pick thanks to its monumental burst damage. Its still cheap but it has a reasonable downside now.,tf2,dgwx40h,1,t5_2qka0

11799649,1,t1_dgwtj0g,gt It doesnt the other banners need to brought up to its level.No they dont. The other banners are absolutely fine the way they are and are fairly balanced. The Concherer is retardedly strong. Why does it now give  HP regen to Soldier? Why does it cost over a hundred damage less to charge than the other two banners? Why the fuck is there a speed boost involved at all? It already returns one third of all damage dealt as health on top of its constant passive health regen why does everyone get free nonstop Disciplinary Action speed too in a group radius?,tf2,dgxj4ga,-1,t5_2qka0
