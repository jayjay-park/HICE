9840988,0,t1_da5geho,Interesting to hear We have a similar sleep schedule as well. Except I over due a little more. I usually wake up right before I have to start getting ready for work kinda like how you would do so if you work the normal morning shift. I guess waking up right before going to work is why Im usually wide awake during my shifts and I usually cannot sleep until around am to ishpm. Does sleeping those hours ever bring you down? in a sense that everybody is enjoying their day while your at home sleeping all the time. Be being a single young man its hard to maintain any kind of relationship with a female as Im always sleeping the entire afternoon.,NightShifters,daqay3s,2,t5_32ahc
