81641,0,t1_cenczmb,gt Do NOT go to Pacha its full of druggies and tourists.I second not going to Pacha but not for the reasons you listed. Every club has druggies and tourists? I think the word you mean to use is foreigners in which case I agree with you. Loads of Asians and Middle Eastern type go to Pacha and only Pacha for some reason. They tend to be older too. Its a strange phenomenon. ,avesNYC,cenq29c,2,t5_2vcm6

406002,0,t1_cfklf4b,Last night was weird. I took everything they might have taken out of my pockets and put them in my underboob but the line was so huge they didnt check anyone at all. AT ALL for ANYTHING. An hour later a girl told me they patted her crotch. Was hanging by the door for a bit later in the night and they were patting down people then. So I guess it just depends on what time you get there and how big the event is?And how deep your crack is.,avesNYC,cfmuk0n,1,t5_2vcm6

5192501,0,t1_cvbvpya,I mean if their music altered your life in some way and  doesnt mean too much to you Id go see them. It should be cool doing it at a warehouse as well. I saw them at Coachella  and it was nice that they had the singer and all but the stage setupetc. wasnt anything special. I paid  to see Moderat who rarely come to the US at a Brooklyn Warehouse and they were incredible. I figured I would only have one or two chances to catch them in my life so I had to!,avesNYC,cvbw19g,1,t5_2vcm6
5367491,0,t1_cvxqdub,This confused me as well but I dont think so. Theyre both different venues so I wouldnt imagine them letting you into their Friday show with a  ticket when theyre going for much more ,avesNYC,cvxra4e,2,t5_2vcm6

6575477,0,t3_45j69d,Prydz is my guy been following him for years. Once I saw he signed with EDC and began touring the writing was on the wall. It was only a matter of time until he was bigger than life.  Some say he is selling out others say hes just sporting his kids. Either way hes true to his music and has never changed his sound respect.  This is why I will continue to go see him but you must pick his shows wiselyideally outdoor festival with him.
