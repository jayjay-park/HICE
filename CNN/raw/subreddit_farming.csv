157343,0,t3_1vw1hr,Pythium is active in both corn and beans Crop rotation has little to no effect on Pythium oospores levels.When you plant the weather conditions and soil conditions are key. Plant when soil temperature is above CF. Pythium thrives is early planted fields because of cooler soil temperatures and the fields are typically saturated during the early part of the spring. The field water issues can best be dealt with via tillage dry that dirt out! and overall soil drainage lay some pipe!.There are no known soys resistant to Pythium but a few that are tolerant. This is a lead you need to chase down with your preferred agronomistseed rep.The best control we have right now is via seed treatments. Look for something that contains someall of the following thiamethoxam metaxyl metalaxylM and fludioxonil. That means youre looking for trade name labels of Apron FL metaxyl  Apron XL LS metaxylM Apron Maxx RTA fludioxonil and metalaxylM or CruiserMaxx thiamethoxam metalaxylM and fludioxonil.,farming,cewcq3h,6,t5_2qrz8

The PO could be  and with the work being done by a  year old son and a  year old grandson but as far as the statistic are concerned Grandpa is an  year old farmer because his name is on the farm business.Then it goes on to talk about young farmers working as apprentices and interns. For most young farmers thats called childhood. We dont need much in the way of pay as kids. For a lot of others they get a proper job on a farm instead of being suckered in to an internship.Does your degree help you on the farm? If yes then it should be worth paying for. If no then you made a mistake and you should deal with it rather than beg for someone else to cover it. Then we get a bunch of proorganic bullshit about healthy communities and stewarding soil and agricultural traditions. Hey question! What do a bunch of people from urban areas know about agricultural traditions? Sweetfuckall. Agriculture is a mature industry. Its not a business that you can expect to just walk into and start making a profit. Theres no free land out there waiting for homesteaders to clear the trees and plow the prairie.

3585356,0,t1_cq0wvgh,Thank you for your reply.  I see how you say it was loaded question.  Its a question Im not sure how I feel about and have heard others ask before.  Given that approx.  of California water use goes to plant ag another  to livestock and only approx  is consumed by urban users our efforts of shorter showers and choosing water over other beverages are practically null.  So some wonder why were growing food to export when we are busting our butts in the cities to conserve every drop?  Whats the best thing an urban consumer of water can do?  In my opinion its giving up eating meat not not eating vegetables which I read you grow so do I.  So its an interesting predicament in my opinion.  Regarding the salmon well theyre a keystone species and as you didnt want to dive deep into water history amp politics I dont want to dive deep into keystone species and how they impact the environment. I recognize that my questions were heavier than most you fielded up until I read your post.  I am passionate about water so Ill tell you who I am.  I am a California native.  Ive experienced California droughts and floods all my life yet Ive never seen water levels this low.  I agree  that the water is mismanaged.  I believe I recently read that we let  of our ground water flow to the ocean.  Thats an insane amount when so many rivers have been damned and reservoirs are in place.  I am a vegetable gardner also.  We use a drip system on our  sq ft urban garden which is consider HUGE by gardens looking for a plot in a community garden in the city.  We focus on perennial edibles and our favorite annuals.  Our garden is varied with only a few of each plant and approx.  different edibles or beneficials.  We use municipal water donated to the nonprofit by a neighboring apartment building.  We have no limits I know of and require no legal right to use it any more than I have the right to flush the toilet with potable water.  Nice to meet you.

Deinonychosauria of article  Dromaeosauridae sfw gtgtSince the s the dromaeosaurids and troodontids have often been classified together in a group or clade named the Deinonychosauria initially based primarily on the presence of a retractable second toe with sickleclaw now also known to be present in some primitive birds. The name Deinonychosauria was coined by Ned Colbert and Dale Russell in  and defined as a clade all theropods closer to dromaeosaurids than to birds by Jaques Gauthier in .gtThrough the early s consensus among paleontologists was that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to the troodontids and together with the troodontids with deinonychosaurians in turn the sister taxon to avialans and therefore the closest relatives of avialan birds.  In  Turner et al. conducted a phylogenetic analysis using a dataset of  characters scored for  taxa which found Deinonychosauria to be monophyletic  However several more recent studies have cast doubt on the hypothesis that dromaeosaurids and troodontids were more closely related to each other than either was to birds. A more robust  study by Godefroit et al. using a dataset of  characters scored for  taxa found that troodontids were possibly more closely related to birds than to dromaeosaurids forcing troodontids to remain in a monophyletic Deinonychosauria required four extra steps in the analysis making this result less likely but not implausible.   Because Deinonychosauria was originally defined as all animals closer to dromaeosaurids than to birds without specific reference to troodontids Deinonychosauria is a synonym of Dromaeosauridae if Troodontidae is closer to birds. gtInteresting Unenlagiinae | Velociraptor | Paraves | Itemirus Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqwrtb oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqwrtb.

That stance has no caused supply problems because they cant find suppliers who want to meet their requirements. SO theyve had to expand their search for a supplier. That really seems like capitalism at its finest. ,farming,cwrd63y,2,t5_2qrz8

Most people are happy to donate stuff theyd have to take time out or pay money to get rid of.Similarly if you can hold of sufficient epoxy cheaply you might look into boating supply places and see if theyre willing to donate some in exchange for a credit to the team or the like  sponsor of Alabama High robotics team etc you can apply it to seams on a wood or plastic frame to effectively make a watertight seal for filling. If you add a step of going to a junkyard to raid junked cars for vinyl from carseats to make a liner thick enough to be unlikely to get ripped up by your devices you can build something which should last at least a couple of years.

Rant aside was raised in a leftleaning family and were the extreme minority in our riding but Im thinking the generational turnover might help that in the next  years. ,farming,devs1c1,3,t5_2qrz8

11462152,0,t1_dfv4kil,Yeah I mean your government is just looking out for you guys. Id want the same. But policies like these in the long run lead to more protectionist polices in other industries and it seems unfair to have certain industries get favorable deals that prevent free trade. It seems like a step toward a trade war and nobody wins those.,farming,dfv87kk,-1,t5_2qrz8

If so which and why dont u use it now? Is it price? Product sucks? if so how does it suck?Curious.. how many people  manhours do you need to employ to do all this weeding on your farm? If you dont mind sharing the farm size that would be helpful,farming,dgil3bb,1,t5_2qrz8

11686919,0,t3_66cp2h,id like to see small cheap robots for weeding field crops.  they can be solar or just find their docking station when they need it with shore power.  ideally youd set one of these things up and tell it to manage a quarter acre.  plant the crop record the location of the plants and kill everything not the crop.  can be herbicide kill or tillage.  doesnt matter if the weed has roots if the top is constantly chopped off.  weedwacker?  pair of shears?  most of the rototics are going for larger and more expensive.  i want something that will work for most of the worlds fields.  so we can farm very small areas  half or quarter acre  effectively.,farming,dgkqa86,1,t5_2qrz8
