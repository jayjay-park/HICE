6154867,0,t3_3zrdnb,Oh man! I just bought the same scope and its coming in on Wednesday!  As far as I know and I am very new to this but on forums I have seen this scope come in and almost always need to be collimated.  Here is a great link explaining it.I dont know if you have already tried this.  Let me know how this goes or if you have already done this and hopefully we can figure this thing out.  Hopefully this fixes it cause I dont want the same problem on mine! Lol,telescope,cyp8sjp,1,t5_2rqr0
