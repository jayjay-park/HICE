5714772,0,t1_cx5ailx,The book and the cookbook.Any time youre doing anything more complicated than writing a single class for an exact specific job ask yourself is there a symfomic way to do this and the answer is almost always yes.Juggling classes around because they depend on each other? Service container.Sending emails and trying to figure out how the hell to do it properly in php? Swiftmail.Trying to have your app actually let you know how and why people see exceptions errors on your site? Monolog.Manually validating forms and trying to resolve logic to make sure that a user doesnt do something illegal? Form builder and events.I personally use the advanced features of symfony daily because theyve come up with a way to solve nearly any problem I come across.My most recent issue was that I had a form that had two submit buttons but only admins should be allowed to see and click one of them. I spent a few days trying to juggle all the logic to create this form hiding the button in the twig template make sure that the buttons appeared at the right time and that users couldnt cheat the system in any way if user !admin ignore click.... Then realized that a form event makes it trivial I pass in the user authenticator object check if the user is authenticated and physically add the button to the form only if they are an admin. Symfony takes care of hidingshowing it and will complain if someone tries to forge a form submission that clicks that button when they dont have access.,symfony,cx5h1rr,6,t5_2r358

Dont be locked into my suggestions too its been a while for me there might be better tools for you out there its just a place to start have fun!,symfony,d7tdr2b,2,t5_2r358
