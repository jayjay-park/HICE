8488115,0,t1_d62apmo,Yeah theyre not bad at all but I do take OPs point. Personally I reeeeeaaaally need a new laptop as I have been learning software development in my spare time but am now being totally bottlenecked by the fact that our current laptop is a low spec POS that chokes trying to build simple command line apps. Means Im limited to using my work PC to practice any meaningful dev work and that doesnt really give me a whole lot of time to dedicate to it.While I could buy a current rMBP that would be totally sufficient for my needs Im loathe to spend that much money on last years models when I know the new ones are likely dropping in a month or two at which point I could get a lot more machine for the same money. Ive already committed to waiting it out but the total radio silence from Apple is starting to be a bit frustrating ,macbookpro,d62k7qd,3,t5_2xhss
8492176,0,t1_d632i0t,The thing is that before switching it off by the power button or just leaving it a little bit has resolved the issue and a temporary fix to the issue signals to my brain that I can procrastinate getting the Mac looked at. ,macbookpro,d632k2m,1,t5_2xhss

9417667,0,t1_d97njp5,Thanks for the reply I did a First Aid again and this time it seems to be no errors reporting.But I have one more question. Should I format my HDD which was used as startup disk and never formatted ever since I switched my startup disk to the new SSD?

9433643,0,t1_d9boy2q,Well you could learn how to program on a   Air and still be okay... Worked well enough for me when I was trying to learn java. In terms of old  vs new  Skylake wasnt a leap forward but you would probably be near the performance on an old . Of course you would have a dGPU with the  but if programming is what youre interested in it really wouldnt matter. Id say new  processor would be more than capable and youd get the new features to play around with.,macbookpro,d9bs2wz,2,t5_2xhss

9454020,0,t1_d9ecti7,Thats true. Sometimes its just a numbers and playing with imagination. I asked that question because right now you have an option to buy a  refub at MUCH lower price than  new one  difference and Im just wondering if its worth it to buy a new one. Like I said power consumption and the overall look doesnt matter to me. Actually old one with old ports is even better than new one without touch bar. ,macbookpro,d9ed49c,1,t5_2xhss

9916991,0,t3_5hfmht,Long story short Yes to both.Long story long You should never skimp on the processor if you can do it. This is one of those things that will help futureproof your laptop for years to come. It helps handle more resource intensive things as well  plus it gives you the user more bandwidth to work with. As for the graphics for  you are getting  more GB of GPU memory  again... futureproofing. To me thats a nobrainer. I personally purchased the  .TB in Space Grey. It is way overkill for my needs BUT it gives me a lot of room to go. Technology is an area where I never cut corners. And dress shoes... but thats for another thread. ,macbookpro,db07iki,3,t5_2xhss

I say that just because final cut if bought through the app store would be attached to the user account and not the device itself kind of like iphone or ipad.
