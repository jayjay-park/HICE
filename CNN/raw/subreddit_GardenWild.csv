7457827,0,t3_4hixe2,I dont like touching slugs or them eating new plants but I dont mind them too much. I mostly use mulch that they dont like moving over to protect my plants at the moment. I obviously would advise against using harmful and non organic methods  Has anyone tried the copper rings and tape?,GardenWild,d2pwp9c,2,t5_39sss
9795491,0,t1_dakhub7,I was hoping for flying squirrels. They are nocturnal and I thought they might be visiting my feeder. Im going to try putting some peanuts out in the tree to see if I can attract any. For temps here in MN at this time of year our highs should be around freezing and lows can get in the teens or single digits Fahrenheit. This fall has been unusually warm weve barely gotten down to freezing so far. If youre interested check out my live stream feeder camera at  its online during daylight hours here. ,GardenWild,daki83c,1,t5_39sss
