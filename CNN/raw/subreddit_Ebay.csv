7445,0,t1_ceeczul,I too have an eBay account rep who I have actually met several times and even had dinner with. My rep is a nice guy and does his best to help when things go bad but in the end what he can do is severely limited by eBay policy and the decisions of upper management.Having an account rep who is a nice guy tries to help and buys the occasional dinner does not make me trust eBay as a company. Many times they have made decisions that have cost sellers their livelihood often with little to no warning.For example they pulled all nonphysical items electronic delivery items from eBay a few years ago. Did this affect my business? No. Was it a wakeup call? Yes definitely. They have removed other categories over time as well none of which affected me directly but all of them were reminders that at any time eBay could make a decision that would limit or end my ability to sell items on the site. The most recent was the removal of the eBay Trading Assistant program which greatly damaged the businesses of many many people. Did you think this sort of thing could never happen to you? Were not special any of us could be booted for any reason or no reason at any time.Im not saying your ban from eBay was reasonable logical or warranted. Im saying that you had plenty of warning that this could happen to you at any time yet you did nothing to limit the impact that such a ban would have on your business. Even though you did nothing you feel the impact on your business was eBays fault...? Thats not a reasonable conclusion. As a business manager your job is to make sure that your business doesnt face risks like this and you failed miserably. The ban may have been wrong but the outcome of it rests on you.,Ebay,cefa8il,0,t5_2qh7g

364886,0,t3_1y9tkf,I dont see how this is a problem because I think thats the point  to get to a higher price. But I think this is a case of a maximum bid at work. What it looks like to me is that the first bidder placed a bid higher than your opening bid. So when the nd bidder tried to outbid them the bid automatically increased with each attempt. When they finally outbid the st buyers max their bid registered. If you look at the nd entry down the date is yesterday while the others are all today. I know its kind of confusing.

463115,0,t3_1zdid2,This is kind of offtopic since Ive already got the answer I was looking for from uonlinebizguy but Im more ticked off at the shill bidder than this idiot who thinks Im in cahoots with him.  Heres the bid history In just  minute  seconds  bid  times in  dollar increments  of those bids being as the losing bidder AFAIK this is possible with a certain bidding app for a smart phone and lets you bid with a single button press.  His th bid put him above a so he retracted it bidding history doesnt show retracted bids though.  Do you think ebay would do anything about this asshole if I reported him?  Why should I report him you ask...  Well in my opinion hes artificially driving up the desirability of the item which is a violation of ebays policy on shill bidding.  The item I was selling is a th century antique and somewhat rare.  There are lt others on ebay right now and most of those are reproductions mine is not.  I would not be surprised if that bidder the one who didnt win puts up an identical item of his own for sale on ebay within the next couple weeks at which point any bidder who does their homework would be able to look at the sold items page and see my auction indicating how much its worth.  But even if this bidder doesnt list an item like mine he could very well have a paper printout of my auction accompanying the item hes selling at his antique store as proof of its value and price.  I know this sounds like a conspiracy theory but it is not at all uncommon for an antiques dealer with a high priced item to have a printout of a completed ebay auction proving its value to skeptical antiquers.  This is the same thing and it sold last month on ebay for more than my price.  Look for yourself.  This tactic works doubly well because even a savvy antiquer could look up the item online himself and look at the bidding history and think both bidders had really high feedback so they cant be shill bids.TLDR I think the shill bidder on my auction was doing it to drive up the value of his own item which he may list on ebay in the coming weeks OR have for sale at his own antique store where he has a printout of MY auction proving its value.  I think the bid history which doesnt show the retracted bid FYI is very suspicious and indicative of that.  Do you think ebay would care if I presented my case to them?  ,Ebay,cfswo7z,1,t5_2qh7g

539795,0,t1_cg1mmnd,As an experienced seller who has used GSP it decreases sales it often adds time and cost to the shipment because it needs to reach the US shipping center. Also as a canadian it ensures that I way overpay for customs fees. Normally theres like a  chance that I will be taxed  when a package arrives in Canada. With GSP theres a  chance that I will have to pay around  tax... I will never purchase anything that is sold with GSP. If I want something being sold through GSP I will message the seller to disable it.

707539,0,t3_2290l6,You absolutely do not have to pay for the return shipping. However as others have stated if the reason for return is a mistake on your part error in listing wrong item etc. I would definitely offer to pay for it as it ups your chance of avoiding Negative feedback.Unfortunately even if it is completely the buyers fault they decided they didnt like it or just didnt want it for whatever reason and they ask that you pay return shipping and you dont they can still leave Negative feedback if they are dissatisfied with their experience with you as a seller. I dont know how many times Ive tried to have  bullshit Negative feedbacks removed based on things like inaccurate information flat out lies that can be proven by simply looking at message exchanges only to be told be the eBay representative that The buyer is entitled to his opinion on the transaction  experience with you as a seller.So its really up to you. If you are very very worried about that potential Negative Feedback you might want to cover it for them. But even then even if you DO pay for return shipping they STILL can leave you Negative feedback and have it stick.I hope this all works out for you in the end.,Ebay,cgkp8b8,2,t5_2qh7g

1261406,0,t3_28j273,This can be complicated... If this is a domestic US transaction via USPS then the USPS will verify the address before it generates the label. That amounts to confirming the number street city and state all match a known postal address. So if you enter the wrong state then that state would have to have a city street and number that was valid. Also if you entered the wrong state but the zip code was correct that would trigger an address verification error. Canada also has a similar system now.

Be careful not to give the seller any personal or account information.  If they are legit they will have all the info they need to give you a refund.  For them they just log into Paypal and it only takes a couple clicks of the mouse to give you a refund.  They do not need to know your Paypal email.

Sell a LOT for VERY LITTLE if possible. OPEN cases punish you whether they open a case that has nothing to do with you or not. Whether they are satisfied or not you are PUNISHED. So if a customer opens a case ebays new policies encourage you to blatantly ignore them and focus  of your attention on people that have NOT opened a case. Read minds  you are punished if you uploaded a tracking  and someone opens a case asking for their tracking . If you didnt precog that they were going to open a case and ask for tracking  even though its already posted on their account and their email you are punished. If you not a precog prepare to have low performance status even with  pos feedback and stars in all categories. Listen to peaceful music so to prevent blood pressure from rising due to ebays new rediculous policies that punish sellers for anything the customer asks or does.Good luck. Really.

1888986,0,t1_ckgsjy5,Youre referring to the antics they played years ago however a court ruling has made it clear to PayPal that they cant do this anymore. Im not aware of any cases where PayPal has pulled this trick in the last four or five years. I believe the OP misspoke in the comment above that we are discussing he says seller when I think buyer. In fact eBay doesnt care either as long as the seller offers a secure electronic payment option. The main problem is that to roll your own system is difficult OK thats an understatement! and the few existing systems are not well received by buyers. In fact Ive not bought items on eBay because I was not comfortable with the payment system the seller was using. However in the end PayPals performance and ethics have improved greatly in the last few years. In that area the courts have made it clear that there are rules and that PayPal will follow these rules. ,Ebay,ckgtc1b,2,t5_2qh7g

We have cancellations fairly often at least one or two every other week where the buyer pays and then immediately wants to cancel and receive a refund. This is where we follow the instructions for a Cancel Sale and are instructed to refund the buyer first before sending the request. The eBay representative plainly stated that if you issue a refund through Paypal without opening the case first you will receive a defect for that transaction. According to her the correct procedure isSend the buyer a Cancel Sale request with a note that says you have initiated the refund even though you wont do that until after you hit the button to send the request.Then immediately refund the buyer.

The sniping doesnt encourage anyone to bid more  they dont even know youre in the game yet which is the beauty of it. So theres no enabling of nibblers. And youre not going to pay more than you want to for the widget because you set the snipe to be your maximum amount and you were okay with that.It just matters where your snipe bid is in relation to the others including the unknown proxies and other snipes.If you lose or win at the last second by of a couple cents due to the bid increments Ive seen that happen often thats just bad luck.

But in this case they could just say well it was pickup and you cant prove you didnt get it.Im not sure how eBay would deal with this. Maybe they have a protocol but Im not sure. You should definitely call them and ask them so you dont get boned.Edit  Basically because its sold as pickup using PayPal and shipping could simply be considered outside of the transaction or outside of eBay.

Whereas GSP wont miss the sale or any of the other tacked on feesdutiesetc. The sale isnt complete until those are paid up front.So its a tradeoff. Sellers have easy access to a larger market and can hand off the risks of shipping to GSP while buyers have access to many more products that wouldnt otherwise have been available because some sellers just dont want the hassle of shipping overseas with the limitationsrestrictions on tracking and insurance  too long to go into detail.

3241081,0,t1_coxvaze,If it weighs over oz it does not qualify for FirstClass flat rates depending on weight so you must ship either Parcel  days or Priority  days. Most of the time unless youre shipping very heavy items Priority is about the same or less than Parcel. Priority aside from flatrate is priced by how many zones it goes through. Say youre based in California and someone in RI buys it. Say it weighs  Lb. The cost to ship that would be around . If it weighs  lb it shoots up to . But if you ship from CA to CA it might only go through a zone and a  Lb would cost   Lb ..Calculated uses the weight you have provided and the buyers zip code to come up with the actual cost of postage. You can add a SampH charge to cover your costs boxes bags wrapping paper etc. I usually add . unless I use flatrate boxes which are free.FlatRate Priority might be worth it if youre shipping heavy items or items across the US but not locally. Also if you dont ship a lot and dont buy boxes or bags in bulk their free boxes are a godsend. Bags and boxes can cost  if purchased in small quantities but bags can cost pennies and boxes quarters if you buy in bulk.You can have up to  different shipping options but they all must be either calculated or flatrate though free shipping is always an option. On heavier items I usually throw in Priority FedEx SmartPost UPS Ground and Parcel. Priority is always the cheapest but I like to give my buyers options.

If a seller sends something late and even it arrives late due to no fault of his own it doesnt change the item it doesnt make the item Not as described. Your comparison of an item described as owned by someone important and finding out its not is totally different. Thats the item being different. Go ahead and keep on giving wrong advice and Ill correct you until I get tired of your nonsense. Better yet why dont you try and call eBay and ask them if an item that shows up a day late is grounds for filing a claim as Significantly not as described. The eBay guidelines for shipping state To create a good buyer experience    Ship within the time you specified in your listing using the shipping option from the listing selected by your buyer. and says nothing about repercussions if its not shipped on time. What happens is exactly what happened the buyer left a negative. Its an appropriate response. You keep on wanting to put the entire transaction as not as advertised and that may be true but theres no recourse for a sellers performance related to shipping a day late except possibly for time sensitive items like concert tickets. This is not one of those times. Anyway.... Bad advice. ,Ebay,coz7jfs,0,t5_2qh7g

That went up to about  a day for the whole month of December for the holidays. Most of the year things are alright occasional customer who orders the wrong size helmet then when we tell them we can ship them different pads to make it one size bigger or smaller they still say nah I just want to return it. But around the holidays things get bad. LOTS of people who order something a week before christmas we ship it usually same day. Then when it shows up  days after christmas we get raging messages about how we didnt do out job and waited to ship the item yadda yadda yadda. We always end up having to call eBay and have some negative feedback stripped off our account because the customer was stupid enough to think that if they ordered something that is located in Pennsylvania a week before christmas that they would have it and wrapped under the tree in California by christmas eve.I also think what categories you sell in largely have to deal with this sort of thing as well. I sold collectibles for a company for a little while and holy hell did those customers have zero common sense.

I knew phones so I concentrated on them and as most people know it is very high risk with the potential for stolen  black listed phones etc..Every single time I was scammed it was because I stupidly did not take the time to verify stuff. Normally I would ask for the serial number of the device prior to meeting up so that I can verify it was not blacklisted or on an installment plan through various websites. I had several people give me the IMEI of a clean phone but give me a stolen phone when we made the transaction. I either trusted too much or was in too much of a hurry to double check the IMEI they gave me actually matched the phone. Someone sold me a fake phone I went through my normal process of inspecting it everything looked fine but when I got home and went deeper into the operating system it just didnt look right and ended up being fake. I took a  hit on that one. It literally looked felt and worked EXACTLY like an authentic phone. It was insane. I have had people sell me phones on installment plans which will verify as clean but blacklist a month later when the account goes past due.

While a slow shutter speed a lack of light  or an unsteady camera will contribute to this problem you will never get a good crisp close up if you dont have a macro setup.  for a macro extension tube sounds like a solid option. I would definitely explore this before investing in a macro lense.Other things to keep in mind for the future are the items listed on this post. Get a tri pod. Make sure you have a good light source.

If you want to run an eBay business that you dont have time for unhappy buyers are going to be part of it.

This is a very poor excuse for leaving the buyer hanging for basically an entire work week which is an eternity in Internet sales. How are you shipping things out? If you are using USPS you should start printing labels through eBay. Its faster and less prone to errors because the address is prefilled you get a discount and printing the label automatically marks the package shipped and gives the buyer the tracking. Something as small as a video game you can attach the label and drop in a blue mailbox.

In your case the cancellation to Greece is deserved as you must have your shipping setup to match your terms. The tea cup is the same and I know its easy to have that happen. eBay is even known to make listing mistakes and yet they will not remove the defect even when they relist your sold item. Item not as described  Ive never had one removed even when it was in error by the buyer and they never returned the item. With the vintage thermometer hard to say as I dont know the process taken to cancel.

About  of sellers feel its just another way eBay is jabbing us with a knife while  think eBay is simply trying to evaluate the realworld delivery times without having to dig into the tracking information  IOW a simple click of yes  no vs. dealing with the data provided by tracking. I personally think eBay is trying to gather information on carrier time given that there are so many sellers complaining about unrealistic delivery times. A simple check box is easier for eBay to follow and then they can dig deeper into the no responses. Besides Amazon does this too. Now that might be the best reason ever.

Of course in this situation where he actually has the advertised item and theres no missing piece to send the buyer  nothing to fix  that doesnt help you.The only thing to do now is to contact the buyer directly try to get him to understand and once he gets it see if he will agree to retract the feedback himself.

But neither my father now I have ever received a hostile voicemail from a stranger before and this verbal attack was left on the same night that she send me a number of unhinged screeds. All of her negative feedback mentions rageful messages sent to buyers so Im making what I assume is a safe assumption. Again Im very interested to see how ebay sizes this situation up.

If it was a fixed price listing you have to make sure youre looking at the original listing from your purchase history and not just clicking the link back to the live listing. The live listing may change after your purchase  if your original purchase listing states series  that is what you are entitled to receive and if you receive anything else you can file an INAD claim. Unless your saying the listing used to say series one but then changed before you bought it.

10726635,0,t3_5tgmyq,Accept the return. If they complain to eBay you will probably lose. At least way you maintain control.Sorry this buyer is being an ass but dont let your emotions get to you in your responses. Politely offer to accept a return right here right now. Yes youll have to pay for return shipping. State item will need to be received in the same condition as received. Dont bring up the dry cleaning business. If they do state you will not pay reimburse for that option.  Return now or keep. Get return block buyer amp relist. Dont let these jerks get to you.  All that said I would encourage you to rethink the whole no returns accepted policy. Put yourself in a buyers position. Think of all the places you have shopped in the last few weeks or months online or otherwise. What if every store had a no return policy would that affect your decision making?No matter what your policy is Ebay will force a return if something wrong and the buyer complains loud enough. In cases like this accepting returns will be easier for both parties but wont necessarily increase the amount of returns. I have been selling for about  years and offered a return window on  of my stuff since day one. I can only count on one hand the number of times I felt a buyer was abusing my return policy. Last year I increased my window from  to  days and have not seen an increase in returns either.,Ebay,ddmdf3i,6,t5_2qh7g

Another issue is that the woolworths click and collect thing still shows up and they have to blatantly say in their advert that it is not possible and to not select the optionThat and the vast amount of feedback usually states about how long the shipping was as well as the lack of quality of the item. Curiously some of the transactions are also in other currencies such as UK or USD which makes me wonder if they can falsify the location for overseas sellers too.

I suppose it depends on what constitutes operational.  So you might actually be in the right.

11749046,0,t3_67nl1w,I guess these are the guys responsible for pushing promoted listings on to everyone. What a waste  I tried that program a few months ago and noticed absolutely no extra traffic on my listings. Ended up being charged  to sell an item that ended up getting something like  extra clicks and Im positive it would have sold anyway. Plus whats going to be the point now that all stores are going to get free promoted listings? If everyone is promoted how is it supposed to help you stand out? Maintaining the TRS discount is more important in my opinion to keep seller standards high and prices low. EBay is about to watch a lot of those one day handling times and  day returns disappear. ,Ebay,dgrs82b,2,t5_2qh7g
