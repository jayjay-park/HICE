9515576,0,t3_5b5xn6,If it can give you the card draw at  mana like Wild Growth can this could be good.  Requires more specific deck building style favors the token builds.  Obviously powerful with Living Roots.  Overall I think its a little too underwhelming though and wont see much play.  ,MSGPRDT,d9lzx7n,3,t5_3hdnb
9515617,0,t3_5b5jsi,This has great value  think of how many matchups there are where this kills an Azure Drake then prevents your opponent from playing their Sylvanas and there are a lot of curves vulnerable to this.But Im not really sure what deck this goes in.  Aggro doesnt want it.  Itll seal games in a midrange deck but its not like thereve been very successful midrange rogues anyway.Does Miracle Rogue want this?  It does nothing on turn  when youre most vulnerable then starts paying off on turns where you have Auctioneer available and are at your strongest.  That sounds bad to me but I dont know shit about Miracle Rogue.,MSGPRDT,d9m03ru,5,t5_3hdnb

9531472,0,t3_5bdfwk,Rogue was my fisrt Golden class and the reason in the first place that kept me playing Hearthstone when i found it years ago. Im no t against all this add a random class but when they are forcing it to be the only way to play rogue then we have a problem because its just a try to stupidify the class.

9544864,0,t1_d9nqivi,yeah but against other bad options grook fu master might steal a few games in paladin or shaman arena decks.  A  windfury on an empty board  buffs can win games.

9548618,0,t3_5boig9, attack minions just arent good in constructed right now due to the dominance of Midrange shaman which doesnt run any minions below  health besides Thalnos and the rare sighting of Kobold Geomancer.  Shes decent but because shaman is everywhere and this minion does poorly against them she wont see much constructed play.  Shes not a bad card though as a  is acceptable stats for  mana in a vacuum and the battlecry is solid enough when you hit your four drop with it.  Shell be pretty good in arena.,MSGPRDT,d9q2btj,2,t5_3hdnb
9550796,0,t1_d9q8k5u,gt You have a guaranteed  cards in your hand on turn . True and none of them may be dragons because youve only drawn  cards and are on your first turn. By Turn  youve drawn practically a third of your deck so odds are you have another dragon in hand especially if youve drawn one of your larger dragons. gt Later in the game you could be topdecking. Dragon priest is typically run midrange so youre not sure that you are always going to have  spare cards in your hand and you do eventually run out of dragons against control.Ive seen Kibler play a lot of Dragon Priest and that guys hand is always packed with cards. Nether spite Historian and Azure Drake go a long way in keeping an extra dragon or two around for procs. Very rarely does he come across an instance where he cant proc a dragon card especially since Book Worm and this new Operative card also have the Dragon tag.  ,MSGPRDT,d9qbzk0,1,t5_3hdnb
9551788,0,t1_d9q0ot5,Portal is mvp at keeping you out of burn range though. Ideally your using weapons and other efficient removal early and portal later on. I think cards that are inbetween tempo and survival are always better with an imediate effect.,MSGPRDT,d9qge70,2,t5_3hdnb

9648094,0,t1_da29723,Yeah its certainly not a given that RenoKazakus Mage will be a top tier deck but at least this card is powerful enough to have a reason to exist.

A weapon makes sense at  damage or  damage but  damage is barely an upgrade over  and youll still be trading almost as much to kill. If this didnt have overload I think it would be fine.

9787397,0,t3_5fdun9,Can grab Neptulon in Wild which will be amusing when it happens.In Standard your card pool is Fireguard Destroyer Elemental Destruction   Ancestral Knowledge  Totem Golem  Doomhammer  Earth Elemental  Flamewreathed Faceless  Feral Spirit  Lava Burst  Lightning Storm  Stormforged Axe  Stormcrack  Forked Lightning  Lightning Bolt  Dust Devil  Jinyu Waterspeaker  Jade Claws  Finders KeepersList should have the stuff rotating out next year at the top to make it easier to filter out if you want to look into the future. Looks like you can get some form of AoE about half the time. Add in the number of single target burn or weaponry and you have about an  chance to get some board control. Another two cards are Taunt Earth Elemental Feral Spirit and then theres random healing or card draw so you have an extremely high chance of getting something a control deck might want at any given moment. Not sure there will be a control deck for Shaman but its not a terrible menu. Just not sure its worth  mana overall.

That would make him more like Loatheb where he could disable your opponents direct removal while he is up giving you a greater tempo game and would make your opponent have to either waste removal to get lucky or fight on board.
