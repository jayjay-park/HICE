130570,0,t3_1vj5yf,It is really not up to the students but to the instructors. Basic oldschool OWD course is done by instructor sitting in the middle and students around him all kneeling on the bottom and repeating what instructor is doing. This teaches Basic safety skills but does not teach anybody TO DIVE.    Newer approach to this many instructors around the world are encouraging is neutral buoyancy and trim from the start. This way students learn proper technique of diving naturally while learning the lifesaving skills. Just a little bit more time in the beginning of pool training to get students comfortable horizontal and neutral will win big prizes when going to open water as divers  not as bottomdwellers.,scuba,cetau2v,1,t5_2qhii

357249,0,t3_1xa8md,I sailed with Blackbeards last March and Im going again this weekend.  Im  and my GF is .  The average age of the divers on our boat was probably  at least.  It isnt luxurious and you dont have much privacy but it is a fantastic way to get in a bunch of dives for a ridiculously small amount of money  less than  for a week of diving  and you can easily do  dives in that time.  The food is plentiful and good not gourmet but no complaints either and they include beer and rum punch in the cost of the trip. After your diving day is over of course!You get a bunk with a curtain for privacy.  It all depends on how picky you are.  If you like camping and make friends easily you might have a fantastic time like me. If you are finicky and dont enjoy being thrown in with  other divers on a  ft sailboat  you might want to spend  times as much for a different boat.  Heres something you should know  the Cat Palu and the Aqua Cat are run by the same people and dive all the same sites.  So you can spend more but the diving isnt any better.  Just depends on what is important to you.  Aqua Cat is . times as much but you get a cabin with an ensuite shower and head plus you can control the AC in your cabin.  Much more elbow room.  Same dives.  Blackbeards attracts college students because they can afford it.  I happen to enjoy college students and took one with me last year.  But the college kids were far outnumbered by us older dudes.  We also had people on board from Argentina France Russia Brazil Canada Utah and Missouri.  All kinds of weird places.  Just like any liveaboard you will meet a lot of divers from all over the world.During spring break you might have a larger number of college students that we had.  Hope that helps.,scuba,cfhsmth,2,t5_2qhii

469630,0,t1_cfrqdiu,The regs dont freeflow like crazy at all.  There is normally a small amount of air flow when cracking the valve as the servo engages this is normal.  Cracking the valve quickly and with the purge engaged you can learn to minimize this. If the reg flows for more than a second or two then you should be concerned and not dive with i.  The low cracking pressure will also cause a flow if you submerge the second stage at a mouthpieceup attitude this is true of many regs.  Ive never had a freeflow as a result of current or shallow water and because of the protected check port they even work fine with DPVs.  There is no requirement to keep your second tank turned off.  I always leave mine open and its never flowed.You will require a seven foot hose for your secondary air source right post but any shop that can service Poseidons or who services technical divers should have no issue setting you up there.In regards to sidemount I like that the first stage is fairly compact.  Also having  LP ports and  HP ports makes hose routing a breeze.  If Im diving leisurely in open water Ill stick my SPGs straight up so pressure information is right in front of you to the right or left.  For confined spaces like caves or wreck you can move them to the bottom so they are streamlined along the tank and less of an entanglement hazard.  This way you can also read tank pressure easily when you have the tank unclipped and swimming with it ahead of you.  The second stage has a very small dead air space which means they are easy to clear when switching regs during a dive. The second stages are also totally reversible and low profile meaning you can secure them in any number of configurations.I think youll come to enjoy the amount of air they deliver.  I find it almost refreshing and you get used to it pretty much immediately.Hope you enjoy the regulators.  Some people will try to tell you why they are unsafe but you should learn for yourself and if you into the actual design and construction of the reg youll find the concerns are generally unfounded.  In addition to this the construction and reliability of the reg is top notch.  Hope this all helps!,scuba,cftnd2k,1,t5_2qhii

Plan on paying cash for gas and needing to drive a manual transmission.  Do at least one night dive.  We have an old copy of Bonaire Shore Diving Made Easy.   Its not strictly needed but you might like to read tips on entries and highlights of each site.  Ive only done one dive on Klein the shore diving is the main attraction as far as Im concerned.  Get takeout from Bobbie Jans and a case of Polar Brite.  Dont bother packing many changes of clothes and dont leave anything in your truck while diving.

The boots and log binder are essentially free.However MaskSnorkelFins are the big money makers for a shop not courses instruction or big ticket items like regs etc. As far as books  is fair for textelearning code  PADI fees. While you could get them anywhere else you will still end up paying the same somewhere else.Is  alone plus there will be a fee when PADI processes the cert as well.In the end diving is a VERY expensive hobby and while I agree dont waste your money.

Dont know! gtBecause GPS signals are not directly receivable under water Navimate functions through use of a small unit that is most commonly hung from a dive boat or buoy the GPS gateway. The GPS gateway has a floating radio antenna in order to determine its exact location and communicates with the wrist units via its underwater transducer portion using acoustic signals. As a result of this communication the wrist units know their range and bearing from the GPS gateway as well as the exact position of the gateway.

1679411,0,t3_2dkwfk,rfreedivingWhere are you located? Predicting viz is kinda hard. Try and find local diving sites which have updated reports. A general rule of thumb is Light offshore winds for a few days with low swell BUT it does vary from place to place.Fitness is critical for freediving and whilst still important less so for scuba. Most good freedivers are skinny as a rake whilst still having exceptional cardio vascular fitness. You are correct in assuming that a large amount of muscle mass or high body mass in general can be detrimental to your O consumption freediving but its not going to really matter at this stage of the game  and it doesnt really matter unless youre trying to smash depth or distance records. Whats more important is training your body to endure high levels of CO low levels of O and lactic acid buildup. You really should do a course freediving or scuba. Both cover the physiology of diving safety etc. But keep in mind that doing a scuba cert wont specifically help your freediving and a freediving cert wont allow you to do scuba.

One thing that may have happened without knowing how long it was out of the water its impossible to say is the shark was still alive and simply wasnt revived properly. Often times to get sharks and other fish to swim off especially after a hard fight or being out of the water too long you can force water over the gills by moving it back and forward in the water think fish cpr.

It effectively holds O at psi and N at psi. Put another way each liter of material holds  L of O and . L of N plus some water molecules so at least your air will be nice and moist.Also wrong. Need to redo this calculation but have to do actual work right now.gt the material concentrates O by a factor of  times the density of O gas at  atmDensity of O at atm is . gL  STP so the claim is that a liter of this material under ideal conditions can hold g of O. An AL of air holds g of O so you need L of this material to hold as much oxygen as an AL of air.Impressions having read the paperEach liter of the nitrate salt of the material weighs about . pounds when full and . pounds when empty. The tetrafluoroborate salt is slightly heavier but not enough that I feel like calculating it out.L equivalent to the oxygen capacity of an AL of the material weighs about .lbs full and .lbs empty. Most of that weight is water thats also trapped in the material.More things You have to heat the most useful salt to C to recover all the gas. Im not putting that on my back.gt Cracking was observed in some crystals especially larger specimens. This must be due to large strain caused by thermal stress and the molecular movement requisite for desolvation and deoxygenation.NOPE.

Are you confident that hell show you how to properly avoid an feet first ascent? Are you confident that that hell teach you how to deal with a catastrophic leak? Are you confident that hell make you practice again and again how to reconnect your inflator hose when your fingers are each an inch thick because of gloves?Im not saying you cant learn from just having a buddy help you. Just like you can learn how to dive from an experienced buddy too.

Ride out to west Baray Lake and go left when you get there there is a cool little temple hidden there watch out for cobras!Phnom Penh is an interesting pace to be. Lots of great food. The Killing fields are very sad. Sihanoukville is one of the two most disgusting places I visited. It is full of backpackers who are drinking too much taking lots of drugs. The beaches are filthy you may want to get tested for hepatitis if you swim there filthy and there are beggars everywhere sexpats with Cambodian women wayy too young for them.The diving is all boat diving. The day trips are apparently not as good as the short live aboard offered I am not sure if it is seasonal. I did enjoy the dive just not Sihanoukville.  I went with a group called The Dive Shop.

3427070,0,t3_2zf9zl,I was just in Bali as a solo diver last month. Lots of dive outfits will want to group you with other people or have a minimum of  person bookings for trips. If you want to go with just a guide on your schedule and dont mind paying for the convenience Id recommend Aquamarine Diving. They were the only ones Ive found that would take me as a solo diver from South Kuta and do solo night diving   other dives on the Tulamben area ended up choosing a night dive at the USAT wreck because I liked it so much in the day. I took a dive boat with them the next day at Blue Lagoon and had the whole dive boat to myself and I got to go as fast or as slow as I wanted ended up faster because I had a plane to catch the next day and wanted to make the  hour window. They picked me up from the resort by car. I suspect drift diving doesnt let you look too closely at marine life so I would recommend the wreck or wall dives over that if youre all about seeing interesting creatures.

4717994,0,t3_3fj0pp,I recommend to most people that they start off cave diving in doubles.

With sidemount you add several more things to the list of shit that you need to worry about. With time and dives most of those things will become second nature with a solid foundations its easy to add new skills.  If you were thinking that you need to be in sidemount configuration due to the size of the cave passages dont be worried about it most of the caves where instructors conduct cave training in are huge.  ,scuba,ctp8pff,3,t5_2qhii

5543780,0,t3_3qjuor,With all due respect please dont put too much emphasis on the cheapest place to get certified.  Theres a number of operators in tourist areas that are concerned about getting you back alive only because dead divers dont make for repeat customers.  When I did my first tourist dives I lucked into Mexican ProDiving in Cozumel and their staff and equipment were pretty darn good.  I next went with a resort operator in the Dominican Republic and pretty much got the minimum training and between myself and my two kids we could have put together a completely broken set of gear.  My depth gauge wasnt working and my sons pressure gauge wasnt reading right.  He ran out at  feet and had to buddy breathe from the DMs tank.  Needless to say he wasnt too pleased about that but his year old self felt much better after a bottle of rum on the boat ride back.  Moral of my ranting  please research your potential instructors and get the best training you can afford.  Typically the training really doesnt vary too much in price in a given area so it shouldnt be much of a difference.  If you find yourself in the Mayan Riviera Ill highly recommend the Mexican Pro Diving company.  I believe theyre owned by a German guy which would explain their attention to detail and boatloads literally of Germans we met on that trip.  And Cozumel is loaded with places new divers can get wet and see cool stuff.  Best of luck to you.,scuba,cwk99g5,1,t5_2qhii
5546573,0,t3_3r3q8o,I have always had a fantastic experience with Ocean divers  dives with them. Their morning dives usually include a deep dive Spiegel Grove Duane Bib. The boats are nice the crew is fantastic and Ive seen people on the boat pair up morningof plenty of times. The instructors I have seen there over the years seem to have a history of sticking around and are always topnotch. As far as a cattle boat goes they fit a lot of people but Ive never found it overcrowded. You will find a lot of other divers in the water but it is largely due to the fact that more than one boat will go to the same reef molasses but a mooring ball or two over. The morning dives I have done with Ocean Divers all seem to beat the other boats out there to the reef so you will get your dive in before everyone else shows up. As far as discovering scuba goes Key largo is a great spot for it. Molasses Reef is the usual spot for some nice shallow dives in  of water and ft viz. currents are also rare. Postdive check out Mrs. Macs Kitchen the original one for key lime pie Hobos for their wings specials and Sharkeys for some good food right there next toabove the dive boatshop.EDIT Shameless link to the most recent Key largo diving video I made for the group I dive there with,scuba,cwklqmr,5,t5_2qhii

5996417,0,t3_3xlan2,Seconding the other opinions to skip on the electronics unless you can get them dirt cheap like under ..The problem with buying other used gear as a beginner is that you are still really dependent on the gear. If you can handle any pretty much anything gear is just there for convenience. Dive enough and everything can happen first stages separating at the yoke or at the swivel is the big Oh Shit! one because instantly you have an open tank shooting at at the back of your head. Gauges that stick are also fun so you can be out of air while your gear says you have  PSI left. If you are comfortable with ascending from an arbitrary depth independent of a buddy and nothing to breathe from then its no big deal to use whatever. If thats not you then if you buy used regs you would be wise to pay to have it overhauled not just checked out. Some of the used stuff I have bought has been downright scary inside. Or just kinda disgusting. Dried vomit inside second stages is pretty standard fare. I am a factory trained gear tech for most manufacturers so for me buying used means something different than it would for others. I have bought used gear that was so corroded inside despite being clean outside that it just ended up being some parts. Thats not a big deal for me cause I can always use the parts. Dive enough in salt water and salt air and UV rays and everything wears out eventually. But for people looking to get their primary setup finding out the first stage body is shot means that the replacement parts basically cost the same as a new first stage.At close to that price range of buying used and paying for an overhaul and maybe potentially being out of luck altogether you could actually go ahead and get some entry level new gear. Cheap stuff still is sold by manufacturers who have to protect themselves from lawsuits. And theres some good knockoff gear coming out of Taiwan these days anyway.This is in fact the season for cheap new gear.Most divers still have their entry level gear even if they move up to fancy stuff later on. I used my first gear til it died even after I had fancy stuff.,scuba,cy5ntaj,1,t5_2qhii

6182257,0,t1_cyrs832,Thank you for a great response. Last night I was ready to just quit. Im still feeling incredibly nervous but willing to consider trying again if I can get anther pool dive session whether I can without fronting a heap more money is still an unknown until Monday. I do apologise in my stress I mentioned needing to hold my breath for the CESA  I was doing the ahhhh thing just couldnt maintain it and needed to take another breath half way through. I was completely comfortable with the general reg breathing the whole day and the instructors were very professional and definitely stuck to strict safety measures. That was just my poor wording. The mask clearing issue was purely an issue with me not being able to switch my breathing from mouth only to out through the nose in through the mouth. Id flood my mask and all thinking went out of my head and Id panic and surface while breathing in water through my nose. In the end I got it with so much intense brain power to get my nose out mouth in breathing right that it was so stressful. I know I can learn to do it but I need much more time and Im far too nervous to be trying to master this skill in the ocean with no quick surfacing nothing to hold on and steady myself when I panic. Im really hoping that the dive company will work a way to let me do the pool session again but because its an all inclusive package Im worried I might not be able to do it all again without paying for the whole lot again  I dont think I can afford to do that while Im still so unsure. Ive already had to spend so much already on a wetsuit I know I wont wear often.,scuba,cyscwnw,1,t5_2qhii

According to the PADI table this puts you into the J pressure group. From there you can just slide your finger across the table until youre at the  column and youll see that a dive to  for  minutes is the same as if you did a dive to  for  minutes. Now add the  minutes for this depth to get .      but since there is no  minutes at  on the table you go to . This puts you in the L group. Now repeat this process for the  depth which puts you at  for  minutes add your  for   on the table and you wind up being in the Q group.Like I said its a little hard to explain without being able to demonstrate but hopefully that helps to understand how its done.,scuba,cz8gjld,-1,t5_2qhii

7522045,0,t1_d2wy2ea,Shark cages arent build with shark attacks in mind because sharks dont attack cages. Steel shark cages are build with two things in mind You need a barrier to deter curious great whites and a barrier is all it has to be because great whites really arent in the habit of attacking cages or divers. Most commercial cage diving out fits will actually let their tourist customers sit on top of the cage to get a better view of the sharks the dive master will only make people go into the cage if one of the sharks present gets too curious. It has to be relatively light weight and fold down to stow easily on the boat. Most shark cages consist of separate sides held together with chain or other connectors.If you want to build a cage thatll hold up to a  pound fish attacking it welded steel bars is entirely the wrong choice of material. Even a modestly sized great white effortlessly wrecks a shark cage from a stationary position when they accidentally get stuk. A  pound fish making an attack run at  miles an hour will fold a welded steel cage like an accordeon. They just dont do it because theyre animals not horror movie monsters.There are stronger safer cages but those are generally not made of steel. The fancier models tend to be transparent cylindrical perspex cages. The smooth round material doesnt give the shark any angles to get stuck get their jaws around or push. Theyre pretty unpopular though because theyre big heavy expensive and utterly unnecessary.Anyway if you think most steel shark cages are designed to be impenetrable you vastly underestimate sharks or overestimate steel.,scuba,d2x7x06,-1,t5_2qhii

7791984,0,t1_d3rqscp,Youre right that nitrox wont prevent narcosis but it should delay its onset by a bit by reducing the partial pressure of the nitrogen. My only point in mentioning it was that we had just arrived at our max depth which was also a bit too shallow for narcosis to really be felt by most individuals. And your dive at ft m would be very shallow for narcosis even in cold water.Another point is that narcosis usually triggers feelings of euphoria. Hypercapnia is also known as Dark Narc because of the dysphoric feelings it produces. If you feel like that again underwater definitely stop and rest as you did because it can cause a blackout which is of course potentially fatal at depth if you spit your reg. Thinking about it now I believe I did end up with a headache following the dive as well. Even though you recall being relaxed I would suspect that there was an issue with your breathing causing you to accumulate CO  either too rapidly or not exhaling fully. In my case I knew I was breathing a bit rapidly but as I counted the cycles per minute on the video I was absolutely shocked to find myself at  cycles per minute.  side note I just reproduced that breathing rate now on the surface and I am feeling rather dizzy as I type this.

The problem is that if you dont dive with people who can show you how to do it then it is very hard.   If you order one online and then put it together yourself without someone who is familiar with it youre going to put it together wrong and everything is going to continue from there.   Story time. One of my buddies from across the country decided he wanted to get a bpw after seeing me diving one on a few trips.   So he orders one.   Next time we go to the carribean he brings it.   Then we spent a few hours taking it apart and putting it back together right.One reason I specifically mention the PADI sidemount class is that it is a particularly egregious cash grab even for PADI.

8543508,0,t3_4ws736,Couple of things I can recommend Start equalizing before descent. Ideally you want to be a bit ahead of equalization curve not behind it. Control your descent speed  slower descent gives your ears more time to adjust.  If your ears start hurting during descent bob up just a bit. Not much  even just a couple feet may suffice to relieve excessive pressure.  Make sure your sinuses arent stuffed  some overthecounter decongestants in moderation andor saline solution rinse before diving sometimes does wonders for me. If you can find them get your hands on some ventilated ear plugs. They slow down pressure changes a bit and also contain bodywarmed water inside your ears instead of letting alwayscold water circulate in and out. Sometimes equalization just doesnt happen. Remember if youre not comfortable diving for any reason abort the dive and live to dive another day.Edit Forgot the basics of course If you have problems equalizing try tilting your head to the side as if trying to touch ear to the shoulder. That may help open up the eustachian tube making equalization easier.Heres some excellent reading on various equalization techniques Hopefully youll find ones that work best for you,scuba,d69ib4g,4,t5_2qhii

8991792,0,t3_5368c3,There are no dive outfits on Sipadan island itself. Only a small military base. Diving in Sipadan must be done as a day trip from Semporna Mabul Kapalai or one of the other nearby islands.Stayed with Scuba Junkies. Theyre a pretty professionally run outfit with great emphasis on safety. Would recommend them. They have locations on Semporna and Mabul. Stayed at the Mabul location which was pretty comfortable but pricey. The Semporna location is supposed to be much more affordable but also mostly just a backpacker location not anything upscale or even mid scale.Its very difficult to just go to a place like Semporna and go straight to Sipadan. There are only about  permits to go to Sipadan daily and these are rationed to the resorts. The resorts will require you to stay  nights before allocating one of these permits to you so unless you want to sit around doing nothing you might as well dive the waters around there like Mabul or Kapalai. It is sometimes possible to buy a single day Sipadan permit from a resort that has extra but this only happens in low season.All that said I would definitely dive MabulKapalai area. Lots of stuff to see and richer than many other locations in Malaysia. It trends more towards macro in that area but you sometimes get the larger stuff. And turtles. There are turtles everywhere. Sipadan is more for the large stuff. In MabulKapalai you spend a lot of time in a single area cause you are looking for the smaller things. In Sipadan you are always moving because theres always big stuff moving around. It can be hit and miss depending on your luck. Some people have managed to go there and miss everything including the jack storm the barracuda storm and all the sharks you could want. Others have been swarmed and have an amazing time. Never heard of anyone missing out on turtles though. You will see so many turtles that you will be sick of them. They will come at you from everywhere in front behind above below etc. ,scuba,d7soaxs,1,t5_2qhii

Then make sure you fold the strap round the front so it does nothing put it on your face and inhale just the slightest trace through your nose. If it sticks on almost zero suck put it in the good pile and try another. Buy the one that sticks with the least suck in a colour that doesnt make you ill. Then wear it with the strap so loose it just stops it flopping down over your nose. Be prepared to say none of these and go to the next place.

Not entirely sure but I think its possible.Its definitely possible to rig a manually controlled mechanical one.gtCages have hatches on the top so you can get in and out easily thats why the divers are out of the cage in the photo. That honestly seems like the best safety mechanism there is. Youre not stuck in the cage.Of course they do but I think youve missed part of the conversation. The underlying assumption above was in response to the idea the cable breaking in itself would bring you to the bottom of the ocean.

10547978,0,t3_5r1jh3,Easy and cheap holiday vids of low quality GoPro with housing.If you want better quality stills the bare minimum camera capability is RAW mode and full manual control over exposure time ISO and aperture. For a beginner I would recommend to go with an older toptier compact model such as the Canon S or above. You can get those second hand in a Canon or Ikelite housing for quite cheap. Another top choice would be the Sony RX but thats already much bigger and somewhat more expensive.Play around for a bit and later you will quickly want to add a tray and arms an underwater wideangle lens or macro adapter and most definitely an external strobe. You might be able to find all of that ready to go for less than k on eBay or Scubaboard.A step up from such a compact setup would be a mirrorless camera such as the micro  Olympus PEN line in an Olympus housing.

10606197,0,t1_dd9gu92,I think it is a bad idea that you go to a awesome area of the world to dive and not do the good dives. The deep dive at blue hole is you all go down in a group. You all come back up as a group. You are not more than m apart. Experienced and new divers can do stupid things at m. They even warn you about some people trying to give their regulator to the fish. People can have shallow water black out even in m of water. Normally your required to do a course to do cave diving. In this case they get around it by saying you can always see natural light. Max depth is m small groups of  people and lack of slit so even inexperienced people cant make it hard to see.,scuba,dd9y518,1,t5_2qhii

Pure aluminum by itself should never corrode but it can corrode in saltwater when combined with other metals basically the metals corrode each other instead of the salt water directly causing the corrosion.  Brass an alloy of copper will definitely corrode over time as will copper.  Pure titanium should be just as resistant to salt water as pure aluminum essentially impervious but titanium is less commonly found pure and is more often an alloy.  Some titanium alloys are impervious and others less so.,scuba,dep76qs,2,t5_2qhii

11263766,0,t3_60qtzt,Always good to see a new diver showing interest in doing things right! The sidemount stuff should be some use shortly apologies for getting stung  its a plague in this industry. He couldve at least sold you a decent sidemount system. There are tons you should avoid so the ones you should go for are  Nitrox Peak performance buoyancy Drysuit Rescue Deep Wreck NavigationOther agencies are doing courses with one or two stages on a single cylinder wing which are there to bridge the gap between recreational and technical diving  theyre fantastic for recreational divers wanting to get a bit more time on a deep wreck and they allow you to rack up a few minutes of deco safely and will do wonders for your dive planning skills. Its all just diving to me now. I wanna explore and get back safely and Ill use what ever fits the bill.Find a good club  school that you can dive with regularly and you can skip navigation as you can be taught these skills whilst actively diving. Drysuit again if you get your own you can skip this one. Its only really renting where I will wanna see a drysuit cert to put my mind at rest.Key is  find a really good instructor. Technical diving backgrounds are ideal in a recreational instructor because they will be very thorough and will teach buoyancy very well. Get on a sidemount course once you have some experience too or sell that shit and dive twins like a proper diver P Im ready for some stick  sidemount is a tool for a job and thats not deep diving. With regards to recreational rebreathers  I think theres still a few years until they get the recreational units on point Im looking at you Hollis with what should have been a product recall but diving in silence is something everyone should experience even if its just a try dive in m.,scuba,df8qcek,10,t5_2qhii

That was the only game in town at the time and I understand that business was bought out and is now called AquaTrec. Looks like they still do certificationsales. If you do OW youll do the OW part at a sort of sand pit lake near Kearney which is about as exciting as it sounds. Still though youll have some skills and a couple dives under your belt so when you get a chance to go somewhere with good sites youll be thinking about sightseeing and improving rather than getting certified. ,scuba,df8s7z5,2,t5_2qhii

My wife already purchased aqualung bcd  she loves it perfect fit and light She did express desire to stick to aqualung equipment which Im ok with. The reason why Im asking about those two is i can get really good prices for either one of those regs. I know they are good regs but honestly pricing is really really good on both cheaper than web. I personally use I dive computer as my backup computer dont judge me for solo diving sometimes . So my experiences I had with aqualung things are positive. ps.

If they mention they need you to do a swim test and theyll get back to you on the days email one of the other dive officers asking if theres any availability for swim tests on the near future and x are your available days.
