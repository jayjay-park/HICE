6387106,0,t1_czfm7rd,Personally it seems like most of her strength comes from the free bleed on normal attacks so Im looking at skills that complement. GM lacerate is obviously in the build so that leaves  free slots.  I have multiple strike in now and it looks even better with the reduced CD so I think Ill keep it. That leaves primal strength primal growth and frenzy out of what seem like the top options. Lacerate  primal strength is the most mana hungry combo Ive seen so until I get the mp regen for it Im thinking regrowth but I could be wrong about that but or any of this.,chromaticsouls,czfnbe8,1,t5_39xi9

6605174,0,t3_4653rs, There are some poor translations in this game undoubtedly done by some poor unpaid intern. From my experience most of the confusion about ATK and damage can be resolved by taking the context into account. i.e. if it makes sense for ATK to be referring to AP then it means AP if not it means Damage.    Not sure about this one there are many factors that come into play and id imagine that some testing will be needed. Sometimes mp regen related essences can help more than raw damage but i guess thats not an issue with brigand.,chromaticsouls,d02j39d,1,t5_39xi9
6651653,0,t3_46psrl,Thanks for the guide Elve !Wave  is also the most dangerous one their Swift Flight is nasty and they tended to use it altogether in one go can be from first turn or any turn if you dont have Steady Battle Line up its a . wipe.Not to mention their baby breaths  turn to cast hit HARD.Wave   watch out for Magic Mirror I was careless and he put it on me FIRST TURN which is also  instant death if you cast any spell.For the Boss you cant dispel it tried with Neutralize so its best to let the stack up to  or  depends on how tough your tank is before interrupting her channeling cant let the debuff stack to  or your tank and others will be hit with massive AoE that will wipe your party I think the AoE she doesthe one that she uses if you interrupt her can be withstand for  turns without nothing but heals more than that it will be very tough and most likely party wipe.Also watch out for a debuff on the boss that restrict your party to only  heal per turn everything counts as a heal EXCEPT if you put Regenerate up before she has the debuff on.She does this after  HP not too sure about this so make sure you have something defensive up your sleeves and as Elve mentioned she will take lots of DMG at this state.,chromaticsouls,d07c6y7,1,t5_39xi9

6885894,0,t3_3ypf9s,I have finally cleared Waterfall and I am on to Gorge. At what point will I start seeing the highlarge material? I have tons of scrolls eating up my slots and no way to use them. As they intended I am sure for lots and lots of money. If I continue exploring Waterfall will I get any there? Almost feels like my maxed II scrolls are getting very weak. ,chromaticsouls,d0wtzrj,1,t5_39xi9
