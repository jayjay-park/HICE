2702859,0,t3_2q8qp8,You should replace your bushings and pivot cups every year anyway but setup is pretty arbitrary.  It all depends on how big you are speed and your personal ride style.  I crank them bitches down hard.  Easiest way to explain it  if either end is sliding too much and you cant control it you need to tighten down.  Not sliding enough loosen it up.  You gotta find that sweet spot thats just right.,freebord,cnbazjh,1,t5_2ryy5

If the cost doesnt matter just go with bamboo you can always pick up a maple another time. I ride my maple just as much as my bamboo. Hope that helps.,freebord,cni3z1n,1,t5_2ryy5
