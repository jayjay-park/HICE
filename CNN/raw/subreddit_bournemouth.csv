Ive known people whove done archaeology in the past and they seemed to really enjoy it too. The homeless people are numerous however theyre some of the nicest homeless people Ive encountered so I dont really mind giving them a bit of spare change... I never do but Im saying that if I did I wouldnt have minded.Good luck with your studies!,bournemouth,d28ov66,1,t5_2rzj6
