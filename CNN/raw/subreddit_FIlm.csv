3568404,0,t1_cpypdpv,I really like Guy! Tom Hanks actually thought he was perfect for the role but didnt hire him based solely on the fact that he looked just like Tom Hanks which I totally agree  he looks like an older version of the kid David Moscow who played him in Big.,FIlm,cpz0x12,1,t5_2qh7m

5486036,0,t3_3q6q8f,Just watch the film and note down anytime they use any film or interview technique to give the impression they did not manipulate events or footage in order to show the whole story as it happened. This might be numerous sound bytes that are appeals to authority e.g. eye witnesses experts etc. Long unbroken takes where little to no editing has taken place to prove whats being seen or heard is truthful. Arguments that deconstruct any possible counter arguments to the narrative being presented.,FIlm,cwcw4ct,3,t5_2qh7m

A Short Guide to Writing About Film by Timothy Corrigan is a great resource.  My favorite collection is Film Theory and Criticism edited by Braudy and Cohen,FIlm,cyx7g2n,1,t5_2qh7m

7772698,0,t1_d3paqka,Nor did I imply that I was a film critic. That Id seen films that had similar sequences to some in the film also having other really predictable scenes it hardly felt original more of a lets shove in the best sequences weve seen in other films and make a new film feel. So sure thats my opinion. Doesnt make me a bad guy just someone who watches films. Apologies if I triggered some deeper filmexpert nerve in you mate.,FIlm,d3poypt,2,t5_2qh7m
