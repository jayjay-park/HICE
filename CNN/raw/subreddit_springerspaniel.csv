365932,0,t1_cfhlmqq,gt I believe I am an exception and that my springer may be inbred. I dont know if thats the reason although inbreeding a few generations back is not too uncommon in showline springers it contributes to the arthritis and back problem tendencies later in life.Its probably just hyperactivity and not enough socialization to release it. I made the mistake of not socializing mine when he was young to be fair I got him at  and later in life he was completely reliant on me for stimulation and company. That was fine since I would never have given him away no matter what but when I was away from him at college and later when I had to work long hours it was hard on him.If you can join a private dog park where they check out all the members behavior and immunizations. Or if you know someone with wellbehaved dogs bring yours around them. Dont be surprised if he has a rough start the first few times or if he ends up being dominated by other dogs  springers are eager to please by nature so theyll often submit. Best thing to do is separate yourself and dont engage with your dog or any of the others just let them work out their hierarchy. Stick with it! In the long run your dog will be much happier when hes able to regularly interact with other dogs and it will tone down his anxiety a lot.,springerspaniel,cfiozv6,1,t5_2t8om

1556387,0,t3_2c27gx,Mine walks wonderfully on a harness but I started him on whistle recall training when I got him . years old at the time and he picked it up very quickly. He can run and sprint in the woods but I whistle and he comes back immediately. I also let him go straight out in front of me then would call him back when he got to the max distance I liked. He now stops about that distance and waits for me to catch up or tell him he can keep going.,springerspaniel,cjbd7jn,1,t5_2t8om
2989161,0,t3_2uc0j3,Love this! I can only imagine the constant thwack thwack thwack of that tail wagging! Mine were docked when I got them or I would have asked them to have their tails. ,springerspaniel,co7to0q,2,t5_2t8om
3148226,0,t1_coo8ega,Is he good about not chewing on things and staying within earshot if off leash?Im in NM.  I grew up with a springer but have had brittanys for the last  years.  I have an  month old brittany at the moment that kind of hyper isnt a problem as long as he comes when called even at distance.  I go running or hiking out in the desert and mountains a couple times a week and dont use a leash so its important that he comes back when called and stays within earshot of the group would ease him into that but the potential should be there.  My two older brittanys passed away in the fall and its been a little too quiet with just the puppy so I could conceivably give him a home.Guess I should ask if he is good or you think hed be good around catschickenshorses.,springerspaniel,coob6nv,1,t5_2t8om
3818979,0,t3_343h3o,My male did this as a younger dog lt. Hed growl if someone came near if he had a bone to chew on.Im not super sure this was the correct response on my part but I just wound up going the dominant route. I corrected him verbally effectively demanded he drop it and won the battle of wills. I took away the bone and put him in a time out in his kennel with a stern hand.Basically the message was you dont get to growl at people and be guardey and if you do you get punished and the thing youre punishing gets taken away.,springerspaniel,cqrlevp,1,t5_2t8om
