213283,0,t3_1wk8jn,Dez led Maryland scoring with  points. The team shot  from the field  from   from the line.The Terps were outrebounded  but only committed  turnovers with  steals.Cleare saw spares minutes with Turgeon opting for a rotation of big men.,terps,cf2qkhi,4,t5_2thnf

2632866,0,t3_2q16r5,Terps played some great D and rebounded very well for s of the game.Packs threes were open looks so I cant fault him for taking them.Too many turnovers when they were trying to close out the game. Didnt look like there was a well defined play to beat the press.Trimble was clearly frustrated early with the  on  pressure but started handling it better as the game went on. Thats also something teams arent going to be able to do when Dez gets back on the floor.Thanks for the recap look forward to more!,terps,cn28zin,3,t5_2thnf
5216671,0,t3_3mexc8,The key to his game is turnovers and special teams. If Caleb can have a good game and limit his mistakes and we get a turnover or  on defense and if they are dumb enough to kick to Will maryland has a good shot. I got faith in the Teps and Im betting on them I just dont see WVU covering that spread,terps,cvesuu8,1,t5_2thnf
