1546093,0,t1_cj9e00k,You are right that was a huge spoiler.  I always like to note where the cover illustration comes up in the story.  I have found that most of them are near the middle or end of the book.  Some covers like  The Phantom Freighter dont actually depict any specific scene from the book. ,hardyboys,cja2rel,2,t5_31njz
