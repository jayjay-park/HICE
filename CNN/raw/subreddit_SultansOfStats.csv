304029,0,t1_cf3jf6n,i agree with your points regarding all  of your points and alsoi like QS|SV|WHIP|K|ERA|HLDand OBP|HR|R|SB|RBI|SLGso x QS over Wins at least the pitcher has control the lesser of two evils Adding Holds for the upper division OBP instead of Avg because walks should count for something. In a points league they get you a point it should be worth something in roto too SLG i like either slugging or OPS but if OBP is factored in its own category adding OPS would be redundant as the difference would only be SLG so cut out the middle man. I would also be okay with total bases or even better XBH,SultansOfStats,cfca2ox,1,t5_2vmi6

586563,0,t3_20ukeg,Im keeping track for my own purposes. Ill try and throw something together after all the drafts with some neat analysis once the season starts.,SultansOfStats,cg6y2sd,9,t5_2vmi6
737757,0,t1_cgo4k7e,Im pretty happy with it C  Carlos Santana Rd  B  Edwin Encarnacion Rd  B  Ian Kinsler Rd  SS  Starlin Castro Rd  B  Aramis Ramirez Rd  OF  Mark Trumbo Rd  OF  Carlos Beltran Rd  OF  Nick Swisher Rd  U  Chris Carter Rd  U  Torii Hunter Rd Also in the mix are Asdrubal Cabrera Rd  and Dee Gordon FA.  Plus Jurickson Profar Rd  on the DL.  I have a ton of flexibility to work guys into empty spots on off days  guys can play B  at B  at SS  at B  in the OF.  Not the best offense in the world but I got a lot of the guys I was targeting at good values.  Also I just traded Addison Reed and Emilio Bonifacio for Craig Kimbrel so my pitching got a little bit better   Plus waiting on Kershaw to come back still...,SultansOfStats,cgo4y2a,1,t5_2vmi6

3568002,0,t1_cpy93ho,He went late th in our draft last night and I almost took him at mid  but thought hed slide to mid . The downside of taking him at  is thats pretty close to equal value. Which isnt a bad thing just that he has to have a good year to get any ROI. ,SultansOfStats,cpyz9hh,1,t5_2vmi6

4574991,0,t1_ct7a982,Yep most likely. I said it in my other comment in a few too many words but all we can do is attempt to settle any debates as to who actually owns schwarber if both guys are rostered in a league. Everything else will be handled by fleaflickerIll adjust rosters if need be.,SultansOfStats,ct7ab1i,2,t5_2vmi6

6946587,0,t1_d13nqh0,I added notes to the original comment so people know that they signed up for the wrong draft. Also the draft on the st has  open spots currently so you shouldnt have any trouble signing up.,SultansOfStats,d13q5ot,1,t5_2vmi6

11363635,0,t1_dfjztbq,thanks I was pretty happy when the injured guys fell so far figured someone else would have been willing to take a chance earlier.im a little concerned about my ability to compete in saves and holds but I think I can win some batting categories and maybe trade some OF depth for relief pitching later in the season.also I have literally no depth at any infield position so that could be an issue,SultansOfStats,dfk1oj6,2,t5_2vmi6
