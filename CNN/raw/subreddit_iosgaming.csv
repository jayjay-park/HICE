72398,0,t1_celrioq,It got up and working today finally! So it looks like theres a assistant management part to the game where basically there are collectable and boostable sidekicks you can equip to give you small bonuses to not taking damage or what have you. And theres the option to add a friends ally or random stranger each time you go out so theres the online component. Im assuming the microtransations are completely ignorable to beat the main game and they have daily mini quests too from the looks of it.,iosgaming,cemo6nb,1,t5_2sc2s

325141,0,t3_1xrbxa,the ipad and ipad mini used to be very different spec wise while gen ipad has a chip and all the new goodness where ipad mini  was running a non retina display with previous years specs. Nowadays with ipad air and mini  the specs are exactly the same. They are both high end with A chip retina display and all the new hotness. There is only one or two things you have to decide on between the current ipad air and ipad mini  is size and money. spec wise exactly the same and both the same for gaming. The differences are ipad air of course bigger but both are light. ipad air starts at  bucks and ipad mini  starts at  so you have to decide is screen size more important or does saving  bucks matter more cause thats the only difference. In my personal case i chose ipad airActually one other thing to note ipad air and mini  have same resolution so your getting higher pixel density on ipad mini ....i believe ipad air ppi is like  and ipad mini  is like ppi just something to think about and also ipad mini  is great for portable gaming on the go.,iosgaming,cfegzbp,2,t5_2sc2s

It can never match the performance of a native game nor can it use all the features to enrich the gaming experience.

So currently you can actually start min turn limit games with your friends.As for the random games you can only start games with hour turn limits for now. Were literally dying to enable the min mode for random games as well because like you said its more fun playing faster. Its just that we havent been getting enough new players throughout the day fast enough to actually support that quick of a game time. The games fail because players are stuck matching for a little over  min.Were a man indie studio and working to market the game the best we can and as soon as its getting enough traffic throughout the day its a matter of us flipping a switch to enable the min turns. Its been growing really steadily so hopefully we can flip that switch in the near future. Now if only we could get Apple to feature the game D,iosgaming,cgvho5x,3,t5_2sc2s

991394,0,t3_25dcke,This article hits home for myself we are developers of a game that started off by as a very successful flash game and has been cloned hacked and claimed by several indie devs both in the online world and now mobile.The problem goes beyond cloning it seems that it is this recent act of small developers taking other small developers work and claiming it as their own thinking that the risk of copyright infringement is low enough or worth the risk to earn the potential quick buck that the app stores are currently pushing through. In fact one developer has been stupid enough to take actual assets from our games sounds  icons etc and push that to the app store.Anyways that is just my rant.We currently have an iOS app store version in development but our game is currently playable on all iOS devices through the web here FreeRiderHD.comI wont bother mentioning the clones as I do not feel inclined to give free publicity but searching rider in the stores and if it is a stickman on a bike most likely you will find that all drawing tools icons and boosts are shared with Free Rider which was released and iterated on since .I will break off a separate post to link to Free Rider HD for feedback  comments.,iosgaming,chgz8wf,1,t5_2sc2s

1117333,0,t1_chuu8g3,Just to chip in my two centsFF is by far the higherquality port but FF I think is a better game mainly because FFs riskreward balance turns to crap later on in the game where the strongest random encounters stop giving experience for no good reason and the strongest enemies that do give experience dont give very much.Id also throw in FF Dimensions and say its the most enjoyable compared to FF simply because it was made from the groundup the sprites are more faithful to the original SNES roots the controls and touch screen menus are better it runs better and has cooler spell effects the character customization is better its an expansion of FFs system and the music is in my opinion superior gasp!!. Theres also War of the Lions which is a kickass port with some very minor gripes the text is very small on iPhone and the controls for scrolling menus takes a bit of getting used to but ends up being faster than using a dpad. It also fixed the horrid fps cap on spells that was present in the PSP version and adds free camera rotation and zooms during battle instead of the preset cameras in previous versions.,iosgaming,chvau6b,3,t5_2sc2s

Visuals look much worse than modern combat  Overall animations and action sequences feel crappy I dont see how they released this. Its just sloppy really takes any Emerson right out.On a side note the frame rate is good on my iPhone s but textures and visuals still look terrible.Lastly why do the guns sound so bad? Not to mention every gun feels so limited when it comes to fire rate.Should you buy it? Well not right now but I fear they may never fix these issues. Lastly there are no graphic settings in this game so you cant turn anything down although it feels like the graphics are at minimum already.Ps This is the most energy sucking app I have ever used also turns phone and iPad into mini space heaters.,iosgaming,cj758s2,1,t5_2sc2s

2406161,0,t1_cm93lk8,At mobile there are barely any games that does IAP well.  for a hero? Really? I aint gonna pay for that because not everyone stays in a developed country where  is nothing. It means a hell lot more for me as  in my country I can get a decent meal with it than some in game currency. If not ask me grind a mission for some of those gems so that I can buy power before starting a game? Why is it so tedious?IAP compromises the game design. If Kingdom Rush was released  years back without IAP heroes will be unlockables while the game will be difficult but fair without forcing you grind for gems to progress. I played their previous game and it left a very sour taste in my mouth.There are no good reasons to have IAP other than as a way for them to make more money with little effort. The whole game cost  to buy why is the cost of a hero cost more than an entire game? Or In game gems IAP cost a few times more? Downvote me if you want I dont buy games that is packed with IAP.The game itself is great as its one of the best TD i ever played but the IAP business model is extremely exploitative with little to offer.,iosgaming,cm93zi5,0,t5_2sc2s

2842406,0,t3_2smw3r,It really depends on what kind of game youre making. For games where each round is fairly repetitive e.g. match  games runners and some platformers it actually helps retention a lot by adding limits but not because of the reasons most people think.The common belief is that adding limits will merely split the total time the player will spend playing the game over the number of sessions needed based on the limits placed. However what tends to happen is that limits decrease burnout on the gameplay mechanics and increases anticipation for the next session that it actually increases total time spent playing the game.However if your game requires skill building or immersion adding these artificial limits will be hugely detrimental to the experience.,iosgaming,cnr6gyi,3,t5_2sc2s

3024518,0,t3_2upcz6,Hello.  I wanted to give my feedback I hope I dont come off as too harsh.  Here are the major issues I have noticed with the site in no particular order  There is WAY too much white space.  Most of your page is simply blank.  If you are concerned about mobile users make a separate mobile site view.  There is not nearly enough content.  This may not be an issue once you are running for a while but currently there is very little value in stopping by a site that indexes so few games.  The content you have provides insufficient information.  For example the description of the game RABBL is  characters.  That simply isnt enough for me to make an informed judgement about the game.  I dont know if it would be to my taste I dont know what games are similar I dont know what the bias is of the person reviewing.  There simply is insufficient information.  The information is presented in a very awkward format.  It is difficult to read the information on your site.  Everything being center justified is unattractive and feels unnatural.  The site navigation is awkward and difficult to find.  Coupling part of your site navigation to mouse hover makes it awkward for mobile users.  The hover state makes the the navigation more difficult to find and adds no value.  Your navigation bar blends in with the other text on the site.  Your navigation bar should stand out from the background of the site and be very clear and should require the least amount of hoverclicks.Again I hope I did not come off too harsh.  I am a professional web developer so I am probably a bit more critical than your average user.  Good luck with your site gents!,iosgaming,cobhlae,2,t5_2sc2s

As far as then following the market is mostly due to too many players kids and parents are the exact reason for the freemium cr a p that keeps being at the top in the ApoStore. Everyone freaks when any hard working developer actually wants to eat and pay their own bills. Instead its a OH My GODdddddddd!!!!!! Those bastards! They are charging me . for a game! How dare they! They must burn!!!! and make holy crusade to lower quality game ratings making up multiple false games of something being junk and preventing any possible success great games with no bull sh it garbage IAP while Bitcoin Billionaire and similar get constant  star rave reviews that top the store. Want to solve the problem? Easy. Start by looking at the pay once and play area on the AppStore.  Spend your money on those games and start a trend by wrecking the train wreck of IAP based games. Which makes more sense especially since many socalled AAA PSXbox games cost . spend . or . to buy a full game no ads no IAP garbage? or end up spending well over . in the months you play a free game full of ads user tracking user spying etc. for fictional lunch boxes weapons cheats paytowin junk? Its simple look for and spend your real money on games that show real support for those that arent forced into IAP pay to win trash.

Since theres one fewer dimension to explore it feels like theres less exploring and more crafting.  Of the three Junk Jack X is probably strongest on the crafting axis.  The developer has a LOT of recipes and they often release updates that add new ones.You might also like Doodle God and its variants.  You start with just a few elements and you have to figure out how to combine them to make new things which in turn combine to make even more things.

Alternatively if its very far forward it can be better to go for the border expansion rather than the pop expansion as you can get  super units from the additional tiles.Also remember to hold the wonders the things that give  pop for completing some task in reserve to either push out the borders of a poorly situated city or to pump out an extra super unit.With this strat Ive had multiple runs where Ive gotten perfect completion all enemies eliminated whole map explored full tech tree researched even with  enemies.Of course it also depends a bit on RNG on how your enemies are placed.,iosgaming,d1bj7m9,6,t5_2sc2s

8552556,0,t3_4we4om,Im in the same boat too. Ive played Arcane Legends for over a year and now Ive gotten to a certain point in the game where Ive hit the paywall  I just cant do it so Ive deleted the game after reaching character level . Maps quests amp guilds were great fun but the crafting part for better gear etc and the ALMIGHTY task of map grinding becomes like a full time job. So Ive been searching for something to quench my mmorpg thirst. Ive been playing HIT Heroes of Incredible Tales and its ok but theres no maps like in Arcane Legends just some kind of single player story levels. The addition of auto battle and auto skill buttons make it way too easy. You just sit there in your lazy moments eating a sandwich grinding your way through the levels totally void of involvement with the game. I think I may delete it. Theres guilds and guild raids but Ive not found a guild thats particularly active. The pw element will come eventually too here I think. So one other that Ive had my eye on but not downloaded yet is Darkness Reborn. Ive watched a few YouTube gameplay videos and watched the AppStore advert for it. It seems ok.

8884455,0,t3_51ws9h,Ive been playing Solitairica this week and have been loving it. Mechanically its really different from Downwell but it has a lot of structural similarities that scratch the same itch. Its a solitaire game so it plays really similar to something like Fairway Solitaire except with a roguelike structure to the progression. Each round youre collecting currency that you can use to buy upgrades for your current run as well as an overall currency that you can use to unlock permanent upgrades like new decks classes like warrior wizard rogue etc. new cards that work like powerups and that kind of thing. Also once you die your run is over and you start from scratch again just like Downwell.Its really good. If youre into these kinds of games Id say drop the  on this game. There are no in app purchases so the economy of the ingame currency is based on how well you play not a slow trickle that urges you to spend money. ,iosgaming,d7fsb66,3,t5_2sc2s
