1627617,0,t1_cjkbivd,And whats inconceivable to me is that you think on the grand scope of things vets have to learn and deal with that lowly nail trims are so dang high on their minds. You think they devote even a days worth of schooling to that? Im saying its so insignificant in the range of what they have to deal with and worry about that they dont think about it the way I and my equivalents across the world do. YOU are the only one trying to equate anything. It is probably . of their time and money and problems vs almost  of a groomers. Is it so unbelievable that we pay more attentionspend more time dealing with it?? Numbers made up obviously but come on. Like you said they are diagnosing treating operating all that recognized life saving they are not sitting around their office thinking about dremeling. The title seems more important to you than me as I mentioned it once in passing and you have typed it out three times. I was simply trying to illustrate quickly that I personally spend ALOT of time focusing my entire braindead brain on it to complete strangers without giving a life history. Holy crap though and if they ever have a competition for it Id be happy to earn it legimately just for you. Im the least snobby person seriously you think people dont get defensive when one of the first things out of your mouth keyboard is to put my career in quotes belitting the entire industry while simultaneously accusing me of not even holding that job at all? Then you implied I had no experience with Frenchie types yet there are Frenchies in our logo and all over everything and they are heavily infused in my life just short of living with one. Im human I was offended at your assumptions. To another of your points a HUGE amount of people dont deserve their pets in our opinion but we cant change that. I never said I save a life every day you are giving expansion to what Im saying across the board. ,frogdogs,cjkbr0a,1,t5_2sngw

6461524,0,t1_cznd82f,Its actually very bad for them especially as puppies. They can get worms from ingesting feces.Mine did this too at about the same age and he got a really bad case of round worms.My suggestion to OP is to just try your best to clean it up as soon as she does her business and for fucks sake potty train her to go outside! I understand certain circumstances but that should be at the top of your priorities when getting a puppy.,frogdogs,cznny5x,1,t5_2sngw

7002886,0,t3_4bhaxz,Everyone else is addressing your lifestyle but I want to address the breeder. Please for your sake and your new puppys make sure this is a reputable breeder. All health testing MUST be done pedigree should have title dogs and bitches and get references. Do not get caught up in getting a Frenchie quickly because reputable breeders almost NEVER have puppies readily available so this is a massive red flag. Make sure they do not breed for fad colors blue chocolate and blackamptan and offer a health guarantee. Get copies of all health testing for both the sire and the dam. If they dont have any of these things I mentioned do not get a puppy from them. I know waiting sucks but with Frenchies you almost always have to. I waited about a year for my first one and am now waiting on my second. Its not something to be taken lightly. These dogs are a manmade breed and are medical nightmares when taken from poor breeders. They are unfortunately popular and people see dollar signs instead of giving a damn about the quality of the breed. I wish you the best of luck but I cannot stress enough how important the quality of the breeder is. It will come back to haunt you if you pick someone irresponsible and it will cost a fortune and likely the health of your dog. I am in the veterinary field and see this all the time it is heartbreaking. ,frogdogs,d1a4e8u,2,t5_2sngw

7435295,0,t1_d2mxr31,Anything other than basic checkups I go down to the University vet specialists.

I was depressed until I could get a second opinion at the neurologist. Within seconds of looking at my dog she corrected the local vet.  years later and my buddy is still rocking it.,frogdogs,d2ncg50,3,t5_2sngw

9255209,0,t1_d8o4x5z,From what I understood the dogs in the cargo area are not in the exact same one than the luggages simply because they would die by lack of oxygen and the cold. However their area is adapted for living creatures. In case it helps we took our frenchie to Spain on an h flight in the cabin. Went well. Most companies accept small pets as long as you let them know at booking time and have some sort of temporary certification that the dog is healthy from a certified vet thats for international flights no document is required for domestic flights,frogdogs,d8p5xh2,1,t5_2sngw

10653221,0,t3_5sdjsv,Ive never known anyone to request a dog stops playing because of a growth. Maybe let that have some foundation before you start worrying about it. My dog started getting warts about  years ago. I hate when they form on her head but it seems to be to do with her immune system  so they come and go. Is your dog getting a good diet? I tried the oil thing youre talking about and it didnt do anything. Working on her health and fitness seems to be working for her  apart from one huge ugly black oilleaking wart on her back that Im going to ask the vet to cut off. Ive stopped caring about it being nothing to worry about. Its gotten so big that people are stroking her and catching it causing her to snap at them. The other warts though  theyre just pink and fairly small and dont seem to bother her at all. If its really not bothering your dog you might have to learn to love it. ,frogdogs,ddesqag,3,t5_2sngw
