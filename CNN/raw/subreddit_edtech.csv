1315042,0,t1_cihcqmi,Thanks  let me try to give you an idea of our thought process and vision in creating Chalkup. Its all about improving student outcomes. We need to try and do everything we can to have a more engaging user experience for students. Letting students ask questions work with other classmates and share interesting content is only the beginning. We have a really big vision on how we can improve a modern students learning experience More info here If we can take some of students time away from twitter fb instagram reddit etc and move to a place where they can informally talk about questions theyre having and continue to think about their schoolwork at any time of day  we believe that we can actually move the needle on engaging students. The student usage of Chalkup is unbelievable and we think its because finally students have a voice. Students study together on Chalkup create flashcard decks and are genuinely more organized when all of their assignments and todos are organized in one place. Having a vehicle for students to get unstuck is really important when working on schoolwork especially outside the classroom. Classes are just more connected on Chalkup. Were so excited about the future for Chalkup and we hope you will take a deeper look.,edtech,cihk4xx,1,t5_2r5zc

Why there is a lack of technology involved for this social studies topics ?  students thinks this topic is not problem solving like math or experimental like science how can you  make this topic interesting using technology?

2552953,0,t1_cmrsyff,These are some fair criticisms. I am actually not  sold on SMART boards. They have some good features but they are not something that Id use all the time. I think we need to have boards that can have  or  students working on them at one time. I find SMART boards all too often lead to a lesson where one student is interacting and  students are passively watching. I would have suggested an iPad but I think the post said that the administrator had already stated no more iPads.,edtech,cmrt394,1,t5_2r5zc

4807804,0,t1_cu007uv,Yep basically. Its like the opposite of photosphere pictures. Instead of focusing outward and getting all angels around you you focus inward at an object. Take a bunch of pictures it tracks the angels you have and still need then upload them and it compiles me. In my tests Ive made one with as few as  pictures and another with . Obviously the more pics the better but then it takes longer to upload and create depending on your internet connection.

4815706,0,t1_cu0kadx,gt www.dapp.comGallerycatchNeat! I feel like that is a great low cost solution for teachers since the scanners arent exactly the cheapest tech and most scans probably dont need to be too accurate for most purposes. Do you find that you have to be careful with how you take the photos to position your camera in just the right way or does it track the angles well enough that even if you move the camera further away it will still give an accurate model?,edtech,cu1k4wc,1,t5_2r5zc

6155368,0,t3_3zs2h8,This is essentially what I do! MeetUps EduCamps Twitter chats design thinking workshops Hangouts online communities beernbull sessions... You name it  if I havent already done it Ive at least thought about it.So if youre starting out fresh without any established audience here are some things that youll want to consider. Drum up some enthusiasm! This is a new opportunity for people to influence their environment. Make sure they know this. Use personal networks contact school admins professional organizations use social media. Figure out where your potential audience hangs out in cyber amp meatspace and go to them.. Give your audience an opportunity to have some input. What would they want to discuss at such an event? What would they want to share from their own experience? What would they want to take away from the event?. For a location find some neutral ground where at least most of your audience will feel comfortable. I work at a national university in a small country. We often host our events at the university. Most of our audience knows it knows their way around and is comfortable there most of them are studying or have studied there.. Make a tentative agenda so that people know what to expect and can decide whether it suits them or not. Now heres where it gets tricky. You want to attract a very broad audience  you want everyone from the knowitalls to the stragglers curious about IT but havent made any major leaps yet. Include some talking points in your agenda in the form of openended questions i.e. that cant be answered with a simple yesno. Make sure that your questions are formulated in a way that invites response from everyone that you want to include. For example dont ask Should tablet computers be used at school? Thats a yesno question. People tend to be very economical in their responses so in their minds theyre just going to respond yes or no and decide that the meet up has no relevance for them. Also the question asks specifically about school. That could dissuade people who are involved in education but not in schools. So a better example might be How do tablet computers affect learning?. That gets people thinking and when they start thinking they want to tell someone about it or here someone else tell them about it. Youre offering a forum where people that are so inclined can speak up and others can listen and learn. Now that youve piqued peoples interest you want to make sure that youre getting all of the people that you want to attend. The ones who want to learn are going to come just to learn. The ones that consider themselves to be ahead of the pack might need some more persuasion. Include an edgy forwardlooking question  one that brings up a topic concerning emerging or projected technologies. Like How does wearable computing eg. smartwatches Google Glass affect the learning environment? Now youre raising even the most stubborn eyebrows... Finally you might want to encourage members of your potential audience to bring their favorite tech toys to the meetup.. Think about how you might make the event accessible for people who cant show up at the venue social media recordings to go online etc... Make sure that people know that this will be a possibility when you promote the event. But you might also want to subtly make the point that they can follow what happens from afar but cant directly participate. You dont want to give people too much of an excuse for not showing up.Feel free to PM me if you have any commentsquestions.,edtech,cypaua6,2,t5_2r5zc

8778866,0,t3_50bko6,There are apps out there that use spaced repetition to help people learn but really thats step three. To memorize anything I usually teach three steps. Make it not abstractmake it visual etc. You can do this by rhyming using the Major System for numbers etc. What visual does the word remind you of?.  Connect it to something you know or have access to. If youre trying to memorize a list of items and know already a visual list of pegwords its real easy to connect the images together and know the list backwards and forwards. When youre memorizing someones name take the image you got from rhyming or thinking of their name and slap it on their face focusing on what strikes you about their face..  Repetition and review. The stronger steps one and two are the less you have to rely on step . But heres where spaced repetition apps will come in handy.So for enjambment I think of a jar of jam. Its the first thing that comes to my mind and I find that thats usually the best thing to go with. Google tells me that enjambment is in verse the continuation of a sentence without a pause beyond the end of a line couplet or stanza. so I think of jam oozing between sentences sticking them together. After writing that out on a flashcard or some such app Ill have it pretty solid.Id teach those kids the theory and then have them run wild with it on their own time.But to close this out and keep it with the topic of the subreddit memrise.com is a community of people who make and share lists of things to memorize and mnemonics to help do so. Im pretty sure theres apps for it on Android and iOS!,edtech,d7310gh,1,t5_2r5zc
