7994930,0,t1_d3hphds,Ive played Crusader and recently Crusader  and I like  better. Crusader  is just outdated at this point although Extreme was awesome. On that note its unlikely their d engine could handle an extreme version of the game which is what I consider the worst aspect of .I bought all of the DLC to support FF but I also get some good skirmishes and AI so its not like I did it solely to support FF. I dont consider myself opinionally challenged whatever that is I just enjoy the game and want to support the devs so theyll continue making Stronghold games.The only way well see more Stronghold is to support them. Theyve done a really good job with SHC I think you should both revisit  and see if you cant find some good in it.,stronghold,d4epfd6,1,t5_2s7jv
