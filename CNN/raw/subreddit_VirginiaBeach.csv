I have had  different roasts from these guys and they were all excellent.,VirginiaBeach,chjyas4,2,t5_2rzc0

4170292,0,t3_38gq8q,I will also put my vote in for First Landing especially if you have kids. The bay beach is great and they rent kayaks SUPs and have lots of activities if you want them. If you are tent camping this is definitely the pick. ,VirginiaBeach,crvmddh,1,t5_2rzc0
4745017,0,t3_3fwqlt,I stayed there one night a few years ago with a small group of people for something of a birthday party specifically because of the jacuzzi tub. I was not the one who rented the room. The room was decent had a balcony facing the ocean nothing noticeably dirty or problematic and the tub worked fine even overloaded with people so I didnt have any complaints. I never ventured elsewhere in the hotel just straight to and from the room so I have no idea as far as amenities or the pool or anything else. ,VirginiaBeach,ctsnk7b,3,t5_2rzc0

7298683,0,t1_d26x240,Just to add to this while you will hear jet noise no matter where you live in Virginia Beach there is a huge difference in the decibel levels depending on where you are. Occasionally during the day I hear a random jet in the distance but never has one woken me from sleep or has someone on the other end of a telephone asked me if I am in an airport. This PDF  will highlight the noise areas which will help you decide what youre willing to put up with. Right near the base can be rough with you literally unable to hear your own thoughts while I am almost in Chesapeake and almost never think about the jets. ,VirginiaBeach,d27t6yr,3,t5_2rzc0

9662483,0,t3_5dbsm3,Night life Id choose Norfolk on any day. They have more of local surprises more things to see and shows more of the love for Virginia. VB is good place for home and thats it. They turned down the light rail transportation from Norfolk downtown to VB because... I dunno they just want to stay conservative ,VirginiaBeach,da43qa7,8,t5_2rzc0
9691337,0,t3_5dbsm3,Norfolk for nightlife but holy shit does peabodys throw down. Ill hate on Peabodys all day long but they have HUGE acts coming through. tg planet was just here with lvmberjack.
