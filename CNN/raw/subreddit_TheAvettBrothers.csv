8009661,0,t3_4owvk6,Aint No Man I feel the same way about this as I have since its release. Not a fan of the lyrics or the clapping. Pretty weak to me. Overall not one Ill skip but also not one Ive gotta hear. Mama I Dont Believe Really good song. Reminds me a lot of Tom Petty. Enjoyed the banjo and piano. The guitar Seth lays down is pretty solid as well. No Hard Feelings enjoyed this song as well. Thought the lyrical content was very well written. Reminds of some older songs and you cant go wrong there. Smithsonian I like this song. I just dont like the this recording. Drums seemed off and seemed to speed the song up. Was not a fan of Tanias vocals at all. This receding lacked the passion that Scott gives live and that can clearly be heard on the last verse. You Are Mine Laughed as soon as the banjo opening was over. This song is an absolute joke. The synth in this was awful.  Also thought the lyrical content was weak. This is probably the worst song they have ever made in my opinion. Satan Pulls the Strings This version isnt bad. Unlike the synth in You Are Mine this was done alright. Never really been a fan of this song. The song is much better live. True Sadness Great song. Nothing to be said. I Wish I Was Again another great track which I expected. Fisher Road Waited a long time for this and was pleased. Easily my favorite and its not close. Only issue I have is that Scott seems turned down a little bit. Victims of Life Catchy song. However it is very similar to PGFSD and ATB. Not gonna skip it but not gonna seek it out. Divorce Separation Blues Been a fan since day one of this song. Still think it lacks the passion of the live version but what can you do? May it Last Not a bad song. Out out of the effect heavy songs this is the best. Overall the album is ok at best. Rick Rubin really overproduced the album. The flow of the album is nonexistent. But you win some and you lose some. ,TheAvettBrothers,d4gd09v,5,t5_2sc3d
8014238,0,t1_d4gd09v,I too loved Seths electric on Mama. Thought that sounded awesome. ,TheAvettBrothers,d4gvide,3,t5_2sc3d
8014486,0,t3_4owvk6, for me on this. Lyrically I think most these songs are very very good. Musically some of them have branched out further then we are all used to but they seem like they are having fun. I think we all agree this band is much better stripped down.    ampnbspMy takes belowampnbspSong | Review||Aint No Man|We knew what we were getting with this one. I think this could have been SO much better without the effected claps. This will always be built to be played live  |Mama I Dont Believe|Love the harmonica punchy bass and and the natural drums. Lyrically I think this is a gem  |No Hard Feelings|Another great song because less is more with these guys. Love the off beat rhyme scheme in the verses poetry vibe here and the building stringsbanjoorgan.  |Smithsonian|I think they found the balance of production on this one. Love the strings on this one drums are a little quick.  Scott sounds asleep and the bathrooms a bar verse always kills me on this one..  |You Are Mine|Just Strange. Lyrically I think its great just feels like it was pieced together by a high school DJ.  |Satan Pulls The Strings|Knowing where it could have been this is just really bad. I do really like the funky effected bass groove around  just not for this.  |True Sadness|Lyrically another amazing song might be my favorite. Feel like if they toned down the intro effects it would be even better. The bottle and bottle rhyme is growing on me  |I Wish I Was|A clear standout their emotion shows through. We knew what we were getting with this one just glad Ricks fingers didnt find this one.  |Fisher Road to Hollywood|Another standout where the emotion comes through. Great storytelling on this song something we dont get too often from them.  |Victims Of Life|This one is growing on me. Digging the Spanish vibe. Lyrically its meh. Would be a good drinking game every time they say victims.  |Divorce Separation Blues|I love this one just not the yodeling. I like the rhyme scheme.  |May It Last|Starts off like a waltz and goes into a Pink Floyd vibe. Not attributes that I necessarily love.  |,TheAvettBrothers,d4gwiiy,8,t5_2sc3d
8063055,0,t1_d4mcq5k,Same! I immediately learned and love playing the album version when they started doing it live but this one makes it so fun and funky! ,TheAvettBrothers,d4md363,2,t5_2sc3d
8086099,0,t3_4pyd9i,Favorites No Hard Feelings Rejects In The Attic Fisher RoadLeast Favorites Smithsonian Aint No Man Victims of LifeI just want to say that Satan is so badass live since it seems to be a common least favorite the track cannot do it justice. Not to go too far off topic but I think even with my least favorites on True Sadness I can still see how they will be so great live. Conversely with Magpie which I didnt particularly care for as a whole the songs I dislike I find myself almost zoning out to when played in concert Never Been Alive Vanity.  I think overall this is a great album and I cant wait to hear how they change the songs up live.,TheAvettBrothers,d4oy99d,3,t5_2sc3d
8089612,0,t3_4ps531,This was amazing. Their energy was out the roof. I can only imagine their concerts. I also love how pumped Jimmy was after that. ,TheAvettBrothers,d4pchb0,3,t5_2sc3d
8093682,0,t3_4q1q4o,Ouch! Is it me or does she seem a tad bitter? Im not usually in the habit of reading record reviews but something about the tone of this one seems a little personal. She sounds like a longtime fan and this album pushed her over the edge. I dont think shes alone. She knows what shes talking about  speaks of the bands history accurately and with a clarity of thought that has escaped me in the past. And she uses turns of phrase and vocabulary that I swear Ive heard others use here and other places online. I cant help but agree with her on some points but a large part of me wants to say Ok. You got that out of your system. Now take a deep breath and let me tell you why its great. Cause while a lot of what shes said is true she seems unable to expound on the many positive points this album and its production createsperforms. Its not a bad album. I firmly believe that.,TheAvettBrothers,d4pswok,7,t5_2sc3d
8102549,0,t1_d4q6cfn,The intro riff the chord progression the structure of the cadence at the end of the verse and the yodeling are all homage to some other song. I just havent placed it yet.

8167946,0,t1_d4y9k0u,Oh lord no. Its a masterful album and most Chili fans love it. Its just the production on it that is cringe worthy. Go look up songs from Californication unmastered on YouTube.
