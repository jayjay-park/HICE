3636127,0,t3_2y57g5,I understand this doesnt answer your question but thought I should share my experience. I exclusively use IntelliJ over remote desktop. I have been doing so at work for over a year. There are some compression artifacts but nothing that would impact usability. I am primarily going over a gigabit connection but have had success over the internet and vpn tunneling. I didnt change any flags. Im on version . and both systems are windows .Perhaps this points to a problem at the RDP layer and not the application.,IntelliJIDEA,cq6qv3y,2,t5_2xdh0
5113998,0,t3_302rne,I was a couple years ago in the boat of those vim people are such masochists.. But Ive been hearing so much about it.. So I decided what the hell Ill try it. Tried it for a week really hated it at first.. I was really slow But after a bit of coding and forcing to use them  by the end of the week I was getting the hang of it. I was also able to much more quickly navigate and modify code. I highly recommend it. If you are knocking it and havent tried it exclusively then your opinion doesnt matter... And to those who are saying  percent of time spent isnt actually writing code.. Well youre not being exactly accurate either.. Yes you often stop to concentrate on problems and sometimes these problems give you complete road blocks.. But when you can navigate and fix your errors much faster than someone who cant then you have more time to go back to thinking. The time wasted is easily earned back.. I mean I was up and running better than before in a week.. Its not like youre learning an entirely different keyboard layout like Dvorak or something.. Think about it most of your time isnt spent commuting to and from work right? But that doesnt mean you want to or it makes sense to spend an extra half hour each time when you dont have to. So just try it.. Genuinely try to learn it. And if you fail after a while  well then you know it isnt for you. Thats the only way you further yourself and learn in this field anyways... And should be applied to other areas and technologies too.Also to those who say you can be just as fast in notepad youre wrong. Ive seen and often come across a ton of situations where I have to do repetitive partial word modifications switch upper to lower with a simple key edit multiple columns of text at the same time... And I see a lot of people doing it the regular way it makes me cringe each time thinking I could be done by now ... ,IntelliJIDEA,cv2ff44,2,t5_2xdh0

11084827,0,t1_deo2zai,thanks for the response. Im going to open a ticket and see what happens but if I have the time Ill spin up a VM and try to test this there. I want to say this is a configuration issue bc I have other installs that are fine but who knows!. ,IntelliJIDEA,deogejs,1,t5_2xdh0
