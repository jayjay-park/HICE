176786,0,t1_ceybrg6,Most ski bases are actually composed of a mixture of Ptex a polyethylene plastic and wax. There main job yes your right is to repel water of which makes a much faster ski lowering the adhesion of water molecules to the base.Once a base is dry it will start to have white chalky type patches within the base. This is due to the pores of the skis actually opening up and as a result there is no wax. This then grabs the water molecules in turn slowing down your ski. I have never had a base that I could just scrap away the white dirt minerals what could cause this I have no idea. In general though It is best to keep a good wax on your skis at all times,skiing,ceykjgb,1,t5_2qig7

Also he could take on a small sponsor to help out a cool company or something but instead he has Burton and Target ect. I get it.

When there are people like Travis Rice and Nico Muller that seem to represent the sport so much better to me I just resent how Shaun White is the face of snowboarding.

Im aware lots of skiers only compete against themselves but theres the crowd who only seem to be in it to win it. The whole I need to be better than everyone else attitude throws me off. I think theres so much more to skiing. Racing to me is like the most basic form of alpine skiing.

Shaped skis help people carve their turn rather than skidding but there is no fundamental change in the process of turning on a modern shortradius ski than on say a s ski. No matter the shape materials and flex of the skis under your feet you still need to make the same transition between edges and ski poles are just as helpful now as they ever were if you are using them correctly.gt There is a reason they begin teaching people without poles...I learned to ski without poles too at least until I progressed to the point that they became useful.  The fact that I see so many intermediate skiers not using their poles properly if at all tells me that either their instructors didnt know how to teach them or they couldnt be bothered to take enough lessons to learn. Can you learn to ski without poles?  Of course.  Should you?  Well have you ever seen any competitive skiers outside of park and pipe which I freely acknowledge are different not using them and using them properly? I doubt it and there is a reason for that.,skiing,cfuypw5,1,t5_2qig7

627372,0,t3_218oz4,Face downhill.  The upper body should remain still as possible shoulders square to the fall line.  You need to bend your knees to turn keep your knees bent except when you need a rest.  Yes avoid a squatting position that would mean too deep a bend. Your thighs should not be vertical they lean back at about a  deg. angle your legs forming a Z of sorts not a lowercase r.  Pelvis forward as one adviser here said is more of a feeling than a location.  Your pelvis stays behind your knees your feet even a little behind your shoulders but it is your center of gravity and leverage and drives you from behind.  You turn the skis with your lower legs and feet they drive you skis the way the steering system drives a car.  Pay attention to the edges as others here have said study carving technique many guides online.  Plan the next turn while in the middle of the present turn look downslope.  Facing downhill shoulders square to the fall line your body will coil like  a spring then uncoil into the next turn.  Bob up and down slightly as you do this to lift your weight off the skis so they can swing around.Doing the right things can improve your technique more in  days than a whole season of skiing wrong.,skiing,cgbl0av,1,t5_2qig7

Since then I have got about  days in at resorts like Les  Laux Chamrousse Les  Alpes Alpe dHuez about  days straight Val dIsereTignes for a week and Chamonix the Vallee Blanche. Im getting back home in a little less than two weeks so I plan on hitting up Tucks also. It wont be the same after the alps though.My best day was probably a midweek day a Les  Laux I woke up to rain and clouds in the valley but as I went up the swichbacks to the mountain the snow piled up and we got above the clouds. Instead of the  that was called for we had about  of blower powder from the night before with bluebird skies. As we went up the lift they were setting off charges and huge avalanches were going down.

You have places that are more resortbased than anywhere else in the world and see huge population influxes on holiday weekends where people have the best gear that they use maybe twice a season. Yet on the other hand there are also many places where you can get away with not seeing a single person wearing a backpack costing over  or even a backpack at all for that matter. In my opinion it totally is based upon where you decide to call your mountain not so much the actual skiing that is able to be had.,skiing,chlxxe6,1,t5_2qig7

Luckily she had skied once or twice about  years before she lost her sight and was a strong fit woman.  Essentially we would ski behind or next to her and gave her commands on when to turn how big of a turn  when she should slow down or stop and if there were any obstaclesother skiers to avoid.  She came several weeks in a row with her husband who we were also teaching how to guide her.  By the end of the season she was comfortably skiing blue squares.

That is just not achievable from a boot like the ones here.Nowhere have I derided people for using second hand gear check through my post history and youll see that I regularly recommend used skis. But I never recommend buying used boots. Ive never assumed that people with used gear are terrible skiers but being familiar with ski equipment retail I understand the people buying it a little better than most. Ive helped people in similar situations in real life before. Im not imply someone is a bad skier simply that if someone was to buy these boots and believe they are a good fit it indicates that a they havent had well fitting boots yet and b that is probably because they are fairly new to the sport.The biggest problem I have with the post is that there are a lot of casual skiers on this sub and a post like this can be misleading for them. Im not trying to get people to spend more money I hate the commercialisation of skiing but buying good boots is a smart investment get it right and they should last  years.I have no problem with people disagreeing with me and I accept that Ive upset people by being snappy initially but no one has really offered an argument against the points that Im making so I apologise but dont really care that people were upset and ultimately stand by what I said. ,skiing,clr9dcx,2,t5_2qig7

The insides of skis can lose camber but I dont think they really wear out in the same way ski boots can.

2476991,0,t3_2nvlld,If been going to Saas Fee my entire youthabout  years in a row. Theres a lot i like about the place and a few things that I dont.Where your apartment is located is going to have a big influence on your holidays. Are you staying in central Saas Fee or at the bottom of the Saas Valley namely Saas Grund Saas Balen and Saas Almagell.If you are staying in Saas Fee you will probably do most of your skiing there. The area is big but shaped like a bowl all the runs end up in more or less the same place by the village. Skiing there you will experience vastly different conditions in one run from top to bottom. At m you have some of the best snow conditions anywhere currently they are sitting at cm I think. On the downside it gets very windy and obscenely cold quite frequently C was my record. In those conditions avoid the Tbars up there especially the Feechatz which is insanely long but really flat and exposed to the wind. From the glacier area down you can go two routes One goes to Morenia and the other one goes out to Lngfluh. Pistes above Morenia are wide and easy there are a few Tbars and a chairlift there. I really like run no.  Mittaghorn which is a little off to the side and usually very empty and great for bigangle carving.  Morenia has a big self service restaurant that is a good option for lunch. It also has a picnic area on the downstairs floor. in December the only way down from Morenia is run no. A Ritzi. If I had to point to a spot where most accidents in Saas Fee occur the very bottom part of that run would be it. Being quite steep and the only way down from Morenia in the afternoon it gets super crowded and really really icy there at times. Going from the glacier area to Lngfluh is one of the nicest runs in Saas Fee called Panorama. You have some of the highest mountains in the alps on your left a huge glacier on your right and the valley in front of you. Its a blue run great for going really really fast but sadly a little flat so make sure to carry some speed into it. Or just enjoy the view. At the bottom of the Panorama run are two restaurantsbars. Popcorn is the hippest place on the mountain with music playing sun chairs for relaxing and a young crowd. The other restaurant is located in the building of the Lngfluh cable car. Its self service too but way smaller than Morenia and somewhat more atmospheric. Lngfluh is the place in Saas Fee that sees the most sunlight in December or any time really even though the sun is in your back most of the time.Going down from both Morenia and Lngfluh will lead you to a series of runs that go through forest and end up near the village.Not much to be said about those except that my favorite restaurant in Saas Fee is located m to the left of slope b Gletschegrotte with which it shares the name. Its small and usually packed but the food is fantastic. You mentioned you like off piste skiing. There are great runs to be found in all areas I mentioned but if you do not consult a guide stay on piste anywhere in the glacier region even if it looks completely safe m outside of the cords there is a reason those ropes are there.The nightlife in Saas Fee is plentiful. Bars line the main road from the bottom of the slopes to the church square. Try to get a day in at Saas Grund. It looks tiny compared to Saas Fee but is so much more relaxed for that reason. Also most of it is sunlit the entire day. The two very modern cable cars are all you need to use all day. The Weissmiespiste from Hohsaas to Kreuzboden covers m of height in bright sunlight with varying terrain and some off piste opportunities along the way. Saas Almagell is not too bad either and has the most runs through forests of all regions in the Saastal. You could make this an option in bad weather but I would say its not a must. There is the option of a day trip to Zermatt at a reduced rate with your Saas Fee skipass. Do it if your holiday is long enough and you dont mind spending the extra.I hope this helps you and that you will have a fantastic holiday in SwitzerlandampSaas Fee.     ,skiing,cmhvoe8,1,t5_2qig7

What is everyone doing while skiing that requires finger dexterity? Whatever it is Im dont seem to be doing it.

2741222,0,t3_2rfi49,Ski boots are designed for skiing not walking. Get into an athletic skiing stance and press your shins into the boot cuffs  do you feel your feet start to flatten out? To have good control over your skis there needs to be a direct transfer of energy from your feet to your bindings for this to happen your boots need to be tight. If theyre loose and you feel your feet sliding around youll have less control edge to edge which will result in shittier skiing. You want a tight but not painful fit.Expect your liners to pack out a little bit after a few days in them which will give your toes some extra room. If you continue having problems seek out a knowledgeable boot fitter. ,skiing,cnfnyxh,2,t5_2qig7

No set backs. It gets sore and stiff sometimes but has no effect on my skiing. It did change the shape of my left foot though so if you have custom insoles I would recommend getting that foot redone.

2945509,0,t3_2rvv76,Jealous. Chamonix is a fantastic place. Ive seen a lot of mountains and the Alps just blew me away. The town is a lot of fun too. Great food.Make sure you plan in a ride up to Aiguille du Midi along with a ride up to the glacier caves on the Montenvers train. Both are unique experiences that you and your girlfriend can enjoy.I skied Brevent and Les Grands Montets.  Skied Verbier as well. To be honest theres nothing at either place that a black diamond skier would need to worry about except... the ice. Yup. From my experience I would say the Alps are closer to New England skiing than Colorado skiing.  Thats not to say you cant luck out and get a dump of powder but that can happen in New England too. It seemed to me that the snow had more moisture than snow in the Rockies.  Ive only been there once so I could be wrong but I got the same impression from other people I talked to. Unlike New England the terrain and expanse of the mountains is mind blowing. not dissing New England its just that differentThere were groomers everywhere but the fun stuff was in between the groomers.  You do need to ski carefully though.  Unlike Colorado there is not necessarily a sign warning you about a cliff ahead. When I was there there was a multiday pass that included all of the mountains in addition to Verbier.  It seemed like the best deal but I just noticed youre only skiing two days. Id say hit both Grand Montets and Brevent. Theyre both unique and worth checking out.Oh yeah watch out for the chairlifts.  Rarely is there an attendant politely holding the chair for you.

3323230,0,t3_2y60ez,This is incredibly common on the FFGZ series that use this style heel. Im actually surprised so many people are saying you are shit out of luck. I dont see any indiction youve pulled the screws out or bent the heel track mind you Im only looking at two pictures.Tthe cracking almost qualifies as cosmetic the part you have broken is just a casing the screws hold the metal heel track almost exactly the same without them. Its not good and you shouldnt ski on it but people do all the time and never have a problem. Any salomon or atomic dealer should be able to order the part for you. Ill try to explain why this isnt that bad. They way this binding is designed with the front heel screw go through the track and the rear screws set tight against the sides of the track with the tops of the screws over the sides to keep it down. This allows the track of the binding to slide under the rear screws as the ski flexes. Im not sure if this is by design or not I imagine it is as knee bindings markets this feature heavily. The down side of this feature is that the housing not held in this way and is forced against the screw cracking it in extreme circumstances. If only the housing is cracked the name of what you need is Plastic Heel Guide Housing L  Definitely dont pay more than  dollars per guide. Now if your heel track is bent you have slightly more expensive problems. You now need Steel Heel Track L. Dont pay more than ish per track. Your screws are most likely bentpulled out a bit in this scenario as well which means either heli coils or moving the binding at least  mm from the edge of any damaged part of your ski.Figure to pay at least the price of remount on top of the parts from your local shop if you go heli coils you will probably bump the price up significantly.Depending on the ability of you to install the parts your self this can be kind of a pricey problem.,skiing,cp72r9j,6,t5_2qig7

A handson course is the best option like what the lazyanachonist suggested.  NSP does offer avalanche training but its designed for patrollers.  A great resource however would be your local patroldepending on where you are in the country of course.  If you ski in areas where avalanches are likely then the patrollers there can give you a much better idea of whats going on.  A good bet is that patrollers that do control work know how to rescue from an avalanche and will generally willingly share their knowledge.

Now the biggest moneymaker at Vail referencing their most recent K is actually the mountain operations broadly considered including ski school passes etc. Real Estate is a smaller portion of the pie now. I also generally disagree with the idea that a cheaper pass makes skiing less good or less interesting simply because more people are doing it. More people skiing will I think beget better mountains and better operations in the future. And perhaps it is unfortunate but the resorts and mountains have to make money somehow you could argue that cheap passes are a marketing tool to get people to spend money on the mountain in ancillary places or in expensive stores but that doesnt mean the soul of skiing is fading away. The soul of skiing will always be out there in people who take the cheap passes ski all day and ignore the other crap thats on the mountain.,skiing,cpyh2le,1,t5_2qig7

3742125,0,t3_3384bf,Im not too familiar with either of those skis from Moment but I have a pair of Tahoes and Bibby Pros. From what I can tell the micro camber sections are really meant to hold better grip on firm conditions. They give multiple contact points for the ski so the edge has something to dig in on ice or hard pack. Thats probably not what youre going to need if youre primarily skiing powder in the backcountry.Just looked at their website and depending on how much you care about weight you might want to consider the Exit Worlds too. The Ghost Train is a pure powder ski with  rocker but its also a heavy hard charging ski. The Exit World is lighter and will be better suited for touring but not as wide underfoot. Not sure if youll notice a difference though since theyre still  mm vs  mm for the Ghost Train.FWIW the Bibbys feel like a compromise between those two.  mm underfoot and a pretty hard charging ski but with a bit of camber just to make it manageable in variable conditions.Anyway hope that helps a bit.,skiing,cqitryu,2,t5_2qig7

4738088,1,t1_ctrqzsw,gt Sarah Burke was obviously a much better skier than you and had many more days on the snow.I dont think comparing a recreational skier who is out there tooling around with the primary goal of having fun to someone who was trying to push the very limits of the sport and what is physically possible is anywhere near a fair comparison.You must have missed this quotegt his research had not found any decline in what he called P.S.H.I.s for potentially serious head injuries a classification that includes concussion skull fracture closed head injury traumatic brain injury and death by head injury.A helmet will not save your life.  The article explains that helmets are indeed helpful at mitigating mild head injures like cuts and abrasions.gtSchumachers doctors say he would not have survived his fall had he not worn a helmet.Its really unprofessional of doctors to make statements like this.  There is no way anyone can know what wouldve happened unless we could go back in time and replicate the exact same fall without a helmet.  Doctors are not engineers.  The data says helmets wont save your life. gtSo the problem is not that helmets dont work but rather that people are increasing the amount of risk they take. If you increase your risk because you are wearing a helmet that says nothing about the helmet and everything about you.Thats human nature.  However stupid you might think it is this is how the majority of people are going to behave.  Doesnt mean you just actively dismiss this phenomenon because it doesnt jive with how you think people should behave.Ultimately this comes down to personal freedom and your own sense of risk.  I do not feel that recreational skiing is any more dangerous than walking down the street.  I also dont feel that the protection offered by helmets is good enough to warrant the discomfort of wearing one or the loss in awareness I cant hear anything with my helmet on.

I agree Nomads look awesome they would have been on my list but I cant get them at  in my price range although this might be too short with the rocker. Can get them at  but maybe thats a bit long?

He also says that he likes to ski in the bumps and trees so Im going to assume that hes not a complete beginner even if it is his first season.  Plus anything double rockered at  is going to ski more like a  if not shorter.

Ive seen failed attempts to spray your friend end up taking out three people Ive seen edges cut through snowpants Ive seen fucking massive welts... You hit a patch of ice or hook an edge and suddenly youre sliding or falling into someone at full speed really dangerous. Luckily I never personally saw someone hospitalized from it but I know several coaches who have.The other one that happened all the time was wrestling in the snow in ski boots. Get a bunch of young people together and playing in the snow and it degenerates into wrestling matches a lot. Always ended in tears with preteen kids from those hard heavy boots and one time a kid lost a tooth.

My work had me drive from Colorado to Idaho.  While I was in Idaho they got a foot of fresh powder so on my way back to Colorado I swung through Park City for lunch which turned into  hours of hot laps a few days before they closed for the season.  Fortunately Id brought my skis and gear with me just in case.  It was a Tuesday or a Wednesday and it was just me and about a dozen old guys on the mountain.  Of the whole place there were just half a dozen runs still open and only  or  worth hitting it was looking pretty barren even with foot of new snow.

5915710,0,t3_3wc6eh,Ski bindings used on rental gear are super cheap and are set up to pop out more easily because its better for the average rental customer to pop out on falls. The cost of this is that you cant be very aggressive in them even small torques will pop you out. So dont try skiing a downhill course in them or in your case taking bigger airs. It also has to do with rental equipment usually being stiffer and heavier than good park skis which would flex and absorb more impact on landing. And then theres probably a bit of technique going on that isnt helping either. The fix to your problem short of avoiding jumps would be to mention your issue when youre getting your rental stuff or when youre ordering it ahead of time. Any decent rental shop should be able to set you up with a little tighter binding. Some most? of them will also rent out park skis which would be a solution as well.,skiing,cxv2xz6,0,t5_2qig7

I pretty much go every year and I love it.One last thing to note is that if you are on a budget and love back country you might want to check out Loveland pass free Ive never personally been there but my brothers have and they say its basically a huge back country area with cheap sometimes free shuttle rides back up to the top. Im not really sure about lodging but I recommend looking at Airbnb for places to live in Denver and maybe in the Rockies. You can usually get a place in Denver for cheap and just do the  hour commute to the mountains via car or shuttle.Most of this you can do while on a pretty cheap budget which is really nice.,skiing,cxx5v2r,1,t5_2qig7

If you need to hire equipment at Glenshee Fresh Tracks is probably the best place if you have transport its not on the slopes but it is much better quality than anything you would get from the hire shop at the actual Ski Centre.Ski Scotland Website| Has Links to all resorts and ski areas in Scotland with webcams weather reports and lift opening times.,skiing,cywr17u,3,t5_2qig7

Rosalyn who is quoted in the article has been here for  years. She has a real job and could afford to live in a place if she could find one. Source She is my friend. However lets look at your comment in a little more depth. If there are no ski bums there is no resort. There are no workers and Vail ceases to exist. No one is ever going to pay a lifty enough to afford a place here so if Vail wants to keep their workforce theyve got to come up with affordable housing solutions. I know everyone loves to hate on Vail but that should stick to hating the company because its honestly a pretty awesome place to live for those of us that were lucky to secure longterm housingafford the massive hikes in rent.

Theyll help the fit and height of your feet in your boots. If your boots are too tight youll probably have less bloodflow so it could be the shape of your boot. Many people have problems with their boots and have to get them molded and reshaped if need be. Its not unusual to have this. If you own the boots read this but if they are rentals or not yours do NOT do this If you own the boots and plan on using them for a while bring them to someone who can help mold them and even press them if you need to. If that doesnt work ask if they will cut liner out. It sounds scary but cutting material out of the liner really helps.

For Glades either off ptarmigan chair of the gondola head to the back side head down the top of old ptarmigan and when the run heads skiers left stay right and head into the trees this is probably the best glade area I think on the mountain.

7374218,1,t1_d2g5p7f,gt A quick google search said that experts tend to equate this to an increase in risk taken  Which goes at the expense of people who arent wearing a helmet  gt I tend to equate the protection given by a ski helmet to be roughly similar to a bike helmet.   I disagree. The major reason why a bike helmet is so important is because you have your hands on the handlebars and cant control much about the fall your center of gravity is also higher as well as hitting tarmac is something different than hitting snow Yes I know that ice exists.  To me ski helmets have their place if youre park skiing going through trees offpiste in general where you cant know whats beneath the snow hard objects or for kids   But other than that? I wont wear a helmet. It restricts my head movement looking uphill it makes me less aware of my surroundings sound amp maybe even visuals.   gt However if it helps even a tiny bit you need to come up with a damn good reason not to use helmet.   Risk assessment.  You could also wear a helmet when walking on the street a car could hit you.  Or you could wear a mouth guard or back protector while skiing.  It all depends on your own judgment of the risk and if you want to take it.  Yknow what I would wear? A bikestyle helmet.  ,skiing,d2geb8u,1,t5_2qig7

If you lived in New England instead of Texas I mightve sent you to Mad River Glen.  Its reputation is that its a hardcore throwback area with nothing but steep narrow trails that are never groomed but they actually have a large beginner area thats as user friendly as anything in the East.

8689760,0,t3_4yx0tu,I do both but mainly ski.  The first day on a board is harder than the first day on skis.  On a board you will take falls that feel like a giant grabbed you by your ankles and slammed you into the ground. Once you get to where you can turn both ways a board is much easier to progress from beginner to advanced.  You will be able to survive on steeper stuff quicker.  It is much easier to side slip down steep stuff on a board which is blessingcurse.  On a board you have to constantly pay attention to where you are because you will want to avoid the flats.  On skis you can just skate.   On long run outs skis are much easier to glide along.  On a board you have to make sure you dont catch an edge.Once you have skills on skis it is so much easier to get around.  Especially in the back country the bumps... It is easier to get big air on skis.  Skis are much easier to put on and take off.  Skiers spend very little time sitting in the snow.   Sitting in the snow gives you a wet ass.  Boarders often unwittingly sit in places that put them harms way.The walk from the car to lifts is much easier for boarders.  It is much easier to walk in snowboard boots than it is ski boots.  A board weighs far less than skis with bindings.  If you can only go once or twice a year snowboard.  You wont be able to put in the mileage to be a decent skier.  If you can put in the time to learn to ski I recommend skiing.,skiing,d6ruj9w,5,t5_2qig7

Sunday river can get some snow too. Other Vermont resorts will have snow and will be open but not to the extent that Jay and Sunday River will be. You could also go to Killington. They start blowing snow in October so they will definitely have the biggest base and best park at the time if you are interested in that. Killington will be much much more expensive.

Chances are you will have to have them remounted and adjusted.

9278693,0,t3_57hui0,Its been said  times in this thread but join a race team ASAP. Nothing builds technique like formal instruction. The other thing is that a race team forces you to constantly try and improve theres no days off to just hang out and take it easy like many of us do. Its not just about going and having fun its about getting better faster stronger more precise and smarter every time. I only get to ski for about a week a year these days but I still ski better than a lot of people who have a lot more daysyear because of that formal background.A great example of this stuff is Shane McConkey dude was a legend in big mountain a pro in moguls and eventually just a all around crazy good skiier in every discipline.

I bought a pair of Spy Platoons from the linked seller that had the same issue didnt impede my vision any as far as I can tell. If you dont mind the aesthetic imperfection and can find the right lens its not a bad deal.Also I ordered a pair of Spy Dooms from Evos online store had the same issue.

I went skiing on the th which was technically a holiday and it literally took  hours to get from the top of the mountain to Chandler. Normally it just takes us  hours to get tofrom Flagstaff  As far as runs go I enjoy Sunrises better because of the longer runs. The only problem is Greer can be a hitormiss when it comes to snow.

I would actually say line and K probably hold up better than most.  Youre going to have more chance of issues the further down the food chain you go.  I would say ONP and Moment make bombproof skis but the fact is they are probably going to have a bit of a high rate of failure than a ski like K of Line.  I would say whatever company you think is easier to deal with in the case of your skis falling apart is who you should go through.  I cant really say who is the best I know enough people to make things easy for me at most companies but I do know KLine is going through some stuff right now so you might want to look into that though I dont think its affected any consumers as far as I know. ,skiing,ddfdv36,1,t5_2qig7

11229300,0,t3_606diu,I ski FTs Ive been through a few pairs.  They are kind of a cheaper boot buckles break plastic is weak etc but they last as long as the intuition for the most part other than replacing the buckles.  I harvest parts all the time and they are all interchangable so its actually better for me and how I ski.  Im going to break buckles regardless of the boot with FTs its one screw and I can replace the buckle easily.  Always  get the intuition wraps the other liners arent nearly as good for the design.  Dalbellos are technically a better boot and will last a lot longer.  I really like FTs when they fit.  theres a reason the old Reichle boots were so popular.  I ride my FTs super soft I use the  flex most of the time but i Have the  and  as well.   is my favorite.  ,skiing,df4tr7j,2,t5_2qig7

11244056,0,t3_60hnqy,In my experience they dont ride too differently from early rise skis. I personally break skis into three categories traditionally cambered fully rockeredreverse cambered and all the others. If you have ridden early rise but still normally cambered under foot I dont think the transition will be too weird for you. I think they are a cool design that ski well but didnt notice as big of a difference as some people claim. ,skiing,df6hwn2,3,t5_2qig7

11350028,0,t1_dfd46v7,I have a few things I need to share with you. First skis come with bindings not binders. Secondly I have a  frame and am a very good skier so my binding choice is important because I it is unwise to ride on din bindings if you have them set to .. Another point Im in Ontario so its Canadian pricing without ski specialists crawling out of every crack in the wall so ski gear can be a little bit more expensive for me.

11402833,0,t1_dfo330f,There is no width concept for skill level. Looking at my skis as an example again both of mine are expertcompetition skis but one is  mm and the other is  mm under foot. The famed Atomic Bent Chetler is an expert ski at  mm so you can set aside width as a concept for beginners or experts. If you take a lesson thats an ideal time to talk gear with your instructor but get multiple opinions from experts. Highvolume ski shops are also a good place to seek guidance. As others have said width is for how you use the skis and where. It helps if you are able to tell the reps about how you ski how you see yourself skiing in the future the kind of terrain you ski and want to ski and well how fast you like to go. The experts can look you over and estimate your size weight and fitness level which are also important factors in how skis behave.,skiing,dfohw8m,1,t5_2qig7

11577759,0,t1_dg8ar3d,Snowmobiles in powder are not controlled by the skishandlebars so that wouldnt really work. Just turning the skis in powder will basically do nothing at all and the sled will keep going straight forward. In order to turn it you have to learn harder than you might think in one direction or another. Every time I bring someone new out on my sled they tell me at some point that they had no idea how tiring it is and how much muscleweight you have to put into it. You have to throw all your weight into the turn. See how this guy and this guy are leaning all the way to the right notice how the skis are actually slightly in the opposite direction but theyre still barely turning?Its actually hard to get used to controlling a sled its like nothing else Ive ever tried. Its kinda like taking a ATV locking the steering and trying to maneuver it just by leaning one way or another lifting the opposite wheels of the ground and hitting the gas at the right time. Modern sleds mines an  are better designed and somewhat easier to turn but since the tracks keep getting longer and longer the difference is often offset by the length of the sled.,skiing,dg8cfrb,5,t5_2qig7

11673383,0,t1_dgj44t7,Oh and just to be thoroughgt  If you actually look at history you can see that the s were the hottest period in the sIncorrectgt  Also that evidence that you talk about is all fake and done by corrupt scientists who are just trying to get money. There is not a single scrap of evidence that is the case AND you actually get funding the most easily  for novel things.  If someone were to do research and come out with actual data showing the consensus wrong theyd get flooded with cash especially by the fossil fuel industry.  This is just a conspiracy theory to ad hominem science perpetuated by the same marketing firms that attacked the science showing smoking causes cancer.gt Another reason that it isnt caused by humans is the fact that the Roman warm period hundreds of years ago was a lot hotter than how warm it is now.There is no Roman warm period im not sure where you came up from that one.  Maybe youre confusing the premedieval period then the medieval warm period.  neither of which was anywhere near as warm as now in terms of departure from long term average AND the time in which it took them to warm and cool were much longerHeres a graphgt  Even the founder of Greenpeace thinks that climate change isnt caused by humans.A greenpeace wasnt founded by a single person  B what some nonexperts thinks is irrelevant in the face of massive evidence  C bullshitgt Also the regulations that Obama and other stupid environmentalists make to stop climate change isnt doing anything but take away jobs.Also massively incorrect. The entire coal industry employees less people than Arbys.  The solar industry alone employees more people than oil coal and gas combined. and unlike mineral extraction jobs these ones stay where they are. they cant be shipped off to a big city. they dont dry up with the exhaustion of a mineral vein.
