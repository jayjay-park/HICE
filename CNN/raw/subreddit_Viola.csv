2915708,0,t1_cntnr4v,To add I would recommend the accessorize as a wrapped gift and then find a day where you can go look and such I completely agree with having her go with you because Ive had a bad gift experience before. As for rosin I recommend the MagicRosin brand Ive been using it for years and its about  USD Im pretty sure you can only buy it online. and as far as budget goes if your looking for a beginner Viola you should be able to get it in that range but Im not so sure about the accessories and ask the dealermaker I would recommend buying it from the actual maker of the instrument on which polishes he recommend for that certain instrument ,Viola,cnziv4p,1,t5_2t2qx

This place isnt for fundraising without any evidence. Theres a reason this isnt gaining traction.Also tighten your bow. It looks loose in the video.Cheers,Viola,daa9uzb,3,t5_2t2qx
