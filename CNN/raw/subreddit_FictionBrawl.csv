These weapons fire bolts of highly energized heavy particles compressed to an immense density at borderline lightspeed capable of striking with nearly a hundred megatons of power at a rate of five shots per minute. Secondary armaments include a bank of six plasma projectors each capable of firing a relatively slowmoving plasma flare that deals immense heat damage. Each cruiser is also equipped with twenty pointdefense multispectral lasers for infrared xray and gamma along with two batteries of antimattermatter reaction missiles. Each cruiser has a compliment of fifteen Snapperclass fighters armed with twin pulse lasers and a particle cannon. Each cruiser is protected by fifteen overlapping hard energy barriers and is plated with reflective armor than can be tuned to different spectrums of laser weapons.x Ironcladclass dreadnoughts. . kilometers long and armed with three particle cannons capable of dealing three hundred megatons of energy in a concentrated shot five times a minute twenty plasma projectors a hundred pulse lasers and twenty AMM missile pods along with a compliment of forty Snapperclass fighters.

It is protected by reflective armor and one hundred overlapping shields.WARMINDAs per standard Saeporti battle standards within times of conflict all ships crews are entered into WARMIND for optimal situational awareness and response. When the captain issues calls to battle stations all bridge crew are neurally linked to the ships computer via their neural implant to enter a state of altered consciousness. Plugged into the incredible processing power of the main computer the ships crew perceive the ships instruments and components in a way like an extension of their own body and are able to comprehend and understand the data flowing directly into their brain at a rate far faster than by antique physical displays. With flawless communication between themselves and the ship the WARMIND crew can assess a situation formulate a response and deliver that response in the time that a conventional human crew would take to understand what was going on in the first place.Good god that thing is atrociously large. The captain of the Perpetual Vigilance remarked as they analyzed the ship on their screen. The Vigilance was swimming through low hyperspace along with the rest of the battle group looking at information streaming in through their surface probes about the monstrosity before them. Big enough to hold a damn city the crew must be enormous. The captain shook his head then turned to the deck officer. Alright you know the orders. Bring us up and into position. The sharp yellow alert snapped throughout the ship to notify the crew they were emerging into normal space.The empty blackness of space contorted as if a boiling surface then erupted into a series of radioactive flashes as six Seaporti capital ships emerged from hyperspace in formation fifty kilometers distant each. Aboard the dreadnought Vigilance ForeAdmiral Dejalir sat in the command chair flicking on FLEETCOM. This is ForeAdmiral Dejalir I am initiating the call to general quarters all crew to your battle stations. The overhead lighting hummed red gently flashing as the twentysome bridge crew of the Vigilance sat back in their seats. Initializing WARMIND in three two one. whispered the ships computer in his mind. His world twisted inward then a sudden twinge across his brain. The ForeAdmiral opened his eyes and took in the situation. He wasnt seeing from his physical eyes now but rather sensing the presence of his crew as they all plugged in the status of ships across the fleet and the tactical view presented by the ships sensors across real space and hyperspace. No words were spoken the crew communicated instantaneously with each other as they set about their work. He felt out with the ships sensors. The Saeporti fleet had emerged from hyperspace in good order within a several hundred kilometer bubble the dreadnought Vigilance and five battlecruisers. They were at a distance of just over a million kilometers from the enemy capital ship sublight engines warmed and hyperdrives recharging quickly. Reports came in from the crew checking off greenlight statuses for weapons and shields reflective armor was tuned and fighters had already been launched now forming a protective screen. Just over five seconds had passed in real time since the crew had entered WARMIND. Alright lets see how if theyve spotted us. The ForeAdmiral figured they were likely detected by now having dropped out relatively close to the ship anything capable of building such a large vessel would doubtlessly have noticed the radiation burst when they exited hyperspace. ,FictionBrawl,dcwcxru,2,t5_2x101
