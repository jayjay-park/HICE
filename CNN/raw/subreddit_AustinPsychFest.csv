3372650,0,t3_2ynn2p,I do! Ive stayed here a few times. Its reasonably priced right downtown clean and laid back Easily one of my favorite hostels. They have private rooms which are more expensive but coed dorm style rooms too that wont run you much at all. In the past APF has had shuttles running from a couple different spots downtown  if you wont have a car that will be a cheap option for you guys. Please let me know if you have any other questions. I visit Austin a few times a year and this will be my th APF. Youll love it.,AustinPsychFest,cpcpgok,1,t5_2zau5

7395058,0,t3_4fe81w,Yo. I will be at the ranch this weekend. First time for this fest. I camped Roo  years in a row.I am a bit puzzled by the no alcoholno canister stove rules. I understand no glass and no open fires. But is it really going to get me kicked out if I drink some boxed wine and cook some ramen on a small backpacking canister stove like an MSR pocket rocket.Anyone ever been and camped? Would this get us kicked out or confiscated?,AustinPsychFest,d2irpeu,2,t5_2zau5

I wouldnt even try to hide something in an inconspicuous way in a bag because I remember them taking out my beach towel and unrolling it to see if anything had been rolled up inside. Theyll take your snacks and dump out your water. I stick my weed and a Clif bar in my bra. Once youre in you can take it out and put it in your bag. I went to Stubbs a couple weeks ago and they were asking people to empty their pockets so I wouldnt be surprised if security were to do it there too now. ,AustinPsychFest,d2k6zj8,1,t5_2zau5
7424099,0,t3_4gxpko,All of the lakes are near or at capacity.  They opened one of the gates at Mansfield already.  A large influx of rain anywhere in the highland lakes area will trigger the need to open more floodgates at Mansfield will will in turn necessitate opening gates at Tom Miller and Longhorn dams.  Of course this will lead to a large increase in flow in the Colorado river. ,AustinPsychFest,d2m2l7o,3,t5_2zau5
7924903,0,t3_4nszle,I dunno theyre probably just sick of people being impatient with them. I would be. Theyre waiting on an insurance company to pay them so they can pay us. Have you ever filed an insurance claim? It fucking sucks. ,AustinPsychFest,d46u1hp,1,t5_2zau5
