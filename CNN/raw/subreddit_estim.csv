8540712,0,t3_4wkxjq,The problem youre going to have with the Davey and Midi boxes are in finding an actual stereo speaker set.  Many of these little cheapo plug in speakers are mono and you dont know until you open it up and look at the guts.  I went through a couple Amazon purchases before just going to the local discount store and buying a few.One thing I found was that the single transformer design didnt pack enough punch.  I didnt put a voltage regulator or limiter inline and yes with some audio it is spiky  really depends on the track.  With a resistorregulator in line on each channel I imagine it smooths out.The difference between the audio box and a commercial box like a  or B is that the commercial ones have a processor built in to remove the spikes and limit signal to keep within safer levels.  If you are into estim for a little pain and whatnot you may quite enjoy the DIY units.  If youre into electro for the pleasure end?  Save up a bit its worth it.,estim,d695oc6,1,t5_2t03u

11372918,0,t1_dfgeelz,anecdotal evidence disclaimer I have that model and I like it although I am a guy.  It has absolutely never failed to work on me.  I tried  cheaper models previously which lacked the normal constant mode that this unit has.  I would absolutely recommend getting a model like this one with which has the constant mode available.  With the pulsed modes especially for a beginner they can be very jarring uncomfortable and difficult to dial into a pleasurable setting.  With the normal mode since your receiving a constant signal it is much easier slowly turn up the intensity and get it right into the groove.  In fact I can imagine some people being turned off to estim completely after trying models that only offer pulse modes.  The zeus model i own is extremely disappointing compared to this unit for this reason and in addition turning up the intensity by  notch on the zeus makes a large difference so large that one setting might be too weak and one more notch up might be too strong.  The TENS  has the little potentiometer dial on the top which allows very fine adjustment.  The pulsed modes are very difficult to reach orgasm without a lot of concentration.  Now the only downside to the dial is if you forget which way turns it up and which way turns it down just be aware of this when using it so that you dont turn it to full blast intending to turn the unit off.Also one more thing previous poster recommended  pad on each side of the clit and while I am not a girl and have no experience with that setup I have tried  pad on either side of my penis both top and bottom and on the left and right most comparable setup I could possibly have and it is not pleasurable at all.   You WANT to have the pads a little bit more spread out than this as the electricity is traveling in between the pads if you try this setup everything will be concentrated directly onto your clit and could be uncomfortable.  This is what I found while trying  pad on each side of the dick thing the sensation felt very concentrated to the area the pads were stuck onto.  The best setup for me has been  pad electrode halfway down the TOP of the penis and a connection to  pole of a bipolar anal plug with the active portion pointing anterior.  The pad on the top of the penis directly stimulates the dorsal nerve of the penis and without having the two electrodes so close together the sensation is much more spread out stimulating a much larger area The sensation covers the entire penis and even down into the pelvic area from  pad and is much more pleasurable.  The comparable setup for a female would be an anal electrode as described and an electrode that manages to stimulate the upper portion of the clitoral hood.Now experimentation is absolutely everything with this of course.  But I have seen  videos online of a woman bringing herself to orgasm purely through the use of electrostim.  Cant find the videos online anymore but i have a local copy of both saved on my hard drive and could find a way to get them to you if you want.  Heres a screenshot of the electrodes shes using    Shes able to get herself there later in the video with this setup so at least it could be a starting point for you.  Heres her setup from video  for clitoral stimulation she uses a clip that goes down around the sides of the clit and also swoops down the clitoral hood to the tip of the clit attached to one output of the stimulator Hope everything works out for you estim orgasms are very rewarding.   Let me know if you have any questions??,estim,dfl3l4v,3,t5_2t03u
