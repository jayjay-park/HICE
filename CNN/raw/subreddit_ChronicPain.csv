84446,0,t3_1ux56r,Intense pressure in my head and every muscle in my facehead becomes a supertight rubber band that will neither let go nor snap.Ive got a weird history of multiple pain issues.This post really strikes a chord with me though because not only have I been struggling with this periodially for years but all day today and right now Ive been in an alternate universe of pain.It has always seemed to me that Im really set up for this pain anytime I cant get a good night sleep due to noisy environment etc which to me seems to be all the time.Sometimes I naturally turn to enormous amounts of black coffee to try to pierce it my own terminology with caffeine.I havent found a solution. But I tend towards trying to go to bed really early having lots of coffee in the morning and I actually tend to try to avoid aspirin naproxen etf. It does so little and somehow seems to prolong the problem.I wish I had something useful to offer but Im really glad you posted this.I remember years ago when I was in graduate school and I just started feeling this insane pressure in my head. I was baffled. Little did I know it would continue to be an issue periodically for so many years.,ChronicPain,ceo1k4z,1,t5_2rdpj

108580,0,t3_1vb3xl,You will probably find that you need a combination of meds. I currently take a time released opiate for general pain. Gabapentin which is an antiseizure med amitriptyline both help with nerve pain Soma for muscle pain. And Lidoderm patches at night as needed. It numbs the area that its applied to but its really expensive and hard to get approved by insurance companies which really annoys me. They will give me all the narcotics I want but dont want to cover the nonnarcotic patches.

157817,0,t3_1vvj8d,My wife saw a pain management doc at a VA hospital for visceral abdominal pain  probably small duct pancreatitis  he said there were no interventions that would help did not feel celiac plexus block or any spinal injections would help.  He sent her back to her primary care doc at the VA to continue the opioids. Fast forward one year she is admitted to a nonVA hospital with a flare of her pain and an inpatient pain consult is placed  and the SAME guy shows up but now in private practice mode ...  Now in private practice he tells my wife that there are definitely spinal injections that would give good pain relief which he can provide in his private practice office ... and that she should stop all opiates.moral I suspect that many pain management docs in private practice are afraid to prescribe opioids for fear of DEA and they probably get reimbursed more for doing interventional treatments.

571883,0,t3_20oi54,As a young person with an uncertain future due to pain I know how you feel. I worry about what my career prospects will be like in a few years. Since pain became a part of my daily life Ive had to reduce the number of hours I work just so that I can cope. Its not hard for me to imagine having to live off SSI or disability before Im mentally ready to stop working. Its so unfair that we have all this potential but our bodies are failing us. I commend you for wanting to try to work. It seems like you are very strong but also know your limits. For now were both young and can maybe ? suffer through work for a while longer. Maybe well get lucky and our conditions will improvebe better managed... or maybe that wont happen. In any case it really is important to look after our mental health. I dont get much support from my doctors either. I think its because mental health issues are so personal. I dont think any of my doctors could really understand the frustration I go through because of pain. Most things that bother me probably wouldnt even cross their minds. For example I dont think my doctors understand just how tired I am and how that plays into my mood. Unfortunately it really is up to us to advocate for the things we need  mental health support or otherwise. ,ChronicPain,cg5a0oh,1,t5_2rdpj

1023349,0,t3_25tioa,Hi there.  Im sorry about your pain.  I wish that I had a specific answer for you but we all react to these chemicals differently.  Some people are able to take a few months off and have their tolerance pretty much at the same level it was at the beginning while others will never get close to that again no matter the amount of time.The one thing that you could try is ask your doctor to switch your medication.  Some doctors will agree to change the percocets for vicodin or another opioid.  Its always a gamble howeverespecially when you doctor doesnt seem to want to prescribe....much like yours as per your description.  The only thing you could really do is bring back the percocet bottle and tell him that youre not reacting to it...if you could try a different opioid of the same strength. But like I said total gamble.  He may say Ok heres the equivalent dose in Vicodin for example or he may just take your percocets and say well opioids arent working for you...no sense in taking them which would leave you without.The best way would be to know by phone...Hi doc.  Im either tolerant or dont react to the percocet.  Would if be possible for me to bring in the Rx and get another type of opioid at the same strength.  I dont want anything more powerful...I just want to try something chemically different.You really have to thread carefully when dealing with those meds if your doctor doesnt want to cooperate too much.

This kind of doc generally has a background in anesthesiology with advanced training usually a year fellowship in pain management. For instance see these websiteswww.spineuniverse.comHeres a guy who has done a surgical residency but also does a lot of interventional treatments  hes one of the few docs Id trust to treat me.

1608664,0,t1_cjhfa91,Firstly Im so sorry to hear about your suffering. I too am part of the  a week medication scripts. Its very frustrating. Im not a doctor and cant give you medical advice but may have some ideas as to how to handle this problem. One idea if youre going to be seeing a specialist weekly HMO copays will add up. Another idea would be a PPO which would have lesser fees but youd have to pay a lot up front. Its sort of a catch . Dont be ashamed to discuss your financial situation with your doctor. He may be willing to help. One idea would be instead of having weekly or biweekly dosage to do it monthly. Your doctor may need to still see you and count your medication but even just a larger supply could help. Either way some medications cost the same for  as it does for .Another idea would be to contact the group your doctor works through. This should be the hospital they are connected with. Call the hospital and ask for a patient advocate. Tell them about your troubles and most times you should be able to get a few copays knocked off or excused or at the very least a bill pay option so you can pay them as youre able. I do have access to pharmacy cards. These cards generally offer up to  off even used at the pharmacy. Sometimes and for some things it doesnt help the cost with insurance. Other medications are lowered to a couple dollars though. Its paid for by the US Pain foundation. I could send you one but first Im looking online to see if they might be able to send you one through the website like the bracelets. This one you might only be able to get through someone.Lastly Id take another look at the insurance plans your SO is offered. Most companies will have multiple types of plans that offer different copays for visits and medicines. Maybe you two can look over it together and see if youre able to come up with a cheaper option. Lastly since you work unfortunately disability probably cant help. However depending on your income and state theyre may be services that can help you with food or rent ect. Then youll have more money for paying medical lol.  Seeing as you both work unfortunately you probably make too much for this type of help. LOOK INTO IT! Many states offer random grants and help those in a tough spot. Cash assistance for example TANF  requires the person to work so you could very well qualify. Id start there. Ill keep brainstorming and if you need more let me know. Good luck! ,ChronicPain,cjhxu0h,0,t5_2rdpj

1638337,0,t1_cjlnnwx,The issue is that I am in Canada.  I moved from Ottawa to bucktown nowhere basically.  I STILL after  years do not have what we call a family doctor.  I think you guys call them PCs primary care.  I forget the exact them.  Well if youre in the USA that is.  This hospital is on the Quebec side and Im on the Ontario side.  There is a river that separates both provinces.  Now as per new law they have to refer me to any specialists on the Ontario side even if the ER is on the Quebec side.  I was refereed to a GP  months ago and still no callback.  My old GP wont see me as Im not in Ottawa anymore.I would LOVE to discuss this with a GP and youre right it would be the person to see at this moment.  This doctor didnt even seem to know what gastroparesis was too much or that pain was a symptom of it...I felt like I had to educate which when youre in pain isnt easy to do.  And trust me I have A LOT of other pains bad fibrochronic pain etc every day.  Im used to pain.  I dont usually even complain about my pain.  I talk about it especially as an example on here to tell the new generation of chronic pain people that it can get better.  But even on here I try to not have venting posts or complaining posts because I feel like theres people who need a lot more attention NOW than I do.  I dont want to take away from what they need and I do try to answer posts as much as I can especially if I know about the condition.  I was lost and confused before my diagnosis so I try my best to help those people.  Im the same with the ER.  I even want the baby with a bad cold to be treated first.  Hes not used to pain and it may be intolerable to him.  Im an adult whos used to pain.  Im not making myself out to be some saint I hope...I just mean that yes I do feel the pain but when you feel something every day  awake or asleep you have no choice but to get used to it.  I think most of the pain veterans know this and to be a veteran you dont need long trust me!  Im going on  years but less than  months and youre a chronic pain veteran in my books....you are already hardening compared to what most people can handle.  You can take more.  They couldnt walk a day in your shoes without complaining and crying and complaining some more.I do have a paper with all my meds etc.  I showed my grandma where it was as well as my health card but I guess she was panicked too.  They put ALL my meds in a small garbage bag kitchen type and of course I looked like a huge druggie.  I have  bottles full with  percocets each.  I mean at least the doctor was smart enough to say hes only really taking  pills per day the rest repeat and his doctor must of had reasons to have high trust to prescribe so much at a time.  She got that...only thing she got that made sense to me I feel.What I will do is call on Monday as Im supposed to call back as they want me to see another nutritionist I know the GP diet but whatever I can do to please them.  I will ask about my referal to the gastro dr and see if theres any way to ask the dr that I saw to push it...write emergency etc.  I dont know if shell want to as my pain is gone ...for now the GP pain.  So am I an emergency at the moment?  Likely not?!I may be my parents to loan me k to go see one in the USAprivate doctor.  You can get in anywhere with money there.  Its the downfall of Canada.  Everyone gets treated but in some areas its slow.  When I was in the city I saw a gastroenterologist within a month as a nonemergency.  Here its been  and not even a call.Oh btw what the doctor said was that some nerve from my stomach contracted not the Vagus nerve associated with GP btw and that it did go up to my neck and its likely what caused the pain.  I had to ask for theories about x before I got that answer.  Its not a definite answer btw.  Its a theory of hers.  It does make sense I have to agree but is it  sure its that NOPE!  I go home to this.  We all go home to our health being crappy.  The ER is pretty much...how can we get rid of you today.  So I dont even know what Id do if this happened again.  Do the  minute drive to the ER on the Ontario side which is a HUGE ER with all the latest machines or go to this ER that is missing a ton of machines and has like  doctor working ER at a time Monday to Friday .I know that they wont do the work to help me.  I know that much so far.  Oh and they know my family btw.  My family has .  They donate...I still get crappy treatment.  My mom was there so was my grandma.  The doctor didnt know me but my mom made it clear that I was her eldest son.  No better treatment at all.  Hours for a shot of something weak and an ice pack.  I also had to ask for a Vomibag Im sure you can guess what that is x before I got it.  Are they so expensive?! LOL  In Ottawa they gave me one as soon as I came in because with gastroparesis you dont feel it coming.  Youve got the pain then BAM youre sick.  No time to make it to a garbage or a toilet.  I figured hed prefer me to have a damn vomibag the nurse than to have the janitors pick up puke everywhere.  I asked politely too even if I was in pain.  When I finally got it I had to raise my voice.  May I PLEASE PLEASE have a VOMIBAG.  I think you prefer I PUKE in there than ALL OVER.  I finally got it.  The ER is never fun and that goes for all of us.  I just dont think Ive ever been treated this badly or poorly or lightly I guess. ,ChronicPain,cjlodtr,0,t5_2rdpj

There are six in the US. You will go through about seven hours a day of physical and occupational therapy and you will be discharged when you are fully functional. Trust me stairs will be no problem at all. For most kids though not all pain levels are drastically reduced and many finish with no pain at all. You will set goals such as returning to martial arts etc. and you will be in a program for anywhere from  weeks.

1974168,0,t1_ckqbu3e,I think your last few lines in this reply hit the nail on the head about why people get defensive when fibro is called a psychosomatic disorder. There is a negative connotation with the term psychosomatic disorder that implies that were hypochondriacs or we should just be able to get over it because its all in our heads. Have you ever read any studies or seen lectures by Dr Dan Clauw? Hes a rheumatologistpsychanaesthesiologistresearcherpain guru in the US. He uses awesome phrases like issues with pain amplification and centralised sensitisation to describe disorders like FMS. Its much more validating as a patient to hear that. You may get the impression that FMS patients glamorise their illness because we have to fight so damn hard against people including medical professionals who think its NOT a real illness or a serious illness or that were drug seeking.

I mean I get it but youre your own person. Part of CBT teaches that why give people the time of day you could be using to better yourself.  months also some say but it doesnt matter because youre in pain and thats not okay.

Talking to a therapist helped loads. I still have bad days but they are much fewer than before. Also you need some professional help to get you sleeping better since poor sleep and chronic pain are interconnected. You need to see a doctor. I waited too long and it turns out if I had started treating the pain sooner it might not be so severe now. I mean this in the kindest way possible there is no way you can possibly accurately selfdiagnose yourself with something as confusing as nerve pain. It could be pudendal neuralgia it could be a pelvic floor disorder who knows? Also dysesthesia is a description of the type of pain it does not tell you what the root cause is and therefore does not tell you whether or not there is no treatment.

2014782,0,t1_ckvylkw,Thanks Ill look into getting an appointment as fast as possible and Ill start writing both a list of medications and probably the best definitions of the pain I can come up with previously Ive ended up choking when asked to describe the pain. Thanks for all your help but one last thing just to be sure from what Ive read online Im almost sure I have been experiencing dysesthetic burning and at times it seems like a form of hypersensitivity. You seem to be very well educated on the subject and I was just wandering if in your experience these symptoms match up When at its worst the pain feels like an intense form of pins and needles in so far as its a repeating lancinating pain spread across the affected area. Pain is often triggered by touch or friction but also sometimes starts of its own accord. The area is often slightly red not very noticeable but slightly inflamed. Pain seems to be heat sensitive when in cold temperatures the pain is less likely to occur and if it does is less severe whereas in high temperatures the pain occurs very frequently is more severe and is less likely to go away. This ones a bit out there but under a shower turned high the skin feels more similar to my hands than any other area in that its incredibly sensitive but each drop is also moderately painful. At touch once again its very sensitive.I appreciate youre not a professional and if this is over your head thats completely fine Ill hopefully get some sort of confirmation when I see the GP anyway.Just wanted to say the GPs in my town are pretty terrible my sister dislocated the tendon in her ankle it was very severe and ended up requiring surgery but before she was correctly diagnosed she was told multiple times is was a sprain and completely ignored despite the fact you could literally see the tendon when she moved her ankle.

2143317,0,t1_clc7mb6,Thanks.  Im glad that youre doing better.Im very depressed lately.  I cry entirely too much.  Its odd because Ive been sick for around  years but Im just starting to mourn my future.  Or I should say the future that I wanted.  Ive tried telling myself that I dont have it so bad.  I know of all the atrocities on this planet.  The starving children women and men.  The rapes.  The genital mutilations the inequalities the murders...  I am of course terribly blessed like most other Canadians to not really have to deal with that at least not as our realitywe see it and we do try to help but its not our lives usually....  Even reminding myself of all those things I cannot stop these selfcentered feelings.  I dont think anyone can.  Maybe someone like the Dalai Lama would die for others or totally live a life for others and really be able to do it.  I couldnt.  I do my best to help those less fortunate but I cannot stop reminding myself that Im also less fortunate than some others...  If you dont mind me asking do you see yourself that way too?  I mean due to the pain.  Like I said we are fortunate to live in our countries etc and not in utter poverty but there are many who have that luxury and who are healthy as well.Im trying to let go of that depression.  Im doing my best to be more social lately.  Like I told you I did that dating profile Im back on Facebook after being off from that thing for years I hate their policies but meh...My life is so boring...if they really need to sell my info so be it lol..Im hoping to reconnect with some people.  I started the therapy after people here suggested it.  Its only been a few sessions but it does feel good to talk.  Im trying to bring back a certain normalcy to my life even if my life was never entirely normal what is really.  I guess that its the best that I can do for now and hopefully I beat this depressive mood this depression like you did.  I have been way more tired lately and Im starting to think that the depression is a huge cause of it.  The more I sleep the less I do the less I feel human the more I feel depressed.  I joined a local Facebook group for handicapped people...were such a small viallge in the boonies here.  I wouldnt of ever used the word handicapped for my group but whatever...They dont seem to keen on people with invisible illnesses but Ill see if I cant change their minds...Meeting locals who live with disabilities could be good for me. I will meet people with intellectual disabilities too because they can be very wise.  I think that going out and meeting people who are living after a disability and with a disability might help.  Ill keep you posted.  I hope that something Im doing differently as of late pays off.  I want everyone on here to be happy but I would lie if I said that I didnt want myself to be happy too. ,ChronicPain,clc9i5u,1,t5_2rdpj

But then he got diabetes. In not very long he started having terrible peripheral neuropathy.  It probably came on so fast because of the drinking but he was what he was. He couldnt get the doctors to prescribe what he needed for pain. Then he told everyone on his regular channel that he was gonna try heroin. And he did. And pretty much dropped off the internet at least to talk. Someone later pointed out a page showing he had been arrested a couple of times. And it was so sad. He was someone who had never been arrested before was honest the only slightly far out things was the drinking mostly beer and being into conspiracies. But the pain put him into a different place. And he had savings. And had bought gold. Pretty sure he had to sell it to get heroin cause while opiates really are just a farm crop they can be grown and processed cheaply but once they become a street drug they become enormously expensive cause of the street premium.

2337463,0,t3_2m3jnr,I dont know if its so much that its outdated or dudlike in any way. Our body is just weird. Humans not even people with chronic pain although our bodies are a bit more complex. For me sometimes this happens a lot actually my meds dont feel like theyre working mentally. But it is really more along the lines of taking my medication knowing that it hasnt worked for me in the past sometimes and knowing that it could all be in my head that it isnt working. I am not saying your pain is in your head or the fact that it doesnt work is in your head. It is a psychological concept though that is  something my psychiatrist psychologist and pain docs agree on as a potential explanation of that phenomenon.  How long have you been taking percocet? I have never taken that but it seems like you might have a bit of tolerance working up and not manifesting all at one time? That would really be the only thing I could think of.

2339470,0,t1_cm0pefw,I am not positive about how this situation came to be but as far as i can tell sometime in the late s early s someone noticed that there was in increase in opiate related deaths. This led to studies that showed a high rate of opiate use.  Now what a lot of people arent pointing out is that many of the addicts were not typical chronic pain patients nearly all has previous substance abuse problems and a majority of the addicted patients and the over prescribing doctors were in the VA system. Also not mentioned is that just prior to this increase there was a HUGE push by manufacturers of their opiate products. some later articles have doctors claiming they were outright lied to about the intended use of them such as Oxycontin being for temporary or intermittent pain rather than chronic constant pain.As far as I can tell instead of better oversight and treatment someone decided that it would be better to suggest not using these medications at all. It could be because of the lack of evidence that they help but the big reason no one did studies on it before is because this was a given many studies are being done and some are even in review process now.  I guess the no opiates campaign took hold or someone in the government really liked it and it has been spewing out propaganda ever since.Some of the proven false claims they have made Most addicts are chronic pain patients Most chronic pain patients become addicts There is no evidence it helps Opiates make the pain worse this is only true in very specific circumstances Patients have plenty of other options not exactly untrue but what about after you have tried all those options? Most chronic pain is not of a severity that needs medication this study included things like minor arthritis and pulled muscles as chronic pain conditions,ChronicPain,cm0vdg5,3,t5_2rdpj

Shes stuck with it and she probably worries about all of the things that youve mentioned. In addition to that she is likely to assess your attitude and reaction as well. If you dont think you can handle it you would be better off leaving her now because it will save you both a lot of problems later. If you really love her you need to find a way to do things with her that she can do. If date nights turn more into movie nights at home rather than going out dancing... would you be ok with that? The key is to find things that you both enjoy that she is capable of doing.

The good ones have a ton of empathy and are building a relationship with you to improve your health  emotional and physical. Pain docs approach your treatment holistically  the whole enchilada  body and mind. They know if youre not sleeping your emotional and physical outlook is negatively  impacted. Same with managing the pain levels throughout the day. Id expect youll be looking at a combination of therapies including meds PT and possibly diagnostic injections. Youll sign a contract and pee In a cup on the regular. Your age will be a concern  mine was  and Im  years older than you. They worry about longterm effects of meds on your organs and mental functioning. And of course addiction. Generally they start klonopin dosage pretty low. You may have some wiggle room to increase.

And that in all my years of PT  I was told that was a warning sign to scale it back a bit. ,ChronicPain,ctavafm,1,t5_2rdpj

4756368,0,t3_3g0wh8,If it is a close friend or family member I try to use a specific pain I know they have experienced as a reference point. Then I tell them to imagine having that pain for weeks months and years with no relief. Ask someone you know well to recall the pain of a past injury and chances are they cant accurately remember how much they hurt. I dont have that luxury I know everyday exactly how much I hurt because the pain has never gone away. If it is someone I dont know as well Ive tried common pain descriptors like extreme stabbing and shooting with little success. I have found pain from dental work is something most adults have experienced and can use that as a reference. However Ive come to the conclusion that it is more important to convey the permanency of my pain instead of the level or intensity. It is there constantly whether Im standing sitting laying down just falling asleep or just waking up. Everything you do during your day I do with the addition of back pain. It will get worse until I am able to take prescription meds and get in my chair for several days. No it isnt gone now it is just back down to normal pain for me. Yes it has been a long time since my injury and surgery but it still hurts. Yes I know every injury you have sustained including broken bones has healed in a much shorter time but that doesnt mean I hurt any less. No I will not do work that will cause me more pain no matter how trivial or easy you think the work is. Does this make me lazy? No it makes me smart. I doubt this helps people understand but it is what I have experienced with  years of nonstop back pain. ,ChronicPain,ctu33bt,7,t5_2rdpj

I am still an inquisitive person but I do focus on the latter more now.The second thing would be  I absolutely agree that when that insurance comes through be pushy about better referrals and do the groundwork yourself about who to see first from whatever support groups on the net recommend.Just make sure that the support team you do put together at the end is indeed on a holistic levelcaters to all aspects and not just the physical pain.

Either you do not have a proper diagnosis or those herniated discs are in fact causing you a fuckton of pain.It infuriates me when doctors say a certain condition such as yours should not cause so much pain. Why not? Every human body is different.For FOUR YEARS OF HELL I was told that the vascular non cancerous tumor that was aggressively growing in my T vertebrae simply COULD NOT cause pain.  Oh really?  I nearly commit suicide despite heaps of opiates from the pain. I received the same rolled eyes its in your headpsychobabble as you did.  Like you I started to doubt my judgement and instinct.  I was hitting the point where my husband knew I was dying so he took me to France where they did an MRI said fuck this tumor is about to explode bleed out and kill her lets operate NOW.  And they said yes while usually those tumors hemangiomas do not cause pain in a small number of cases they most certainly DO cause pain such as if they are pressing on a nerve.I also took  years to find the one drug that helped.  Heaps of oxycontin all the nerve pain drugs opiates nerve blocks etc TENS unit all fucking useless.Except methadone.  The docs said it was no different but I insisted on trying it and it was like magic.  It didnt take all the pain away but it quite literally stopped me from planning and executing my suicide.You need more opinions. I am so sorry youve reached this point. I remember clearly the times I wanted so badly to hospitalize myself on a morphine drip because the pain was constant crushing killing me from the inside out. And most docs just rolled their fucking eyes because I was too young and looked too good.Please do not give up. See as many docs as you must until you meet one who is not a lazy fuck who only wants to spend  minutes with you.There are also more diagnostic tests you may do such as a discogram an EMG a bone scan etc. The back is highly complex and MRIs and CTs hardly show everything.  Your pain could be coming not from those discs but from something completely different.You are not crazy. You are suffering. You are sleep deprived.  Its a terrible sense of betrayal when doctors blame YOU for either being a drug seeker or exaggerating when you are truly suffering and just want a diagnosis and treatment. The docs give you  minutes of their time dismiss your stupid quesitons tell you do to do core work and try to relax or send you to a goddamn mental therapist.You are your only advocate.  Keep good records in a binder that describes your pain well. I have typed up a timeline of events a complete description of my pain what happens when I am weight bearing etc. what meds help and what dont and I give a copy to each new doc I see. I tell them up front that my case appears to be unique and I will need their dedication not a mere  minutes and if they arent ready or prepared for a patient like me please let me know beforehand.I am so sorry.

Oh well Ive never been one to be silenced.Semantics are important. How often do doctors get patients looking for specific treatment that is not the right treatment? it happens a lot. people like us who have to devote a major portion of our lives to the study of treatments effective for our problems and we walk into a doctors office with a real understanding of what to expect and a knowledge that we may have to fight for proper treatment. That sucks but for  of people who visit a doctor may have heard of some treatment or another but that is not the right treatment at what point do the doctors have to draw the line? of course not receiving the treatment we want can still be treatment or else there would be no need for doctors. To suggest that patients be given whatever treatment they want or else be guilty of refusing treatment is seriously a silly thing. But does the line get crossed? absolutely. Those of us who have had to argue with our doctors because they keep trying things that we have already had tried for me methadone is the one that Ive had to start telling new doctors dont proscribe it or I wont pay because it doesnt work for me... like... at all.... Did the line get crossed here in her case? absolutely! but just because a doctor doesnt give a patient the treatment the patient wants doesnt mean the doctor refused treatment.

That doesnt mean that the marginal assistance we get from pain killers is not valuable and appreciated.With that kind of statement youre showing how little you know about the positive effects painkillers have on my painful existence. Honestly its annoying if a doctor questions the efficacy of pain killers because some random bloke that does not have an illness is going to get high off these drugs. Can you see how the two are not related? Its annoying that other peoples recreational use of drugs affects us chronic pain patients. The United states is known to over react on many issuess. Well now youre dragging down patients with this addiction prevention obsession. Your idea to curb addiction is to question treatment efficacy of a patient? What the hell! Invest in mental health resources you tards. P.s. you are not scienceing if you define the effectiveness of a medication by summing up all illnesses as if its a monolithic entity. Dont you know that chronic pain is full of diverse illnesses?,ChronicPain,czc2gkj,5,t5_2rdpj

6416000,0,t3_43kh53,Hey Im F but have been chronically ill for  years now. Do your parents support you at all? You should demand a slew of doctor consults such as. Rheumatologist . Immunologist. Infectious Disease . NeurologistIt took me  months to receive a diagnosis and its only because I had a friend with chronic Lyme Disease. I cannot even count how many doctors insisted there was nothing wrong that it was depression or psychological.. Especially being female. PM me theres an abundance of info I want to offer. And although you may not have what I have Ive learned a large amount of info about chronic illnesses diseases etc. in the process. The overlaying point is that all tests are not  accurate doctors CAN be wrong and unfortunately more than half of these cases the only way to get help is to be your own advocate fight and never give up even though you feel lousy and even if you never feel  ok your life can and will get better.

6584802,0,t3_45tvff,Being able to get enough relief to sleep and still being able to have a satisfactory quality of life is one of the biggest issues Ive ran into on my pain management journey as well. The strategy that is working the best for me right now is something akin to pyramid dosing. When I wake up my pain is typically an  or a  because of the gap in my meds so I compensate by taking mg oxy during this time I am my most active and after an hour the most pain free. After  hours this starts to wear off so I redose with mg.  hrs after this its time to get ready for bed and I take my gabba flexeril and  mg of oxy to take the edge off of the pain so I can sleep and get thru that first  hours which is the roughest patch of sleeping for me. This is just what works for me now. I have also tried setting an alarm half way thru my night to wake up and redose to keep the morning from being so bad.

You just sort of notice that its not as sharp and piercing.  When you stop taking it the pain edges back in.  Really important to keep taking it for effect.What it does is something to affect nerves that fire off to much.  So since its affecting nerves theres going to be an adjustment period for your body.   weeks or according to the website.  Thats when the biggest amount of dizzinesssleepiness hit me.As with anything this may not work for you and results may vary.  Im not associated with Pfizer at all its just worked over time to keep my sciatic and ulnar nerve pain in check.  Lots of people here didnt have any luck with Lyrica and it is stupid expensive.  Thankfully my insurance covers it without a problem.For information heres the medicine stack Im onCelebrex and Lyrica for constant use tramadol and flexeril for breakthrough pain as needed.

7853736,0,t3_4mu43p,I have an undiagnosed disease that is most likely endometriosis. Endometriosis is when the lining that grows in the uterus that a fertilized egg attaches to to make a baby grows in other places. Thats the tissue that is shed every month during a normal period. No matter where the tissue is though it can act like the regular tissue when you get your period so it can give you cramping all over and cause a lot of bleeding. It can have no symptoms or really bad symptoms and diagnosing it is relatively difficult. You have to find the tissue and biopsy it to confirm it but since the tissue grows cyclically they cant be certain theyll find anything when they do a laparoscopy. I was also recently told by my OBGYN that the tissue can even be microscopic so you can have it and they may not be able to see it or biopsy it.I dont look sick at all but my symptoms are a lot of cramping nausea and chronic migraines. Im on the depo shot to treat it since birth control is basically the only way Im aware of to treat it and Im still getting a lot of cramping and sickness. Ive also been getting more migraines then usual and my doctor wants to put me on a preventative medicine to help with them. Since the depo shot hasnt made them better I just started it again about a month ago and the first time I was on it I wasnt getting the migraines as frequently so I was trying to see if they would go away with the shot Ill most likely have to start the preventative medicine which sucks because the one he wants to put me on causes weight loss and Im only about  lbs at . Hes putting me on that one though because the other one can lower your blood pressure and mine is on the low end of healthy already. It doesnt sound like there are any other options for that kind of medication. Its frustrating because I already have issues with eating which Im pretty sure has to do with whatever disease I actually have but Im getting migraines about twice a week on top of all the cramping so I kind of need to go on it to feel better. Now Ill have to monitor my weight on top of everything.I also just get a lot of fatigue from all of this. Plus Im probably gonna get depressed from the depo shot again Im already not feeling so great but it works the best out of all my other options. I think out of everything I experience no one expected me to be in pain literally all the time since they think its just a really bad period. They also dont understand why Im so tired all the time and it gets frustrating because I dont have the worst disease out there and just because Im sick does not mean my friends and familys problems arent important but sometimes theyre really not very empathetic and it makes me angry with them when I dont want to be. Im stuck because I want somebody to make things easier on me because its hard but then I think it could be worse and I dont want people to cater to me.I should probably say that this is all just from my experience and what my own research has shown me. Ive tried to learn more about endometriosis but since I havent been diagnosed with anything I havent put a huge amount of effort into it. Basically take what Ive said about the actual disease with a grain of salt especially since the disease itself isnt completely understood.,ChronicPain,d3ytwmd,5,t5_2rdpj

If you were a shit time they wouldnt want to celebrate with you.Its not weak to tell them youre feeling pain down or crap. Its weak for them to not be able to process that appropriately. Especially as students in the medical field! Although Ive often found those to be the worst. Even in my degree. You would think that people studying psychology would be the kindest most tender people you can find. They can be the most brutal. Even I can be. I guess you just get desensitised and also have a patientpersona to an extent. I say things to my friends I would never dare say to a client. I agree with the other poster stress can make pain worse. Find some meditation on youtube or some mindfulness. Make a decision about the exam either youre going to defer it or sit it. Feel confident in that decision and stick to it. Dont stress about sleeping dont let your brain annoy you that its not happening just attempt to wind down lights off listen to some youtube get your mind in a better place. Try the alphabet game. Pick a theme. Countries. A is for Australia B is for... keep going it actually gets a little tough. Other themes can be comedy movies vegetables. You can do this. Youve gotten this far. Everything will be okay. ,ChronicPain,d40co0g,1,t5_2rdpj

7873880,0,t3_4n3d1i,I actually do use exercise to cope with my chronic pain but my story may be different in that I chose to run marathons with extremly bad compartment syndrome that developed when playing high level athletics in highschool. I kept having recurrence of compartment syndrome through NCAA D athletics and into my marathoning post college.When it got too bad i.e. chronic pain level i decided to have a fasciotomy to help the pain. But it made the pain worse and I have permanent nerve damage from having nerves compressed by compartment syndrome for  years during college and post college. anyway I have found a new style of working out that I can endure because it is in short intervals. It is based on crossfit or HIIT. It works because I can suck up terrible legit level pain for  min at a time. The flare up pain post workout is grueling  i am miserable and in tears for  hours post workout. BUT it does make me feel better to be active as that is what so much of my joy and fun in life is rooted in. Mentally I am better being active and crying in pain than sitting around and being unactive. It makes me depressed.For a year after the bad surgeries that caused all these problems I sat around and walked or walked in the pool. Then one day I got fed up with myself and started to make a change. I could only endure  min of the severe pain i get during workouts at the beginning  months ago but now I can endure  min to an hour. The pain afterwards I manage with strong painkillers. Even at work I take drugs. it is my only option for the timebeing as I have failed so many interventional approaches.Hang tough all and consider the mental benefit of some level of activity. Not saying you have to or should be as crazy as I am and put yourself thru extreme pain but hey its gonna be painful but IMO it will be better than sitting around and getting depressed which Is what i did before i went back to the gym,ChronicPain,d413hn9,-1,t5_2rdpj

8125892,0,t3_4qiqej,Im sorry she left you. If one day she experiences a long or chronic illness maybe shell have a different perspective and her understanding of you will change and shell gain a bit more empathy. Love is about being there for someone when they are there for you especially if theyre fighting through pain to do it. Its easy to be there when things are going well. And easier to leave in a crisis. You deserve a better love than that a kinder more generous and reciprocal kind. I originally started following this sub because my partner has had chronic pain for many years. Then I developed it about six months ago. I have a better understanding of his experience now and it has deepened my love and commitment and made me hyper aware of how damaging it is to make someone feel like a burden.Dont give up on yourself. Youve suffered two huge losses your health and a relationship of  years.

8133610,0,t1_d4ttfhd,Im glad to hear your parents are understandingthat really helps so much.  gt  my left si joint doesnt movebarely moves so if we can get it to drop back where it needs to that should fix a lot of my painHey high five!  My left SI is also nearly permanently dislocated.  Yay us!  Has your docPT given you either shoe lifts or an SI brace?  The brace didnt help me a lot but it does help some people.  The shoe lift did help.  Essentially my SI is rotated up and back so my left leg is a bit shorter than my right.  My PT would get it back into place but itd dislocate again within an hour or so of leaving her.  The shoe lift keeps my hips level and helps the SI stay in place.  Its pretty cheap no one else can see it and it really helped medef worth a shot.Also is it your left knee causing problems?  Im guessing it is.  When you see your ortho make sure he knows about your SI.  He wont be able to properly address the knee pain if your whole leg is out of alignment because of your hiphell have to address everything as a whole.Heres the thing with POTS.  A lot of people with EDS also have POTS because our blood vessels are also made of collagenwhich for us is defective.  When you move to stand up your autonomic nervous system makes certain adjustments to ensure enough blood gets to your brain while upright.  It constricts the blood vessels in your extremities to help push the blood upwards.  But our blood vessels can be a bit stretchy and dont always constrict properly.  That means blood pools in our legs etc and not enough gets pushed up to our brains.  Because of that our blood pressure drops.  Then to try to get enough blood moving upwards our hearts start beating really fast.  So you get the perfect storm low blood pressure high heart rate  dizziness and faintness and general unpleasantness.Add to that many people with POTS have lower than normal blood volume too.  So there just isnt enough blood to go around in the first place.  Thats where salt and steroids come in.  For some reason our kidneys tend to just push all the fluids straight through instead of adding to our blood volume.  The saltsteroids trick our kidneys into retaining fluid.  That helps build up the blood volume and helps us feel better.  It doesnt actually cure POTS it just helps alleviates the symptoms.  Another thing that can help is an SSRI like fluoxetine prozac or SNRI like venlafaxine effexor.  They typically used as antidepressants but they help stimulate vasoconstriction so more blood goes up.  I dont recommend effexor it has awful side effects and terrible withdrawal.  Fluoxetine is much less drastic and has few side effects for most people.Beta blockers reduce the heart rate by blocking the receptors that are responsible for the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine.  It helps some people but Im not one of them.  Essentially my cardio told me that he could put me on a beta blocker and it would bring my heart rate downbut Id probably pass out every time I sat up.  Basically your body compensates for the low BP by raising the heart rate.  Take that away and even less blood gets to your braindown you go.I should mention that not everyone with POTS has low BP when upright.  If youre one of those whose BP raises beta blockers may help you.  Ask your cardio if thats an option.  If you dont feel hes being aggressive enough in his treatment dont be afraid to advocate for yourself.  Or bring your mom in with you and have her help explain exactly how much this affects your quality of life.  Ive found that most docs really arent in a big hurry to treat EDS and POTSthey want to take things slowly and see what happens mainly because these are lifelong conditions.  Dont be afraid to ask for more if that slow approach isnt working for you.  Be polite but firm.  Sometimes it helps to keep a log of your symptoms and take it to an appointment.  I made a list of all the things I couldnt do anymore and it got the docs attention.  Alsocompression stockings can really help!  You can try support hose from your local store or find compression stockings online amazon is good.  I prefer the thighhighs but ymmv.  Also I dont wear them in public cause yuck. lol  The other thing is to avoid heat as much as possible including hot showers baths etc.  The heat also dilates your blood vessels and exacerbates everything.gtI spend most of my days laying in bed replaying shows Ive already seen on Netflix and I hate it.I hear you.  Ive had a really bad flare since midFeb and thats pretty much what Ive been doing.  I cant sit up for too long so I browse reddit while laying down then sit up to comment. lol  If your hands are bothering you that much you really should see an OT sooner than later.  Check with your insurance or have your parents do it! and see if you need a referral to see a specialist.  Some insurance policies dont require that.  If so you could just make an appointment yourself and save some time.  Id call first to see if they have experience with EDSnot all do.  If not bug your primary until they send you.  Again let them know you cant write use your laptop probably cant open bottles or carry a gallon of milk Im guessing?  Doors difficult to open?  Look on amazon for arthritis aids.  I know its silly since youre only  but theres a lot of overlap in things that can help us.  My geneticist recommended these pens though I havent tried them yet.  I use the Dr Grip pens theyre fat enough to lessen the pain in my hands when writing.  Also those pencil grips kids use are greatand you can put them on colored pencils and lots of other things.  This got a bit long sorry for that!  Hope some of it helps though.  Just remember YOU ARE NOT ALONE.  There are a lot of us out here we get it.  Dont be afraid to ask questions and feel free to pm me if you need to vent or whatever.  Im just hanging out at home being bored too! ,ChronicPain,d4uahtj,2,t5_2rdpj
8139090,0,t3_4qpncu,I can definitely relate to a lot of that. But I think what I focus on is that it is not my place to judge or decide how much something affects another person. We perhaps didnt get a fair lot in life and have to put up with a lot of stuff but thats not to say someone else isnt and you have zero way of knowing what else might be going on in their life. For someone who hasnt had to negotiate a chronic disease or chronic pain tearing a shoulder is probably a big deal for them. If Im being quite blunt Id say it sounds like youre looking for a lot of attention and validation from other people for your own condition and are going after it by invalidating other peoples lives. I think you just need to work on developing a mindset wherein you can come to realize and understand that everyone accepts and struggles with the same issue in a different manner. You dont have the right to tell another person to not complain or not be upset about whatever it is theyre dealing with just as anyone else has no right judging you for your pain. Youre allowed to feel whatever you feel however youre not allowed to act however you want to act. I think maintaining a professional level of distance among your coworkers is acceptable. You should look into the practice of mindfulness based stress reduction. ,ChronicPain,d4uxjyb,2,t5_2rdpj

You can ask your local pharmacists if they have suggestions. Though they may not be able to straight out say who is good or bad they typically can tell you each Drs personality im a pcist.

9394820,0,t1_d95yg11,Thanks  I am going to see a neurologist about it to see if its related to nerves and what I can do about it. I am based in Ireland so cant see those doctors you mentioned.Its been yr  months since I had the surgery and feel i have less pressure now but more of a constant nervy type pain  I can run for mins on a threadmill now which I couldnt do before the surgery. Are you doing anything for your nerve entrapment? medication?,ChronicPain,d96uyba,1,t5_2rdpj
9395448,0,t1_d96uyba,Sorry to hear youre unable to travel to states. If the treatment I hope to try in about  hour fails I will have to save money to travel to Hong Kong for treatment.Sounds like we are in similar boats with our pain. Rather than see a neurologist contact a person by the name of Peter Bregman on Facebook messenger and ask him for AENS surgeons in the usa. Contact Dr. Stanley Lam via Facebook messenger and ask him for MSKUS docs in Europe there are some. Do not get a surgery for nerve entrapment I urge you to avoid it. Its risky and uncertain. For my nerves now I for awhile did a lot of massage which helped bUT didnt give permanent results. So due to expense of that I quit it. I started working out with a trainer who has experience working with people who have had massive injuries like myself due to military combat injuries. My coming back SUPER SLOW I have made progress and can now run over  min at a time and do cardio circuits for  hours. But I have extreme pain and the workouts make it worse.I wouldnt bother with meds. I take opioids as needed to sleep and I suck up the pain the rest of the time. I have tried a million meds and most give me such terrible side effects that I would rather be in debilitating nerve pain. You might also order a myofascial cupping kit off amazon  cheap. Lifts tissue instead of compressing like massage. Can help lift tissue in leg to ease entrapment. I get a tiny bit of relief from it at times.Ive also tried in no specific order ultrasound guided peripheral nerve blocks Peter Bergman can find you a doc and it was the only treatment that temporarily relieved pain...and its only supposed to be temporary.I also have failed the belowNerve root blocksSpinal cord stimulator trialSympathetic nerve blocksProlotherapyDeep lidocaine injections not ultrasound guidedDry needling makes it worse dont do this modality,ChronicPain,d96xtek,1,t5_2rdpj

9451164,0,t1_d9dfrnp,Yeah I was reading and I didnt realize so many people actually abuse Lyrica which now makes sense why its a controlled substance. The Seroquel I can see taking a few weeks for anxietydepression etc but I thought the sleep effect would be immediate and thats what Im taking it for. I get so frustrated always reacting weird to medications. I definitely think the side effects can be worse than the problems theyre prescribed for. This whole year Ive been on a cocktail of evershifting prescriptions and half of them are drugs to counteract the side effect of another drug. Swallow the spider to catch the fly problem. Oh yes and my neurologist is an issue. She does know what shes doing in general I think and sometimes I see her and shes fine. Other times I come in and she screaming at people and firing her staff. Theres some other shifty stuff going on too like my PM doctor warned me not to let me let her do any spine injections on me because shes not certified. She wants me to do more facet injections which everyone else disagrees with. That was one of the reasons she yelled at me tooI havent let her do the injections because literally four doctors told me not to let her do it. Anyway see the above about why Im stuck with her for now but I agree shes not ideal but its just slightly better than having no neurologist at all for now. I wish all my doctors were like my psychiatristshes so nice and always wants to collaborate with my other doctors and she tries to make me feel like I have agency in the treatment decisions. Night and day from being screamed at by the neurologist for not submitting to a dangerous procedure that she potentially has neither the equipment or certification to perform. ,ChronicPain,d9e02ju,1,t5_2rdpj

10334960,0,t1_dca688r,Hahahahahahahahaha I agree wholeheartedly sorry Ive developed an extremely dark sense of humor as a coping mechanism for the pain and resultant depression if a person adamantly opposes opioid analgesics theyve never had longterm pain yet they pretend to know everything about it. Hmmmmm hubris and arrogance right there. gtI am not feeling pain therefore it does not exist and so that makes you a faker and drugseeker! Im dying laughing at how accurately this portrays the thought processes just beneath the consciousness in these individuals and how horrible this is. gtThese federal people havent succeeded in stopping illegal drugs nor are they likely to anytime soon they are fighting some very hard targets  honestly these Cartels would frighten anybody. In fact overdoses have continued to climb despite the recent reduction in pain medication prescribing on all fronts in the past couple years. The CDC lied about the ODs increasing from legitimately prescribed pain meds. That number has remained relatively stable over the years. Furthermore you fight illegal trafficking by legalizing the shit and starve the cartels and illicit drug manufacturers of any profit like you would do with a competitor but instead weve made our healthcare product so shitty that people go to heroin instead. gtSo my guess is to justify their own existence they turn to the soft targets the people that cant fight back  prescription medication users. Crack down on us people desperately in need of pain meds lock up doctors and they can then produce a mighty impressive Powerpoint presentation brimming with SUCCESSES to show congress at budget time.  Upon reading this bit I am overcome with the desire to roll on the floor laughing while at the same time inclined to cry so instead I smirked and giggled. This may very well be the case but sadly theres no god way to know at this point in time although its a hysterically funny thought that absolutely merits consideration. gtAre they really this uncaring? Do they NOT care about the agony and pain they cause among people who have legitimate need for pain killers? Well...you will know them by the deeds they do! These DEA professionals have immense power  they have the ability to lock anyone up for violating these often unreasonable laws they have the power to entrap trick and coerce doctors and pharmacists they have the power to revoke doctor licenses. Which in turn makes doctors terrified of prescribing these medications since the consequences of one misstep are too high for them!Tragically yes they are this uncaring or perhaps they simply really really believe that theyre doing the right thing. They could just be horribly ignorant and figure because things are this way there must be a good reason and as such I wont question it which is a fallacy common in humans but then again is these peoples ignorance a crime? I think yes but that is an opinion. The real crime is the sum total of the results of the organizations actions diffusing the responsibility enough that the systemic discrimination is hard to challenge and difficult to place blame which is why the CDC needs to be the first target. Yeah fear makes the prefrontal cortex shut off involved in all higher functioning so these doctors are scared so shitless of the DEA that the part of their brain that involves empathy can be bypassed by creating an us them dichotomy and labeling us drug seekers. Its a rudimentary defense mechanism that lots nearly all humans employ to varying degrees at various times. It allows us to make it easier to hate hurt and be unkind. gtRegardless of what the doctors have to say as they read from their script about we cannot prescribe these due to the longterm good of the patient bla bla bla as if  hours of  to  level pain wouldnt be more then enough to change anybodys mind if it were happening to them personally when bearing such pain longterm becomes the day after tomorrow! You cant function you cant think you can barely take care of yourself let alone others who depend on you. You function all day every day with the red haze of pain boiling inside you. All because some demonic sadist of a government bureaucrat doesnt think you should have pain relief for  reasons???!!!.Theres something very wrong with our society when government only makes every problem WORSE  and taxes us all for the privilege.Oh I know right. Part of it comes from doctors inability too imagine a fate worse than death the aforementioned scenario with  pain levels and a doctor refusing to help you an experience I am quite familiar with which pain becomes rather quickly if left untreated and the refusal of the doctors is often psychologically traumatic. On the other hand doctors are allowed to break these guidelines without having to be scared of DEA action but they are unreasonably afraid of the DEA and regulatory scrutiny so much so that they abstain from prescribing painkillers at all. Also a reason for this is that they arent taught the  proper way to use them despite managing pain being the primary purpose for medicines existence. Specifically in reference to longterm becomes the day after tomorrow! yes pain has been shown to slow down the subjective experience of time because the circuits involved in processing pain go a lot faster than other neural circuits heavily simplified for the sake of how much my hands hurt from typingYou are entirely right that doctors and people in general simply dont grasp the ways in which or the degree to which pain drains away any semblance of quality of life as it slowly or quickly drives you completely fucking insane. Yes self care and care for others is physically difficult for me even though Im being treated and I want too take care of myself and those who need me its just... not always possible. Its hard enough without the government restricting our ability to live our lives. Are you being even remotely adequately treated? And I find that systemic discrimination rarely starts with malicious intent it usually starts with ignorance and self interest such as is the case with the people who were the main advisors to writing the CDC guidelines PROP as they stand to benefit a great deal from these guidelines... at the expense of a third of the population... Its wrong and fucked up and we can change it. We are alive and thats more than a lot of people whose severe pain went untreated can say as many of them killed themselves and although itll be a difficult battle it is one that can be won. Am I hearing some libertarian ideals bleeding through at the end there  jkjk I dont actually identify with a political party although I did vote this election for the democratic party political affiliations aside I want everybodys help regardless of political affiliation. ,ChronicPain,dcfixhc,1,t5_2rdpj

Had to learn how to use a walker on stairs. You might want to get some granola or protein bars. Since my injury Ive been eating a lot of them. Theyre generally healthy but definitely look to see what the sugar content is. If you like nuts eat those for protein as well. Since you have a minifridge maybe get some Greek yogurt. Do not get regular yogurt since they generally have about g of sugar in each serving. Greek yogurt usually has gg but has protein and fruit. Id get some bananas as well since they dont need to be refrigerated. Apples dont really need to be refrigerated if you eat them fast enough. Maybe get peanut butter jelly and bread to keep in your room. Ive been eating a lot of baked potato chips lately. Theyre generally not too unhealthy for you. Also maybe get some bottled water. Or just drink water in general whatever is easiest to drink it. I usually have flavoring packets or flavored water. But its probably the best thing for you to drink.These are all things that I can think of off the top of my head. Hopefully someone else can add their ideas as well.

10458176,0,t3_5pr9cn,Have you thought of writing short stories about it? It could be fiction too. A few years ago I started work on a short story thats set on a world where a few members of the population are receivers to other peoples pain. They allow the rest of humanity to be happy by soaking up all the bad thats happening to people but they live terrible lives because of it. Institutes for these pain receivers are setup around the world and scientists use technology to help them cope with the pain but to also soak as much pain as possible from healthy people. I thought it was an interesting idea and I got to write about the perfect room to decrease the pain for me. I never managed to get anywhere with the story though fatigue and brain fog are a hell of an impediment. It makes writing more than a few paragraphs extremely frustrating for me. Ive tried to program and think of creating games in the same manner but its not any easier and then you need to add sounds music art and its quite the undertaking. Ive dabble in C C with SDL Java Gamemaker Studio but ultimately I hit a bad week or two of crazy pain then I forget what I had learned and was working on and I give up.Have you looked into any development kit to create a game yourself? Gamemaker Studio isnt too complex and theres a free version to learn on. I know there are game development tools to create visual novels too which is a genre I think would work best to explain chronic pain in an interactive way. I think RPG Maker could work as well in creating a nonfighting game with a strong narrativesee To The Moon.

Some patients do very well with ointments as opposed to pills. There is a link Im posting below to give you an idea of some of the compounded ointments.  I have a neighbor who uses the GabapentinLidocaine ointment on his hands and feet and says it works well for him. His insurance does not cover it and he says an  oz bottle costs him . and it lasts him about  weeks. It might be worth discussing it with your doctor.  ,ChronicPain,dcxwe0j,2,t5_2rdpj

10711750,0,t3_5t3i7x,It really depends on you and the doctor or therapist you see. The first psychiatrist I found was the worst bad listener had no clue about chronic pain and was in it for the money. My pain management clinic later set me up with an incredible pain psychologist who just listens and helps me look at what is going in a new perspective. I dont just ramble on she hears what Im saying and asks questions to lead me to a point if that makes sense. She also can tell if Im doing well or having a hard time and brings it up without making me feel awkward or judged. Its validating to have someone really see me and what Im going through. It never feels like an unbalanced doctorpatient relationship. I just started seeing a new psychiatrist as well because I wanted someone to help with meds my PCP had handled antidepressants. I started having major anxiety and felt like that needed addressing. Anyway Ill see how that goes. It is worth trying because your mental health is important. I went  years before starting. It was only after I switched doctors and on my second appointment this doctor included mental health care as part of my treatment plan. I was floored but also grateful that something so obvious hadnt been swept under the rug. ,ChronicPain,ddku4wa,3,t5_2rdpj

They are seeking help and hoping to find people who can help them learn how to cope with their problems.  A down vote can make them feel more isolated. They are humbly seeking support and get bitch slapped because some redditor doesnt like the way they have asked their questions.

I used to pride myself on how well I managed pain from injuries and I hated asking for help for anything physical tasks or otherwise because my aunt taught me that you should never ask somebody to do what you can do yourself. I prided myself on my independence.Now I cant do most things myself. I have to be carried down stairs I dont prepare my own food I have to ask friends to help me pour my own watermilk into a cup the jug is too heavy I cant even walk for long on my own and I usually have to use a wheelchair outside the house. Sometimes I really feel like I cannot cope with needing all that help cant cope with my own inability or disability.But as you said yourself so well we have limits. Once you accept that giving in to the need for them is easier. Youre not weaker now you just work differently I work differently. Sometimes it feels like I dont function very much at all because lets be honest I dont!.Bah I dont really know what Im trying to say here but your words helped me just now. So if you cant see your own strengths through your struggles at least we can see it  And we appreciate it in different ways and degrees for some. So thank you for sharing your thoughts Chronic plain has taught me that accepting help isnt defeat its just a necessity. Our bodies can do some things and cant do others. You wouldnt expect a cat to open a tin of tuna their abilities are limited. So are ours. Nobody sees the cat as weak for it just as we are not weak for other things. Youre only weak if you give up on what you can do  giving up on what you cant do is only logical.PS I really miss martial arts!
