3610988,0,t1_cq3ja6z,I think hes mostly taking a sort of perverse pleasure in our reaction to it.  Apparently some folks have said some pretty unkind things to him about it and he vehemently defended the need for painful experiences in good story telling.  As much as this chapter has bothered me I have to agree.  Mostly Ive just been telling myself that Tom hasnt let me down in  years so wherever this is going I trust it will be worth the heartache.

4378439,0,t3_3b61zj,So this isnt obliviously happy blocking bad thoughts out Annie. Its... weird I have some kind of master plan Annie like when she tried to trick Jack. Is she happy to be separated from her etheric self? I know this means she has a longer life expectancy but surely she must feel some sense of loss given how big a part of her life that was and how she was just beginning to master it? I presume her father must have separated the two of them so why is she concerned with preventing him from seeing the fire spirit? Did it escape somehow? Why is Anthony letting it just... wander around? Are they joining back together now? Im also confused by Annies relationship to her father. It seems increasingly like shes playing the submissive docile daughter while simultaneously participating in acts of extreme rebellion such as placing Renard in Kats control and whatever shes doing here presumably. Im confused though because until this point in the comic she has appeared to be genuinely that way with no incentive to pretend... that is viewing her father as this perfect deity that can do no wrong. And now... maybe Im wrong... but she seems to be furthering her own agenda by pretending to submit to him. Anyway she has her old expression back now... the feisty one. So thats good. But Im still confused. ,gunnerkrigg,csj6owb,22,t5_2tv6q

If they ARE in a relationship thats pretty stinkin weird phrasing on Buds part it seems to me that it might have been a subtle hint that W amp J really arent stupidly in love like they appear. Maybe theyre pretending for some reason or another a cover for something else? Their relationship has seemed always rather over the top and storybook till now that could be just the tone of the comic or Tom might have been playing us ever since the scene in the closet. ,gunnerkrigg,d0f8iyo,5,t5_2tv6q
