The next violation will result in a ban.You implied I am censoring you. I have not. Do you intend to cite sources in your future sub or just pressure TIs and open minded nonTIs to believe you? There are nine TI subs. No need to create a tenth.What symptoms are in line with maser and laser attacks? I do not lie. The photograph of my back which I linked to has a medical device in the background. Clearly the photograph was taken at a medical clinic. The photo was taken by the ER nurse. Yesterday I went to the ER twice. I suspect the ER doctor became closed minded when I explained I was being attacked by laser.You do not know whether my symptoms are due to a primary medical condition. It is you who are making TIs look bad by implying only attacks are intrusive thoughts and humming. You did not answer my questions regarding intrusive thoughts.

9335974,0,t3_58d4ze,Part Finally  the above info tells you why  say worth of Tshirts saying Ban Electronic Weapons and MKULTRA Continues and Make the World Safe for Our Children would put us light years ahead of even the best technical survey.     All you have there Mr. Bratcher is a wiggly line on a piece of paper. Do you expect this jury to believe that is a weapon?

9500964,0,t1_d9k6xco,Part      Executive Intelligence Review Special Report ElectromagneticEffect Weapons The Technology and the Strategic Implications editor Michael Liebig EIR News Service Inc. This publication can be found at the UC Berkeley library or can be ordered from EIR News Service Inc.  Pennsylvania Ave. S.E. nd Floor Washington DC  Page  .    Some ABCs of Electromagnetic AntiPersonnel Weapons by Jonathan Tennenbaum    Electromagnetic Pulse    Much more could be said about nonlinear biological effects exploitable by EP weaponssee also other articles in this publication. In this short introduction however we want to move on to another key problem of these weapons how to generate and deliver the destructive action to the target.    This Special Report presents some details on highpower RF and microwave generators an area of highest priority in Soviet research and development. There are two essential types of devices which can be used in EP weapons oscillators using beams of electrons or plasmas and solid state devices.    In electron beam devices like the magnetron common in older radar technology or the more advanced relativistic devices like the gyrotron and free electron laser an electron beam interacts with an electromagnetic field in a resonant cavity oscillating and pumping energy into the field. Other advanced devices use nonlinear interactions between an electron beam and plasma or plasma oscillations directly to generate high output. The advantage of these types of radiation sources is that their output energy power and power density ratio of power to size are theoretically unlimited.    Solid state radar whose development is driven by the needs of military aircraft and missiles is one of the fastest advancing areas of electronic technology today. Although solid state devices do not yet! reach the very high powers attained by electron beam devices miniaturization makes it possible to build today complete highly sophisticated phasedarray radars of suitcasesize with several kilowatts of average output. The principal advantage of this technology is that it permits extremely sophisticated tailoring of pulse shape in space and time in a compact system with direct coupling to highspeed computers. This is exactly what is needed in order to optimally exploit nonlinear biological effects. What is lost in brute power is thus gained in efficiency.    Recent breakthroughs in what is called hightemperature superconductivity open up the perspective that both types of EP generation technologyelectron beam as well as solid stateare going to undergo revolutionary improvements in the years immediately ahead. The impact of this revolution cannot even be estimated at this time but it will certainly mean radical reductions in the size of devices having a given electromagnetic firepower.    Holography and Electromagnetic Warfare    As our discussion of biological effects already indicated electromagnetic antipersonnel weapons depend essentially on tuning the output signal to the target. This goes not only for the frequency and amplitude of the signal but for its entire spacetime shape. Figure  for example is drawn from thermographs of models of the human body irradiated by RF radiation of the same frequency but with field geometries. These and other experiments demonstrate that the areas of maximum absorption of electromagnetic energy inside the body depend on the geometry of the incident wave. By choosing the right geometry the energy can be focused into any desired area such as the brain. A sophisticated EP Weapon must thus be able to project a specific geometry of electromagnetic field onto a distant object not readable text... technical details of waveguides and various antenna types we shall briefly present one of the relevant techniques the principle of the phased array.    A phasedarray antenna consists of an assemblage of many individually controlled emitting or receiving elements placed in a fixed geometrical arrangement. The output field of the array is the sum of the waves emitted by the individual elements. By electronically controlling the relative phases of these individual signals the output field can be given any desired shape and direction limited only by the wavelength used the number of elements and the size of the array. The huge Soviet ABM radar at Krasnoyarsk for example contains an  meter diameter phased array of thousands of elements. The output can consist of a single very narrow beam or hundreds of independently directed beams all depending on the phasing of the elements. This radar can track large numbers of missiles simultaneously without any mechanical motion of the antenna.    The functioning of phasedarray antennae is thus closely related to holography or threedimensional photography. In a hologram photographic plate records interference patterns corresponding to the phase relationships of laser light reflected from the object. When the holographic plate is illuminated by a laser the phase relationships are reconstituted and the viewer has the impression of seeing a three dimensional object. The ensemble of elements of a phasedarray antenna takes the place of the holographic plate but at a much longer wavelength than visible light centimeters and millimeters instead of fractions of a micrometer. When operated in a receiving mode the phased array obtains much more information than an ordinary antenna like the hologram it measures entire electromagnetic field geometries not merely a one dimensional signal.    The holographic principle underlying phasedarray systems points to a potentiality for treating any desired threedimensional electromagnetic field distribution around a target object from a distance correcting for reflections obstacles and other interference. Moreover the field can be transformed and shifted from one location to another in space within a fraction of a second. Thus an ideal EPweapon could attack many individual targets simultaneously or in rapid succession. One or more phased arrays would be used in receiving and transmitting modes to lockon to selected targets and determine the necessary geometry of the attack pulses.  To fully exploit such potentialities the weapon would require for its targetacquisition and beamcontrol systems sophisticated highspeed computers able to perform complex computations of the inversescattering type. Miniaturized systems of this sort are well within the reach of fifth generation computer technology. Hybrid digital analog systems would be simpler smaller and faster still. There is much overlap in requirements between EP weapons and systems developed for strategic defenseSDI.The application of holographic principles to EP weaponry has profound implications for the future shape of warfare. The deployment of such weapons and the defense against them cannot be understood in terms of pointtopoint trajectory concepts associated with conventional firearms and artillery. Actually even in the past competent military doctrine has always emphasized the geometries of fields of fire generated by overall deployment of mobile weapons over a given area as opposed to mere straightline action of an individual weapon. The geometrical aspect becomes much more explicit in the era of EP weaponry in which firepower counts as the ability to control the electromagnetic field geometry on the field of battle through coordinated deployment and operation of mobile phased arrays and related devices.The situation could therefore be summed up as follows in practice both the use of EP weapons and defense against them is a tricky sophisticated business if the antagonists are at comparable levels of technology knowledge and preparation. A surprise attack against an unprepared enemy is simpler and very devastating. In this respect EP weapons are no exception to the general rules of warfare.For concrete weapon applications simpler devices will often suffice and tradeoffs can be made among range output power extent of threat not readable text...An obvious aspect of defense is to detect locate and neutralize weapons before they can be used. Antenna structures of EP weapons are resonant structures which can be detected in various ways. Spetsnaz deployment of EP weapons can be countered by intercepting the weapons or weapons components in transport by appropriate surveillance of the areas around potential targets and by the whole range of countermeasures which can be taken against the spetsnaz groups themselves. ...Of course the EP weapon declares its existence as soon as it is turned on and itself becomes vulnerable to rapid counterattack if readiness and appropriate means are at hand.The famous Faraday cage and other forms of electromagnetic shielding can provide some protection against EP weapons especially if the characteristics of the EP signal are known in advance and countermeasures are devised accordingly. Unfortunately a sophisticated weapon can tailor its pulse to get through nearly any given kind of shielding utilizing nonlinear inversescattering techniques and a process known as selfinduced transparency. A Faraday cage under certain conditions can be transformed into an antenna focusing the signal on the inside and even enhancing the effect for the unfortunate persons inside.In theory biological effects can be offset by creating a controlled electromagnetic environment around the target with the effect of detuning the target relative to the anticipated signal of the attacking EP weapon  a kind of immunization. To realize such potentialities will require a major research effort but one having important spinoffs for biology and medicine.,TargetedEnergyWeapons,d9k72ue,1,t5_3ajmg
