But at the same time Its helpful to have your characteristics right above. I thought this would be helpful but now Im not sure. Long story short sploder is right this is a fantastic character sheet.,UESRPG,csshgm9,1,t5_38t35

5920614,0,t1_cxvps7k,Ok thats good I wasnt looking forward to drawing up a bunch of maps. So is it best to just play fast and loose with the distances and positioning during combat then? I guess I just need to roll up some characters and do some practice battles. Are there any places I can look for examples of encountersstoriesscenarios that players have done? Looking at what other people have done might help me work out the best way to set things up. Thanks for all the hard work youve done on this youre awesome!,UESRPG,cxvq2hq,1,t5_38t35

8947449,0,t3_52rqom,Another thing to remember is that that you can create tension through enviroment and other situations. An example from my game The player find themsleves in an old collapsing dungeon surrounded by a body of water. They dont know where they are and were recently captured. As they attempt to make there escape they find that the dungeon is collapsing around them and is quickly flooding. They now feel pressure and need to make a quick escape even though I have no intention of drowning them or crushing them They are affected mechanically by finding penalties to movement to traverse constantly raising water while fighting whats essentialy a bunch of mooks that are in no way a real threat to them. Another thing is to throw one or two elites at them with several mook bodyguards to help them in the fight. The mooks will help eat up action points while they have to deal with the bigger threqts fighting among them.Hope this helps!,UESRPG,d7ncnl3,1,t5_38t35
