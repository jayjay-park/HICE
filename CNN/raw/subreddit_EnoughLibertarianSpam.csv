Its grueling work and largely unappreciated in our culture. He goes fucking crazy when people say retarded in common speech. Still I just cant get behind language policing these days.The first time I met my one day sisterinlaw she and my brother came to visit me while I was in college. I happened to be baked and jamming out some phat Hendrix riffs on my guitar when they arrived I assume I was jamming exquisitely but I think weve all heard inebriated people who mistakenly think theyre rocking your socks off. We got to talking about the music and I commented that Hendrix is a pimp guitarist. It was a silly thing to say I cringe to this day no doubt but my future sisinlaw jumped all over me for using a misogynistic word that was used to oppress women and... well she went on for a while and I was high as a kite and it was really awkward and horrible.I disliked her for a long time thereafter. I got over it and shes great and she was well intentioned in her tirade. She was also correct in a very annoying and technical sense. Pimps are part of the sex trade which is not a very wholesome thing in the US and can easily be presented as representative of misogyny. Still... if you can look at my use of the word and truly think I meant to imply that Jimi was part of a brutal misogynistic enterprise to objectify women and capitalize off of making a commodity of their sexuality... youre stretching.This thread has gone on way too long. No you shouldnt use the term retarded lightly its just not very nice and the word doesnt come from a very nice place. Its like chan kids pretending that faggot somehow derives its power from something other than the homophobia that originated the term in modern language. If you insist on calling something retarded you have to accept that its kind of an assholeish thing to do and that says something about you the user.

The Holodomor wasnt even mentioned in my high school history classes and I took AP European History.Holodomor occurred in the early s.  What were people saying in the s and s?  I cant say.  Id have to ask my grandparents and most of them are dead.  Was the Holodomor ever major news in the US?  Did any established US politicians mention it  obliquely or directly?  I dont know enough about US domestic media and political history from that time period to really say.Joseph Stalin massacred his own people and that is why Communism is terrible and wrong is definitely a line I learned in US World History though.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,cftdgxa,1,t5_2tzlb

Again I dont necessarily love that but think it would be unwise to privatize them. Beyond that though I think most things can be privatized.ampnbspgtgtHave you ever heard of a philosophy called Voluntaryism? How about anarchocapitalism? Or agorism? Thoughts?gtI have. Im a big fan of Voluntarism and anarchocapitalist principles in general. In fact I run a weekly podcast with a friend of mine on the topics www.jkpod.com  were about  weeks behind at the moment. I straddle the line of these philosophies. In general I think they should outweigh Libertarianism but I think were a long way from a libertarianesque mindset in the US and probably need to get that far before we get a little further. Either way though these words are all very favorable principles to me.ampnbspalso heres a list of some of his other positions credit to ujihadbinladengt thinks its a good idea to stop fluoridating city water thinks its a good idea to challenge the federal government to shut down texas airspace and then a good idea to defy the shutdown thinks that because we do not have the same exact security apparatus everywhere as we do at airports that we should stop protecting our airports so well doesnt just oppose the recent NSA snooping but fully opposes the NSA and thinks it should be completely dismantled thinks that the FDA EPA and other federal regulatory agencies are bogus and should be dismantledAlso someone literally says that theyll vote for him because he uses the Fedora Linux OSYou cant even make this shit up.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,chgt2ft,45,t5_2tzlb

Giving criminals and the mentally fucked up and the inept less access to firearms means less violence and thats something each one of those countries does.  Some of them do it in different ways.  I dont think guns are inherently bad and dont grow their own arms and legs and go out killing people.  Crazy people kill people we just need to look at how other nations prevent crazy people from getting guns and copy that.  Switzerland gives guns to most males in the nation specifically males capable of military service ie. males that are not insane dont have a criminal background are capable of wielding a weapon and are trained in its use.  They furthermore have very strict regulations on who can actually buy weapons and ammo and specifically what weapons they can actually buy.  When you say any swiss person can acquire a gun and some bullets is completely untrue criminals and insane people cannot acquire them legally and the fact that almost every other stable and responsible male in the nation is somehow involved in the military probably is a very strong deterrent to most violent criminal behavior.

While all states require certain vaccinations to attend public school andor child care there are exemptions for religious philosophical and medical reasons. Plus you can also get around this by going to a private school which doesnt require immunizations or resort to home schooling. Therefore all these fucking idiots who did not want to get inoculated should direct their angst against their totalitarian parents.  It were their parents who used violence against them as young children and forced them to get inoculated against their will all while robbing people at gunpoint to put them into public indoctrination camps. I simply cannot imagine the horrors that ancaps have suffered. It were their parents who violated their holy NAP not the state.  Stop bitching about the state and stand up to your totalitarian parents.  What sort of fascist would inoculate their young child against communicable diseases?This is a slippery slope.

1450719,0,t3_2ar6cr, Theyre actually corporate shills whether they realize or not. They spout a narrative that favors the rich and screws the poor. Of course they dont see it that way but thats what it does in practice. Their narrative is overly simplistic. Oh capitalism benefits EVERYONE. Oh working is VOLUNTARY. Its bull. It fails to account for power relationships outside of a literal gun to ones head.  Im for personal liberty but they take it way too far. Wanting to get rid of traffic law consent laws etc. Its just...how can anyone believe this crap!? Some go so far to want to eliminate the state altogether and privatize the police and crap. Its just...GAH! Its too dogmatic. I dislike positions that are strongly grounded in ideology or philosophy. They sound like religions. I prefer perspectives to be flexible and based on evidence but they instead build up this complex philosophical framework I just see as out of touch with the real world. Also very rigid with a black and white view of the world.  Double standards. If businesses do something its fine. If the state does it its EVIL! Its like the reverse of statist communism where the state is good and markets are categorically evil. Often a front for even crazier ideologies. Im not gonna say all libertarians are racists and sexists thats totally unfair because a lot of libertarians especially outside of reddit are comparatively moderate and progressive especially on social issues but we cant deny at least as far as reddit libertarians go and the cliven bundy crowd that theres some serious racism and sexism going on there. Red Pill thinking covert and sometimes even overt racism towardAfrican Americans....strong support of states rights which is essentially a code word for discrimination if we look at history.I wanna point out as I implied above not all libertarians are like that. Many are moderate and reasonable people especially outside of reddit and heck Ive come across many that actually support ideas that I consider to be highly progressive.

1808991,0,t1_ck74ial,gtwhoever best meets the description of legitimate owner according to the rulesprocedures for how to become the legitimate owner of the property.I assume your legitimate ownership is something based on a similar argument to Locke? Mixing labor and whatnot? To which even if he somewhat agreed with Locke Nozicks argument does well to discredit this position. Im sure youre well aware of the Tomato Juice in the Ocean analogy. But I cant really tell as I am not versed in whatever rAnCap holds as legitimate on this front.I believe it fails completely to address my argument though. The argument is that those two functions would still exist within the construct of Private Property as AnCaps put forward. You are both required to accept that their ownership is legitimate even if you disagree and especially if you disagree fundamentally with the idea of private ownership being legitimate and the owner can obligate you within their property to obey commands this is especially true in the situation of renters which you would not normally agree to. The analogy Huemer uses to make his case in  which was linked in the thread and seems to tie in closely to your point seems to actively dodge resources which are more scarce such as land and the resources therein. gtWhen I say that I own a car I am not placing myself above all other agents and it is not at all natural to respond Whats so special about you?I cant see a situation where this argument stand up to scrutiny when you take scarce resources as the standard. You are in fact placing yourself above others when you remove their access to resources which they without your interference could have used.Beyond that he seems to without hesitation concede to my exact argumentgt. I certainly agree with Kevin that none of the philosophical theories of authority can be used to defend property rights any more than they can be used to defend the authority of the state.And his reply of taking norms for granted fails in my opinion because his original argument then falls flat on its face against the legitimate or accepted whichever you would prefer it doesnt matter authority of the state as it is the norm.As an aside to the entire discussion Id like to thank you for your calm and reasoned approach to the discussion.

The use of metaphors or allegories are constantly misinterpreted even when you ask them to look at something from a different perspective they are unable to accomplish the task. And you might as well give up if you want them to see an implied meaning in a sentence. This isnt to say that autistic people are bad but they also are not what we would call Normative to the human population and evolutionary development. Id love to see a survey of what percentage of Libertarians fall on the autistic spectrum.

2488991,0,t1_cmjb8hw,Its more than a subjective how things are done in the field reason too. Its because in fields which deal with such highly chaotic data there are many possible alternative reasons for the result which makes proving a theory wrong incredibly difficult since you would have to prove that the theory being wrong is the only possible explanation. Economics is nonlinear differential calculus with enough chaotic behavior for pretty much anything to happen. Its funny how libertarians are quick to talk about trivial mathematical examples such as trades between two people stuck on an island yet lack any real scientific or mathematical ability. They treat trades as a linear problem and then come to the conclusion that because negotiation between two people in isolation can be fair when the economy is actually an N dimensional problem. That is why theres chaotic behavior and why supercomputers get used to try and make rough predictions. These idiots come in with a moderate level of math and think they know how these highly complicated problems work. Computational modeling doesnt have nice solutions like  body classical physics.

2784136,0,t1_cnkd68z,Yes this is a good criticism. I wish libertarians would stop using slavery analogies and nonaggression principle. It all depends on whether theres consent. Your approach is the social contract theory which is probably the most popular justification for consent. People give consent by simply being present in the govts territory or by accepting benefitsservices from the govt. I think the theory falls flat because you can only have one owner for a piece of property. Does a US citizen own hisher own property? Or does the US govt own it? If the citizen owns hisher own property then the US govt is imposing conditions on the use of someone elses property.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,cnkjojp,2,t5_2tzlb

2939257,0,t1_co21ckh,Context because its my favorite Oscar Wilde writinggt Disobedience in the eyes of anyone who has read history is mans original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made through disobedience and through rebellion. Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty. But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting. It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less. For a town or country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely immoral. Man should not be ready to show that he can live like a badlyfed animal. He should decline to live like that and should either steal or go on the rates which is considered by many to be a form of stealing. As for begging it is safer to beg than to take but it is finer to take than to beg. No a poor man who is ungrateful unthrifty discontented and rebellious is probably a real personality and has much in him. He is at any rate a healthy protest. As for the virtuous poor one can pity them of course but one cannot possibly admire them. They have made private terms with the enemy and sold their birthright for very bad pottage. They must also be extraordinarily stupid. Oscar Wilde  The Soul of Man Under Socialism,EnoughLibertarianSpam,co27fwb,30,t5_2tzlb

3392342,0,t1_cpedbo1,gt Paul is being alarmist but repealing these neoconservative Bushera laws like the NDAA and PATRIOT Act is a good thing.The NDAA is a massive omnibus bill that funds national defense.  There are exactly two lines in it that have been the subject of any serious debate.  It is A never getting repealed or failing to get renewed as is required every two years and B completely off the public radar absent these two lines.The PATRIOT Act is likewise a massive legislative omnibus with a host of useful provisions including border security reform and rules for providing reparations for victims of terrorist attacks.  No we shouldnt just repeal the whole thing carte blanche.  Thats dumb.What we need is logical wellthoughtout linebyline reform.  But we cant get it in a legislature that refuses to compromise on anything or with base voters that believe anything shy of a full repeal is a Both sides do it! betrayal born of conspiracy and deceit.I do agree that the US is perfectly capable of treating terrorists just like they handle every other crook or criminal unless apparently its a banker or a billionaire p.  But one contribution to the alarmism is an impulse among liberals to doubledowninreverse rhetorical tropes used by conservatives.  It would be great if our national discourse could find some kind of moderate ground to tread without the base voters going into apoplexy.  But  and this is the true rub of it all  alarmism works.  It gets hard liners out to vote.  It scares off moderates of all stripes and depresses voter turnout among the notcrazy.So were going to keep seeing alarmism as a political tool until theres some kind of moderate backlash.

3430523,0,t1_cpjaqon,Different people will give different answers. I for one am an Anarchist so my own view is that the very notion of trying to establish communism through a State is destined to fail and that a centrallyplanned economy is really just a form of Statecapitalism rather than Socialism. From the Anarchist view this specific error begun with Lenin and the Bolsheviks failure to truly destroy the Tsarist government structure Stalin just continued what Lenin set in motion.A Trotskyist would reply that it failed because the revolution failed to spread through out the world and by becoming isolated it degenerated and became incapable of paving the way to communism. Trotskyists usually put the blame for letting that happen on Stalin. A MarxistHumanist or leftcommunist would argue that it failed because the revolutionaires failed to establish a thing they refer to as directly social labor as a reality and hence turned into a Statecapitalist economy.

No GG was not somehow caused by Tumblr. It was caused by allegations that certain Indie devs had slept their way onto popular websites and morphed from an isolated scandal to an amalgamated defense of gaming culture and communities thanks to the batshit insane organized backlash against those allegations. Seriously  a few peoples articles were called into question and suddenly GAMERS ARE DEEEAAAD. What the Christ. I mention Tumblr as a preexisting illustration of the law of triviality. Roundabout  there was some genuinely useful discussion of AAA development squeezing out niches like yknow half the population. Conversations about feminism and gaming called to mind boobcentric character design for the few females in even large casts. Of late though theres calls for censorious boycotts accusations about rape culture in a medium that barely even references consensual sex and an explosion of sexist terminology like mansplaining  and Tumblr is a locus of this cowpat Katamari. In short there was a souring of the tone and range of this debate. GG did not cause this shift. GG did not exist when this change took place. And while I specified a subset of SJWs which basic reading comprehension would tell you didnt imply anything about the whole group the term certainly could be used as a pejorative because it neatly encompasses a noisy and oblivious culture of internet kvetching without accidentally referencing many worthwhile complaints or complainers. It is a group whose war is against e.g. scholarly English and consists largely of sweeping hyperbole on dramahappy websites. It is distinct from the commendable feminist and civilrights movements which carry on pursuing things like workplace equality without getting mired in Twitter shouting matches about flavor text in roleplaying games. ,EnoughLibertarianSpam,cq3jx0i,0,t5_2tzlb

3723822,0,t1_cqgiyll,gtOK so do you think that there has been a significant negative impact on inclusivity caused by the Gamergate Drama Hurricaneplease note this includes both sides?Of course.gtHow would you hypothetically have changed the situation knowing what you do now to prevent or at least significantly dampen the effect?I dont think Id be able to on a personal level.If I somehow had omnipotent control over the situation? Theres several things that wouldve made gamergate not be the shitstorm it was. If corrupt individuals either lost their jobs or agreed to reform and corrupt outlets decided an internal reform was needed rather than attacking their own reader base gamergate wouldve been gone in about two weeks time. They were given a choice  reform their practices or go to war against gamers and they chose war. Choosing reform first wouldve made gamergate nonexistent. If corrupt women in the industry specifically didnt scream MISOGYNY over and over when their corruption was exposed shit like the Law and Order SVU gamergate episode wouldve never happened. The mid s gamer scare wouldntve been resurrected. They decided to brand an entire diverse subculture of people as sexists rather than own up to their own wrongdoing and then that entire subculture revolted on them. If they owned their shit it wouldntve happened.Really the actual people concerned with ethical conduct did nothing wrong. When developers journalists and outlets reacted with extreme hostility and hate to the accusations of corruption thats what turned everything into a shitshow.gtIf you dont believe that there has been a significant negative impact on inclusivity caused by the gamergate drama hurricane how many people have to leave the industry to quantify that for you?Again that depends on whether or not you value ethics over inclusivity.Lets say just hypothetically every single woman in games media and development was corrupt. This is obviously not true in real life of course. But lets say the industry just got unlucky and all of the corrupt women are right here in gaming while the noncorrupt women arent in the industry at the moment.Would shitcanning all of those women hurt inclusivity? of course. Would it improve ethics? Yes.Now the real world isnt that black and white. If the majority of unethical people who leave the industry are of a minority then thats what needs to happen. And if the majority of unethical people are white guys they need to go too. The demographics dont matter only their behaviour. Ethics gt inclusivity every time.Now when you say people who have left the industry I assume youre not referring to unethical people who have lost their jobs or bailed but perfectly innocent people who have become afraid of the industry and are either leaving or refusing to join.And while that narrative is present in antigg Look GAMERGATE IS SCARING WOMEN AWAY FROM GAMING theres no actual evidence thats happened. More and more developers are coming out in support of ethical reform because GG has shown them the consumer is on their side. Indie devs in particular have been inspired by GGs stance against unethical conduct.GG scaring women out of the industry is a major antigg talking point. But theres been no evidence its happened and I honestly dont think it has.Meanwhile I DO know of a few female indie devs not many at all admittedly who support GG and have been harassed by antiGG quite a bit. Youll never get a job in indie development now your career is over for not siding with us Youre not a real woman youve clearly got internalized misogyny for supporting GG etc. None of them have left indie development but theyve been shaken up and fear for their careers.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,cqgqpes,1,t5_2tzlb

4028846,0,t1_cremoki,gt but Id like to hear some of the examples where economically speaking an initiation of force upon a nonviolent criminal is the moral thing to do.One of the problems with the NAP is that it has no provision against fraud.Obviously thats a bad thing.  Libertarians understand that its a bad thing because they assume that the free market will be made up of honest actors and the legalization of fraud undermines their case.So one solution is to define fraud as a form of aggression.  Even though these are two entirely unrelated concepts.  There is no standard definition of aggression that even allows for fraud.The other problem is even if you assume that fraud is covered under the NAP the NAP doesnt have any mechanism for addressing it.  If someone physically attacks you then you can physically attack them back.  That makes sense.  But if someone commits fraud on you then whats the remedy?  Are you allowed to commit fraud on them?  That doesnt make sense.Instead when libertarians say fraud violates the NAP what they really mean is Were just going to handwave this issue away and pretend it never happens.  Its basically a no true scotsman.  Instead of explaining how the NAP deals with fraud theyre simply going to pretend that no one will attempt it in the first place.But in the real world fraudsters deserve to be locked up.  And deep down libertarians agree with that.  They just dont know how they can agree without contradicting the entire NAP.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,crfiolv,3,t5_2tzlb

The psychopaths need inequality psychologically to the same degree that the nonpsychopaths need equality. The reasons why the psychopathic minority rule despite their tiny population size is firstly because most nonpsychopaths do not want to take responsibility for their lives and prefer to delegate their sovereignty to psychopaths as the psychopaths have trained them to do. The second reason is that the nonpsychopaths generally refuse to acknowledge the psychopaths existence or at least their existence in government. The nonpsychopaths are desperate to believe that government is good because if government was not good then that would mean that the nonpsychopaths would have to become selfresponsible and start looking after themselves.Snapshots This post LinkI am a bot.

You believe in the presumption of innocence but believe that judicial discretion trumps thhis principle. You offer no examples of this being the case Your examples include judges using proven criminal behavior in sentencing judges using suspected behavior in bond setting and judges using positive behavior to mitigate sentencing none of your examples support your claim. You consistently advoctate using unproven criminal allegations to support harsh sentences again for laws you dont even support. You have also accused me of strawmanning you. This from the man who started the thread by claiming ancaps dont care that Ulbricht may have conspired to kill people despite that not being remotely close to the point. You have yet to support a single claim you have made about your opponents positions yet are happy to laugh as if you are in the right.

OK.gtbecause he demonstrated himself repeatedly to be violent and aggressive against those who crossed him.Which is precisely the crime which has not been proven. He was not charged with those crimes not convicted of those crimes. So how can they be used against him? If he had been convicted of conspiracy to commit murder etc. then I would not have a problem with using those crimes to enhance his sentence.gtIm not sure what the hell this even means.All your examples of jusges using discretion in sentencing involve either positives crimes for which the accused has been convicted or discretion in areas other than sentencing.gtSee above for why all of this is a gross misrepresentation of how I feel.I am not saying the prosecution did not present the accusations I am saying he was never convicted of the crimes which the prosecution brought up. Thus he is due presumption of innocence.Character matters I suppose but again you have to prove a crime occurred in order to use it against someone.I dont consider Ulbricht a hero just a victim.gtThats a pretty aggressiveClearly you do not know what the word aggressive means.

4147922,0,t1_crszm6g,As a general role of political discourse if you ever try to make the case that slavery wasnt as bad as people make it out to be and the prax it out to slaves were property like farm equipment and therefor slavers would treat them as kindly as a farmer today treats his tractor then you lose any credibility when you try to claim that taxes are slavery or taxes are force or taxes are rape.A slave was paid compensated for their labor with just enough to resources to keep them alive. They didnt get a wage. They had no right to determine their own destiny in any way. They were property of the plantation owner.If you try to make the case that slavery wasnt that bad then you are basically saying that Soviet style Communism isnt that bad. You get enough to survive and have no control over the course of your own life. You are property of the state because you were born on land that the state administers and protects. And you are lucky that the state gives you what you they do and you should expect or ask for anything more than the basic necessities. And you should just deal it with because your situation is just a product of the time and location in which you were born.Living in the US today the state takes something like  of what you make. They benevolently allow you to keep . And you can choose what kind of labor your do and what region you live in and what hours you work. You get a vacation and weekends off. A slave should be so lucky.Shit you can even leave the plantation you were born and move to another plantation... if you can prove your worth to the plantation you wish to move to...Slaves never had any kind of choices like that.Why arent you happy with just being one of the freest slaves that the world has ever known?

5006185,0,t1_cupdrol,This makes me thinkof JK Galbraiths critique of neoclassical economics.  He basically coined the term conventional wisdom which is pretty much the same issue against people who use common sense to promote ideologies today.gtGalbraith is a critic of the neoclassical conventional wisdom a set of ideas that is familiar to all widely accepted but no longer relevant. His evolutionary approach explores changing conditions and examines the need to change our ideas to fit new situations. In a statement similar to that made by Veblen Galbraith said Ideas are inherently conservative. They yield not to the attack of other ideas but to the massive onslaughts of circumstances with which they cannot contend. He is quick to point out that his attack is on the conventional wisdom not on those who originally expounded the ideasgtThe reader will soon discover that I think very little of certain of the central ideas of economics. But I do think a great deal of the men who originated these ideas. The shortcomings of economics are not original error but uncorrected obsolescence. The obsolescence has occurred because what is convenient has become sacrosanct.gtAnd how is it that these obsolete neoclassical ideas have been able to survive? Galbraith answers as follows  gtThe neoclassical system owes much to tradition  it is not implausible as a description of a society that once existed....gtAdditionally it is the available doctrine. Students arrive something must be taught the neoclassical model exists. It has yet another strength. It lends itself to endless theoretical refinement. With increasing complexity goes an impression of increasing precision and accuracy. And with resolved perplexity goes an impression of understanding.Within Galbraiths overall theory of modern capitalism one can find several specific theories that challenge orthodox economics. Two theories of particular importance are his notion of the dependence effect and his theory of the behavior of the firm.  ,EnoughLibertarianSpam,cupfmk3,6,t5_2tzlb

6073024,0,t1_cye4v43,gt Maybe medieval Ireland or whatever the libertarian talking point was.No.  Ancapism has never been tried by any society anywhere ever. Theyll sometimes try to give an ancient Ireland example but thats because they dont understand Brehon Law and the religious caste and kinship systems that operated under it. The law required kin to blood feud over violations. Once in a great while they try to go earlier. Even then they never bother to read the stories of the time. Read the Tin B Cailnge and youll get a sense of how this was nothing like ancapism at all.Put simply there was a period of time in Ireland full of Kings with no courts and no police where one could simply pay a fine for murder.  But whenif the fine wasnt paid instead of police or courts there were blood feuds among familiesclans.  But there were kings and priests and different castes and clans and hierarchies and common land and blood feuds and stuff.  There were no child markets or NAP or forced privatization or any of that shit.And just because there wasnt quite one overarching state even though there was an overarching High King sometimes that doesnt mean there werent  little microstates operating as clans.  Clans would simply kidnap people they felt were acting incorrectly and demand money.  If they didnt get their money they might kill them they might try to force them into service.  Whatever.Meanwhile some combination of clans would award one clan leader usually the most powerful one but sometimes a compromise candidate with the title of High King.  The High King would be the ultimate arbiter.  You could think of it like states and the federal government.  Each clan has control over its little area so maybe theres  of them and the High King claimed broad control over all of it but not in most regular local matters more for arbitrating disputes between local leaders and rallying several clans at once if needed or if there was an outside threat.Whatever was going on there it was certainly not anarchy.  Not any more than Native American chiefdoms were anarchy.  There was law and enforcement and hierarchy and all the trimmings.  Like I said most of that went to the clans.  Now the clans all were beneath the High King but each clan was also ruled by a king and there would be about  of them or so on the island of  people at any given time.Each king ruled directly only within the bounds of his own petty kingdom and was responsible for ensuring good government by exercising fr flaithemon rulers truth. His responsibilities included convening its enach popular assembly collecting taxes building public works external relations defence emergency legislation law enforcement and promulgating legal judgment.The lands in a petty kingdom were held allodially by various fine agnatic kingroups of freemen. The king occupied the apex of a pyramid of clientship within the petty kingdom. This pyramid progressed from the unfree population at its base up to the heads of noble fine held in immediate clientship by the king. Thus the king was drawn from the dominant fine within the cenl a wider kingroup encompassing the noble fine of the petty kingdom.So I mean there was a basic land hierarchy and tax system here too.I mean they had taxes!But somehow ancaps still point to ancientmedieval Ireland as the historical example of their nonsense working...when clearly it wasnt.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,cyfnsbm,6,t5_2tzlb

6209219,0,t1_cyvendm,The point being is thats actually not central planning. Thats planning done  even if it is far reaching by people with a vested interest and stake in those firms. Making decisions with their own property. The point being when you get the government planning the economy referred to as central planning because lets face it government planning is far more centralized than firm planningits done usually without regard not only for the workers of those firms but without regard to the output of those firms and the effect on the rest of society. Take the Semele of the Cuban gvernment and toothbrush production. The government tells all firms that they allow to exist how many toothbrushes are allowed to be produced. When that happens theres a history of the govt far understating how many they needed to produce and then having a black market for things as simple as toothbrushes develop. So to answer your question no you misunderstand what central planning is and so no libertarians are opposed to central planning both in principle and because its the govt doing it mainly because the govt doesnt have the ability to process the vast amount of information needed for production of adequate amounts of goods in every sector wheres private firms that work in their sector pay more attention to what they are doing because they put their own money into it and so care about it.

They think its a great idea because its supposedly cheaper or more efficient but if it is actually cheaper or more efficient it only comes directly out of the pockets of the drivers.  The drivers are getting legitimately screwed because theyre contractors which means Uber is shielded from pretty much all liabilities and Uber can dictate the rates that Uber drivers get paid and the drivers cant do anything about it.  Uber also gets paid regardless of how many Uber drivers there are so they can contract a ton of people.  Then you end up with situations where people make essentially zero dollars a night as a contracted Uber driver because theres no regulation keeping the supply down.  Eventually if it goes on long enough Uber drivers will unionize or demand that Uber start actually compensating them fairly.

Businesses have been marketing differently to boys and girls for as long as parents have been encouraging them to act their gender. Whether or not the big bad capitalist boss intentionally wants the gays to stay unmarried is not really that important. Parents play such a larger role in what kids think and want to buy than what is actually on the shelf.gtIts because they thought boys would get confused if the toy lines werent marketed towards boys exclusively.This is true but it is not the whole story. There is a strong desire among kids to identify with their assigned gender because parents work hard to reinforce that. Additionally gender is one of the few identities that young children implicitly understand so I personally think it makes sense that they want to build that identity. Why do you think so many boys say their favorite color is blue and girls say its pink? Either they chose to act more masculinefeminine or their parentssociety encouraged them to act their gender. I dont think they looked at the toy aisle and made that decision gt.ltIt isnt a toy companys fault that they have to market to boys that are afraid of being seen as girly or girls that dont want to be an ugly boy.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,czasa24,2,t5_2tzlb

In reality you were... clingy and needyThats kinda foreign to me. Now youre talking about a genuinely nice person that is married. Thats completely divorced from the idea of nice guy neckbeard who cant get a date. No one is going to hear a story about a guy who got hurt by a spouse and pull out the nice guy memes. It wouldnt even make sense. Instead youre referring to your personal traumatic history with your family.You spend a lot of your post talking about your history. I just think youre taking stuff about nice guys personally when no one is actually talking about you or people in your situation. They are not talking about guys that have been mistreated in relationships. Thats not what the meme is about. Its about guys who are needy and feel entitled to sex and get whiny whenever the object of their affections isnt interested.gtyou dont see men proposing to women in prisonThats a decent point because I suspect it might be true but that would just suggest to me that crazy minorities of men and women are different kinds of crazy. I still dont have any interest at all in pursuing women who would be into serial killers and I dont see any reason to be more upset about their existence than about the existence of male assholes. Its just irrelevant. gtyou dont see men throwing themselves at rock star womenCome on theres stupid amounts of drooling over female celebrities of every stripe. I remember people in junior high seriously fantasizing about dating Britney Spears. I dont know what you were going for this point.gtYou dont rarely see men posting how they can be abused in bedHooo boy. You are really making it obvious that this whole thing is confirmation bias and you just need to take a step back and focus on why youre feeling the way you do because it isnt because reality justifies it. Femdom is one of the largest fetishes out there and youre just pretending it doesnt exist at all. It would be a mistake to take any one source as a representative sample of the whole of humanity. Anecdotes are bullshit.gtanyway yes I have a bias but i think you are not seeing reality either. You dont see books written about women mistreating men that sell millions of copies do you? I mean the middle aged women going to twilight movies? You think its a small minority of women who have that issue?Let me try to give you another way to view all of this. When a woman says she wants something sexual she risks being labeled a slut.  Thats clearly fantasydeflating and men face no similar stigma. A man requesting what she actually wants in the first place can give a pretense for doing the same things but not being slutty by initiating it. Its a weird double standard but it could easily be a result of cultural expectations rather than anything biologically inherent. It provides a means for shielding yourself from social expectations of what women should want or feel about sex especially when it comes to pushing the boundaries of previous sexual experiences. A woman cant be interested in anything kinky that would be slutty! But oh sure men are allowed to be slutty so if its a man driving everything and woman just goes along with it thats cool. See how that can be appealing and how its just a way to dodge cultural double standards?Do you understand the difference between a rape fantasy and actually being raped? Because youre an inch from saying that women actually want to be abused and thats just not true. Among other things domination fantasies allow sexuality to be experienced and explored without the stigma of admitting you want to do so. Men are generally free from any such cultural stigma. Men are expected to want sex and even kinky sex. Women are generally required not to. Its bullshit but its the recent cultural norms.Rewrite  Shades of Grey to be exactly the same except the woman initiates every sexual encounter and makes all the requests. A lot of women dont feel comfortable selfinserting in that scenario because it doesnt fit their selfimage of not a slut.TLDR You have serious issues youre still working through and Im sorry all thats happened to you.

6587360,0,t1_czxzec2,Again youre not reading my comments fairly.  I didnt say I think welfare is great I simply said it keeps millions out of poverty each year which is true.  Further I never said I supported Obama nor in fact did I.  This is again a prime example of creating a target for yourself to attack not a reflection of anything Ive said here.Never the less youve made your choice on some of these philosophical questions.  Youve decided that the freedom of a bigot is more important than the freedom of a minority proving my earlier point that one can get away with the most vile injustices if theyll only attached the word liberty to it.Im not sure how you gauge that you havent bought into the whole libertarian thing  you make precisely the same arguments in approximately the same manner that they do.  So you have to ask yourself did you happen to come to these thoughts as a result of your own unique process or did you simply drink the kool aid?You play the part so well.  Deflect and start attacking government?  Check.  Accuse others of positions they dont support?  Check.  Accuse others of supporting Obama?  Check.  Historical inaccuracy  Difference is I have very rarely seen people starve in an economy or society geared towards a capitalist structure.?  Check.  Repeated use of the word freedom like its some kind of prayer cloth that makes everything better?  Check.The main difference between you and I is I perform analysis you engage in advocacy.  Im not out here telling you how the world should work as you are Im simply describing it as it is.

6995108,0,t1_d197r0h,That is completely false. Collectivism is not pooling resources together. The best way to describe what collectivism is is to define its opposite individualism. Individualism is NOT the idea that you as an individual can take care of yourself and that you dont need groups ever. Individualism is the idea that an individual possesses inalienable rights such as the right to life. Individualism champions the moral worth of the individual over the collective. Collectivism on the other hand is the idea that groups possess certain rights over the individual. Collectivism is often wrongly defined as simply working in a group but thats not what individualism is against. Collectivism is essentially mob rule. A collectivist thinks that a group should have more power over any individual within the group. Collectivists do not care for individual rights. They see an individual as a means to an ends they see an individual as a tool that can be exploited for the good of the group. It is the governing idea behind totalitarianism as well as tribalism. ,EnoughLibertarianSpam,d198lg7,-38,t5_2tzlb

7577125,0,t1_d2uieak,gt Price and value are not the same thing. This is why in Economists they talk about consumer and producer surplus because there is a difference between what the value of a particular unit of good is and the exchange that happens on the market.gt This is why I said this entire thing was not a market issue.gt Consumers base their willingness to pay on what utility they draw from the good. Producers base their willingness to take that is a minimum theyre willing to accept in trade in order to compel them to sell based on production costs which does consider LTV.gt Worth noting the example were working with factors out the minimum a seller is willing to take in the discussion by giving him a perfect advantage over the buyer. Were dealing with valuation from the consumer prospective only because weve necessarily factored out the other half of the story.gt The price of a good becomes some amalgamation of the idea above. The price will be some integer between the sellers minimum and buyers maximum price if a unit will be sold at all.Marx agrees here for the most part. He says that price is the money name of the value of a commodity e.g. the concretized socially necessary labor time embodied in it and can go above and below it in individual trades but will usually fluctuate around it. gt But you should already see how price isnt what were talking about here. Price is a function of value... So when were talking about value we have to talk about something separate of price or were being circular. Hence again were not talking about markets. What you pay for a good is a different idea from how you value a good.Socially necessary labor time in capitalist system  value gt price is a function of  derived from value. Im not being circular here. When you say what you pay for a good is different than how you value a good yeah thats true. But like I said price can stray from value SNLT. If you average the market transactions wherein people pay above or below the real value of the item youll likely get close to the value under Marx framework. gt My experience with Marx is about hour lecture in a Econ writing class so I will have to trust you that he believes this. However what youre claiming he is saying is definitely wrong and he is still semirelevant in discussion so this leads me to believe youre misattributing him in some capacity.gt My willingness to pay is the price of the good? Even theoretical monopolies dont have that kind of power. What youre describing here is perfect information where a seller knows the absolute maximum I am willing to bid for a good and prices it accordingly. Ive yet to meet the world where this actually happens.Sorry I wasnt clear there. What I meant was that the actual dollar amount it is sold at is the price  what Marx would call the exchange value. Exchange value is what it goes for on the market and use value is the subjective utility you get from it what you call value. gt Marginal utility is a theory of value. Unless we are willing to accept that prices are set completely arbitrarily we have to have some sort of theory that explains value before we even begin to talk about prices...And thats where LTV comes in. gt This is very selfdefeating. Marx added the whole socially necessary line to labor value for a reason. It is because people differ on what necessary amount of food clothing shelter etc. ismeans. Even in Marxs world prices really cannot be some definable objective value.Im pretty sure he added socially necessary because a. before that was added any amount of labor could be seen as creating value obviously not true a guy pushing a rock back and forth  times and then trying to sell it because labor has been embodied in it would be crazy and because under the laws of capitalism any socially unnecessary labor time would mean a disadvantage in the market that would drive that person out of business. Like I mentioned before  and Im getting the feeling more and more that this is the case  Marx labor theory of value only pertains under capitalist social relations and well functioning markets. Youre looking at this individualistically whereas Marx looks at it systemically under the theses of classical liberal economics. First take those theses seriously and then look at relations in a capitalist system on a macro level and they fit perfectly. Im going to post to rsocialism to see if they can explain to me if Im wrong here or if Im explaining poorly  dw they wont brigade here ,EnoughLibertarianSpam,d33hdyk,1,t5_2tzlb

It was racists and religious fanatics in the past and today its progressivism.If you start pushing social progress through the federal government its not hard to imagine someone like Trump getting into power and pushing everything back where it was. Its a boundary that we dont need to cross.Social change is something that exists within the populous. People who were thirsty for rapid changes crossed a boundary and changed the nature of our government. I simply want to close the floodgates before the water turns murky again.

8781056,0,t1_d738muf,There is absolutely nothing stupid about that rule and if anything the requirement should really be .The vast majority of voters make up their minds early on and the number of undecideds dwindles exponentially as election day approaches.  The main purpose of the debates is to rally your supporters to actually show up to vote.  If you cant achieve  the month before the election then have no shot of rallying enough support to actually win on election day.Libertarians live in this delusion that all Gary Johnson has to do is show up on stage and talk for a few minutes and then everyone will start supporting him.

8811783,0,t1_d76zqdk,gt But that excludes defense I made that clear by saying initiating force.gtThis is the defense of childs right to its body therefore its not aggressionStarving a child does not require any aggression against their body and therefore does not violate their right to their body.  They starve just like a homeless person would  due to inaction.  Their right to live only guarantees them the right to find or purchase food on their own property or on property they are allowed to enter by a property owner.  There is no right to defense in this case because there was never any initiation of force to begin with. gtCourts would gladly judge if your reply to someones aggression was proportional. You cant kill someone because he lied to you about something.But the NAP makes no room for proportion or difference between acts of aggression.  There is simply aggression as the line for what morality is.  And all aggression justifies retaliatory homicide.  As in the case of home invasion of attempted murder.  Going to court is unnecessary when I can punish someone myself with my own firearms. Furthermore bringing someone before a trial would require initiating force to detain someone so would defeat the whole purpose of having courts decide if one can or cannot use force. This is in addition to the child having no independent income could be used to pay for private law enforcement as I said before.  No money means no court plays ball even if they could.  Judges do not work for free.gtWhat problem do you have with understanding that lying and fraud can harm someones body or property.It simply doesnt.  Or at least it is not initiatory force by any stretch of the imagination.  If I tell people that your business has terrible products this hurts your business and maybe your feelings.  But it is not initiating force against you.  If it did every competitive business would be violating the NAP.  Every person with an opinion about another would similarly guilty of criminal actions. In libertarian philosophy there is no necessity to provide perfect information to customers.  For instance selling you a lemon at a car dealership does not initiate force against you.  I do not force you into the car or steal your money.  We make an exchange  of our own free will. It is your responsibility to know about cars.  Neither is me selling you a sandwich at my restaurant that you later decided you didnt like.  I am not obligated to provide a refund after the fact..  Making me do so would require initiating force which is immoral according to NAP.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,d7721s3,1,t5_2tzlb

Society needs a state because that it how we manage human capability to enforce will. Sorry but as long as humans are willing and able to use force it is paramount that that potential use of force is well managed in the interest of the collective hence the need for a state. Then in order to ensure a the most horizontal power structure possible everyone has to have the minimum capability necessary to participate in that state. So we need as democratic a system as possible with which to interact with and through that state. Not to mention that states can be made to have far better redistributive mechanisms than unregulated stateless markets. The state is absolutely necessary for the maximization of prosperity. But I think that a state is also a reflection of its expressed political will. In The U.S. political will is skewed towards conservatism by giving conservative states an undue share of our total political will.

10945525,0,t1_de8kdbd,gt Indeed the  revisions made matters worse authorizing the federal government to reject any electoral changes in covered jurisdictions whenever they are believed to diminish the ability of minority citizens  to elect their preferred candidate of choice  which has been taken to mean the need to gerrymander to preserve majorityminority districts. This is an absurd claim on face because it assumes that all districts used to be fairly drawn until the VRA came along and invented gerrymandering to make things.  When the reality is that gerrymandering has always existed minorities have always gotten screwed over and the VRA was one of their few options for recourse to challenge unfair districts.Which is the entire point of the lawsuit.  CATO is against the idea that minorities should have representatives who actually represent them.gt So they had evidence that a law granting the government extraordinary powers over states rights was no longer needed and they worked to remove it.Except that the VRA already had a provision for districts where coverage was no longer needed  The only problem is that it only applies to states that havent been found guilty in a court of law of trying to disenfranchise minorities from in the past  years.  So explain to me again why it was no longer needed?gt Also I personally have never understood the hate for voter ID laws.Libertarians are opposed to poll taxes...  unless theyre the poll taxes that hurt minorities and dont affect me in any way in which case theyre totally legit.gt How else do you prevent voter fraud?You mean the voter fraud we have no evidence is actually occurring despite the fact that it would leave a massive paper trail if it actually happened and which voter IDs would do absolutely nothing to prevent?Voter fraud is just the modern form of reefer madness.  Its a fictional problem that exists purely to punish innocent people of color.  But if we dont outlaw the reefer how else will we prevent rape and murder and cannibalism and the total destruction of modern society?gt Why fight against needing an ID to vote instead of fighting to give everyone equal access to getting IDs? Because by sheer coincidence the same lawmakers who vote to create voter ID laws will also vote to shut down DMVs in minority districts at the same time thus making it harder for minorities to gain an ID rather than easier.But Im sure that there are completely legitimate reasons for doing so other than preventing black people from being able to vote.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,de8yc92,6,t5_2tzlb

10947917,0,t1_de95x0v,First of all the platform of the Libertarian Party isnt the defining document for all of Libertarianism. Second of all even in the context of the platform you are either willfully misrepresenting what their statements mean in context or simply have no idea what youre talking about. The party platform uses terms in Libertarian senses and you would have to be familiar with Libertarian thought and literature to know what they mean in their use of language. Either you are not so familiar or are being willingly disingenuous.gt The constitutional rights of the criminally accused including due process a speedy trial legal counsel trial by jury and the legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty must be preserved.The constitutional rights of the criminally accused apply to action by the government regarding someone who has been accused of a crime. The Libertarian Party isnt against the Castle Doctrine.gt Meaning you may have firearms and other weapons for self defense and defense of your property but you may not use them except in defense of aggression.And how do Libertarians define aggression? Ill give you a hint  aggression includes violations of property rights. gt Meaning again that you can not just shoot a man for being on your property.No that statement is regarding things like pollution. Once someone has violated your property rights the Libertarian perspective is that they are the aggressor and you are justified in defending yourself.If your interpretation of the platform were correct it would imply that the Libertarian Party is opposed to the Castle Doctrine which is patently absurd.,EnoughLibertarianSpam,de977ru,3,t5_2tzlb

11058702,0,t3_5xwdm2,Another parallel Id draw to today is the use of fear of social upheaval and retributive violence employed in the South to discourage even the consideration of a postslavery society. It wasnt purely suasion in economic termssocial and economic anxieties that abolitionism inspired in the white lower class were inextricably tied. Haiti and the rebellions led by Gabriel Prosser and Nat Turner were key to stoking this sort of fear. This propaganda tactic only transformed in the latenineteenth and twentieth centuries and a tempered form of it still permeates the conservative social attitudes that have allowed for tough on crime politics and resulting mass incarceration as one example. Regional politics is still shaped by the realignment of the midtwentieth century and the Atwater strategy which was essentially a reaffirmation of this connection between fiscal and social conservatism.
