10348196,0,t1_dcgxk6q,There was a cool analysis recently I think on summonerschool about champs that do well in low elo vs high elo and Reksai and Ivern were some of the biggest differences. Generally early pressure seemed to do better in high elos but I think that has as much to do w strength of strategy as strength of champ. Higher elo players are usually the ones who can impact the game more consistently and if you consistently impact the game in a positive way then having that impact early is generally a big advantage for your team.,Jungle_Mains,dch10es,1,t5_3ii1w

11796992,0,t1_dgx58ef,Sure thing glad to be of any help! The first step to improvement is identifying the mistakes you make. Ask yourself these questions. Have you ever tried tracking the enemy junglers CS count?. Do you ever invade after the first clear?. Do you generally know where the enemy jungler is and include that in your decisionmaking?. Do you counterjungle safely?Let me explain what I mean with each question and what it means to do those things.. Tracking CS This takes a little practice but isnt that hard at least in the early game. You see the jungler for the first time. Whats his CS? You can derive the camps he has done.Buffs scuttle gromp  wolves  raptors  krugs . Say he has  farm and appears top. He likely did Buff  wolves  buff  scuttle or gromp . You cleared reverse and are now at botside. His raptors and Krugs are up if you cant gank take the camps. You also know his wolves will respawn at the same time as yours. You can now predict his future movement.. Invading Does the enemy jungler play something like Amumu or other tanks Rengar Hecarim ... basically any jungler with a slow clear or a jungler who often does a full clear or someone who will be low hp? Do you have kill potential at level ? Do buff wolves buff maybe scuttle walk to his red. Is he there doing red? Smite it away kill him. Is he not there? Walk to Krugs. Kill him or take them. Only take the big scuttle then run away. The camp wont completely disappear he has to clear it for less gold and also super little exp bc they dont give much on the first clear. If you killed him you are a mile ahead of the other jungler. Pressure him farm his jungle kill him.. You know because of  and mini map info which camps are up and when they will respawn. You know which way the jungler will go after a gank or recall because he wants to take his farm. Is all his topside jgl gone? He is botside. Ping them to be careful. Honestly use pings! Laners will ward or go back a little. You know the enemy jungler will gank bot because they are pushing in the enemy botlane has CC to set up a gank? Move botside too ward the area hover the area to countergank. You know he will farm his top jungle? Do dragon. . Counterjungling. Are you ahead and kill him? You can probably safely invade the jungler again and again. Are you behind? Stay back and farm up. Are your side lanes and midlane getting pressured by their laner? Then the enemy laner will be able to react to your invade while your laners will have to clear waves. Be safe. Do you play a jungler with a low cooldown jump? Dont worry about laners too much you can always escape Kindred Nidalee are good examples and the only junglers I play btw. Also again You see the enemy jungler somewhere? Use that information to gank somewhere else countergank take his camps.In essence Use all the information the game gives you to your advantage. The information is there you need to work to see it to understand it to use it. Theres more to it than I explained in this post. Efficient warding spots denying the enemy information about you by walking outside of the wardvision radius. Use your pings to communicate your information with your laners. Thats stuff about jungling in general. Remember you wanna win. Go for turrets whenever you can. Trade pressure for pressure somewhere else not just with fighting back. Work towards the nexus.Edit To put things into perspective I do like half of these things half the time and only to a half extent. And thats Plat  already. Work on these things one by one. Youll see fast improvement if you know what you have to improve. ,Jungle_Mains,dgx89kk,6,t5_3ii1w
