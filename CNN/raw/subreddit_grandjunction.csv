6849056,0,t1_d0rqmu8,Page  details the test procedure and mentions near Grand Junction but gives no other hints. A GJ Sentinel reporter wrote about the incident decades after the fact and stated it was in Glade Park. I cant find a Sentinel archive to confirm.,grandjunction,d0snbrv,1,t5_2sfod
11074288,0,t1_den88vu,Yes! The problem with the milltailings is that when they decay they emit radon. The house we bought when we moved here had to have several areas of the foundation jackhammered out to meet the EPAs standards for habitability and we had to have radon remediation done before we could even get a loan. Mill tailings are supposed to be listed on property disclosures but Colorado real estate agents have found legal loopholes if the home was previously rented or has sat vacant for a few months they can say they have no knowledge of the issue. They also have no legal obligation whatsoever to disclose milltailings and radon issues to renters either!Even if you dismiss everything I say outright dont take my word for it call Mike Cosby at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment  . They do gamma radiation surveys for free here because its so commonplace. ,grandjunction,den9e2o,3,t5_2sfod
