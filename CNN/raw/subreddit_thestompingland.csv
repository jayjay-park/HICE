779635,0,t3_22x8j6,Can you post the pc specs  and how much are you going to spend on iti believe the stomping land its made on unreal engine so i cant be sure about the specs. But a intel  wont cut it on mid graphics it probably will be on  very low lt  fps which is unplayable. if can change the cpu get a intel k for less  bucks and get a low tier graphic card for about  dollars.you can switch out all the parts to a bigger case but rarely the oposite.Please pm me the pc specs for further advice.,thestompingland,cgswcqa,1,t5_2x5d6

1116743,0,t3_26wldg,When you exit a game everything you built disappears. I do believe havent played much solo that you will keep all of your expertise and weapons. Unless the servers are reset twice a week. Then you start fresh.One cannot simply save their game,thestompingland,chv8f04,2,t5_2x5d6

1132996,0,t1_chwue6v,As mentioned in the video the totem is a very important component to every tribe even if youre solo. Here is a longer list of details about the totem The totem is the tribes icon of power it starts at zero and is upgraded by sacrificing dinosaur meat to the totem. Each totem tier gives the tribe increased abilities. There can only be  totem per tribeif there are  players in a server and they each make a totem they establish  separate tribes The totem creator is considered the leader of the tribe and invites other hunters into his tribe through their teepee. Each totem tier requires larger amounts of meat and from more difficult dinosaurs. Every time a hunter dies an entire tier from his tribes totem is lost. So only keep the best hunters.Source ,thestompingland,chx2l5a,1,t5_2x5d6

1158150,0,t3_27czxa,Creationism? I stopped the video after that. What does a game have to do with Creationism vs Evolution debate? I think this game is meant to be more Holy smokes batman! I can ride dinosaurs! But they always eat me. Lets make a tribe and work together. YEEEHAW!You know maybe. But I highly doubt it has anything to do with creationism. Oh also. Creationists do not believe the earth is  or however old it is million years old. They believe it is or around there? years old. Thus they do not believe dinosaurs existed.

1166628,0,t3_27gui0,Regarding boxes disappearing. Could we have it so items placed near teepees do not disappear? That way we can store meat and stuff at our camp or is the idle time so long that we need not really worry about it? Also is there a possibility that we could have teepees on such timer after we leave the server?,thestompingland,ci0v5xx,5,t5_2x5d6

1205416,0,t1_ci3bo08,The game wont change its price at all. Theyre allowing early access for the same as release price. I dont remember the reason but they have it in an FAQ somewhere.,thestompingland,ci5874n,1,t5_2x5d6
1208529,1,t3_27ye5q,The purpose of this video Ive seen alot of people complaining about the foliage saying how impossible it is to be stealthy due to the most recent update and how people can spot you miles away because of this. According to some of the players with the foliage update you cannot do anything now  Well im here to prove them wrong.Daytime  The first clip youll see me crawl up to a player take him out then relocate. After him being confused for about  minutes trying to figure out what happened i then take out his hut. He spots me and chases after me only to find i vanish like a ghost using my environment.Nighttime  The second clip i noticed a little fire in the distance so i went to explore only to find two tribesmen and two teepees. I took the challenge on. I crawled my way around and take both teepees down without being detected. You can still be stealthy  use the environment and be patient padawans. May the assassin  snake eater skills be with you.NOTE  The video is  minutes long not  minutes. Everything has been shortened down and cut to the main parts  fast forwarded. ,thestompingland,ci5kt19,1,t5_2x5d6

1326202,0,t3_295zxk,Fellow South African Player here. That server though empty most of the time is a great jam. Just last week it was full and we had a full a great time racing Dinos and waging war against our neighbours. I highly doubt that a South African Server will be implemented soon so I suggest just bear with it and check the servers every now and then. I normally go on about  on a Friday because that is when most people have free time SchoolJobs etc. If you ever want a quick jam just PM me for my steam name and we will play sometime.,thestompingland,ciitca2,1,t5_2x5d6

1385678,1,t1_cipcseq,Why? You willingly paid for a product. If you think it was falsely advertised you didnt research it enough. You always take a risk when buying an early access game. You should either accept the chance that the game might be broken and shit or you can wait a week or two and see what other people say.I hate seeing people acting as though they were ripped off or treated unfairly. Nobody forced you to buy the game. Sure the developers havent been updating as much as we would like but again thats the risk with early access...,thestompingland,cipz6s3,1,t5_2x5d6
