166473,0,t1_cexd1wd,I never said that the only funny people are on SNL.  Im just saying that it is stupid to care so much about race and gender of the cast members.It literally doesnt matter who is on SNL as long as their funny. They could be black white yellow red purple green or whatever the fuck they are.  It doesnt matter.  They could be male female or transgendered.  It doesnt even fucking matter.I mean SNL isnt a fucking show about racial or gender matters.  It doesnt have to have diversity among its cast.  The fact that it does should be good enough for people like you to shut the fuck up.Even if there is only four others that are of other races who cares?  Racial bias will always be a problem in this world because we are all human and all humans are assholes.  Also almost half the cast is female as well.TLDR  It really doesnt matter who makes up the cast on SNL as long as they can act well and can make people laugh with the skits that are written.

1042316,0,t3_25vbz8,My Top  would probably be Josh Hutcherson  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this episode. I definitely think he should come back to host because he did really well.  Drake  Another one I was surprised I enjoyed so much. Drake has some good impressions and the writing material was pretty good. I think that his episode had the best cold opening of all of them.  Edward Norton  Norton looked like he was having a blast which is great to see. This episode was so much fun. Also that Wes Anderson sendup of a horror movie was amazing.  Lady Gaga  I really enjoyed this episode. I cant really put my finger on why I just liked it.  Anna Kendrick  While I thought there was too much singing I cant necessarily say I hated it. It had a lot of charm and it was extremely amusing. Honorable Mentions to Jimmy Fallon the fangirls really took me out of the episode with all the incessant screaming Louis C.K. Paul Rudd and Kerry Washington.I just realized I ranked all first timer hosts. I felt like a lot of the returning hosts episodes were really formulaic. Which is bothersome.

In dress rehearsal he did this sketch with Rachel Dratch where he was supposed to be on a blind date with her and he was a really bad guesser she would ask him to guess her weight and hed say she weighs . But for some strange reason in the middle of the sketch he reached over and started touching on her boobs it wasnt even in the script he just went and did it and surprised Rachel. I saw the clip of it many years ago when she talked about it on Late Night with Conan OBrien.

5996661,0,t1_cy5og47,Basically I think Sanders supporters especially on this site have a hypersensitivity about everything. And it does Bernie a disservice. Its not an endorsement every time someone says something about Hillary or Bernie. Look at this sketch. Why did they say Hillary was going to be president? Its because by just about every metric there is she has a big lead in the primaries and fairs well in the general. Simply stating that she has a big lead isnt endorsing. Its a fact. Bernie supporters do their candidate no favors by taking offense to literally every tiny thing. I think there are a lot of people myself included that really like Bernie and are excited about the debate he brings to the table but have just been alienated by his supporters to the point that its nudged us over to Hillarys side. ,LiveFromNewYork,cy5oyqp,22,t5_2s7yh

6126320,0,t3_3zctna,. Kate McKinnon  Shes the indisputable queen of this cast. She got the coveted role of a woman very likely to become president and she constantly brings fresh new characters to Update.. Kenan Thompson  Always putting work into things so that they can constantly be a little better. Plus this is Season  and hes STILL getting new characters.. Cecily Strong  Cecily Strong is like the correct version of Taran Killam. You can tell shes an actress as well as a comedienne but you dont feel like shes trying to show off her acting chops in every. sketch. shes. in. thats how I feel about Taran. I love her impressions and I miss her on Update. Very versatile.. Bobby Moynihan  Bobby always seems so happy to be performing which is amazing. Unlike some past cast members he hasnt limited himself to big guy or fat guy impression. His Chris Christie is absolutely excellent. He brings a lot of unique energy to his characters.. Aidy Bryant  She is anything from oversexualizedhumpbucket to naiveasabutterfly. Her impressions are physical and hilarious and she commits so much. I think shell do well after SNL.. Jay Pharoah  He doesnt really have any crazy characters but hes a good straight man who can service in whatever impression role hes asked to. Ive never seen him bomb an impression and sometimes skill really is most important.. Beck Bennett  In three seasons hes shaping up to be a better lead than Taran IMO. He does decent impressions has great physicality and commits. He doesnt appear much these days though.. Taran Killam  I always feel like hes overacting a bit which knocks him down a good bit. Ive always really enjoyed Jebediah Atkinson though.. Colin Jost  Sometimes I feel like he feels that hes the smart kid working with his best friend on a school project but his best friend is just goofing up but Jost really wants a good grade. Hes got the chops to be a good Update anchor and he interacts well with correspondents.. Leslie Jones  Say what you will about her being onenote and loud shes slowly beginning to diversify her role. I think that it goes a long way to say that someone of that age is every considering changing their act. So I have a lot of respect for her jumping into something so out of her comfort zone and I sympathize with her screwups which are getting better.. Kyle Mooney  A lot of his sketches just arent my brand of humor. Not to discredit him it just isnt my personal scene. I think hed be much better elsewhere.. Sasheer Zamata  Poor Sasheer. Shes terribly funny and can do a decent impression but shes getting Abby Ellioted. The women with her just outshine her. Shell probably do well on her own.. Vanessa Bayer  theres no connect there. I rarely find her very funny and I think that shell be good on a sitcom but theres no reason for SNL to lock her up further when her contract ends.. Pete Davidson  I love his material and delivery and Im glad hes tried a few impressions but cmon. The kids a purebred standup. Hes excellent at it. Dont muddle him up with sketch. Let him go forge his own path but stop by the studio that gave him namerecognition every once in a while.. Jon Rudnitsky  Who? Exactly.. Michael Che  Are you a teenager at a rager Michael Che?

6213089,0,t3_40fjqd,Well I do think that if they didnt even do this sketch most would end up getting unflattering comparisons to the original cast whether they like it or not.  But with that said this wasnt good and it also sort of set them up as making it seem as though they would be as good as the ones they compare themselves to being.Also speaking of this I read that Elliott Gould had already signed up to be the host for that episode before he even knew that the original cast were gone so I wonder if he would had done this show if he knew it would be with an entirely new cast? Probably not.  It is a shame that this is the last time he hosted SNL.  If Mulaney wouldve been any good maybe he couldve hosted again.,LiveFromNewYork,cyvv0lf,1,t5_2s7yh

7931028,0,t1_d47bei7,To black people there is no such thing as tasteful blackface. I think the closest you can get to having acceptable blackface is what they did with Robert Downey Jr. in Tropic Thunder where a huge part of the joke was that this was a very tone deaf out of touch character within the movie who didnt understand that his blackface was offensive even as the movie makes clear that blackface is not acceptable to normal society. So it actually becomes informative about whats wrong with blackface.There is none of that meta selfawareness with Fallon in blackface here. Even if the makeup is good its still offensive because part of the joke is hey a white guy is painted to be a black guy. It also puts an embarrassing highlight on the problem that SNL has at times in the past had very limited numbers of blackminority cast members who could have filled that role.,LiveFromNewYork,d47itek,7,t5_2s7yh

I have immigrant parents so I grew up wellversed in Sabado Gigante but with zero knowledge of what SNL was until I saw the episode filled with clips of the Ambiguously Gay Duo among others. I was immediately hooked. I searched for it the next Saturday only to find Weekend Update with Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler and they did Really?! With Seth and Amy and SNL has become a religion ever since. Ive since been in the audience three times Melissa McCarthyPhoenix Josh HutchersonHAIM and Jonah HillBastille. Every show was a riot!

If you hadnt been paying attention to the things that were happening in the culture leading up to the joke you wouldnt know it but if you had you would know that there had been a lot of speculation about Barron being autistic and shit like that and then this joke about him going on a shooting spree? Thats definitely a he looks like a serial killer joke. Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to gaslight you.Id also like to remind you that liberal orthodoxy is currently that the speaker isnt the one who gets to say whether offense exists. The person hearing the joke is the one who gets to decide if it was offensive. This has been the case for years now. So Im saying it my cousin was a schoolteacher at Sandy Hook and I am offended by this tasteless joke.But she shouldnt be fired unless she wrote while on the clock at her job for SNL i.e. if SNL effectively paid her to tell the joke because your nonworkplace behavior shouldnt be able to get you fired.,LiveFromNewYork,dcvipqb,0,t5_2s7yh

10484180,0,t1_dcwe8we,Yes that is the right email and exactly what I did. This was my first year emailing. I emailed the last day available. I think there was a post reminding everyone it was their last chance to email so I thought why not. I didnt get any form of response saying I was entered or anything. I completely forgot that I had done that until Jan th so  days before the show saying I had won tickets to dress rehearsal so I was pretty surprised. You have to tell them if youre coming and who you are bringing two tickets within  hours or they will give the tickets away. Luckily I had checked my email that day. Seating is fucking weird. Even for the rehearsal they were being so weird and it felt...secretive? I dont know. They were being very specific about what group certain people were in. Ill try to explain this.To begin with the email says this PRESENTATION OF THIS LETTER IS REQUIRED TO CLAIM YOUR TICKETS. To claim your tickets on the day of the taping you and your guests should arrive at  Rockefeller Plaza using the  West th Street entrance. Upon arrival proceed to the Grand Stair and present this confirmation letter and ask for Jens Line. You will be directed up the staircase where you will be required to present this confirmation letter and photo ID that matches the name listed above. Upon receiving your tickets your party will be ushered into the Peacock Lounge. Please be aware that once your party checks in your party will not be permitted to leave the Peacock Lounge prior to the taping.So it already feels weird having a password. Anyways you get there and a lady asked for anything you have to show her so we show her the email and my ID and she says OK........How did you get this.......and I was like Ummm email lottery and shes like.....OK......So then I say..........Jens Line? And shes like Yep! Right up the stairs! So we go up and talk to a Page and shes talking about Aziz and how excited she is for this episode and asking how excited we are. We had been up for  hours straight so we looked and sounded like shit. We guessed she was gauging our personality if we were happy and excitable and probably what we looked like like shit.We go through brief metal detector security and talk to a few Pages at a table who ask the same things are we excited have we been here before etc. One of them writes a  on our ticket envelope. They give us blue wristbands and tell us to sit in the large section of the Peacock lounge. There are three sections of the peacock lounge. One large section and two smaller section veiled off with curtains on the left and right. I notice right away there are cameras all over. We start seeing people put into the different sections and we start wondering what it takes to get into the smaller sections. We quickly realize they are being very specific as to who goes where. We joke around that maybe its based on attractiveness and that the attractive people will sit down by the stage. I scan our large section and to my horror I realize weve been put with the ugly group. Then two very attractive girls come and sit in our section so then we say OK its not based on attractiveness because those two would definitely be in the attractive group.  minutes later a producer comes around the corner from down the hall walks directly up to them pulls them out of our section gives them purple wristbands and has them sit in one of the smaller sections. We immediately conclude we will be sitting in the balcony. They start having people go into the studio by saying Those with a B on their envelope can line up! Im like Uhhh is this  a B? Then they say If you have TH you can line up Then they say If you have a star on your envelope you can line up! All of the smaller sections have gone to the studio and then they let the big group of us ugly people in. We rode the elevator in groups of ten and then waited in a long line as somehow other people would pop up the elevator and would walk right past us say something to the pages and go straight to a seat in the studio. Eventually we sat in the balcony on the far left side so most sets were blocking a lot of my view. I didnt mind though I was beyond happy to be there and can not wait to be back. Seriously though I immediately looked up how to get a job at  Rock I would be happy just to clean up after the set crew or anything just to be there.TLDR They only respond when you win. And I obviously dont know for sure what thier seating system is but as far as the stage seating goes I dont think it matters how early you are. We were the first people there at pm and they told us to leave. ,LiveFromNewYork,dcwho0m,13,t5_2s7yh

I feel like Chris KellySarah Schneider would have written that since they love pop music and throwing back to earlier eras.What sitcom sketch were you referring to that Kyle didnt come out for? Im blanking.Lastly was the horrible gym sketch longer in dress? Because the only reason I think they included it was because time was running out and it was shortrushed? They did it last week with the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory sketch it was under  minutes and I was unsure if the sketch was edited down OR it was really just that short that they squeezed it in last minute...,LiveFromNewYork,ddo5v9e,8,t5_2s7yh
