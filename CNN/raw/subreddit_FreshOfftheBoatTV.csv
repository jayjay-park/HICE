3214464,0,t1_cov2hia,Ran out of space in the first post so Ill just add this small part to a new postAs for Mark Wahlberg I dont really have strong opinions on that. People do fucked up shit when they are young that dont necessarily reflect who they are when they are older. I know I used to believe some fucked up shit that Im embarrassed about. If he says something overtly racist against asians now Id be much more critical about him. But I dont know if its fair to expect all Asian Americans to hate him because he beat up a Vietnamese dude a long time ago. I think that Asians take more offense at people conflating Asians and thinking they are the same rather than actually necessarily getting mad when any specific Asian is wronged. In other words I think saying all Asians are interchangeable is more offensive to most Asians than someone using the word chink at a Chinese person or gook at a Vietnamese person. How much offense you take at a Vietnamese guy getting beat up has much to do with if youre Vietnamese or are immersed in Vietnamese culture. Im not saying its not offensive unless Im that race but its amplified by being a part of that race. Its offensive to me when a black guy is called a nigger and is beat up for being black. But it wouldnt hit home as hard as if it were Chinese American.I think this would be similar to the Marky Mark thing. Asians have a complicated relationship with other groups of Asians. We band together under a single banner when it comes to racial politics but secretly hate each other when its not about racial politics. Its all about context. Id expect him to offend Vietnamese more than Chinese. But if someone mixed up Japanese and Korean Id be more offended by that because it regards racial politics and thus its about solidarity under that Asian banner. I dont know if its shitty of me for feeling this way but thats just how it is in my mind. Maybe if I were SE Asian Id have a completely different opinion on Mark Wahlberg.,FreshOfftheBoatTV,cov6iir,1,t5_33o0g
