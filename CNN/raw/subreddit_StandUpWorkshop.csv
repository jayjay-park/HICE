3351996,0,t3_2yj12i,Its a little confusing. I dont follow along. I think I would say something about how women get to use all the bathrooms but men cant and how awkward that is. And then say that you snuck into a womans bathroom because you really had to pee but the mens bathroom was full you got in trouble and then tried to make a big political deal by saying you were the rosa parks of bathroom access. And have the last time be how that didnt work and you still received a lifetime ban courtesy of the fascists at Chuck E. Cheese replace this with whatever location works. ,StandUpWorkshop,cpacp0a,5,t5_3067k

4942069,0,t3_3i0196,In general I dont think people have to have seen a given movie for a joke to work if you set it up a little FYI I havent seen Field of Dreams and Im in my late s. Just reading your bit and having not seen the movie I think it would be funnier to just state that black people dont like ghosts a well known stereotype and end it at especially white man ghosts from the s telling not asking them to do shit.,StandUpWorkshop,cuhhjq8,2,t5_3067k

6982707,0,t1_d17tdvq,Yeah you do get paid for jury duty. I cant remember the pay but they pay weekly over  for sure. They feed everyone on the jury too. Last day we were there they fed us a Mexican buffet. Im not sure about the misleading part kinda confuses me a little. Maybe if I mention we were charging her with capital murder and I couldnt sleep knowing that my decision chooses her fate. But I feel thats kinda sad and not too funny. Was looking at this one more to be a passing joke or one liner if possible.,StandUpWorkshop,d17tupf,1,t5_3067k
7031316,0,t1_d1cai3m,It relies on being totally unexpected.It uses the same format as a lesser known Louis CK bit that goes something like do you ever think youre going to fart but instead you shit all over your fathers face? And everyone on the bus is like hey come on thats not appropriate.Element of surprise plus an unrelated risque topic catches people off guard. Its not overly clever its not good for a closing bit but if you need a laugh in the middle of your set without much set up its good to keep one or two of these jokes handy.,StandUpWorkshop,d1dcreo,2,t5_3067k
7675683,0,t1_d3e2ach,See my response to uApolloScreed . I think if I pursue some of the angles talked about there it could be something good. Obviously this isnt a particularly hard conclusion to come to as your said but as far as we can tell there hasnt been a stand up bit about this so its worth trying to go further.Unrelated note on originality Things dont have to be things that have never been thought of before for them to be funny standup bits. In this instance you are very right about it being a thought that is easy to come to which is why I obviously need to find another angle. But I have noticed a lot of your responses on this sub are proof of similar jokes or premises being done or proof others have had that thought. Sometimes standup is just pointing out things that everyone has thought before in an innovative way and making people think haha Ive totally thought that too. once again not applicable with this joke Im just speaking generally. You may be limiting yourself by overzealously avoiding ideas that have been previously explored. Just a thought from one aspiring comic to another. Take it how you may.,StandUpWorkshop,d3eohe0,1,t5_3067k

Sometimes standup is just pointing out things that everyone has thought before in an innovative way and making people think haha Ive totally thought that too.I dont point out examples when they are innovative. I point it out when the joke is ridiculously obvious and overdone. I also point out when things could be trimmed.Both of those are things that are pointed out to me when I post. I appreciate the honesty and hope others do too. Ignore it freely. Im just a shitty open micer. ,StandUpWorkshop,d3es1af,1,t5_3067k

7715659,0,t1_d3j7mmf,You posted here and asked for criticism you cant expect everyone to be nice about. You cant call someone judgemental when youre asking for judgement. Even if uSharkfightxl was being a judgmental cyber bully he is correct. Its a street joke. Street jokes dont work well on stage they work better when youre at the water color during your  minute break at the office.I get it sucks hearing that your joke isnt very good but use it as motivation to write better jokes. Ask for advice. You can report him all you want but Im not going to do anything about it.,StandUpWorkshop,d3j7ufe,7,t5_3067k

8699693,0,t3_4z2q4m,First personalize it. My friends is stronger than people my age. You can even preface your joke by adding a little ironyMy friends and I were sitting around watching My Little Pony and eating Oreos when one guy says Life would be so much easier if I were a kid again. I have too many responsibilities. Is that right David? The Pokmon Go a little too stressful for ya? The way your mom folds your laundry giving you an ulcer?Ive heard this a lot from my friends. Lifes so hard. I feel like if you want to become a kid again just go full homeless. Its even better!Kids have a bedtime. Homeless people dont even have beds.Kids have to go to school doctors appointments...the main priority of a homeless guy is finding a piece of cardboard and a crayon and writing God Bless legibly.Dont take candy from strangers! Dont get in that van! Disregard that completely when youre homeless! By the way I have a very lovely van filled with candy if there are any homeless people here.Impression of Buffalo Bill from Silence of the LambsIt places the lotion on its skin.Was she a great big fat person?And if uCinnabonBJ lets you have that joke they wrote...Im not really a serial killer. Im actually pretty generous with the homeless. I always give my pocket full of a change to a homeless guy... I just dont want to make any contact so I have to throw it at him. Tag Kids have bath times. Homeless...not so much.Okay thats a lot of ideas. God Bless!,StandUpWorkshop,d6t3dk3,1,t5_3067k
8717179,0,t3_4zevl8,Can I point out an awesome typo?  Platonic friendship is what you meant but plutonic friendship would be either friendship based on death or friendship based on fabulous wealth.

10566734,0,t1_dd367y6,People will accept if you say kids are annoying but its a dick move to say old people are annoying. Were just coddling them because theyre closer to death. Just think about every time you let shit slide with an old person. I do it all the time and just think to myself eh theyre just old Im giving them an excuse that should be the reason why they know better. Youve been around long enough to have figured it out by now. If we actually told old people how annoying they are we wouldnt have trump. Im already annoying now I cant imagine how insufferable Ill be when Im old. I talk a lot. Mostly about things that dont matter. I have regular conversations about how I would handle a zombie apocalypse. what kind of shit Ill be spouting off about when Im old? If I found  red eared slider turtles covered in ooze I would definitely raise them as my children and teach them ninjitsu,StandUpWorkshop,dd5uxcp,2,t5_3067k
