I also messed up big time by not working an accounting job during school. Instead I worked nonaccounting type jobs.My best advice is to find accounting work ASAP even if it is lowend type of work. The longer you wait the worse off you will be when you go to find a real job. If you have relevant accounting experience on your resume even if it is menial accounting clerk job then it will make you sound out. Also I am not talking about accounting internships. You need to get a job that requires you to do real accounting work.DO NOT go to school full time without working. Do whatever it takes to get relevant accounting experience.

Where do we draw the line? Why ban them but not Green Peace? We should let both sides of issues be heard so that we arent seen as trying to silence people so long as they were not being violent in speech or actions. Do I think what they are saying is trueright? Hell no.For me Id want no organizations to just randomly come onto campus and promote their stuff but I dont know if others would agree with me on this.Good on you for emailing though and I hope others follow suit.

I always consider that someone would have to be stealing just for the sake of stealing to take something that  probably doesnt fit them  is filled with someones sweat from the past few months or years and  that they probably couldnt even sell for money if they wanted.Plus someone would have to be a huge dick to steal something that you need in order to even ride the bike.Up to you though.  Whatever youre comfortable with.,csuf,ddpsah0,3,t5_2rxvl

11125382,0,t1_deshe9v,Its very beginner friendly theres a beginners specific class called Jiu Jitsu Fundamentals. The teacher Rich is very attentive and willing to work with everyone. Unfortunately I cant tell you about the times this semester because I dont know what they are. I tore my meniscus before the semester started so I had to withdraw this time around. But I highly recommend this club if you wanna learn a skill that can potentially save your life DEdit The people in the club are also very friendly. Everyone just wants to learn from one another. Plus the class itself is like  or so dollars per session.,csuf,det1wn5,1,t5_2rxvl
11276290,0,t3_60ldai,I took Anthony Chen for A. Personally I think Accounting classes all require selfteaching a bit. My prof go over some problems in class but most of the time I have to go over more problems at home  with solution give. Test is average not hard not easy and he does CURVE. ,csuf,dfa5g9k,3,t5_2rxvl

11379420,0,t1_dflpkg9,You HAVE to take  class that has the code ACCT and says accounting ethicsresponsibilities. Im currently taking that class at OCC.  unitsI used my audit class  to fulfill this section so thats  unitsAnd I believe I used my mgmt  class so thats another  units to fulfill the  units.So your mgmt  class will count for this section but you HAVE to take the class that I mentioned first. When youre allocating your classes you must remember that you cant double count a class for different sections. If you dont understand just go to one of those cpa leisure events they have on campus. Theyll explain the tip sheet to you.,csuf,dflu6nr,1,t5_2rxvl
