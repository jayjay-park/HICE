151132,0,t3_1vsh30,Hi! I took a Russian literature class last year and have all of my books still. I really enjoyed the works my professor selected and I think you might too! Heart of a Dog by Mikhail Bulgakov  Loved this one. Moscow to the End of the Line by Venedikt Erofeev  One of my favorites from the class. Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev  A classic Medieval Russias Epics Chronicles and Tales by Serge Zenkovsky  To be very honest this one is rather dry but the stories themselves are very interesting.  Everything Flows by Vasily Grossman  Written as a novel but really more of a brutally honest history of Soviet Russia. I highly recommend it. I would love to swap for either of the Philip K. Dick books or Sedaris. ,bookexchange,cevn8g0,1,t5_2rl8w
