5474241,0,t3_3pki6t,Rep here.Also something to consider. The internet and the TV goes through the same line but the bandwidth for the two are separate. Speed test for the internet service wont have any bearing on the TV. That said if there is issue with the line going to your house your internet will be affected too. TlDr call tech support. We will get that fixed for ya. If you dont call us we dont know its broken so we cant fix it for you. ,uverse,cwbdw42,0,t5_2s50d
5741603,0,t3_3tr0wf,Tech support escalation rep here. From what I have gathered from your post so far there is a couple of possibilities. Some one screwed up the order to move your GFs account from her old address to yours. fairly common. Someone misunderstood the situation and screwed up the whole process. Also fairly common. Some ultra rare situations that is preventing you guys to getting services at your address currently. which I have run into once alsoDepending how messed up the whole situation is the soonest you can talk to someone that fix your issue is going to be Monday. Tech support is going to be there Sunday. However Sales who writes orders that move someones service from address A to address B is not going be in the office until am local time Monday. If you want you can talk to tech support tomorrow and they will be able to do much. At least they will be to at least  figure out where you need to go to sort out your situation on Monday. PS Just for clarification sake your GF is moving herself and her service to your place? Also did a tech was dispatchedcame out at all? If so what did she say?,uverse,cx8sv4d,2,t5_2s50d

5856650,0,t1_cxnaz3j,Right I think everything up to that box is fine. The rest of my house has terrible networking although this might make it easier for me to fix.What I want to do is grab a wall mount patch panel and connect the hard wired house lines into it that will be repurposed for data and not voice everything in the house is wired with cate just using various pairs and then put my switch down there with the gateway and connect everything. I just wanted to be sure my thoughts as outlined above were kosher. I know I mucked up connectors a bit RJ vs RJ and that Id have to fix both ends of my existing office wire to have RJ for my network if I connected it to the patch panel.,uverse,cxnc2rn,1,t5_2s50d

6469416,0,t1_czoh3gv,A tech came out took the kitchen jack out of the loop leaving only the jack in my bedroom where the modem was hooked up. He replaced the jack there with a ATampT branded jack and I was good to go. The branded jack as far as I know isnt really necessary. If anything it only helped because it has shiny new contact points. They just use them because it helps them check for things from their end.Keep in mind that repairs of inside wiring issues are usually at the customers expense. I wasnt charged because I had only just established service the previous day. If you have a kitchen jack you may want to try plugging it in there because I have been told that that is usually the first point of entry and see if it syncs both lights solid green. The modem doesnt need to be hooked up to anything so dont worry about dragging a computer to the kitchen. If its going to sync it should be able to do it with just a phone line hooked up to it. If both lights go solid green after a while you will then know for sure that its the wiring since it can sync there. You may want to check with the tech when he show up if he thinks you will be charged. If you are adept at phone wiring you may want to try to fix it yourself.,uverse,czohezc,3,t5_2s50d
6610089,0,t3_466qxb,As someone that sees both services all day everyday this is not surprising. UTV service is very simple compared to DIRECTV. Its like comparing UVoice to Mobility Wireless homephone vs cellphone. The better service is obviously DIRECTV.Im afraid of the plans to rebrand DTV though. If its true theyre changing the name I feel like that will be a big misstep. Ignorant people are already blaming simple random things like taxes and their  month promos ending on ATT buying DIRECTV. The insane backlash when they rebrand will be a nightmare.,uverse,d031ey6,1,t5_2s50d

7874874,0,t1_d40sbdi,That is somewhat correct. You have mb service into your house. Phone and TV service get first dibs on that bandwidth. If he has all  TVs running on different channels that takes around mb away from the  leaving only around mb for internet. The only time this isnt the case is if the user is on FTTP. I dont know that anyone actually knows how much overhead they give for that. I have mb Internet and u and with all  tvs running I still am able to download at mb.,uverse,d417iij,1,t5_2s50d

10541809,0,t1_dd30z8y,Ah my mistake.  I meant putting the Residential Gateway where the current DSL line terminates so where the previous owner kept it and just running Ethernet from that location to where youd like your computer.I dont think youll see much difference especially since you want to be hardwired having the gateway directly next to your computer in comparison to in another room.,uverse,dd315bx,1,t5_2s50d

10878201,0,t1_de1w4zb,I think you mean Ethernet over the power lines. But yes they are pretty nice although I would only use them if the range is the issue. Its not a cure all. ,uverse,de20c7f,3,t5_2s50d
