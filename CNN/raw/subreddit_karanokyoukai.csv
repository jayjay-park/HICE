6628205,0,t1_d04wm7i,I know I think I will drop a lame excuse like Well in the movies Shiki never had her powers activated for a long time so you shouldnt either!Jokes aside I am working on it. Those things have names and Ive got to figure them out in order to correct them. I thought I make it public to you guys because this is only a minor problem.,karanokyoukai,d04ww8c,2,t5_33fum
6648833,0,t1_d071kzw,gtThe reply box isnt transparent like the comments are.I never intended to do the reply box transparent idk if that is even possible. If you have deactivated your eyes then the comments are still as transparent as when you have it activated. gtSame with this flair thing over here.I will look after how much I can tweak the things around.,karanokyoukai,d071p5x,2,t5_33fum
7147402,0,t1_d1qkwcx,I looked at Mirai Fukuin again approx  min duration and saw some cat scenes at the beginning. We are talking about two plots in one movie right? Sorry for this confusion haha but a whole movie about Shiki and the cat is new for me.,karanokyoukai,d1ql3fh,1,t5_33fum

11438614,0,t3_63a5dq,I had that discussion with a guy I was watching it with once he hadnt seen it before I think? and was told in his anime forums to watch it chronologically.In the end I got him to watch it in release order as well. I think it makes for a better suspense arc when you slowly find out what is actually going onwhat happened.,karanokyoukai,dfsk117,4,t5_33fum
