Saturday morning and then a hike or other activity. Not just sitting down to dinner. We went antiqueing to an antiques mall once. We went to an outdoor arts festival another time. We went to lunch and a movie and then the next week we discussed the movie over pizza. I had a lot of fun. We are in a larger town Huntsville AL and the meetup groups number somewhere around  or so. There seems to be a lot of choices. Wish I had more to suggest.

7265085,0,t3_4erkes,I think men are the same. I have first dates with men who made plans to get together again and never followed through or just flaked people ask for my number and never call. I would actually like to find a monogamous relationship myself. I find it annoying in the online context when men just message hey. I have also come to realize many do not read the profile because I get contacted by a ton of men who live too far away or when I look at their profile we have obvious incompatibilities or they put one sentence in their description like to have fun. My perception is that there are a ton of low effort guys who say they want a relationship in their profile but also know that is what women want to hear. I just ended things with one of those low effort people he said he wanted a relationship but really what he wanted was somebody to hook up on the weekends with to have sex. Nothing wrong with that but I want something more. I think for me the issue is my idea of a relationship and other peoples might be vastly different. I dont want to Nextflix and chill I like planning activities and because I have a weird work schedule I like to plan a bit in advance.I personally avoid everybody who explicitly states they want a casual arrangement.So it is not just an ego boost I want to connect with somebody I have some common ground with. I am personally not in a great dating market for me because I am in the bible belt not religious and I dont want to be a football or hunting widow because I already did that. The men in my area post a lot of hunting and fishing pictures on their profile and I skip right by them. Also in my age group most men want to date younger or they claim to be athletic which is blatantly untrue from photos and I actually am somewhat.I am actually thinking of taking a break I am not unhappy single and I dont want a relationship just to fill some holes in life.,datingoverthirty,d23zlzr,2,t5_34cyw

7619777,0,t3_4jhdco,I can so relate to this post. I think after a very long marriage that did not have good chemistry and a divorce that will just not end because he is dragging it I found myself in a similar attraction with someone. I know part of it has been a good thing because it has been a distraction from the massive pain I have had to deal with the last  months and it was also amazing feeling desired for once. But now I find myself constantly thinking of him way to much. It is a constant distraction in my everyday life. I dont remember ever feeling this way about someone. I wonder if it isnt a false feeling just because of where I am in life. I know the advice about learning to be alone is important advice and I see that a lot in the divorce advice. Now that you have had some time with someone that made you feel desired now back off and really heal from your divorce. Now if I can follow my own advice.It seems I am not the only one that has found themselves after divorce in this situation. I have to say I appreciate not feeling totally crazy anymore. ,datingoverthirty,d38buwa,3,t5_34cyw

A person who likes another person should not contact other people in order to appear distant or important and because they expect the other person to be doing the same.Maybe thats why dating for our generation is so fucked up.

Im Asian though and when I had no luck initially with online dating I blamed my race. Then I began to look objectively at my profile. I talked about my divorce too much. I tried too hard to be funny. I had some toilet humor in my profile. I was negative in places and entitled in others listing a set of qualities that I wanted but it came across as demands. My profile was full of clichs of what I thought everyone wanted to hear. I wasnt myself.I drastically revised my profile. I took better pics. My previous pics were all with my ex andor my kid or were professional headshots for work. I began to get dates. I got a few gfs. I eventually lost s and got an amazing beautiful gf. I dont know if she would have noticed me when I was heavier. But I think I might be overestimating the effect my weight had on women and you might be too. In retrospect I still did okay for myself when I was heavy. My ex was a size  which I learned is even smaller than a . The first woman I had a regular thing with postdivorce was a fitness instructor. One of my exgfs was sexy as fuck and had great boobs. TL DR Youre overweight but not alarmingly so unless youre a cardiologist.

I did mention that I was only recently dating again after getting divorced early last year. I explained that I spent almost all of  focusing on myself with rebuilding and improving refusing to date until I felt ready again and have no kidspropertycontact with the exwife. I was a little nervous but she didnt seem to have a problem. anyway we exchanged numbers at the end we had only messaged on OKC prior to that and the messaging aspect of the app likes to either send a message  times or not at all and Im hopeful for another meetup. shes awfully cute in her late s and we both had a laugh at the fact that were both of Italian heritage but always get mistaken for other nationalities. ah the glory of looking ethnically ambiguous! speaking of I got a Merry Christmas text from Wisdom Tooth Girl and just said same to you!  bye Felicia. unrelated to my own dating life but I helped my younger cousin whos effectively my brother since were both the only children of our parents and have done so much together in our lives propose to his girlfriend in Central Park last Friday!

People dont like surprises and your dates are showing up with a look of disappointed or even worse leaving which is SO fucking rude and completely inexcusable...it sounds to me like your profile might be slightly deceptive or not quite as complete as it should be.

10770105,0,t3_5t7d8b,  Asian Filipino cancer survivor . Separated in . Divorced as of last year after a  year marriage.  Two kids who live with me.  No regrets though as everything in my life so far has made me who I am and I like to think thats a great father and overall a good man.  Ive been lurking on here for a while as I try to figure out how this dating thing works again.  Its nice to see that Im not alone in being at a complete loss.   Bit of an introvert ISFJ so that has been a challenge when it comes to dating.  I was never a big dater.  Currently focused on finding myself again.  I never realized how much of myself was lost when I got married.  Creative quirky and always up for an adventure.  I love that I get to be creative in my work again.  Ive been told that Im a great listener laid back and very patient.  I relish a challenge especially in the kitchen.  I love to experiment with new recipes all the time. Latest challenge is moving to a more plant based lifestyle and living a more meaningful and compassionate life.  Its been great for weightloss too!Tried all the dating apps and found out first hand that yes being Asian and male is the worst demographic in those apps.  At least for me anyway.  Still I went on a few dates to no avail.  The negative ego crushing experiences far outweigh the little bit of good.  So Ive given up on those for now and hoping for an old school romance.  But there is no rush.  Teach me oh wise sages of rdatingoverthirty!,datingoverthirty,ddquun4,5,t5_34cyw

11002494,0,t3_5wyg96,Ive picked through the comments in this thread and in all honesty probably havent read them as closely as I could or should. Forgive me if I tread over any familiar ground I offer my own thoughts...First and foremost If theres one thing I dislike evern more than trolling and troublemaking its willful ignorance. I freely admit that Ill use a posters history to try to suss out what theyre getting at I find it a perfectly acceptable tool to use because I dont look merely at where theyre posting but at what theyre posting. The one that came in a week or so agoI deserve a better caliber of womanI looked through his post history. One of his Red Pill posts was I accidentally got a woman pregnant how can I force her to have an abortion so she doesnt trap me?. At that point I wrote him off that person in my mind isnt looking for dating advice and hes certainly not going to take it from the  percent of this sub who happen to be female.One of societys wonderful benefits is that it gives us the tools we need to gauge whether or not were an asshole. If I stand on a streetcorner somewhere screaming ALL WOMEN ARE BITCHES AND WHORES! berating every woman that walks past the reactions I get should be an indicator as to how I might consider my future actions. If I fail to heed the advice proffered in this instance if I adamantly remain an asshole and society chastises me for it I have no right to be confused. Ive been told how to comport myself in a manner respectful to others and if I choose to willfully ignore that by screaming Red Pill rants or goosestepping and Sieg Heiling down the sidewalk or going into my local fast food restaurant with my klan robes on I get what I deserve.If someone goes into a Red Pill sub and posts I cant figure it out my dating life is in a death spiral whats up with women? Id say that he went to the wrong place to get his answers but hes not necessarily a bad person and may still be worth my time to give an opposing viewpoint. If he lives in a Reb Pill sub constantly spewing the most insane belligerent horseshit imaginable then comes here and asks why dont women like me? then I perceive him as a lost cause at best or a troll at worst because anyone who isnt willfully ignorant knows what the Red Pill is about and knows that those sorts of thoughts and actions are not exactly endearing to women.On to my second point I realized belatedly whilst vacuuming my living room last night that I was unnecessarily hard on uCrossCountry. Guy wants what he wants and frankly while I did find his tone a bit on the whiny side I dont think that he was harboring any intended malice his point was that he wanted an older woman not that he was entitled to one. And frankly I still think hes wrong about a number of things. That doesnt give me the right to badger him about it. One of my greatest flaws is that Im hell on a viewpoint that I personally consider illogical its a terrible trait and working on letting it go and letting people have their own thoughts on things is something that I need to do more of.If at any time one of the mods thinks Im out of line with my own horseshit I invite them to put on their green suit and give me a warning. Bossman says to mind my Ps and Qs Ill be all yes sir no sir. Im not immune to bad moods to acting up to trying to get the last word. And again society gives me the tools to stop that shit to have someone else say that was out of line. I gratefully accept those tools.A final note Ive grown to like you all quite a bit. I think that I was on shaky ground romancewise when I stumbled over this sub. The advice that Ive been given the bit of confidence that Ive gained I never before would have imagined sending someone a picture of myself and having them say youre handsome and the sense of camaraderie Ive felt to include the great friendship Ive made with uMorningBeer has helped me greatly and has made me feel at home. Weve had some come and go but the core people that remain are to my thinking good people who want to genuinely help those who genuinely come looking for it.I wont apologize for protecting my home or for sticking up for my friends. If someone wants to come to this sub and shit all over it whether because theyre trolling or because theyre just so messed up that they lost any sense of decency a long time ago I will fight it. I will not let the needlessly angry and the willfully ignorant mess up what you all have built here if I can help it. I will fight it with every weapon I have. And if Im a bit too quick on the trigger I hope that someone will step in set me right to tell me to cool off I trust our mods and all of you to do that.And thats my two cents on the matter.,datingoverthirty,def3msq,5,t5_34cyw

Have yet to meet a guy thats older than me who shares my penchant for going to EDM concerts and dancing around. Im sure they exist though. I can imagine in person you probably look tons younger.

There needs to be an expressed intent that neither of you will seek datesromance with others before anyone can get pissy about being on a dating site. Otherwise theres so much unsaid and youre relying on implied meanings to define your relationship. E.g. he seems to be relying on sex  several dates in a row to imply commitment.What you do with your time is your business. Until such time that you expressly agree to be committed to this man its a bit out of bounds for him to expect complete fidelity by you. OTOH saying you were stalking his dating profile and thats why you were online is likely going to make him feel better about you being on POF. ,datingoverthirty,desj524,5,t5_34cyw

If shes  and thats what she looks like thats what  looks like. I know lots of women in their forties and fifties who are attractive even by superficial objective criteria.

11567727,0,t3_64x053,I definitely wouldnt judge someone for that even before my current circumstance had to terminate my lease when my ex split and then stopped paying her portion of the rent. Im moving in  weeks to a house my parents own. Im trying to buy but its difficult. The house Im moving into would be a bonus in most cases. Waterfront house on the Atlantic Ocean. Problem is I want to be out of it by the time they move in June. Im humiliated by that prospect if I didnt own a dog Id be renting a campsite for the summer. I can see where others might judge because I judge myself. I dont blame them but I personally see someone in a similar situation as a plus almost just because I know they wont they can relate. It sucks not to have your own place at this age but if your a person with a family thats willing to help you and your willing to accept it that just means youve got a healthy outlook overall. ,datingoverthirty,dg77h2b,1,t5_34cyw

11620566,0,t1_dgd3uvf,This is TERRIBLE idea.  It escalates a situation by forcing an already unstable person to react.  They will react in ways that are completely unpredictable.If a guy is acting like a creep being a creep yourself by trying to show him and the world the errors of his ways is no better than what he is doing himself.  In many ways it is worse as those actions are absolutely conscious and deliberate.You cannot force someone with sociopathic tendencies to stop their behaviours with shame.  That is like trying put out a fire with liquid oxygen.There is also the very real consideration of legal ramifications against the poster of the information.  Libel is a real thing and if the subject of a posting gets lawyers involved before any criminal charges against him are filed there IS going to be a bad time.,datingoverthirty,dgd7a6l,8,t5_34cyw

Why on earth would you think you cant love after going on a few dates with some duds that didnt impress you? I would not be impressed by most people either but that doesnt mean I cant love. You are worthy and absolutely should have standards. Theyre what keep us from settling with someone who would make us miserable. ,datingoverthirty,dgp5746,2,t5_34cyw
11726166,0,t3_67bhdl,Ive found my major issue is a dissatisfaction with two key issues Ideology and emotional intelligence.Ideology in the way that Ive come across too many people with no ideology at all. No political opinions no thoughts on society no awareness of current events foreign or domestic outside of the news in their Facebook feed. Their entire worldview is limited to their everyday lives.And emotional intelligence in such that I keep meeting women who  havent moved beyond the high schoollevel of selfawareness who seem incapable of making themselves happy without a partner to do the emotional heavy lifting for them. I blame this more on inexperience with relationships after being with one partner for a long stretch. Ive been divorced for  years so Ive been through the trenches and figured a lot of stuff out the hard way. I no longer have the interest or patience to deal with women fresh out of a bad relationship.Its very frustrating for me and at the same time I acknowledge that this is my problem not theirs.,datingoverthirty,dgp6wdx,3,t5_34cyw
11726574,0,t3_67bhdl,Ive been single for   years. I used that time to learn new dating relationship and communication skills.I didnt think Id need them with The Writer. Hes in his s surely his skills are better than mine right? Nope. Not even close. Hes been dating women in the their s since he hit  and oh boy does it show. He has the weird reaction where he sort of cringes away from me or goes really quiet when he does something he thinks will make me angry or upset. I never yell or lose my temper so I did not teach him to expect that. It was so obvious I had to explain gently to him that yelling and losing my temper wasnt my style. On our last few dates he showed up looking exhausted and stressed and while he would loosen up and become engaging and laugh and be affectionate and warm he seemed to be a bit distant. After our unexpected DTR talk which sort of destroyed me inside I suggest he take some space to think about what he wanted. The fact that I had to do that for him surprised me. Why? If left to his own devices he would have carried on seeing me as normal despite obvious signs he was starting to pull away. Sure  he has a lot on his plate working six days a week is three weeks away from leaving for Cannes and is trying to raise  million for his feature script amp rewrite said feature script. He also hates where he rents so much he is staying with his mother. But I thought at his age he would have the self awareness to ask for space if he needed it. I would understand.Ive had a no contact policy in place to give him mentalemotional as well as physical space its been a week now and while I have stuck to it he recently commented and liked a status of mine on Facebook and seems to be fishing for me to do the same for him. If you want to see me miss me whatever ... Just goddamn call. ,datingoverthirty,dgp8kbs,1,t5_34cyw

11751163,0,t3_67jm2c,Hes lamenting on that same old thing though...  think about the city you live and date in!  like me citiy near me is barely .  half of them are the right gender then about half of those are even single who knows what percentage is straight and then less than half of those ever date very small percentage of those might ever go to some place you might meet them at...  and then half of those would seem attractive to you less than half find you attractive so on and so on then you would divide that population by political amp then ethical traits etc...  Look at it...  I am using the plain old easy math of half and picking the biggest probable halving stats I have heard.  without that real statistics means that the dating pool in k population is very skimpy like less than ? and the more specific you are the skimpier it gets.  So to me hes saying dont be so specific aka allow yourself to settle?  Which I think we all here at DOT know settling is a bad idea most times than not.,datingoverthirty,dgs0v9f,1,t5_34cyw

For three years he was my main priority.  I was nineteen he was around  and in the process of separating from his wife.  I think I thought we would date someday which is really embarassing.It is one of the biggest regrets of my life and I cant think about it without feeling sick throughout my whole body.  Ill never get that time back.  Ill never get to be the mommy that my baby needed and deserved then.

For me the most important thing is to ensure there is a foundation for a solid relationship. This revolves around finding a life partner and not a sex partner. But I am on dating sites to actually date guys and not to make friends. In fact it really bothers me when guys are looking for friends first because what if I never make the jump to girlfriend? I want guys to think of me firstandforemost as a potential mate and not a friend. I do not want to hold hands hug kiss and have sex with my friends. I want guys to know that I am looking for an allin relationship but I am not going to jump from meeting them to their bed quickly. ,datingoverthirty,dgue82s,2,t5_34cyw
