7245137,0,t3_4en1f6,To be able to answer your questions more accurately what type of frame is it? If you arent sure do you have a photo?  I used to have an Aire Ocelot  foot longer than the Wildcat with a NRS Alley Cat fishing frame. Although I never tried it my frame would definitely have worked on larger tubes but not on a raft. Most cat frames have what are called yokestyle curved cross bars and foot mounts on the ends that fit snug around the curve of your tubes so if it is an adjustable one then yes you could use parts of your frame the side rails crossbars seat and oar mounts on a raft but you would need additional pieces. Again my experience is only with one type of cat set up so your frame may be very different. It sounds like a good deal you have in your sights especially with a trailer in the haul. I should add that cats are so much god damn fun. Although I used mine for up to  day multidays with a cooler drybox and  people they are pretty poor for hauling lots of gear and people that are used to the comfort of a raft at least...but I absolutely loved rowing it in whitewater. The Wildcat is probably even more fun than the Ocelot given the smaller size but you just cannot beat their maneuverability and stability in larger and more technical water. A quick tip that took me a few tries to figure out on my own you will need to really pay attention as to how you distribute your weight from front to back. Just like a kayak you need to position yourself and your gear so that the tubes are really sitting flat in the water or else you will notice a huge difference. If I was rowing alone for day trips I would always move my seat up a foot or so forward from center.Bonus my two favorite cataraft videosCats in GoreShelly Becker killing it in Idaho ,rafting,d21pxly,1,t5_2v5vv
