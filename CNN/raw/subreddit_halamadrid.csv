4269160,0,t3_39vj9x,I dont know what others see in Bale to think so highly of him.I like him but i am not sure he is good enough to build Madrids team around.Lets be honest hes no Messi or Ronaldo.Heck a good argument could be made that Neymar is better than him.Lets play him in a position so that the team as a whole plays well.No need to talk about Bale being the main man or building RMs team around him.For better or for worse RM payed a shitload of money to acquire him.And that preposterous transfer fee clouds peoples judgement and makes them feel that he is a better player than he is.And for all the talk about Bale being given a free role thats laughable at best.So because he was given a free role in Spurs and has one at Wales he should be given one at RM?Maybe he would play better but i dont think RM as a whole would improve greatly.James given free rein would work out much better IMO.

5578453,0,t1_cwojtkz,My last response to this. He does work when the situation is right. Up until Dec  the situation was right and Kroos was a monster. The problem is that since Dec  the situation hasnt been right due to injuries. Modric was out for much of the latter half of  season. And right now there is nobody else to play. There is no chance for alternatives because every alternative is injured. So you play Isco in Kroos position. Who do you get to play in Iscos position? Kovacic? Hes just coming off an injury and still very new to the team. Vazquez? Cheryshev? Neither of them can do that.The problem isnt Kroos and has never been. Its injuries. The  players that would play in Iscos position are both injured.,halamadrid,cwok4yu,1,t5_38i8b

7138966,0,t1_d1pm4te,Im not too sure about James but when Ive seen Isco hes impressed me. Individual player analysis isnt something that I focus on in all honesty I prefer to look at more collectivefocused aspects in a football match.However I think that an important factor is to accommodate Ronaldo more  he can individually be quite problematic in the collective attack as his movements are often one of the causes of these issues. Of course he is excellent at what he does but on a collective level he can be problematic. Not saying that he should be dropped but Zidane needs to incorporate him better into the team.The biggest solution though is to have more of a focus on creating connections around the ball which will then allow you to play the combinations and fast short passes which Zidane is wanting.,halamadrid,d1pmfwu,2,t5_38i8b

I honestly think Florentino will resist the urge to make a bid for Pogba. He doesnt like his agent Raiola and the extraordinary salary he would command means everyone else would also demand a raise. Florentino only goes for Galacticos who express a strong desire to play for us  in interviews or by handing a transfer request Bale Modric... to their clubs. Pogba hasnt done this. For the second year running we could have a summer with no major signings to speak of  just a few loan players returning. ,halamadrid,d41brrm,1,t5_38i8b

10795877,0,t1_ddskn37,Varane and Ramos should have been laying back a little bit farther but Navas should have really read Insignes positioning. As a goal keeper even if the player with the ball is  yards away you have to be constantly adjusting your positioning to try and cut off or cover the potential angles that the ball could have come from. In that situation Navas was stupid because Insigne is much more likely to strike the ball inwards towards the right side of the post but Navas was covering the near post as if A cross was coming from thats side.,halamadrid,ddting3,1,t5_38i8b

11639002,0,t1_dgf2agv,I think Asensio would be a braver choice than Isco taking into account maturity and context. I firmly believe Lucas will start to keep Ribery in line and since were the one going into the game as victors. If things go south we can sub in Isco or Asensio like last time.However Zidane himself acknowledged in the press conference that Isco hasnt played much in the CL this season just twice IIRC and said it just a coincidence which it is due to rotation etc. He just might start Isco due to the form he is in and to reward Isco for his recent performances or else there is a chance Isco might get frustrated thinking even his current form couldnt make him a viable option as a starter which I remember Isco publicly said annoyed him in Ancelottis second year with us.,halamadrid,dgfaliy,1,t5_38i8b
