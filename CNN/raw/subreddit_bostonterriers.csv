354886,0,t3_1y4851,You sound get a Boston. From all the comments Ive read it sounds like youre already ok with the cons of a Boston. They require no grooming.Theyre smart but stubborn. They fart snore and cant handle extreme heat bc of their noses. They can be hyper andor anxious dogs but good training and a strong attachment between you and the dog can address the most of that. Plus you have another dog for the Boston to work out its energy and anxiety with. They have anal gland problems but that can be fairly well controlled if you put a scoop of canned pumpkin not pie filing in their food and let them run around outside. If you do have the gland squeezed the vet can do it for fairly cheap. They have adorable ears and neck rolls.Get a Boston. Edit also they can sneeze inwards. Which is cool. ,bostonterriers,cfhju10,2,t5_2sduv
502688,0,t3_1yq8q1,I had the exception to the rule. My previous Boston hated women small children strangers and bigger dogs. Once he got to know you you were best friends forever but if you fell in one of those categories you and him were mortal enemies initially. He loved babies though. So go figure. My current Boston loves everything and everyone like they all do but man I still miss my last one. ,bostonterriers,cfxeqir,1,t5_2sduv
