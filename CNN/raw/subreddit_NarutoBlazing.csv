8827964,0,t1_d78y3fe,No the problem isnt that people dont know how to play. The problem is people dont understand difficulty levels. There is nothing at all in the game which teaches you how hard a  stam mission is. Yet theyre open to anyone from the get go. So any person who starts out the game with out having playing optc or something before. Its just another mission. No ideas of how hard or what level characters you need. So people on their first day can join you  stamina mission without knowing they literally just cant win.. The game does not teach this. Personally I have played dokkan and optc and I still joined a b class mist demon mission because story was easy.. But lost because its clearly harder than expected. ,NarutoBlazing,d78zyeo,3,t5_3fg4n

8898931,0,t3_524t09,One of the most common mistakes I see if people clustering their team up.  Keeping your units at max range when attacking flanking when possible and generally staying spread out will often result in the enemy just attacking a single unit of yours.  I know the game tempts you to cluster your units to get those field bonuses but they are often not worth it if it means your opponent will combo x attacks onto you in the next turn.  Especially if the enemy has a short range unit like Sasuke then there is no reason that you should allow that unit to ever hit two or more of your team at once.Also abuse the AI.  I use Gaara so I need to keep strong purple units like Zabuza off of him by parking some other unit of mine closer to Zabuza.  The AI generally goes for the closest enemy even if it means a type mismatch.Also healing is OP in PC.  Even passive heals like Sakura can add up to  extra HP over a match.,NarutoBlazing,d7hivhs,2,t5_3fg4n

8922483,0,t1_d7irssf,I agree completely with Kidomaru over Hinata though both are good depending on elemental matchups.  Kidomaru has an amazing attack not only the large area which is great but he hits several times per enemy which makes it so much easier to hit that  combo for bonus chakra.On top of that if you park Hinata on the boss to tank it she does that fine but she wont help you hit anyone other than the boss maybe.  Sticking Kidomaru near the boss still often gives him the opportunity to combo in for your other characters attacks which can add up to a lot of damage that Hinatas higher stats cant really make up.,NarutoBlazing,d7kco3u,1,t5_3fg4n

9389758,0,t1_d963pe8,I doubt Bundle characters will ever be available on Summons. If that were the case someone like me would simply just stop putting in money just to get these characters.Bundle characters are pretty much on the same terms as PC characters. Theyre exclusive characters. Those that put in the time work andor money to get them are the only ones that will and should get them. To ever make them come in a banner is a huge loss. Especially since Bundles are their most purchased things according to Itunes These are characters being brought for their exclusivity. Those that maxed their abilities will be the most ripped off since they had to buy  US worth of these characers. To make that character possible for everyone to obtain they wouldve been better off buying   packs or possibly not put in any money at all.Many also already know these characters arent really that good anyway.

I have used up  pearls on stamina and only got enough Haku crystals to get him to what hes out so tell me how skill determines what character crystals drop? ALL of my Raid characters are fully Limit Brokennot max level but fully Limit Broken aside from Courage Kakashi who i have the crystals and scrolls for ice just been focusing on other cards ATM. I got Naruto to where he was at and stopped so I could focus on other cards since his attack was already at a decent spot. His crystals wouldnt drop and so I stopped its that simple.Ive gotten every single mission complete every special Pearl mission complete I havent really spent a whole lot of time on Limit Breaking because I didnt want to deal with the crap drops. And I literally just pulled Zabuza and Skill Kakashi so of course theyre not maxed.  And what do you have? Huh? Do you even have more than  maxed Limit Break card or are you just talking out of your ass and using someone elses profile as your example? Pathetic honestly,NarutoBlazing,d9p8597,2,t5_3fg4n
9560208,0,t1_d9rgamg,Ive been playing since day one  I know  the strategies and havent wasted a pearl in anything but the S rank HashiTobirama raid. You want to question my  inexperience go right ahead. Not all raids have to be dealt with fast with just damage hitters. Ive seen people use their jutsu  when not required just to get rid of  units and then we get hit with a spawn of  units. Well what happens then? These idiots have their characters so close with no chakra left and end up wasting a pearl. If you want to go all out then go right ahead  there are raids that require units to be taken out quickly  I understand that just know that the direction this game is taking is going to make raids much harder its not all about the damage. If you want to take this the wrong way then thats your problem  Im not even going to insult anyone on here. Everyone has their own strategies. And for the record last I checked Sakura and Gaara are useful in many situations  youre just looking at the damage numbers like the majority of this games player base. ,NarutoBlazing,d9rhpxq,2,t5_3fg4n

9581704,0,t3_5c5deu,I think its just the player base getting too greedy.    Most gacha games are like that. The main point of gacha games is to keep pulling for new cardscharactersunits. And this is how gacha game makers earn money. Sure the pearls may be pricey but you dont have to buy them to get good.    Basically going fp on a gacha game means you need to learn control. I see so many fp players pulling everything and in the end end up with nothing then start whining how the game isnt good to fp players. The thing is you were given so many gems right from the start. You simply do not pull on every single banner. Knowing when and how to spend your pearls is important. I dont think the rates are bad. They do seem slightly lower than Jap no proof gut feeling but even  isnt too bad. I have experienced gacha with worse rates. The fp characters the game provides are good enough to get by game content get your hands on all the farmable characters in the game. Also the game actually makes it easy for rerollers. You can constantly reroll till you get something you want to build a team around easily.  Indeed the game can do more to make the fp experience better. But dont forget this is a profit company were talking about. Im fp Im fine with my experience so far. Dont see why people not targeting at you OP make such a big fuss out of this fppp thing when theyre just bad with selfcontrol.,NarutoBlazing,d9u52rk,1,t5_3fg4n

Nejis aoe may not be more powerful than sasori but it can also immobile units for an extra turn which compensates for the damage while also doing great damage with his secret and a chance to seal. Tsunades heals are great utility and can be essential for survival in some raids. Hiruzen is basically a guaranteed seal zabuza does amazing damage and heals. Sasori just pumps out damage without doing anything else for the team.

9874554,0,t1_daun5h0,Not every FP is as lucky as you WHICH IS WHY you save and wait for guaranteed banners and dont blow  pearls on a multi summon every time a new character comes out. The key word here is patience. On top of that theyve been giving  characters left and right with more sure to come and while they arent as great as the gacha characters they are definitely viable. I have nine  characters. Three of them are free units. So really Ive pulled  eight if you count the two duplicates I got. Im content with what I have. Im not greedy and try to get every character because I know how these games work and Ill just dig myself into a sad pearless hole. You dont need every new character to get by andor enjoy the game.Of course FP players dont have the luxury of buying more pearls. Thats kind of the point. As someone who hasnt lost anything though theres no real right to complain. Id say a paying player has more of a right to complain because they lost real money but thats their problem. I dont sympathize with anyone who wastes their pearls and complains about their bad luck. Actually I dont sympathize with anyone who complains about it. Its RNG. Luck based. Sometimes it doesnt feel fair. Boohoo. Lifes not fair. Thats just how it goes. You dont buy a lottery ticket and get pissed off because you didnt win and then say These odds are fucking trash. This is stupid what a ripoff. They need to make the odds better.Thats not how it works. Its a gamble. Its a risk. Win some lose some and I just dont understand why some people fail to realize that. This games real objective is to get you to spend money. Thats the business theyre running lol. They can only give us so much for free. Give away too much and fewer people will have a reason to spend money. I do agree that the login bonuses are absolute garbage but other than that I dont have an issue with this game. Of the few gacha games Ive played I think this is the second most FP friendly one behind Bleach Brave Souls. Havent played OPTC but I do hear people always saying its pretty FP friendly. ,NarutoBlazing,dauoenb,1,t5_3fg4n

Then start grabbing the rest of those story pearls. Getting a  luck character is also essential for being successful in the game. It will really help with your grind.

Some characters have a field heal that will be good for stalling and there are a lot of  dodge characters that are very useful as well. These can all be farmed from story mode. Oboro and Raido are  perfect dodgers that I find useful. Check the story mode drop locations in the side bar for them.Ramen A cups give you a great amount of XP if you wanna level up your ninja rank and get more team cost.

10238908,0,t3_5mm06o,One good thing about Jiraiya is that people have stopped dickriding Neji so much. Seriously that shit got annoying as hell.Anyway I dont see whats wrong with having both Minato and Jiraiya be in SS tier. One is the best support unit in the game and the other is the best long range unit in the game. Jiraiya can stall heal and immobilise but Minato is a very safe unit and can provide some support from almost anywhere on the map whether it be through his combination damage or field skill. He also hits like a truck both with his regular jutsu and secret technique both of which have a low chakra cost. So if you ever find yourself facing an enemy unit whos about to use their jutsu the more preferable approach is to hit him with Minatos regular jutsu. While Jiraiya can immobilise his jutsu costs more is best used against mobs and still doesnt have a  chance of immobilisation. And despite Minato no longer being the ultimate damage dealer in the game he still has an extremely hard hitting secret technique that you can land from nearly anywhere on the map.tldr Both Jiraiya and Minato have their uses and both are very good units who I think should share the SS tier.,NarutoBlazing,dc4mym3,4,t5_3fg4n

10536060,0,t1_dd2c71z,the HP loss is negligible the damage lost is not.  HP when talking about the likes of ish damages in S rank missions is what makes the difference between getting hit by a perimeter barrier that will deal  damages in total roughly. Depending on how many members get hit ofc or not.You seem to misunderstand  Im a HUGE defender of T Naruto and was one of the people who said he was going to be a huge improvment for BOD types and easily a mustto LBunit. Still your statement remains wrong. This Naruto doesnt make Sasori a useless unit at all both have their advantages Sasori has slip damages less chakra use and more damages on his normal jutsu Naruto has more range more jutsusecret range and more damage on his ult and their drawbacks. on neutral element there will be times when you need more damages rather than range then you pick Sasori and some other times when you need range over damages then you pick Naruto.also Im sorry but if you call people who deny a false fact youre stating butthurt people then youre just closeminded on top of being stupid.Edit  oh and btw I didnt downvote you if its what youre thinking.

Im pretty good at saving up pearls so I figured that if I save up at least  fp style and then buy some I can get at least a couple good six stars to work on. This was way before a lot of the major updates. I save up about  pearls .....nothing. Prolly about  shizunes  konohamarus and enough copies of kibas mom to make another clan. Didnt think anything of it though I understand these games . So I saved up again around this time when I got to about  pearls the new shippuden banners where out and they were Releasing the new naruto and sasuke and all that. Even with increased rates ....nothing!!! No six star ninjas at all!!!! I finally gave up and focused on the free characters  but EVERYBODY HAS THEM!!! Even my friends have said my luck sucks and that they have had way better luck than me with this game... hope this helps!! ,NarutoBlazing,dd774it,-1,t5_3fg4n

As well as explained the good and bad about rates in general in this game. A very wellinformed comment I deleted it as soon as possible cause I know how you guys will react.This is the most I can say on this side of the community that I call the toxic side since I have a differing opinion from yours. Since I know from this point my opinion even if based upon facts wont matter in this side. Itll jist be ignored or downvoted like trash.

Imo Hashirama is a better unit to spend resources on in order to max LB compared to Tobirama because his strength goes up to  I believe when you include his dupe abilities. Tobirama on the other hand is the opposite with a lot of health idr the number but its really high with dupe abilities. In this game health doesnt matter as much as strength does because you can easily stall and heal to get it back so to sum this all up Max LB Hashirama if you dont have time for both. Personally I can do both but Im not gonna waste my time on Tobirama.,NarutoBlazing,denmxms,1,t5_3fg4n

11241117,0,t1_df64hpg,There are  raid units that are very useful eggaaratayuyaeven jugowith his barrier break ultimate which is kinda unique I see your point but I dont think it is possible to make every raid character a great character.and I dont think they should make raid characters too good because they are so easy to farm even for new players. people just underestimate raid characters.EVERY RAID CHARACTER HAS A PURPOSE.for egsuigetsu got shat on by everyone. Ill tell you how he is useful for a new player .suppose you just started during the kirin sasuke banner and if you want to farm itachi so you are going to need a  luck lead to do the itachi impact.suigetsu has high HPkinda and low attack but his ultimate gives him a perfect dodge so for itachi impact you just bring him as your luck lead and just use him every time  his ultimate is ready dodge itachis jutsustaking no neutral damage at all plus his field skill is reduce damage and personally I love damage reduction skills because no matter what the raid they are always useful and then switch back to kirin sasuke therefore taking no extra damage he is kinda perfect for the raid for new players.if you are high leveled then obviously you are going to have better  luck leads so raid characters are not always going to be useful for you,NarutoBlazing,df65x7d,1,t5_3fg4n

Not up to  on WIS Kabuto but maybe a  point increase.But looking at someone like Bundle Sakura whose field heal is actually worse than more recent  star field healers. It would make sense for LB which seemed at least in the beginning who knows now to be a way to catch old characters up to the power creep a bit to catch her up to more recent units in that regard.  Or similarly BOD Narutos  damage reduction buddy skill is woefully out of date and even bumping it up to  at max LB would be a great way to freshen that card up a bit.Chakra cost gets a bit iffy I could maybe see implementing a reduced chakra cost via LB on a handful of cards looking at you BRV Gaara but certainly not making it a normal thing.,NarutoBlazing,dfd6ugn,1,t5_3fg4n

Sasuke is a short range with great attack and HP cheap and usefull aoe jutsu that generate chakra  BUT with an almost useless ultimate.

11733401,0,t1_dgq0aff,Except that Naruto only has damage. Pain has much more HP push back and can pull enemies to himself with his ult first unit to do so. For one more chakra and with much more utility is he worse? I dont think so. Why do you people care that much about stats? Pain will deal much more damage in combination attacks because he has  of those abilities so his attack stat isnt that low. You really need to look at the full picture instead of focusing only on stats,NarutoBlazing,dgq0ejr,8,t5_3fg4n

11742435,0,t1_dgqor83,I also got Temari. Did you get chunin exam green Temari? Also yes I dont know what green units are called because Im not obsessed with this game anymore. ,NarutoBlazing,dgr19m2,1,t5_3fg4n
11745513,0,t3_67lcss,Chakra cost really makes or breaks a unit only way to redeem a high chakra cost would be with a high multiplier or high attack which clearly this unit lacks like cmon  chakra for only .k damage? Thats horrible but what can you expect from a free unit. Even his stats are eh some EM have higher base stats than him. Still going to max LB him since i dont really mind but probably wont ever use him unless if i need that pull effect one day. If he had  chakra he would be good ,NarutoBlazing,dgrdtj7,1,t5_3fg4n
