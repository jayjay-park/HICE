497436,0,t1_cfro8ok,Hey sorry for the lateness of this but better late than never!  Id say about  of people speak English.  I find a lot that even if I try to speak German they still switch to English I think alot of people really want to practice their English and usually jump on the opportunity.  Youll run into people who dont speak English of course but its not an issue since they usually still speak a little bit.  With you speaking a little German and them speaking a little English it generally works out.As far as culture goes people are a bit colder than Americans.  You wont find many who will want to talk and conversations are usually at a minimal with strangers.  This doesnt mean theyre not friendly though!  If you have a problem many are more than willing to help.  Thats the biggest one I think.  You should always stick to the rules and regulations though they get very upset when you dont! I cant say much about German schools but it think others covered it pretty well.I find that I dont really miss America too much.  The things I miss most are probably american foods like Fritos and root beer haha.  I do miss the opportunity to drive when youre   here but its not really necessary with all the public transport. On the train right now actually.  And I also sometimes miss not thinking and having everyone speak English all the time its just easier.Bavarian festivals are great and Germans love their holidays.  Youll find there are a lot of days off school and a lot of festivals throughout the year.  Theyre fun e.g. oktoberfest go with a few friends get really drunk and have a great time.  Its not all its made out to be though.  Long lines to get and its really really crowded.  If you dont end up going or something youre really not missing much.,Munich,cfwt8uv,1,t5_2s6s2

2745269,0,t3_2rfz5f,My internet provider experience so far here as someone who also works from home sometimes  Mnet  Fast in some areas due to fiber.  In others areas they can provide DSL with  compared to other DSL providers  slow upload speeds.  You will get a DualStackLite connection no public IPv and you must use their provided router.  Speed is stable I always got the same bandwidth.  KabelDeutschland  Not available everywhere depends on the specific house.  Connection is fast but shared medium. Sometimes you get advertised speed sometimes not.  Their contract includes a clause that allows them to throttle you after GBday filesharing usage currently enforced at GBday.  You initially get DualStackLite connection but can change it yourself in their portal to a public IPv line again but no IPv then.  You have to use their modem and they charge extra per month if you want to enable the WiFi function on it.  You can of course attach your own access point to it to avoid that.When I needed support both providers were equally bad. ,Munich,cng4ipu,2,t5_2s6s2

8060599,0,t3_4plro9,gt In the event of me finding a beautiful fraulein entirely possible because I am quite a catch and moving there full time can anyone recommend a place to live? Id like to live around the Oktoberfest so I am prepared for next year.  bedrooms if possible and not a share flat. My budget is around  euro a month. PM me your apartment offers.     Bedrooms ? Youre trolling right? In that area you will pay about twice that for a  room appartment if you want  BEDrooms you will have to look somewhere near kmo.,Munich,d4m34zk,1,t5_2s6s2

8666335,0,t3_4ylkeu,I work at Munich Airport. Its rather efficient.  The thing is that since  many but not all flights departing to the US may require a second security screening which takes additional time.To arrive at the airport three hours early is actually a pretty good guess. In your case thatll be a.m.  You should have no issue finding a train SBahn to the airport arriving at that time. There are two lines serving the airport every  minutes each. Try to find a connection on www.db.de or www.mvgmobil.de,Munich,d6owt8h,4,t5_2s6s2

Make sure you keep a record of everything in case you get screwed over.The fact that he responded is a good sign. Id say just try to meet him enjoy the game regardless and have a good time.

9073657,0,t3_54k5y8,I never heard of applicant days like they have in the US. If you want to apply... you just apply uni like LMU or TUM dont really need to promote themselves much.  You can easily just wander around the campus though on any normal study day during the semester. If you really want a tour you can probably tag along to an erasmus group at the start of a semester for some sort of tour thing. LMU and TUM central campus are in the middle of the city more or less and are pretty standard and unexciting IMO... TUM has some remote campus like Garching and Weihenstephan which are also pretty typical. You wont ever see crazy campus with insane infrastructure in DE like you will in the US... the budget is not so ridiculous here.  The deadlines for application depends on the programdepartment. For a PHD it is probably less set and more up to the chair head if they simply have an opening or not. For normal degrees like MS or whatever most programs start Oct and the deadline is anywhere from feb. to july. You wont hear back from these programs fast usually... often people dont know until  or  weeks before the program starts my case. Probably different for a phd.    I would just call or email the proffesor or chair you are interested in doing your PHD and see from there.,Munich,d82i8r4,7,t5_2s6s2

There are several very nice thermal baths around Munich the biggest one is Therme Erding which has many different hot tubs and mineral baths. I also heard Bad Tlz is nice it is only an hour by train.
