1117017,0,t3_26ww0e,Very cool any pictures of the bare sculpt? How much of the detail was added afterwards in Photoshop?My only critique is that the scale texture you applied seems to tile quite a lot in some areas and that tiling doesnt follow the curves of the model which makes it a bit obvious that it was applied later in Photoshop. Also the ridge on the tip of the nose reads as though its not where Im guessing its supposed to be in the middle of the face my guess is thats a shading issue.Overall though awesome color awesome light and shade and a really cool design! I also really like the background especially the bokeh and smoke effects on the topright corner!,ImaginaryDragons,chv9jif,2,t5_2xz43
