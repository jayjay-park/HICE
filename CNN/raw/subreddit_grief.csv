3274734,0,t3_2xm8ij,When my mom lost her mom she said that sometimes she would dream about things like hanging out the laundry and she would wake up and everything would seem so real and she would wake up and be so sad.  On the other hand I dreamed about my dad this week.  He thought I was trying to kill him.  I have weird dreams.  It does make a certain amount of sense though because there were some cognitive issues going on toward the end.  It wasnt that upsetting to me.  More...darkly funny if that makes sense?Time is a really hard thing.  My dad died about a year and a half ago and it seems like I dont really have an accurate perception of time.  Its like it happened ages ago but then when I look back on it Im surprised at how much time has passed.Surreal seems like a good way to describe it.  After it happened I was just so confused about the situation.  On an intellectual level I understood it.  But I just couldnt wrap my mind around the series of events that led to me being someone with a dead parent.Dont feel like youre posting too often though.  Youve been through a very difficult experience and you deserve to do anything that brings you comfort.,grief,cp1jotk,1,t5_2s369
3941873,0,t3_35id65,This was my first mothers day since my mom passed.  I never realized just how much I am still affected by it then yesterday.  A lot of sadness and anger and negative emotions were with me yesterday.  Facebook reddit TV radio everywhere i turned was a constant reminder that shes gone and not coming back.I still cannot visit her grave without choking up and breaking down.  I really REALLY wish I could handle being there.  I feel like an asshole when i can only stay for a minute before I have to walk away.,grief,cr5lvdd,2,t5_2s369

5475495,0,t3_3q1pnx,Im so sorry for your loss.  I can relate.  I lost my Dad in February my Mom in June and my wife in July.  Mom and Dad were kind of expected but my wife was not pulmonary embolism.  Many people offer support and mean well.  Many will say inappropriate things and inadvertently hurt you.  Grieving is a process and it takes time.  Im just now starting to feel somewhat like myself but there are moments when you hear a song or see something that will bring it all rushing back.  Im guessing the holidays will be the worst.  This is the best description Ive seen of the process so far.  It has been floating around for a while and supposedly was a response to someone saying that they had just lost a friend.  It brought me some comfort when things were bad.  When things are good hold on to that feeling because another wave may be coming.  Hang in there my friend and shoot me a pm if you need to talk.  From the internetIm old. What that means is that Ive survived so far and a lot of people Ive known and loved did not.Ive lost friends best friends acquaintances coworkers grandparents mom relatives teachers mentors students neighbors and a host of other folks. I have no children and I cant imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But heres my two cents...I wish I could say you get used to people dying. But I never did. I dont want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies no matter the circumstances. But I dont want it to not matter. I dont want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep so was the love. So be it.Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut or even gouged and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who cant see.As for grief youll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked youre drowning with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe its some physical thing. Maybe its a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe its a person who is also floating. For a while all you can do is float. Stay alive.In the beginning the waves are  feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come  seconds apart and dont even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while maybe weeks maybe months youll find the waves are still  feet tall but they come further apart. When they come they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between you can breathe you can function. You never know whats going to trigger the grief. It might be a song a picture a street intersection the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves there is life.Somewhere down the line and its different for everybody you find that the waves are only  feet tall. Or  feet tall. And while they still come they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary a birthday or Christmas or landing at OHare. You can see it coming for the most part and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you you know that somehow you will again come out the other side. Soaking wet sputtering still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage but youll come out.Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming and somehow you dont really want them to. But you learn that youll survive them. And other waves will come. And youll survive them too.If youre lucky youll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. ,grief,cwbjnkt,2,t5_2s369
5942398,0,t1_cxyeuss,Thank you for your response. I agree that I think our age has a lot to do with my grief growing up we were inseparable and to have my mom frantically wake me up on a Saturday morning to tell me he is dead and I couldnt believe it until I ran into his room to see him there. So that image still burns my mind. ,grief,cxyktvb,2,t5_2s369
9519482,0,t3_5b6b8s,Instant tears when I read your post  my heart aches for a perfect stranger as I am jolted back to the first couple of months after my dads death  years ago. It is tough. I want to place a little hope in your heart that it stops hurting but it doesnt. You will feel that ache for years to come I still do.  Tears still sting my eyes when he comes to mind and Im uncertain which stage of grief Im experiencing when I realize the finality and the fact that I will continue living my life without him and I cannot grasp the harsh fact that I have no other choice.  Its a time of personal growth as well even if you cannot see it now.  Ive gotten to a point of being grateful for the immense love and mentorship that I know no other human being will ever provide and a lot will never have the privilege of having.  It took time to uncover that silver lining and thankfully those blessings take the edge off the pain. You will reach this point dont rush it dont place time limits on healing cry through the yearning of hearing his voice smile when the good memories come and realize while enduring this mass of emotions that you are learning to live your life with a major factor missing. Its normal to feel the way you do  chin up and know hes watching over you. Grieve the way that makes your heart and mind content. Im very sorry for your loss and Im here if you need an ear .... honestly talking about my dad helped me the most in coming to terms with his death and saying what I felt out loud somehow helped me realize that its ok to be a jumbled mess and as time went on I felt small progress towards a sense of normalcy after my world was rocked.  Huge hugs and prayers for you.,grief,d9mh921,4,t5_2s369
