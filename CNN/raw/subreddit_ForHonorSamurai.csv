I have been a long time lurker in the main subreddit but have only just found this sub and plan on being heavily involved in the future. I cant provide proof of how long I have been a samurai but I can provide proof of my loyalty. I was a soldier for rmetalgearpatriots for a long time and served their cause to the best of my ability. I have chosen samurai as my faction and I will never leave I will show the same dedication and loyalty as I did to the patriots. I can bring knowledge of game mechanics and I an willing to help anyone in this faction learn this game and its intricacies. Immediately Yes I am older than . Yes I plan on being very active and helping in whatever way I can. I will obey any and all orders regardless of whether I am successful in my application as a clan leader.

You as a warrior shouldnt position yourself to take that loss. Think about what youre doing as what can come from it. Focus too much on one aspect and you will get pwned,ForHonorSamurai,ddqvil0,3,t5_3iuix

While I appreciate that some people have their own code of honor going on if you expect me or any other random person in a public lobby to leave you alone while you duel with someone in Dominion mode... well prepare to be disappointed.
