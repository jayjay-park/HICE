For someone who wants to build up a collection of monsters thats a good deal but if the book had been split up and priced at  cents per page it would cost  for the entire collection.Either way its your company and your decision.

2344605,0,t3_2m6x7g,Smite is definitely the way to go for the flaming sword player. An alternative for the daggers could involve that player being a runecaster or an equivalent delayed spellcasting power source.Essentially the player has to spend time beforehand actually carving the rune into the dagger for the desired spell effect Blast for example. You could rule that the power points spent on the rune cannot be regenerated until the rune is activated this is how Alchemists work with their pp.If you wish to add an additional drawback to offset the spell damage  weapon damage in a single attack benefit you could possibly tack on a small attack modifier implying that the balance of the dagger is thrown off so it is therefore more difficult to aim or even have the runes casting consume the dagger thereby causing your player to not be chucking out grenadedaggers at every mook he sees.I dont know how complex or simple you want to make this but I would say Zadmars suggestion is probably best for a first run.

3352046,0,t3_2ybtkc,This is definitely a place where Fantasy Companion falls down.I think stealing an idea from Power Stunts from the Superpowers Companion may have some value here. This lets you use one power to replicate another at the cost of a Benny. That general idea could be applied to powers the spellcaster has. For example if a character has Summon Ally I would let them use it for an Unseen Servant type effect since were talking about replicating DampD magic to some extent. Tensers Floating Disk or Knock a modified casting of Telekinesis. Perhaps at the cost of a Benny or something just as Power Stunts does? Or requiring a raise on the roll? Or just a power point cost. I havent really thought it out completely. But I think its an idea that rewards player creativity and doesnt force them buy a crapload of powers that are of limited use with their valuable advances.It doesnt necessarily need a long list of utility spells if youre comfortable adjudicating it on the fly.,savageworlds,cpacwdm,2,t5_2rjj9

4933684,0,t3_3igk5e,The balance for mages vs warriors in SW isnt in armor or toughness but rather in Edges Strength Agility and Fighting skill.Being a mage sucks up Edges and skill points that a fighting type can use freely.The balance can be seen by looking at the question from the other direction Can a fighter cast spells? Yes the fighter can but it takes an Arcane Background edge and some skill points with the possible increase of the Smarts or Spirit skill depending on flavor of magic.So in respects to heavy nuker wearing heavy armour think about what it would take to make that possible in SW. It will require a heavy investment in Edges attributes and skill points. Arcane Background More Power Points high Smarts high Casting skill a decent Strength andor the Brawny Edge. Basically the player will have to optimize their character for both magic and armor. Not an easy balance. They will be weak in all sorts of other areas.Or when an enterprising player covers their character with enough armor to resemble a fireplug you get to laugh with evil glee when they discover their character has a speed of . And dont forget that the encumbrance penalty hits Agility... which reduces Parry.For illustration lets look at the standard fully armored knight in SW Plate Corselet  Plate Arms  Plate Leggings  Steel Helmet  Large Shield . Total  pounds  Just with armor alone the mage with a  d Strength base enc    more pounds of gear means this goes to  d Strength base enc    more pounds of gear to  d Strength base enc    pounds of gear to  d Strength base enc   d Strength Base enc  With Brawny edge requires d STR and d Vigor d not allowed d Str base enc    pounds until  d Str base enc     pounds until  d str base enc   d str base enc  A novice human character with  points of hindrances has  Edges. Arcane Background More Power Points and Brawny seems to give the best result. d Agil d Spirit d Smarts d Str d Vig Armored all to hell but still with a  penalty. Unshaking is going to be difficult. Low agil means they are probably easy to hit. Can take Brawny. d Agil d Spirit d smarts d str d vigarmored unshaking is easier but counts on armor to protect from wounds since soaking is more difficult. Low agility so still easy to hit. Cant take Brawny. d Agil d Spirit d Smarts d Str d Vig  Armored with no penalty but now a high casting skill costs more skill points since smarts is lower. They are still easy to hit with that low agility. Can take Brawny.The first spread is actually of better benefit to the PC since they cant afford all that armor anyway. If More Power points or Brawny were dropped and the player chose Rich instead then all the armor could be bought. But with the choice of the character at  enc with only a few pounds of gear until  or a good margin for  penalty and less power points. PC has Arcane Background Brawny Rich. For  spending and can afford all the armor PC has AB Brawny Power Points Not enough funds for all armor so just Plate Corselet.In either case unshaking is difficult with that spirit of d. No access to the interesting spiritbased Edges like Elan or Arcane Armor.Actually lets look at buying just a plate coreselet.  pounds so they will want a str of d. But that only gives Six pounds of gear until  enc. So brawny is still desired. If str is d they are at  enc but have  pounds until  enc. That might be worth it.In a lot of ways just taking brawny for the  toughness is worth more to the mage than the heavy armor. All that aside remember that SW is game of pulply cinematic action. The PCs are heroes. Wild Cards. Theyre exceptional. If a mage armors up let them. There is plenty of ways you can make their life miserable.I spent too much time thinking about this... Might be some mistakes up there actually probably are. I need more caffeine. ,savageworlds,cugfhta,8,t5_2rjj9

In fact thats actually mentioned in the general guidelines . Dont allow an Edge to turn an attribute into a dump stat.

7836479,0,t3_4mlzgl,Loot is one of the weaknesses of Savage Worlds as it doesnt really have a set of tables like DampD and other systems. You pretty much have to go with your gut feeling as to what is appropriate.This is mainly a result of Savage Worlds being a generic system that cant predict in any way what sort of game you are going to run.Also its not very good at giving you a variety of items to work with. Giving out a magical  sword is a much much bigger deal in Savage Worlds than in DampD. You have to be creative in giving magical or scifi items powers that dont include just x bonuses.Generally I try to be realistic with loot. A caveman might have a loin cloth club and if hes the tribes main warrior some cool and possibly valuable decorations like a head dress necklace of tiger teeth etc. For nonloot rewards such as rewards for completing a quest you just need to think about what is appropriate for your setting. Sometimes its easy. The players were hired to do XYZ thing and get paid . Other times its much harder. The players throw the magic ring into the volcano the Big Bad dies. Now what?In the case of the player with the Rich edge think in terms of what reallife rich people have. They dont just have money they have things like realestate and stocks and other assets. Tell the player a rich uncle just passed away and lawyers have contacted him to come collect his inheritance. You could have a whole sidemission in which the players are introduced to the Rich players family and sucked into a murder mystery.,savageworlds,d3wvyso,2,t5_2rjj9

9678832,0,t3_5d7rmc,So one of the mechanics I have been toying around with is the mechanic for drugs and addiction.  Drugs like Jet and Psycho are such a integral part of Fallout but I dont think the existing mechanic feels right for it.  The basic idea is that each drug has an addiction rating represented by a Die Type.  When you take the drug you make an opposed spirit roll against the Addiction Ratting.  If you pass the check you are fine but if you fail you have become addicted.  If you pass the roll but have to make another addiction check in the same scene you add a cumulative  modifier for every subsequent addiction check.  Once you have become addicted you no longer have to make an addiction roll.  After the drugs duration has elapsed you risk becoming fatigued if you do not feed the addiction.  If the character is in combat at the end of their Spirit die type in rounds they must start making a Vigor check every round.  If they pass the check they are fine this round.  If they pass it with a raise the are fine for once again for their Spirit die type in rounds.  If they fail the Vigor check they start needing a fix.  They immediately become Fatigued until they take another dose of drugs or pass another Vigor check.  Outside of combat the character must Make a Vigor Check every hour to resist the addiction.  Addiction can be cured by taking a dose of Curex or receiving a detox treatment from a doctor or clinic.In addition characters who take the Hindrance Habit Major suffer  to their Spirit Rolls to avoid addiction. ,savageworlds,da64bnn,2,t5_2rjj9

I find it much easier to create characters and homebrew settings are a breeze to create.The question about Wild Die mostly comes from confusion even though its straightforward to understand because its so different when I read it it felt like I wasnt understanding it properly. Its good to know that is how the system is meant to be played.I think we need to try different methods of Initiative Cards to speed it up  another user suggested players calling their cards rather than the GM to speed things up which sounds good. Combined with Wild Die combat should be sped up in terms of having more successful terms so hopefully this will be less frustrating.Another idea might be to have an application that automatically assigns card order without players physically drawing cards  I dont know how this would work but if after a few more sessions we still find Initiative Cards slow I might try this at least for my campaign.,savageworlds,dassipz,1,t5_2rjj9

For very specific rolls where I want it to be ambiguous Ill say something like Sure you can try that but itll be at a heavy penalty. I also roll my dice out in the open except for opposed rolls or the aforementioned ambiguous rolls.,savageworlds,dbom1n5,1,t5_2rjj9
