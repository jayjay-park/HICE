69061,0,t3_1twm5z,Okay lets see.If you look in your cupboard youll probably find several products with their symbol.This is good! Lets use that to estimate the number of kosher products produced.Lets say several means . Then theres  million people in the US. So say  million houses. So about  million kosher products in the US in peoples storage. The problem is that we dont know how often these products are renewed. Lets take a stab at once per month probably right for things like ketchup etc as in their example. This is the worst part of the estimation in order to work out how much ink we really need to know how many products are produced...So if theyre renewed once per month then we get    million   billion kosher products produced per year for the US. Note that Im also assuming here that all these products are produced in the US.Now we need to work out how much it costs to print that symbol. looks like its about mm x mm and maybe  filled in. Id estimate ink thickness as say  m  of the width of the average human hair.So then the volume of ink is mm x mm x  m .  .mmSo then the total volume of ink used is .mm   billion   million mm    cm   LitresNot that much!Now lets estimate that a litre of ink costs say .. So the total cost is   .  .Only  across the entire industry!The only part thats really really dodgy is the number of products produced. But even if were out by  orders of magnitude which means that the items on peoples shelves are replaced once every  hours it still only costs the industry . Still almost nothing.,estimation,cemaigv,3,t5_2uh0h
280565,0,t1_cf9forj,I might be able to offer a slight improvement upon this as a lower bound though it will rest upon a few shots in the dark but they are pretty safe shots I think.    Most estimates seem to agree that there have been around  million cubes solved in total the current official manufacturers claim  million but thats probably pushing it. If we assume the cubes are distributed equally the world over that puts around  million in the USA though the cubesperperson ratio is probably greater than global average in the US.    Some people might have bought more than one or bought a cube for someone else but again shooting in the dark I imagine that the magnitude of this factor is roughly balanced by the magnitude of people who can solve the cube but never actually bought one.    Assuming a ridiculously high proportion of people bought the cube but never bothered learning how to use the darn thing lets say a mere  of cubeowners can actually solve it. That gives us  million over  which is . Making another lowball assumption we could say that fully half the people who originally bought and could solve the cube are now either dead or have forgotten how to use it which finally leaves us with a very low bound of  people in other words .    Though I expect the true number of people is probably at least in the hundredthousands and therefore the true percentage is probably between . and .,estimation,cf9udem,3,t5_2uh0h
281328,0,t1_cf9wjp9,Yeah thats also an important consideration. Of all the cubes I own  are original straight out of the pack original Rubiks brand cubes and I have one more which is one of those old Rubiks DIYs from their website with the rest being CubeYou and other East Asian companies.I have no idea where youd find the numbers for this but it really depends on what OP wants to know how many Rubiks brand Rubiks Cubes there are or how many there are including the variants made by other companies.I imagine the latter would also have to include those horribly godawful tiled dollar store puzzles that break at the slightest attempt to perform a quarter turn.

868990,0,t3_242j1t,You could easily get into the hundreds of thousands just by adding a couple of thousand from each country. Considering Slovakia has over m users you should be able to get at least a thousand out of there and several thousand out of US and UK.

3768026,0,t3_33jqs9,Theatre lighting tech here. The projectors used in theatre and concerts start around  lumens and those are in dark spaces onto reflective surfaces generally. For the Super Bowl there were  projectors each putting out  lumens over  million lumens all together. These projectors can get very powerful.To project onto a building well depending on the size of the surface you want to project onto its materials and the lighting conditions it can vary. Projecting a movie or video game onto the side of a house you could likely use a single  to  lumen projector. For a large building youd likely use many projectors around  lumens each and pixel mapping so they form one seamless image.,estimation,cqls6w3,9,t5_2uh0h
