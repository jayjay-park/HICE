7330875,0,t1_d2bd20d,Are you kidding??? Share away!!! Im super jealous but I can at least live vicariously through your stories!Its one of those things where you or at least I dont really know how youll react until youre reacting and at Carnivores he got down off the stage and came over to the guardrail where my brother and I were like two people away from standing against the guardrail and as he came over my kneejerk reaction was to plunge through people in the OPPOSITE direction and to start mildly hyperventilating. I dont know where the hell that came from.I gauge how insane I must have seemed by my brothers reaction because hes the kind of person who will laugh hysterically when you do something stupid or clumsy but he actually grabbed my shoulder and said Are you like okay? Do you want to go sit down somewhere? Like he was a legitimately freaked out.,BlaqkAudio,d2bgy7y,2,t5_3c1kf
7627974,0,t1_d38q1rq,I was there last night too and yeah it was so much fun. As great as it was watching Davey I really enjoyed seeing Jade dancing away behind the computers and stuff. I also thought Jade was pretty good at directing the crowd at times. Like if we werent quite sure what Davey wanted we could kind of look to Jade. lol I dunno if that makes sense.Charming Liars and Night Riots were great too. I had actually been pretty neutral about Charming Liars before the show. I liked their singles Burn and New Disorder but was a little indifferent to their other stuff but man they are really good live. Like they sound way better live than they do recorded which seems weird to me. Kiliyan was also super fun and really nice. Night Riots sounded great had a lot of good energy and were really good at getting the audience involved. Travis was so charismatic and it really seemed like they were all having a ton of fun. Overall it was a great show and Im so glad they came to the Twin Cities.,BlaqkAudio,d399ctx,2,t5_3c1kf
