3139618,0,t1_coneew8,gtwhy arent you allowed?Worries about safety I guess. Its not like its a warzone out there but Im inexperienced with social life. You know the old tricks shady locals might use etc... When I do morning walks theyre not around the corner I usually go a little further. The last time I tried I was robbed by intimidation next to a city landmark no less... then again I probably couldve avoided that by being more confident. Its not like Im traumatized but ehhh... I wish I had a better social life. Going out at night with friends that is sounds fun despite that somewhat frightening mood that comes with it. Night is cool.,NoStrangersBar,conf2eo,3,t5_36crz
