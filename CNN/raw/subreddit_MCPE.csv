Generally used to express displeasure frustration or to curse someonesomething. This word has been around for almost  years and the definition therein is bound to change with time.

737719,0,t3_22lf0s,Heywill there be a good way to upload maps youve made like from ingame menu you tap Maps and then select either Download or Upload. Downloading them could be easy just tap the world you want to upload. Or other easy ways to do that kind of things? This would help mapmakers a lot.Also whenif redstone will be added will you make any special redstone stuff by a chance? It would be nice because we cant get all the current PC redstone elements in a while.Last but not least could you add any special features to the upcoming and existing biomes? Could you add cliffs to riversides on random places? Or cliffs to the coast line where the sea starts only to places where the ground is higher up from the sea level? Or something special to the biomes because I think MCPE should be adventure based because it cant get all the advanced hightech stuff.PS.

813176,0,t1_cgwktt9,Hmm... what you say would actually mean making the game somewhat pp because if anyone gets a packet about an unloaded chunk they need to journal the changes to be applied later when needed. I can see the synchronization problems being really interesting P  However something much simpler is to keep the client unmodified and unticked chunks unloaded in server memory until the client actually ticks them the first time they are next to a ticked chunk they are normally scheduled for threaded loading. Hopefully this means that they are ready when the player starts ticking them.  Anyway chunks outside of any ticking area are only needed for the rendering.  It is indeed a good idea Ill look into it ,MCPE,cgwpn7b,4,t5_2tu23

Here are the results.Another computer in my house TRex off screen . fpsNvidia Shield Tablet TRex off screen  fpsAnother computer in my house your GLSL shader  fpsNvidia Shield Table your GLSL shader  fpsThe slightly lower than should be score for the computer with the GLSL shader is likely due to how bloated windows is. Anyway I believe your samsung galaxy s is thermal throttling and hard. Samsung devices have been know to thermal throttle source w.tomshardware.comreviewssamsunggalaxyssmartphone.html  and if you look at the GFXbench long term performance score a test that runs the TRex test on screen  times in a row and the score you see is the slowest run if the long term performance score is much lower than the TRex onscreen score your device is  thermal throttling the TRex onscreen score from . fps and the long term performance is . fps. That is a lot of thermal throttling. If you look at the iPhone  on Gfxbench the TRex onscreen scores and long term performance scores are nearly the same with just a . fps score between them indicating that the iPhone  does not have the same thermal throttling problem as the Samsung galaxy s.Edit This other PC is more powerful than the old PC I had that ran Minecraft at p at fps P.,MCPE,cpnbbsw,1,t5_2tu23

5817579,0,t3_3uuige,Red Stone can only go  blocks from the power source. I saw an alternate to a repeater that works well for extending the redstone signal past that  blocks. You use  blocks with a redstone lamp on the first block red stone dust on the top of the second block and a red stone lamp on the side of the second block. This will allow the signal to go farther than  blocks.

6679443,0,t1_d0a5fc6,I think theres kind of a major difference between DirectX  to  and  to . IIRC DirectX  had a good amount of improvements but in the end it wasnt really an important thing to support unless your game was using these top of the line graphic options. I dont believe there was a large difference performance wise between the two.DirectX  on the other hand is far more efficient than DirectX . Not to mention the fact that Im betting that a good amount of ports from the Xbox One are going to push DirectX  much like Quantum Break is now. Hell when it came down to it the big DirectX  game Halo  wasnt actually a DirectX  game at all but a DirectX  game that checked for DirectX . If I remember the situation correctly that is. It was the reason that crackers were able to make it compatible with XP.,MCPE,d0a7ont,2,t5_2tu23

To get my rate up I probably still have to find more caves. I also noticed that the mobs are able to spawn way way more than  blocks away... have you noticed that as well?,MCPE,d0eso3d,2,t5_2tu23

9578983,0,t3_5c21bi,Quick Tip Win edition is special in that you can use Geometry shaders to change whole polygons or even add new polygons. Geometry shaders happen after the vertex shader but before the fragmentpixel shader so you may have to move some code from the vertex shader to the geometry shader inorder to take full advantage of it.By default MCW doesnt use geometry shaders to render terrain unless its running in VR mode to enable them you have to add this line to the terrainopaque object in the terrain.material filegeometryShader shadersrenderchunk.geometry Example ScreenshotOne trick I was playing with before was to subdivide each triangle into  smaller triangles in the geometry shader then do the wave function on each new triangle in the geometry shader. It helps smooth out the waves so there arent as many blatantly obvious creases though it will exponentially hurt performance depending on how many subdivisions there are. Fake specular highlighting like other shaders use also helps add detail and hide creases.Another neat trick you can do with geometry shaders is use them to calculate normal vectors. With that info you could apply the wave function only on water triangles that have a normal vector pointing straight up. That way you dont have wavy waterfalls which look odd.,MCPE,d9tt00l,4,t5_2tu23

I thought it would be easier to clear out the area for building my water elevator  shaft and then build them with glass so its easier to see and fix any issues. BAD MOVE. There is a bug in Minecraft for years where you really want to leave the ORIGINAL BLOCKS in place as much as possible. As soon as you replace them the zombies have a tendency to get pushed into these new stones or completely PHASE out into the room with you. They wont attack its more like they are false images.. but its a pain. It also causes them to keep clogging up in various places because these PHASED zombies kinda exist inout of a block and cause the clogging..

10899281,0,t1_de3uhb1,MCPE uses internet connection to check update messages and local servers obviously it doesnt perform self updates no program can perform self update they all need launchers in most devices nowadays the launcher is the store but duh for you anyway.Oh noes you think Hockeyapp is a marketing company you are also an Antivaxer I bet!The best part about you being so wrong is paranoid is that you are extremely funny. This one is pricelessgt I manage my IOS account and privacy same as Im doing here. The difference is I can use an Iphone without Cloud or any reporting to Apple while Minecraft breaks down in crashes if you try.LMAO. Yeah keep up the good job pretty sure Apple has NO CLUE who you are specially because you think you pay for stuff on Apple store anonymously too?. Dont forget to cut your browser internet access TOO. ,MCPE,de46m4a,3,t5_2tu23

Plus the world stays private since you have to white list people for them to join the worldFor more detailed information Click here Sadly atm self hosted free server software isnt ready yet.

11341257,0,t3_61jcie,You dont really have many text formatting options within MCPE apart from the  modifiers and commands are also missing advanced data editing. The tellraw and scoreboard command are two other features Id also like added. Hopefully the .. releases add that  at least they should be in . which I expect to be out within this year,MCPE,dfhifn2,1,t5_2tu23

11526025,0,t1_dg1y0bo,Technically you can observer the piston heads location but you have to muck about with delays and locked repeaters and stuff. Your proposed solution is much cleaner!,MCPE,dg2h68r,1,t5_2tu23
11547922,0,t1_dg4xamc,Yeah I completely forgot to mention I used full screen mode and it doesnt minimise in windowed mode so if theres no way for full screen mode to stop minimising this is a compromise Im willing to take. Thanks ,MCPE,dg4yk00,1,t5_2tu23

11665144,0,t1_dghqhr4,Still your problem. World itself is not hostile at all if you compare it to anything else. If you just stand still without doing anything that would still be your and only your problem. And what do you even mean without decent protection? For a player who plays the game since .. beta it should take you  minutes at very most to make full iron set. Not to mention that shields are able to block  of incoming damage and they are cheap as hell.Seeing that you use mobs as a valid argument against this combat system you probably have no idea how and why the new combat system makes pvping and pveing more balanced...,MCPE,dgi9ca6,2,t5_2tu23

11760313,0,t1_dgsth3w,Wow fantastic thank you so much! It sounds like thats exactly what I was hoping to find. For the life of me I couldnt figure out where to get a hold of the vanilla MC files  and there seems to be very little documentation online regarding the PEW editions either since the Java version has so much more of a following.Once I figure out how to gain permissions to view the WindowsApps folder currently Im denied permission when I click continue to permanently get access to this folder I will definitely give this a shot!EDIT Figured out the permission issues I was having using the command line and managed to replace the portion of the .json file you mentioned following your directions. It worked like a charm!! Im amazed you knew how to do that without any documentation out there thank you so much for your help.,MCPE,dgt27nm,1,t5_2tu23
