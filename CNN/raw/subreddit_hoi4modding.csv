This way you could just set all the piercingarmor parameters in defines to  and start over by yourself.,hoi4modding,d6ylvf7,1,t5_3fxi5

10877891,0,t1_de1r5v8,Victoria II uses edicts like in Stellaris or now EU. You can select a couple of provinces to influence with your foci. I have a feeling theyll find someway of shoving edicts into Hoi too considering CKs advisers are pretty similar.The other main way to influence is choosing to invest money in programs like education or military to encourage pops to move to certain jobs. Pops job mobility is based on a myriad of factors like how many goods people were consuming. Population consume resources and depending on their job produce other ones or are used for country modifiers. The main way in my mod idea is three law types military economic and domestic. You may have Recruit Volunteers which will raise military popularity by . as your economic you have Promote Corporatism increasing Commercial population drift and giving  to resource extraction. Its kinda of like having New World Order laws that have political adviser drift. I do want to have some events and such in the mod like famines if you dont have enough farmers or worker strikes. ,hoi4modding,de1z6td,1,t5_3fxi5

10961379,0,t1_de9n6f3,Ill consider it. However after unsuccessfully fidgeting with the frontendgamesetupview.gui file I think I found a somehow better way to describe my problem. I forgot atm since which patch it was the case but in the games newer versions you also have smaller leader portraits in the selection menu at the bottom left as the following picture displays with Lord Linlithgow.In line  I think you have this entry.        iconType          name  minorcountryleader        quadTextureSprite GFXleaderunknown        position   x   y           scale.        rotation.        My goal is to have minorcountryleader display a different picture for a character than the one youll see in the other ingame menus.,hoi4modding,deal7d1,1,t5_3fxi5
