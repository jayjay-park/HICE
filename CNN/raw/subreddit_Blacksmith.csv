1703072,0,t3_2dwcca,Obviously a shelter is going to extend the life of an outdoor forge but it is not always mandatory.  A coal forge can often survive outdoors decently well.My initial forge had no welds.  I did weld my hood but I didnt have to and a hood is not even required to run a forge outdoors.  My forge is basically a commercial firepot from Centaur Forge dropped into hole cut in a cheap steel cart from harbor freight.  The firepot has a rim that prevents it from falling through and it is just held in place by gravity.You can build an airtight hood and smokestack by building or buying a cheap pressbreak to bend rightangles on sheet steel and screw or poprivet everything together.  hightemp silicone can be used to seal everything up and high temp paint will keep things from rusting.If you have a few thousand to spend it makes things much easier.  This is the route I took.  The first thing you really want to do is find your local blacksmithing club and sign up for a beginner course.  It is a tremendous help.Another option for building a forge would be to make it from brick and clay.  If you put a few inches of woodash compacted tight over brick it will withstand the heat from a forge.  You dont want this ash to get waterlogged so when the forge is cool you can just cover it with a tarp to keep heavy rains off of it.As far as getting started info theres a decent bit to point you in the right direction in the FAQ on the sidebar.,Blacksmith,cjtu1uw,2,t5_2r2f0

1801461,0,t3_2f5wsg,That looks pretty inefficient for fuel. That huge door would let out most of your heat and for small stuff you dont need a huge door. Quality forges with large doors typically have a fairly large lip around the door to help mitigate the flow of heat out of the forge. This one looks like it would rely entirely on the flame blowing directly on the part. Also theres no insulation on the bottom. Hard firebricks are for withstanding high heat but act as a heat sink rather than an insulator. In short I would not buy this one. Edit Heres one that looks like it should work a little better. Its also cheaper. The only issues are that the door area isnt insulated and theres no door to close the back. It should work for most small work and its perfect for bladesmithing.,Blacksmith,ck688t1,3,t5_2r2f0

He agreed and then asked if I wanted to start learning from him on a regular basis as a class! I pretty much instantly agreed. That was last week and today was my first day forging stuff. I got  horse shoes done I know the nail holes are a little messed up but I was practicing free handing it as opposed to measuring the distance and then I made  hoof picks as well.

2254951,0,t1_clqci2r,Yes well the problem with that approach is that actual mild steel will behave quite differently than rebar. It will move easier at the same heat and will not have as much tendency to crack at the corners like on your twist.  Rebar is real metal it is just not well suited to beginning blacksmiths.

2568377,0,t3_2p5kwr,In theory with enough time effort and raw materials you could do something like this.  In the meantime someone else could accomplish several hundred times as much by simply sorting and reusing the perfectly good steels in that pile.  I could make a dozen swords out of truck axles in the time you tried to figure out what things to add to a crucible of molten iron that you melt at tremendous expense in a nonindustrial culture and economy.  Given a big pile of scrap sorting and reusing is the first thing to do.  The next when high carbon steels run low is to use a technique called pattern welding to mix the hard highcarbon steels with the softer and more resiliant mild steels.  This creates a physical mixing of thin layers of harder and softer metals that support the harder and more brittle hard steel in softer and tougher mild steels.  You never melt things simply get things clean and hot enough that they stick together under hammering.  Plus the blades can form lovely patterns of contrasting metal.  As an example I made a very pretty dagger from a mixture of automobile valve springs and rusty barbed wire from an abandoned fence when I was first investigating that sort of work.    With that there is a type of steel made in small crucibles by hand.  But the resulting steel isnt poured into a mold its left to harden in the crucible broken out then forged into shape with heat and hammer.  Cast steel is an artifact of advanced technology.  Prior to that its built up and shaped by hammer and heat.,Blacksmith,cmttpj9,13,t5_2r2f0

In its current configuration it would be difficult to heat up anything other than the end of a bar of steel much like a lot of brake drum forges that neophytes here put together. On the up side it is an actual forge so it has a tuyere clinker breaker ash dump and a place to input air already there so it has a leg up on the vast majority of brake drum forges.

Burnt steel is tortured steel.Pay attention to what colors it goes through until you start to burn it and try to pull earlier each time. If you pull it and evaluate it quickly to be less than nearwelding heat you can put it back in. With a coal fire building a beehivetype is best for welding because you dont risk getting the weld dirty when returning the piece to the fire the fire has a larger reducing zone and there is more even and contained heat.If you use handoperated blowers instead of loud motordriven ones you can listen to the steel between blasts. It will hiss when it is ready.Also borax sort of makes a weird steamlike smoke when it is around a nearwelding heat.Another trick if you lack welding glass or didymium is to make a small pinhole to look through with your fist  by cutting out a lot of the glare the way a camera oscura works you can see the steel better in the firepot.,Blacksmith,coykyi8,2,t5_2r2f0

The loss of the feet itself doesnt matter as long as you can still mount it securely.  The harmonics business honestly sounds totally meaningless.  Sometimes a dull clunky anvil can indicate a hidden crack but the crack is the problem  not the noise it makes.If you have an all grey cast iron anvil anvil shaped object its going to break with use regardless of past damage.  My impression is that cast iron is not too dangerous when it breaks at least I have never heard of anyone getting injured by it.  Its not as strong as steel and breaks with less force so the bits that go flying have less energy.If you have a steel faced cast iron anvil Fisher Vulcan it will be prone to the same damage as any other steel faced anvil.

Remember that if you really need a  degree corner to forge on you should just make a separate tool since that sharp of an edge isnt to be expected of an anvil. Same goes for the tip of the horn it shouldnt be super sharp make a small coned hardie tool if you are actually forging something that delicate.

And the brake drum ones are only ok when you have enough room around the fire pot to build a large enough fuel pile. no reason to enclose a charcoal forge as the enclosed basin will just collect ash and fill up the reason there is a hole in the bottom is so the ash can fall thru. also you want to direct the smoke and soot away from your face an enclosed forge would direct it right at you and could cause co issues if you stood too close to the opening for too long. if anything you want a hood actively pulling the air away from the back of the forge to keep clear air flowing towards the front where you stand. not a huge issue in an outdoor forge but indoors it is very important to vent forcefully to the outdoors.,Blacksmith,crprd5g,1,t5_2r2f0

Its your first burn and wont be your last. When you see sparks coming off of your piece its burning. Its too hot. Just watch it more carefully. Dont just shove the piece in there and walk away. Keep it close to maybe even on if its an especially small piece the surface of the coals and watch it occasionally pulling it out to see. Is your forge outside? Judging temperature via color in an outside forge is useless so itll be a lot harder to know when your piece is burning. ,Blacksmith,ctzt8k6,1,t5_2r2f0

4904536,0,t1_cucor3m,Im no expert but I was taught this way Start by making square stock into octagonal then round. Learn to draw out the steel to a point both square and round. The technique for drawing and rounding lets you make a nifty fireplace poker or with a little work a on bending barbecue steak turner Practice bends and make twists and such. Once you can bend make a couple of hefty Ushapes from stock you rounded and you can lock them in the vise to bend curls. Lay the curls out in chalk as a reference on a concrete floor or on the unused end of the anvil. Try making slitting and hot cut chisels. Theyre simple and useful and next try making punches. The chisels and punches will get you a little into tempering and hardening. Now youve got enough technique and tools to make Quick Tongs there are a lot of variations these are easy.,Blacksmith,cucr5n6,1,t5_2r2f0

I worked for at least  years on a  lb. anvil and made and sold a lot of stuff with it.  I still use it today though I bought a new  lb. anvil in a different pattern which I use for the bulk of my work.You can get a brand new  lb. anvil for . plus a bunch of freight.  I bought the  lb. anvil from these guys but in the German patternI have been pretty happy with it.  I recently did an all day demo for an industrial arts teachers association and I had one of my students come along to help out.  I put him to work for the first time making nails and he worked on them for much of the day and only really got a few that were decently made.  Making nails is not a bad exercise but pretty difficult for a new student.  It teaches forging a point drawing out cutting off and upsetting but getting good consistent tapers and centered heads is quite difficult.  This particular student has quite a lot of potential and has taken at least a half dozen classes prior to this event.If you decide to follow your interest in blacksmithing and are able to secure a decent anvil and also decide to try to make nails here is a  really clever way to make a nail header courtesy of anvilfire.com.Scroll down until you find the instructions for header. ,Blacksmith,cw8stv4,1,t5_2r2f0

I actually dont remember any movies or shows that explicitly said they were stone molds but I guess he got stone molds from somewhere. I always assume sand molds were used.The other thing is I am fairly sure that in the Game of Throne scene starting at  seconds that is bronze being poured. The way the metal moves and the surface tension it just looks like a heavier metal than aluminum. I dont necessarily agree  with the color argument because when you try and film a bright objects especially in a dark environment odd things happen. These scenes are definitely color corrected which sort of changes the whole color argument.  Regardless that is not likely iron being poured in part again because iron when poured looks and acts different than aluminum or bronze or other metals.   Funny thing is if he is ranting about dumb metal working in game of thrones he should have brought up this scene  Nothing is remotely close to reality about anything in that scene.     ,Blacksmith,cx10bmp,3,t5_2r2f0

The high amount of carbon allows it to be a useful knife or tool. Just about any steel can be repurposed to another use the trick is knowing what kind of steel it is. Some mystery steel can be dangerous to use if you dont know the precise type and are using it for a high stress function but generally speaking its ok. Lots of people use railroad spikes for mild steel purposes they are plentiful. That said steel is pretty cheap in the US even new so lots go that route as well. ,Blacksmith,cxncnow,5,t5_2r2f0

Extra space is nice to have but its less important than having the full mass of the anvil participate in forging.

Its not your fault its the fault of producers and writers who cant be bothered to do just a little bit of basic research before depicting sword making in a film or TV show.Casting a sword in a form and then working it is the perfect way to guarantee you have a totally useless piece of junk that will break the second you try to actually use it.

7053967,0,t3_4c8a1a,I learned the proper and non proper way to belt sand a knife. For example start with a lower grit  and grind until it is only metal. No black impurities left on the blade. Then start going to higher grits  and start making your edge. Also dont forget to grind what will be your edge fairly well so you can get rid of the impurities there. If you have a higher grit around  use it to finish polishing but if you dont I dont know how to polish. For the non proper way way I did it the first time start with  grit and keep grinding and grinding without really getting anywhere. Never change the paper and wonder why it has stopped working. Finally change paper but forget to grind the edge area so your edge you worked on to be perfect you have to grind down because of all the impurities. Needless to say it was an aggravating time.

9515937,0,t1_d9ljern,A manifold is only necessary if you are going to separate your gas supply into two or more outputs.  At the least you need a gas rated ball valve for shut off purposes.  Once that is added you might want to consider an idler modification where the gas supply can be diverted around the valve with a smaller needle valve limiting the amount of gas that gets to the burner. You set that needle valve as low as your burner will accept and while still keeping burning.  That allows you to greatly reduce your gas consumption by turning off the ball valve routing the gas through the needle valve to idle your forge and keep it hot if you are not going to be using it for a few minutes.Here is an image showing what it looks like.  ImgurIn your case you obviously do not need a manifold.  If you have a regulator with a gauge you do not need a manifold gauge either.    ,Blacksmith,d9m1ivu,1,t5_2r2f0

10135693,0,t1_dbsgwl1,gt Well strictly looking at melting temps ... This is wrong.Specifically Glass is a strange material and the melting point temperature of it is a practically meaningless value except if you are intending to cast it.For uses where you are intending it to be a solid its not the melting point that determines the maximum service temperature but rather the glass transition temperature.  This is the point when it switched from being a rigid slid into a gooey mass with the viscosity constantly lowering until it reaches the melting point.The glass transition temperature of the conventional sodalime glass is  C.  This is below the melting point of aluminium C and certainly below the working temperature of liquid aluminium which will usually be around  C.A glass crucible will not be suitable.Even if it were it would crack when you took it out of the furnace  the differential cooling on the glass will impart strains resulting in stresses above the crack propagation stress.OP doesnt even being to understand the issues involved and instead of attempting to do so is asking random people how to do things.  For example he aught to have realised that asking about casting aluminium on a blacksmithing forum is the wrong place given that blacksmithing is about forging iron  a radically different sort of thing to casting any metal for one and aluminium behaves quite differently from iron for another.,Blacksmith,dbsoo3o,7,t5_2r2f0

10560249,0,t1_dd53jfl,Id suggest creating a private test sub and adding anyone you want to help with it.  Once theres something built you could let everyone see it and take input on changingrefining features.,Blacksmith,dd54gfd,2,t5_2r2f0
10572859,0,t1_dd6aptc,you mean that the spike would be then used to install the handle? Like a tomahawk rather than hatchet?,Blacksmith,dd6iaed,1,t5_2r2f0
10685013,0,t1_ddi22my,Yea the clean bits look great but I personally think removing the black would give a very nice looking knife. Probably one of the nicest looking posts on the sub that Ive seen in a while!,Blacksmith,ddi2u0r,4,t5_2r2f0
10711680,0,t1_ddkttr1,gt r then?gt an outcanal gouge wouldnt really work well for lathe use with no bevel to ride on.gt Um I think that you meant in cannel there? Or Im even more confused that I thought I was! Within that yes I see what you mean.Oops yes I meant an incanal gouge there.  The tangs kinda just formed that way so I went with it.  ,Blacksmith,ddktvi1,1,t5_2r2f0
10714710,0,t3_5szozj,If its just like a basic leaf then a cross peen will be fine.  You might need to grind it more blunt depending on how it currently is.  Lots are made with very small peens that will leave deep grooves but arent great for directional spreading of the metal which is what you want to do.Do you want a stem left attached and where?  Thatll mostly dictate how you go about it.,Blacksmith,ddl554d,1,t5_2r2f0
10747554,0,t3_5tlzrz,If he is trying turn a sword into an axe then that wouldnt be terribly easy. if he is wanting to make daggers out of swords then that would be relatively simple. If anything is enchanted I would do a percentile die with a fairly high chance of destroying the enchantment unless he has some sort of proficiency in forging magical weapons or enchanting,Blacksmith,ddoj106,2,t5_2r2f0

10813880,0,t3_5un10u,It leans a bit to one side and I dont know how good having that long of a handle is but otherwise beautiful knife. ,Blacksmith,ddvdj1z,16,t5_2r2f0
10843804,0,t3_5uz6lm,To be fair the game of thrones thing he is bitching about is valyrian steel which is a completely made up magical steel. So maybe you have to caste it?,Blacksmith,ddygnaw,15,t5_2r2f0
10851647,0,t3_5uz6lm,So I cant watch the vid because office worker. But cant you Cast a swordish shaped ingot and shape from a forge afterward?  Thinking about it it would make it straight without needing to draw out a straight object and risking making a semicircular sword. I understand the showsmovies etc have a lot wrong but isnt this inherently possible?,Blacksmith,ddz9r06,1,t5_2r2f0
10872532,0,t3_5v1rkt,The Paw paw thing is really more of an urban legend. If you look into the details he died days after the incident and he was in lousy health anyway.There arent any documented cases of longterm problems from inhaling zinc fumes. Your body is designed to handle zinc. Its other metals like cadmium and lead that you gotta worry about.The illness really really sucks to be sure. Ive given it to myself twice thanks to carelessness and I dont recommend it at all. But the Internet is frequently overcautious about it.Outdoors with a slight breeze is generally sufficient to avoid any problems at the forge welding is a little different since your head is right over the work while youre heating it. But yeah the suggestion of vinegar and a few hours is a good one. Hydrochloric acid aka muriatic acid does work and ive used it but I really hate keeping the stuff on hand its nasty to work with. It takes like a whole box of baking soda to neutralize just a few ounces of the stuff when youre finished.If your forge is outdoors burning it off is perfectly fine too. Stick it in the forge walk away let it smoke. When the smoking stops come back. Get rid of the zincoxide white flakes that remains with a wirebrush again outdoors. ,Blacksmith,de1fa8q,3,t5_2r2f0

11022192,0,t1_deh9hxm,Glad it helped! I use different sizes depending on what size stock Ive got. With most bending on an anvil horn or mandrels I use a rawhide or wooden mallets. Good luck! ,Blacksmith,dehc2wi,1,t5_2r2f0

11143503,0,t1_dev36uk,I dont think what I have asked is very vague the question is what is it really like. An answer something like its hot as shit hard long work for a result that might not be what you expected is a perfectly good answer that i would expect to be a real life situation. If you want to add more to that with things such as cost and other contributing factors then that would only make the answer better. Not trying to be a dick or anything just trying to explain myself. ,Blacksmith,dev3rr1,6,t5_2r2f0
11223469,0,t3_607wc6,Also posted to rbladesmith. Im having issues with the tracking on the belt. Theres still about mm of wobble on the belt while its running. It took me hours to get it that good thing just came flying off many times. Any chance there is a quick easy fix for something like that?,Blacksmith,df4600d,1,t5_2r2f0
11233399,0,t1_df53xjv,My mistake the middle seam made it look like it could have been drop forged and the process was becoming popular in that period. Ive seen much worse anvils in the  range going for  in southwestern Ontario but it depends on where you look.,Blacksmith,df5agxl,3,t5_2r2f0
11256773,0,t1_df7xf7z,well i can pull off the crank with that clamp on the tubing. we werent going to shred it down and really modify it at all structurally except to clean up the surface rust. We were just going to get another coupler and mate the tube where you can detach it with a new piece and then put an electric motor on the end of that...Also where would one get this clay? is it a special kind of clay?edit I think we have like  or  of these rivet forges of various sizes laying around the farm in barns and such. This one is in decent condition but actually one of the worse ones P,Blacksmith,df7xsbo,1,t5_2r2f0
11283924,0,t1_dfaer48,I reread that in the morning and it sounded a little harsh. Dont mean to imply youre not welcome. It is just that foundry work and blacksmithing are completely different technologies that use different equipment. I do a lot more foundry work than blacksmithing nothing wrong with that. Other than heating metal a foundry and forge are completely different designs to handle different temperatures and run for different lengths of time and handle ash. The people at rmetalfoundry will just have a lot more knowledge on the design and function of what you built in the picture.,Blacksmith,dfb0l5s,11,t5_2r2f0
11360976,0,t1_dfjf15n,From my own experiences forging copper and copper alloys and some input from other metalworkers and smiths in my area copper should be hot worked in the range of a black heat just before dull red to a very dull red for thicker stock and cold worked with lots of annealing for smaller pieces. if you get it bright red and hit it it usually just sort of breaks apart,Blacksmith,dfjquof,1,t5_2r2f0

11378040,0,t3_624ov5,Id start with the tried and true old propane tank and kaowool then work up from there.  Its going to be the right size and should only cost you  if you get the tank for free.  I havent made any but a  blade or finished piece sounds like its many many hours away however that depends on the person.Good luck,Blacksmith,dflok1x,2,t5_2r2f0
11381767,0,t1_dfm0lhz,Yea I have found forge welding takes a bit of practice. Thanks I am fairly pleased with how my recent welds have turned out.,Blacksmith,dfm3r9z,1,t5_2r2f0
11403166,0,t1_dfo6xsh,I wouldnt discount the usefulness of a hardy and pritchel. Youve also got much more useful mass with this anvil than RR track without turning it on end. Consider the fact that whatever RR track lying around is probably a lottery in terms of steel and if its anything where I live someones already prefucked it with an OA torch.  At the end of the day both are going to dent.  ,Blacksmith,dfoj95r,2,t5_2r2f0
11451564,0,t3_63gstz,Your coal mound is too small. Airflow is what dictates how much fuel is burned not the amount of coal. So pile it up! ,Blacksmith,dfu0xns,1,t5_2r2f0
11459571,0,t1_dfu7guu,You dont need shelter over your forge like the angry smithing wannabe raged over. The idea is that in direct sunlight you wont be able to see the color of your steel. Cant tell dark red from bright red from Orange in the sun. All it takes is a shadow to give enough darkness so see what you need. ,Blacksmith,dfuxnx4,3,t5_2r2f0
11534595,0,t1_dg35jnh,gtYou are quite thinskinned for being someone who spews out nothing but hate jealousy and narcissism towards the world. How is that working out for you now?Do you happen to know the meaning of the term selfawareness?,Blacksmith,dg3g5ta,0,t5_2r2f0
11619184,0,t3_65rbwp,More of a misconceptionthing beginner smiths dont realize that Ive noticed fairly often Conservation of volume. Steel doesnt compress and forging a bladesomething doesnt make it stronger because it packs steel into the edge. If you realize that the volume doesnt change not counting scale grinding etc. you can quite precisely calculate what stock you need to start with.,Blacksmith,dgd1n25,4,t5_2r2f0
11685060,0,t1_dgk2cd8,I use square stock for a more rustic nail or if the want a pyramid head if they want a round head Ill start with round stock. If im out of round stock Ill forge the shank from square then rough round octagonal  just the head portion before I set down. ,Blacksmith,dgkiox3,1,t5_2r2f0
11732703,0,t1_dgpfhaq,Most forge burners are around the mj.hr mark kg bottle has about mj or gas. so total burn time would be less than hours. Also less gas in the bottle easier it is for the bottle to freeze  less output.,Blacksmith,dgpxkam,3,t5_2r2f0
