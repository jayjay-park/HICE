7171264,0,t3_4d8j7g,I have not gone through Gearbit drops yet because Im uncertain if they always drop three apiece or just one at times. Theres also no way for me to verify where they are. On top of that Im not sure how attached they are to bosses as some normal enemies act as minibosses the bird mage in the North for example.Assuming I did get everything thats  Gearbits that drop from bosses and minibosses.  from the four main bosses.  from the four minibosses in the South. That leaves  that dropped from...somewhere? Which wouldnt make sense if every notable enemy dropped three on defeat. Main Bosses in would be  Gearbits. There are only  minibosses in the South so  there as well. Leaving  to spread between the normal and notable enemies which only ever drop .Do you have a count of how many enemies drop bits on a per area break down? I know how many bits total I got from each zone so it would save me from having to count up how many were boxes cause I doubt I missed an enemy drop.

When an attack is made the Drifter is removed from the dashing state and put into an attack state which does not clip with holes.At the end of the day the dash stab is still an attack  it comes after a dash but is not necessarily during it.,hyperlightdrifter,d1u7kiz,1,t5_2yhza
7182041,0,t1_d1tr9ga,gt Though Im curious to know how that compares to viewing movies which are all  FPSMovies record true motion in  second slices. This is fundamentally different from a game displaying sprites that cycle through  individual static frames in a second. Although even so nobody is saying the sprites need to be done at fps.The reason for that is due to motion blur. A movie camera records everything that happens in that  sec slice of time not entirely true but close enough for this discussion. If theres movement in one of those  slices its smeared across that frame so you see where whatever object was at each point inside that frame. This results in the illusion of fully smooth true although unnatural motion.A sprite can be designed so that it has that sort of blur or other effects built into it so  fps sprites can look like theyre truly moving similar to a movie. For this reason you can actually get pretty good movementsmoothness out of even  or  fps pixel art. You dont need to go to  to have good enough look although part of Hyper Light Drifters super smooth art is that they have some really excellent sprites that convey motion very well.This is different than running the game engine at  fps however. The game will still display those sprites at however many fps they were drawn for but it accepts input and runs its hit detection internal movement calculations etc at twice the temporal resolution  fps does. If you ever look at a sprite sheet for say Mario Brothers youll probably be amazed at just how few sprites Mario was made from. Hyper Light Drifters Drifter alone probably has more pixels than all the sprites of Mario and all enemies in Mario Brothers. However despite this Mario Brothers still plays quite smoothly with tight and accurate controls because the game engine runs at  fps. ,hyperlightdrifter,d1uj9td,3,t5_2yhza

As a whole a lot of games have become homogenized tourist mode normalstill pretty easy and then here we made stuff arbitrarily harder somehow that doesnt really fit. a large number of people have become used to this and feel cheated if they cant have the game the way they want it.

7393800,0,t3_4giuz1,Sadly despite my rig being i I run an intel integrated video card. Hyper light drifter is not another indie. It was something difficult at start but something soothing after you learn the gameplay like playing the drums or playing a musical instrument or meditation and anything that has a rythm that makes you forget about yourself and focus entirely on what youre doing.Speaking of indies despite other AAA games I loved like Deadspace kickstarter and indie games have made me more happy than d games. d is weird and cheap compared to d animation but its not a discussion I want to participate in.My favorites games in the last years were Cave Story All Shadowrun games by Hairebrained Deadmans Switch Dragonfall Hong Kong Banner Saga  amp  Grim Dawn Darkest Dungeon Hyper Light Drifter Skyshines Bedlam Dungeon of the EndlessNot in chronological order as they were not released at the same time.Theres a lot more but I dont think that is the place to list all of them anyway.So you are talking to someone whose last console was a ps and anything I play is mostly indie or something like Devil Daggers. And I dont think d is good looking. I find it awful to look at.But mate Im just stating my opinion. Not cool those other bros being condescending. If that is advice for how you can review better thats okay as I did not watch the video. But if its just flak you would do good to ignore it.Edit I did not watch more than  minute and half of the video because Im a  years old dude and personally I can read two full pages in one and a half minutes of video or less so its take more time to watch a video than to read and article which I prefer and again its just a personal opinion.,hyperlightdrifter,d2imjog,1,t5_2yhza
