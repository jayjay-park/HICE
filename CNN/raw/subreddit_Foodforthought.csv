29058,0,t1_cehqflz,Its still a degrading term comparing women to breeding dogs. The fact that some women engage in it doesnt change the fact. At best you might argue it is like the word nigger where a certain segment of the population has attempted to take control of the word subverting its original meaning but honestly I do not believe that is what most women are doing especially given that it is apparently still found acceptable for those outside the group to use the term with casual disregard. gtAnd to add to it most of them give a positive response to it.Most of them? Have you done a poll or something? Even assuming that is so if most former slaves used the term nigger to describe themselves did that make the term less degrading? The fact that a population can internalize its own oppression isnt really a strong defense of the word nor does it really challenge its meaning. Women are often agents in their own oppression perpetuating damaging norms for various reasons sometimes because it even benefits them in the short term as an individual. In my view you have every right to use the word I just think it is a degrading word that should be used a lot more carefully than it is. It ever so subtly promotes the idea that women are only good for fucking. As I believe words have both meaning and power I feel like we all have a duty to at least consider how we use our language.  ,Foodforthought,cehqo1h,1,t5_2rete

211038,0,t1_cf2fiql,Well of course the diagnosis could be a number of disorders listed in the DSM but again something like a personality disorder is not something appropriate to diagnose a young person with and arguably the impacts of such a diagnosis on the level of care can add serious confounding impacts on the diagnosed individual.But the argument for something like CPTSD is that it is a cluster of symptoms caused by a series of experiences and so it is useful in mental health diagnoses when there are a cluster of symptoms that have common causes and that respond to specific treatments to formalize this into its own diagnosis.gtMaybe there are other diagnosis manuals similar to the ICD and DS that I am not familiar with but if they dont recognize it what does that say about it?The DSM isnt formed based on democracy. Even if professionals may recognize a disorder and treat it in a similar fashion this doesnt mean that it will be accepted as a diagnosis in the DSM.In fact the process by which diagnostic criteria are created for the DSM is worth looking into if you dont know much about it. There are a number of controversial decisions that the people behind the DSM have made most recently adding the arguably normal symptoms of grief into diagnostic criteria.Theres a reasonable chance that the ICD will add CPTSD but again the WHO ICD process is worth looking into.,Foodforthought,cf2hcve,1,t5_2rete

There is no doubt that a significant percentage of girls are encouraged from a young age toward traditionally lower wage fields seen even in the stereotypical toys they play with. I think it is unfortunate since it discourages people from pursuing what may make them happiest.I remain unconvinced that even in a hypothetical society that was free of gendersex bias you would achieve a  or even  break in certain areas. At a minimum there are undeniably significant innate differences in hormonal levels and these have an impact on mood and personality. There are also likely differences in at least some cognative abilities including that those with a feminine psych profile tended to have higher social cognition skills than those with a masculine psych profile regardless of sex but the profile and sex were correlated.I think this means that there will always be a difference between sexes on what they find fulfilling and rewarding and this will impact what careers they pick. I think societys goal should be limit its pressure to fit into stereotypes and let individuals pick on the basis of what they enjoy and how much it pays which should be equal across many dimensions for a given talent in the same field.

313022,1,t1_cfd6q8d,I sincerely hope you are not speaking from bad experiences youve had in the past. As with anything that is good there are bad versions of it too. There are therapists that molest their patients. Humans are innately human.But this is not what recovery is about. Not at all.gtYoure right its not about god. Its about abandoning any self empowerment you have and practicing blanket idolatry of some ephemeral higher power that loves and cares about you in the hopes that that power will take away your desire to drinkIts not about god  per se although it is for some people. If youre not religious its more about letting go your desperate need to control everything. A huge reason people get involved with substances is a desperate need for control usually over their emotions. They call it selfmedicating for a reason. Its about recognizing that you cant control everything and that there are things that are more important than you. For some people that greater thing is a god. For others perhaps its their family. Perhaps its the universe in general. Like I said for everyone it can be different. Its not the thing that is the important part  its about relinquishing a need to control things you cant control.gtgradually replacing your old social order with a new one of similar cowards who will damn judge and fear you if you slip.First it is absolutely about replacing unhealthy relationships with healthy ones. This can have profound changes on people. So much so that their previous friends read using buddies may not even want to be around them. But that new social order is not full of cowards. In fact it takes a great deal of courage to try to deal with addiction. For some people it is absolutely devastating. And shame and judgment have absolutely no place in recovery. None at all. No one who comes forward should ever be ashamed to admit that they relapsed and used again. gtOh fuck you went back to the bottle? Well you must not have sufficiently admitted your wrongs and had your higher power remove your defects of character! Must not have been stepping right!Its not about admitting your wrongs though you are right in that making reparations with past wrongs is part of recovery  but not for the reason you seem to be implying. And addiction is not a defect of character it is an easily traceable genetic disease. Its a congenital problem with the reward center in the brain. gtSuddenly instead of the recognition that they are facing a compulsive chemical disorder they are suddenly saddled with shame derision and ostracism as salt in the wound of relapse. Maybe for some people that negative reinforcement helps keep them on the straight and narrow but Ive seen just as many people give up hope because they had a drink and suddenly all their year chips meant nothing anymore and well fuck it why not keep on going?Ignoring the point about negative reinforcement as negativity and shame has absolutely no place within a recovery environment as I stated earlier. You strike me as someone who does not understand much about addiction. You make the mistake that a lot of people do with confusing dependency with addiction. Dependency is when your body craves a substance. Its the hangover. Dependency is easy to kick and just about anyone can do it cold turkey with no problems. The easiest part about kicking heroin is the withdrawal. Unlike Alcohol it is not lifethreatening. Youll feel like hell but it is by far the easiest part of kicking heroin.Addiction is the beast. Addiction is the liferuiner. Think of like a switch in your brain that some people have because of a genetic predisposition you can see this in things like Native American populations in which alcoholism runs rampant. If you have a parent or grandparent who is an alcoholic you have about a  in  chance of having the gene. Like I said its flipping a switch in your brain. You become obsessed with the chemical rewards that come with a substance or act. This is why you find people with an addictive personality switching between drugs and dabbling in things like sex addiction or gambling. Its not so much about the substance its about the rewards in the brain.AA isnt a perfect system but its the best one we have right now to battle addiction.,Foodforthought,cfd7pdd,-1,t5_2rete

I think we are mostly in agreement about this point. I dont want us to argue around each other about this when we basically agree.gt Is it good for people to push themselves or their children to constantly be striving for more?Its not so much about constantly striving for more so much as it is striving to be better. When I was a child I was always at the top of my class because I was smart and lets be honest the material you learn in elementary and middle school is not exactly complicated. However my parents didnt just let me slack off and coast through school based on my intelligence alone. They told me Dont compare yourself to the other kids. You are not trying to be better than them you are trying to be better than you are now. I think thats why I kept doing well in high school and college even though the classes got a lot harder. I think it is good for parents to push their children to be the best that they can be. For some children that means straight As. For others the standards might be lower.An important thing though is that you cant chase success for successs sake. You have to love what you do. I am a computer engineer. Im currently working at Amazon but will soon enter grad school to pursue a Ph.D. I wouldnt have gotten as far as I have in the field if I didnt love doing what I do.

360422,0,t3_1y64e1,I think many people feel lonely these days but there are people who cannot do anything about it. Some of my disabled friends are stuck at home and depend on people around them to socialise. They are chronically lonely. Im lucky that Im allowed to drive a car. Thanks to that I can go out whenever I have the energy to do so. My horizon is larger and that enables me to make new friends. The average disabled person doesnt get the opportunity to make new friends. Normally people come and go but to them people just go. Eventually everyone moves away pursues their own dreams and ambitions. The problem is that you dont see the chronically lonely. They are not integrated into our society because they stay at home. Especially in our modern society where we prefer not knowing our neighbours there isnt a lot that counters loneliness. One might think that the internet is a solution however nothing compares to physical interaction...which is another problem for many disabled. Even if they meet a new person it takes a long time before that person feels comfortable enough to for example throw a highfive or even hug. But exactly this kind of interaction promotes bonding...especially romantic bonding.Disabled are lonely and they cannot do much about it. They need society to help them out but to do this everyone needs to acknowledge the problem. Charity isnt enough. Events organised by social workers dont help counter chronic loneliness. Every person needs a certain level of human physical interaction. So unless every disabled person has a robot companion they will need not just family but also neighbours their friends and strangers to help them make new friends.,Foodforthought,cfi4gtp,19,t5_2rete

In the past they were sometimes worn into battle but most often worn for ceremonial occasions as is the case today. They are seen as items of great spiritual and magical importance.   The eagle is considered by Plains tribes as the greatest and most powerful of all birds and thus the finest bonnets are made out of its feathers.gtIts beauty was considered of secondary importance the bonnets real value was in its supposed power to protect the wearer. The bonnet is still only to be worn on special occasions and is highly symbolic.gtThe bonnet had to be earned through brave deeds in battle because the feathers signified the deeds themselves. Some warriors might have obtained only two or three honor feathers in their whole lifetime so difficult were they to earn. The bonnet was also a mark of highest respect because it could never be worn without the consent of the leaders of the tribe. A high honor for example was received by the warrior who was the first to touch an enemy fallen in battle for this meant the warrior was at the very front of fighting. Feathers were notched and decorated to designate an event and told individual stories such as killing capturing an enemys weapon and shield and whether the deed had been done on horseback or foot.gtgtImage i  Muscogee war bonnetInteresting Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railway | Roman Nose Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcfxhty oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfxhty.

I know that this can be hard to fathom for people who do not think in that way but opposition to marriage equality doesnt require homophobia.Other things that the Bible says were not mentioned in Prop . Where do they require the state to recognize polygamy? Where does it allow a man to take his brothers widow as a second wife? And lets not forget the special marriage provisions for male rapists and their victims or male soldiers and women captured in war. If the Bible says it must be so where was that in the Prop  efforts?And if homophobia is not required then what other forms of marriage does Prop  propose to ban? What nonhomosexual marriage is prohibited?In any case if you saw the actual Prop  support efforts in CA you would know it went far beyond what the Bible said. They produced hateful advertising claiming that without Prop  schools would be forced...

In nearly every single economics class I have taken so far we have discussed competing perspectives and theories. For example Im currently taking a class on monetary economics. We discussed the Keynesian approach to money demand the classical approach and the monetarist approach. Within the Keynesian approach we broke it down into Keynes versus BaumolTobin although this is a small difference. And thats just on one lesson within the class.You could argue that we havent gone into any real Marxist or fullreserve models but the class is limited to one semester so it makes perfect sense that the department has chosen to devote the vast majority of class time to the most relevant and wellstudied economic models out there.On a side note I had an IPE professor from Korea who did his PhD work with Chang. He was a very kind and straight forward man but he hated Chang with a passion. He claimed Chang had been a good friend before he stole a lot of his work for his PhD thesis and for Kicking Away the Ladder. Given the nature of the class we covered a lot of Chang readings and the professor would always point out the parts that he claimed Chang stole from him.

Food imports are all controlled and distributed by the government. It is not a surprise that such a centralized system has begun to collapse with basic goods becoming extremely scarce. The more populated areas have had to become subject to official food rationing after riots began to occur when people stood in line for hours and still got no food.The government controls almost every single aspect of the Venezuelan economy it is by definition a completely totalitarian state in the sense that the government is in every single aspect of the life of Venezuelans.Not everything is black and white not every leftist government is good and you should try and see beyond your personal bias before passing judgment over such a delicate and complicated country as Venezuela.,Foodforthought,cgpf55z,2,t5_2rete

It doesnt hurt corporate money it hurts local farmers who have no option but to buy GMO seeds!If this were a proposed information sheet that contained all information sign me in but to single out one non health related issue will just feed the antigmo movement.EDIT Also how will you make the distinction between the genetic modifications? Should farmers have to put a label on their products saying that selected the best of their produce year on year? Because thats genetic modification too! Do we include a label in different colors to imply what kind of techniques were used? Should we change the shape to imply what company did the modification? Would the colors signify that the company themselves did the genetic modifications or whether or not they used GMOs? These labels would NOT give more information they would only state a GMO and people would assume all GMOs are equal.

If theyre a good business WalMart might cut into their profit margins but it wont put them out of business.gtThe money that would have been diversified amongst a wider range of financial actors is just getting gobbled by the same higherup WalMart executives that dont redistribute their economic growth and as a result just increase mass wealth inequity.There are plenty of causes of wealth inequality and theyre mostly structural.

The fantasy that it is a gated community filled with wealthy people is patently false. Yes there are wealthy people in San Francisco as there are in all cities but there are also a lot of poor people. Ever been to the Tenderloin?. New York is built over a sheet of geologically stable bedrock which makes it one of the few places in the world that can support massive high rises and towering skyscrapers. San Francisco is built on a hilly uneven unstable tectonically volatile area next to the San Andreas fault. Highrises are not only unfeasible here but they are irresponsibly dangerous to build.. Housing prices vary wildly in San Francisco based on neighborhood and quality of the house. Yes the median home is more expensive than housing in other areas of the United States but it also comes with a higher median income. San Francisco was not founded by tech professionals. It has a long history of being an expensive place to live and thats because wherever you have cramped quarters where there isnt enough room for everybody such as on the tiny peninsula on which SF is situated demand is going to drive prices up.Stick to preaching about things you understand.

First their enforcement is necessarily an infringement of actual property rights. Second ideas have properties wholly unlike propertythey are nonrival and to a degree nonexclusive goodstreating them like private property results in nonoptimal distribution of information.

2232381,0,t3_2kodyp,Republicans would be ready to declare war if Putin made even just a few of the same condescending statements towards the U.S. and our political process that Bibi has made. Israel gets economic and military help from the U.S. and should be extraordinary grateful and gracious to the U.S. and yet Bibi acts as if Israel is entitled to the support. Its expected that countries like Egypt and Pakistan which receive aid from the U.S. would not be so publicly magnanimous because everyone understands the money is meant to buy off kleptocratic authoritarian dictatorships. Bibi continuously in his rhetoric holds Israel culturally philosophically and politically above the dictatorships of the Arab world and yet he offers no more gratitude or even just political breathing room than those countries. Ironically Israel is becoming indistinguishable from the rest of the Arab states which stoke criticism of the U.S. in public but privately offer assurances. He should be on his knees begging and pleading. Id like to see how well Israel would do politically on the international stage and militarily with no support from the U.S.Hes actively endangering the national security of Israel by alienating an ally without the support of which it would cease to exist.,Foodforthought,clnl7mi,13,t5_2rete
2243055,0,t1_clos5m1,gtand citizens of those states have now had those guns taken away from their lawful ability to acquire.I find this sentence absolutely fascinating I must admit. You knew you couldnt say had their guns taken away because they never did. Again the only administration that presided over Americans literally having their guns taken away taken right from their hands and homes was a republican administration who did not one thing to stop it. But lets let that slide for a moment as republican memory problems are well known. You chose instead to say and rightfully so they had their guns taken away from their lawful ability to acquire.You know you have had your lawful ability to acquire many things taken away. You cannot buy recreational drugs in most states and just a short while back you couldnt in any state. You cannot buy a suitcase nuke anywhere at any time. Several republican run states have taken your right to buy a Tesla away despite an oftprofessed love of the free market. You cannot buy most medications without a prescription. The list of things you may not or no longer legally buy is actually quite long. So what if you can buy thousands of kinds of guns but not this one kind or that kind? I cant even buy just any car I want it has to be street legal. Im very well aware of our right to bear arms and I support it but I dont know of any part of the constitution that guarantees us the right to buy any weapon of any kind at any time.Now all that said like you are not a republican I am not a wholesale democrat. You forget this sub is rliberal and not rdemocrat. But if we must vote for one of these parties and not doing so would surely result in Republican victories if not thanks to ceaseless propaganda certainly to unlawful voting practices see Georgia destroying  African American voter registrations this month then I must in all conscience vote democrat for now. I oppose gun control as well but when we talk deal breakers my mind goes to things like taxpaying American citizens being denied equal human rights under the law women being ostensibly raped with vaginal wands to terrify them out of seeking abortions and indeed a return to the days of our daughters dying in alleyways or throwing themselves down flights of stairs to abort pregnancies when no legal remedy exists and the lockstep scorched earth and visceral hatred the conservatives have displayed.I do want us to have gun rights but not at the cost of our souls.,Foodforthought,cloy1eq,1,t5_2rete

2389081,0,t3_2mp24r,Couple of things . Key takeaway is While she is a professor she is not a Professor  thats the exact position that earns K per course to teach. For one reason or another between graduate school fellowships postdoc fellowships job market etc no institution saw enough merit to offer a junior faculty position or a junior faculty position followed up by a tenure track. Academia is extremely tough. Who wouldnt want the job? So institutions get to choose from the best of the best. Its a bit like having a Navy full of sailors and then having the SEALS. Theyre all qualified at some basic level to be considered part of the Navy... but only a hand selected few were able to pass all the tests and make it to the other side. And theres actually more job openings in the SEALS than high level academic jobs. Literally in my wifes field theres  openings a year between the US and Canada. . The problem with administrators taking the lions share of pay on campuses is the result of academics. Colleges as we know them arent actually that old.  years ago you only went to one if you were the second or third son of a wealthy family and therefore couldnt inherit the family business. There was also the seminary side of things. Slowly that transitioned to what we know today. At some point in between professors were running things with a board or set of boards on top. But these professors were more generalists than today and the qualifications for teaching were low. As professors grew more and more specialized in their fields they added more and more qualifications for being considered a professor. Now you have to publish at a rate of John Grisham in many fields to be considered for a job. Its during that transition that admins creeped in. They took on the responsibilities professors didnt want or couldnt be bothered with... and slowly got enough responsibility to control the system. And with that power they could allocate resources... to themselves. . Its all about funding. All schools should have enough funding to pay for professors and grad students. However the local admins get in cozy with local real estate developers and fall into the arms race mentality. And so you end up with more buildings and renovations than tenured positions. My wifes aunt is on a board at a very prestigious school that has no problem raising money... but they constantly have to raise it because it LITERALLY disappears. So between buildings phony ed tech solutions sports and admins you have no money for the things that really matter. And the reality is if you can fund graduate students you attract the best graduate students. And if you can offer professors ridiculous packages you can attract great professors. But after getting to know countless graduate students that turn into adjunct professors the reality is theres also just a lot of shitty academics trying to be professors. I know people that could barely finish their dissertation in  years yet expect a tenure track job. There are really really really smart people out there who also work ridiculously hard... and when a job comes on the market they are way more likely to get it than the person that isnt. ,Foodforthought,cm6zxbg,3,t5_2rete

2531990,0,t1_cmoxze0,Okay there are a few issues here.  Firstly in the context of an article like this you really need to cite the source of your statistic.  I dont find it implausible or unreasonable at all and I dont think theres any serious researcher who contests the idea of which is the bigger problem.  Thats just my impression though.  I think we need to tell people where weve read things and how weve come to believe them.  Otherwise it comes across really strongly as a lesson not learned.Secondly why is it especially men who browse reddit who need to keep this in mind?  I have no problem with you wanting to say that everyone needs to keep this in mind but why are you making assumptions about who I am and what Im like and what Im aware of or not aware of?  Its annoying.Thirdly whats most interesting about this article is that the two cases reported on are certainly not what one would imagine when one imagines a false accusation of rape.  In both cases  as they are presented  the young women were under serious social pressure to regard what had transpired in retrospect as rape  in both cases  as presented  it is clear that whatever happened it did not fit the mould of redpill premeditated serial predation.  It seems that the systems in place were rather murky and ill equipped to do anything other than eject possible rapists from the school system.  At one time the schools would have dealt with such a situation by sweeping the young woman under the rug  it certainly is a sign of feminist progress that this is no longer acceptable but it is highly problematic if the schools are merely sweeping the young man under the rug instead.  In my opinion as long as there is a concept of Rape that empowers and construes the alienation of one gender from the other Rape will continue to be a chronic source of social harm.  Rapes will continue to occur because it is possible for one human to rape another.  This is a crime which must under all circumstances be prevented from allowing one human to exercise power over another.  But the incidence of rape does not need to feed and perpetuate an irrevocably gendered social construction of Rape.  Unless there is an established process that manages to transcend the gender identities of the parties involved Rape will continue to be a source of oppression.  But thats just my opinion.TLDRcite your sources.no change in content edit  By the way I remember the post a few days ago about the consequences of X becoming a default subreddit  this submission is also trending on X and for a moment I thought I had written a response without noticing which subreddit the post was in.  I was wrong it turned out.I probably would have been a lot less opinionated if I had been responding in X and I might not have even made any comment at all.  Did someone really need to contradict Atman on these points?  Maybe not really.  Anyways the part that I thought might be interesting about this  in adding this edit I found myself searching for Atmans gender in  edit history and then I stopped myself.  I mean maybe Atman is also an opinionated male.  I know from what I read that Atman is an opinionated politicized person with an analytical mind.  I really dislike the implications of looking for validation of a gender on this basis.  Furthermore theres definitely something deeply pathological about valorizing opinions and statements on the sole basis of gender like its a switch to be turned on or off.  That said I think X was able to do something as a community when there was an easy presumption that any opinionated speaker was female that its having trouble with now.,Foodforthought,cmp2fuv,16,t5_2rete
2534029,0,t1_cmpbcy9,Whats changing is that you went from thisgt Youre disgusting for dismissing the effects of a false rape accusation. At worst the man goes to prison and employment becomes impossible after his life is effectively over. At best the man suffers serious trust issues and has to deal with the social stigma in which everyone automatically assumes he did it and just managed to get away with.gt So yes I would rather see  rapes go unconvicted than  innocent man have to go through that.To thisgtI would rather see any number of guilty people get away with a crime than an innocent person get convicted.In response to me pointing out the clear gender bias in your initial statement. I dont know maybe you just did a poor job of stating your position clearly the first time so Im sorry if my assessment was based on that. However considering that you accused me of being disgusting for pointing out the apparent gender bias gut reaction maybe? I consider that unlikely. It seems that you have a visceral emotional response to considerations of the gender implications of the issue for some reason. Interesting too that the default reactionary kneejerk response to suggestions of prejudice now seems to be not just denial but to shift the blame of prejudice to the other person for even suggesting that prejudice might play a role. I wonder where this tactic originated? Like the changing goalposts it seems to be a rhetorical tactic widely deployed by the right wing noise machine. ,Foodforthought,cmpc17t,-10,t5_2rete
2542841,0,t3_2othhr,This is not how it feels to be a Young American this is how it feels to be a young white middle class American raised with a certain set of expectations in a certain set of environments. I was raised in this type of environment but by by the time I got to high school I got so sick of it that I almost exclusively hung out with people from outside of mine punks dropouts musicians artists etc. It was amazing what hanging out with people who werent so concerned with the rat race did to my perspective and priorities. You can have all the achievements and credentials and conventional success you want but social contentment and unconventional purpose can go a very long way too. But it did suck bad to see many of them struggle with problems I didnt have to because of my socioeconomic background so theres definitely a balance.At college it was even worse. Everyone was there to check a box not to learn. And no I dont mean this in the sense of People have to treat college like a job investment because its so expensive now and a bachelors has become such a standard requirement for a career. This specific type of rat race mindset was endemic amongst the people for whom the cost of college was of little concern. I was repelled by many of the people I met who were in a Linkedin arms race but couldnt tell you anything interesting about themselves that didnt involve conventional achievement. They didnt just want to be successful they wanted to socially project the aura of success.And thats the root of the problem. Our hyperconnected ultrasocialized world puts our social reputation always at the forefront of our minds. So many young people are so incredibly concerned with what other people think of them. This isnt a new trend. Even in the s some social critics bemoaned that the younger generation was far more concerned about social impressions than taking hard stands. A book I recently read about th century social change quoted one writer from the s who opined that the youth of the day fretted over picking the right flavor of ice cream to eat.There are positives and negatives to the trend. Positive is out and out bigotry is on the decline because social inclusiveness is so highly prized now. Negative is social inclusiveness is so highly prized now that major youth movements like Occupy fail because the organizers specifically value inclusiveness so much as to explicitly reject hierarchical organizational structures and every other basic th century activist norm necessary to achieve genuine progress. Its now better to have a failed movement that address all concerns than to have a successful movement that addresses some.To get off that tangent and go back to my main point young people would be a lot happier if they stopped caring what other people thought. I dont mean this in like a fake it til you make it PUA way. I mean stop caring about what your closest friends and parents think. Stop caring what your peer group thinks. Post on facebook that you dropped out of college I did this. Tweet that you got fired or didnt get your dream internship. Take an instagram selfie in the food stamps line. Just because you like them doesnt mean they cant be wrong. If they dont respect you because of your educational or career choices then you dont need them in your life. Maybe this is all easier for me because I just naturally dont really have respect for other peoples opinions. But I am absofuckinglutely sure no one thinks on their deathbed Boy  Im sure glad I lived my life so in tune with peer and family expectations.,Foodforthought,cmqhixg,13,t5_2rete

2904310,0,t3_2tb26x,He makes some good points but I disagree with him in general. Its unreasonable to expect every moviewhatever the subjectto convey every possible nuance such that one couldnt be misled by it. Especially when he seems to be suggesting that every movie about war has to focus on the political decisions behind it. Throughout human history war has been a really ubiquitous phenomenon and for good or ill the people who experience it most deeply are those who fight it. To say that we cant make a movie about that something that affects so many people is frankly absurd.Not to mention the selfindulgence inherent in someone who has spent a great deal of time studying and criticizing wars claiming that we need to make all films about it in a manner that depicts them in as morally ambiguous political quagmires. Thats akin to a radical feminist saying that we cant make romantic comedies and instead every movie about relationships has to place them in the context of oppressively gendered patriarchal structures. Or a Green Peace member saying that we cant show a movie that involves the outdoors without spending the majority of the running time examining the irreversible damage that the hegemonic corporations are doing to the planet. Its incredibly entitled to think that all content surrounding your subjects of interest has to deal with them in a manner that you approve of and include a message that is consistent with your particular views whatever those subjects and views may be.Its always tempting to take what is a favorite subject of yours and demand that all media depict it with a depth that you would find meaningful. I majored in economics. Ill admit Im a little bothered that A Beautiful Mind a movie about the mathematicianeconomist who founded game theory had a grand total of one scene explaining what game theory is and they got it completely wrong. I would have loved to see a movie that went into great depth about the field and examined the problems that led to its creation and the method with which Nash approached them. But I recognize that just because I like math its not reasonable to expect every movie about a mathematician to involve a complex and indepth examination of mathematics. In short I recognize that despite the fact that they almost completely ignored his work and actively misled people about it the one time they didnt A Beautiful Mind is still a great movie a fact thats true because it focused on the human element of the story.Disclaimer I havent seen American Sniper so Im not directly addressing it directly Im not claiming that it isnt possible to make a movie about war thats morally deceptive in its simplicity.

In my opinion in a case where say  college kids boy and girl get drunk and have sex and later the girl regrets it and cries rape which actually happened to one of my coworkers last semester and fucked him over both of them would be held accountable and punished. At some point both parties made the conscious decision to drink but it shouldnt be just one of the two held responsible for actions taken while drunk.

3510689,0,t1_cpsfd41,Thank you for a nuanced view on this topic.I cant speak to the prison life thank FUCK! so I cant say to what level prison violence prevails. From the combination of sadly mostly anecdotal sources there does appear to be a lot of it. I wasnt trying to say its all day every day but its definitely going to be more than if you were not in prison unless you were at war or something. The visiting warden was looking at the environment as a function of how many weapons could be constructed from objects found in the environment. I found that telling. That was his job that was what he was paying attention to when he was a warden. I dont think hes going to do that if violence is not an issue.Its true that the socialisation process occurs in the peer group but thats the kind of people who need to be reintroduced into society.For me the important thing was to see that there were all these implements with which mayhem could readily be started and that this did not happen regardless of the fact that the implements are freely available. You dont need a coat hanger for a weapon when you have power tools actual knives and sundry hardware present in the environment. Yet this was not a major cause for concern.Im hoping that most inmates dont have to encounter all that much violence but the fact that the warden was visibly uncomfortable with how liberal the prison is in Norway tells me something of the kind of environment he has been exposed to. And hes the warden. Hes not served time Im assuming behind bars himself.Im going to assume that the Norwegian system understands that they have criminals talking to other criminals I also understand that they have programs run by their system where they assist inmates on the way to rehabilitation.Im not going to trump your experience and Im not judging I do believe the Norwegians are doing it better and the US system would do well for itself to evolve in that direction. The warden said so himself Its your fault youre here dont blame us dont look to us for help. Youre the one who fucked up youre on your own. To me its as much as saying well be keeping your bed warm for when you return and you will return.I dont want to be in prison at all but if it was my choice I know where Id want to be in prison.And I hope youre doing well in life.

Your education system is more steeped in classical education than ours at least it was when I was in college studying Educational Theatre a British import in New York. Our education system has been watered down to treat children like impending cogs in an economic machine. Yours recognizes that people are multidimensional individuals with lives apart from their work. Yours also value arts accessibility and education for everyone not just the wealthy. I dont know if this still holds true or if youve been influenced by the American race to the educational bottom more recently.I grew up in a suburb of New York City and was exposed to a great deal of art and culture as a child. When my parents relocated to the country less than  miles away I was seen as an anomaly by my peers because Id attended Shakespearian plays been to the opera and knew a Monet from a Degas. They called me the cultured one even though I came from a working class background and many of their families were much wealthier than mine. Everyone in my NY city public school got the same exposure to the arts regardless of economic class. I think it was much more comparable to the type of exposure one gets in the UK.

Im saying it was one of the triggers. If no shots had been fired there and the fort had exchanged hands peacefully well we have no idea what would have happened.Also fuck you. Im not beating around the bush by ignoring your points. I dont have to make your arguments for you. Now that you HAVE made your arguments allow me to retort.The North wanted to maintain ITS economy by returning the south to the fold. Washington was fully aware that the secession of the south meant an end to Union hegemony and the lifestyle enjoyed in the north. Cotton money spread throughout the nation. It didnt just stay in the south. The industrial center was in the north! If you were a southern plantation owner who benefited most from your welfare after yourself and your family? The people who make all the shit you buy! The North needed the South to maintain their lifestyle just the same as the South needed their slaves. Lincoln understood this. He said explicitly that his interest was not in freeing the slaves it was in repairing the Union. He didnt free border state slaves until after the war was won. Why was that? Because the North ran off of slave labor too. If they werent actual slaves they were wage slaves. Is there a noticeable difference to you?Almost every stationary society in history has run off of slave labor OURS INCLUDED. And thats a disgusting fact that will haunt me until I die but I want it to haunt you as well because evidently you dont get it. Would you bring war to Bangladesh because there are slaves there who need to be freed? Youd never think of it. Your morality ends where convenience begins and that is a natural human behavior. Those on the bottom care about morality and those on top care about themselves. Thus is the way.Maybe there will come a day where this isnt the case but it isnt right now and if you think that waging war will stop slavery youre sorely mistaken and youve been tricked.

This is what I have in common with people of Middle Eastern descent or Asian descent or Latin American descent. Society on the whole treats us differently from white people.

These debates IMO could be seen as the start of the cable debate program that started us down the path of cable news we see today. There was a huge ratings bump not because of the high minded political debate but instead for the conflict and drama that ensued. I think the author missed the point that these debates were a harbinger of what was to come. Buckley called Vidal a queer and threatened to punch him! Thats not exactly high minded debate. This is not something that we should strive to go back to. It only showed television execs that a cheap easy way to get ratings is to have two people yell at each other.

If you need me to give you the rapeincesthealth of the mother caveat you have it.  That said if you have willful unprotected sex in my ideal society which is one where there is sex ed and free prophylactics for everyone then yes you may have to stay pregnant for a whole nine months only by virtue of evolutions role in making you a woman something that had a  chance of going the other way. Then the father would go ahead and raise the kid for decades.  This is not evil this is personal responsibility.  Words like monstrous help no one and add nothing here.  In fact to bring it full circle words like monstrous used in conjunction with eugenics because of the Nazis help hold back progress.  As a man there is nothing I feel is a bigger violation of our personal humanity that when a woman just gets an abortion without telling them or involving them.  Its not that I dont sympathize with a pregnant woman I just dont think its completely her choice only or that its only a womans body issue.

5023938,0,t1_curabqz,I dont which is exactly why Ive concluded that the cries of BLM are so incredibly damaging to black America. The prevalence and magnitude of police brutalityracism are being blown completely out of proportion by the media mainstream and social leading many black people to unreasonably distrust and hate the police. This causes them to think its proper to tell cops to fuck off when theyre pulled over for breaking the law ie Sandra Bland which ironically results in more tension and a cycle of distrust. Over the last year or so racial events have been sensationalized across standard news outlets and social media. Its not that these events are incredibly prevalent  you just think they are because theyre shoved in your face all the time. The reality though is that Black America has much greater internal issues to deal with but would rather point fingers outward than address their own culture. If you look at all the big standout names of the BLM movement every single incident involved someone who was not listening to andor being combative with the police. Taking the ridiculous position that the victim is NEVER at fault only makes these events more common because now whenever a BLMbrainwashed black American gets stopped by a cop for committing a crime they immediately think Youre only stopping me because Im black. and become hostile ultimately escalating the situation and increasing the risk of a violent confrontation.,Foodforthought,curkqpr,1,t5_2rete

People can lie about their symptoms and psychological problems can manifest themselves in real physical symptoms.

5635227,0,t1_cwvc1ei,I think his point is a salient one. While it may miss the fact that group identity forms from a shared experiencehistory rather than an active  decision the underlying point is still strong The stronger we selfidentify with labels the more division it creates in society. This is demonstrably true. It is a simple outcome of tribal nature and the stronger we cling to tribalism the deeper the division between us and those not of our tribe however that tribe is defined. Theres not a neat little answer to the problem. But the reasoning you use to claim value or validation in groupidentity doesnt in any way address the point about cultural appropriation. Yes people will judge you by your skin color. Yes there are racists out there. Yes stereotypes will sometimes color peoples perceptions. Yes it is possible you may miss out on opportunities  because of your skin color. I think everyone would tend to agree that it is unfortunate. But none of this negates his points about cultural appropriation that culture is not the sacred static segregationist taboo thing we treat it as.,Foodforthought,cwvlqlw,2,t5_2rete

Im an engineer right now but I intend to be an engineering manager in the future so I fully expect to see both sides of this as an engineer Ive previously received offers that were noncompetitive from companies I would prefer to work for as has a friend of mine. Through negotiations he was able to get the offer competitive again while I wasnt because the other offer I had was just well out of the companys price range. If we couldnt negotiate wed have both walked away right after their first offer and my friend wouldnt have a job he loves with a company he loves.As an engineering manager its quite simple why pay someone more than you have to? If they accept a lower offer I save money if they negotiate I can raise it commensurate to how much I think they bring to the table and how much I want to add to my salaries. If they perform well their salary can always increase and I have actual evidence of how well they work to base it on rather than a rsumif I had an engineer who was working there for a year didnt negotiate too well but was doing excellent work he would certainly receive a nice big raise because I would want to keep his talent.

This phenomenon was itself tied to the nations sovereign debt which replaced colonial occupation as a means of imperialist domination in a chain of injustices stretching back to the European encounter depicted at the end in Mel Gibsons historical epic named not coincidentally Apocalypto. There are no such thing as natural disasters just fantasies we entertain to excuse our inaction.I thought this passage about the earthquake in Haiti was really interesting particularly the last sentence really stuck with me. While I dont agree with the author that there are no natural disasters I think it reflects the growing change in thinking around these events. Namely the growing understanding that the frequency and intensity of these events is growing as our climate changesand that we are at least partially driving that change. I think the author might be arguing that Haiti wouldnt have been a disaster if we hadnt destroyed Haiti economically and environmentally but Id still probably argue with that assertion.gtEven when a developer doesnt plan a final hurrah players often take it upon themselves to commemorate their worlds imminent end Cormac McCarthy in The Road When one has nothing left make ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them.This passage stuck out to me as well.

We need to admit that the vast majority of people have no economic value whatsoever and will never meaningfully contribute to society and thats OK.  While this move will render most peoples high school degrees meaningless they have already been meaningless for a long time and this is a good step for formally accepting that.  If you dont have a network of people helping you or a ton of skill and ambition even a college degree isnt useful.  Labor just isnt as important as it used to be because of automation and there will never be enough service jobs to make up the shortfall especially now that automation is starting to cut into white collar industries through artificial intelligence.  Right now the bulk of global jobs are done by wage slaves or actual slaves and the only reason why they havent been replaced by machines is because its currently not cost effective.  Meanwhile we let whole continents worth of people starve to death because they have nothing to contribute when we have the resources to stop it. A tiny fraction of the population can produce everything that we need and we need a new economic system that puts developing people instead of capital as its main priority.  We need a universal basic income and a way to keep populations at manageable levels and redefine what the purpose of society is and what peoples role is inside of it.  The longer we define peoples value with their economic output the more tragic the outcomes are going to be.As far as the articles actual point of reducing school difficulty by removing invaluable critical thinking skills from high school so that people who have learned nothing can still graduate.  Thats one of the dumbest things Ive ever heard and only someone privileged enough to succeed no matter how unmotivated they are would propose it seriously.

7336509,0,t1_d2c26b5,gtYeah its usually too lenient on criminals where proving anything beyond a reasonable doubt is very difficult and many times criminals get their sentences downgraded on technicalities.You and I have an apparently unbridgeable gulf in our perspectives about what the role of due process is the significance of the ideal of innocent until proven guilty and just how many guilty men punished makes up for an innocent man being punished alongside them. When I said that police officers have different rules for how they can be treated during an investigation I wasnt taking issue with what those rules were but how selectively they apply. If I come off as extra hawkish on prosecution and punishment its because I hold those in positions of authority to higher standards of behavior and because with how little accountability police have theres not much room to argue for less. gtYeah most police officers have witnesses and cameras and backup and dispatch recordings and witnesses who constantly ride around with them in a car. Most criminals have none of that.And yet even in situations with none of those things officers testimony is still given highly preferential treatment. gtMaking the justice system harsher against police without just being overwhelmingly biased in the eyes of the law against police would require becoming much harsher on the criminals who last I checked do not have permits to go around getting high slashing tires of police cars breaking into cars and threatening police officers with knives.Where to start?  Firstly I outright reject the implicit premise that officers are already treated equally with nonofficers in our legal system the latter group upon which you bestow the blanket categorization of criminals and treat as something mutually exclusive with being a police officer and therefore similarly reject the conclusion that less leniency and more accountability for officers must necessitate harsher treatment for nonofficers unless bias in employed. The institutional bias is already there. Its highly in favor of police officers. I would like to see that bias eliminated.Secondly getting high slashing tires and breaking into cars are all crimes but none of them are capital crimes and the police are very rightly prohibited from taking punitive action. Anything that a police officer does as punishment is wrong. It is not their place. We have a whole separate branch of government just for that. Saying a suspect deserved whatever injury they received from the police is entirely separate from the discussion of whether or not the police were justified in causing the injury. While threatening an officer with a knife can certainly be grounds for justified lethal defensive action there is obviously a line at which the threat is not imminent enough to warrant killing and Van Dyke polevaulted right over that line.gtOfficers do however have permission from the state to defend themselves against people who would do them harm.They certainly do for good reason and there are restrictions on their right to do so also for good reason. gtWell Van Dyke would disagree with you.Would he really? Then why did he lie on his report? Why did he and all his cohorts try to hide the video? Why did they destroy the surveillance footage from the nearby Burger King? Why intimidate the witnesses? If he didnt think what he did was legally wrong if the officers on the scene didnt think what he did was legally wrong if his superiors didnt think that what he did was legally wrong then why did they go through so much trouble to cover it up? ,Foodforthought,d2c3zrw,1,t5_2rete

7466082,0,t1_d2q8m21,You are correct gt Perhaps part of the problem is that The Biggest Loser doesnt even promote a very healthy lifestyle in the first placethis is the common outcome for TBL style dieting.TBL was nothing but glorified starvation made possible through a voluntary internment. What they were selling was always a very low calorie diet VLCD starvation and hours of daily exercise in an unnaturally controlled setting.In that sense the outcome of extreme weightloss is hardly unexpected it has been covered before. The Minnesota Starvation Experiment produced this exact outcome. Note that such an experiment would never get through a modern IRB. Ah the old days when nobody much cared about the ethics involved.And for the record Ancel Keys who was involved in this study is the father of the obesity epidemic. A horrible human being whose pandering to large food companies Kellogg General Mills etc saw him intentionally produce misleading data. We can directly blame Keys for the demonisation of dietary fat particularly saturated fat and with it the onset of the obesity epidemic including the rise of heart disease and other metabolic syndrome pathologies.To bring this back around to your comment one reason inter alia why TBL and equivalent shows are the worst possible method for losing weight are the assumptions on which they are based.Namely the assumption that the internal signalling and feedback systems of the metabolism are totally unimportant. Ironically one of the earlier trainers Jillian Michaels has written several laymens books on hormones particularly leptin ghrelin T and T while advocating a diet system that utterly destroys them from a functional perspective. To be fair to her it may be that she figured out what she was doing wrong but... I dont see any public retraction of the previously recommended approach either.The VLCD approach has a very destructive effect on most of the feedback mechanisms which are responsible for the RMR BMR. By engaging the starvation mechanism at a time when the goal is to facilitate the maximum amount of consumption of endogenous fatty acids from adipocytes instead the body is forced into conservation mode. And conservation mode reduces the amount of stored fatty acids made available for consumption lowers BMR favours energy storage over oxidation depresses most of the hormones responsible for energy metabolism and targets unused lean body mass preferentially. Starvation is effective for weightlossif one doesnt care what weight is lost or what shape the body is in afterwords.However I dont think as you indicate that obesity causes permanent damage to the body. I have seen some indication that there is a homeostatic set point or series of them anyway that can establish a weight that the body would like to return to. And obese people normally have a set point that is in excess of optimal body fat levels.Yet the process of homeostasis is a cellular process happening in cell cytosol and in the mitochondria. All of the monitoring and feedback mechanisms target the production and usage of energy on that level. It would seem to be highly important that whatever changes are desirable towards reduction in adiposity focus on them.To that end I would suggest that the safe approach to losing weight is not starvation and not mindless IIFYM. Instead a very modest caloric restriction say  kCal  day in tandem with a diet that seeks to restore hormonal function would be most effective in the long term.By restore hormonal function I mean specifically working to restore insulin sensitivity and controlling redox reactions in the mitochondria. To accomplish that removal of all simple sugars from the diet favouring starches with a limit of lt g  day total carbohydrate is a very good approach. Likewise an increase in dietary fatbut critically substitution of saturated fat for PUFA sources. The latter point is important because in general the population is eating an overwhelming amount of PUFA through vegetable oils that are in everything. The ratio of Omega  to Omega  in most of these is far higher than the healthy range of  and the fat composition of most of them MUFAPUFASFA creates dangerous levels of H that distort signalling mechanisms to limit the influx of triglycerides to cells ending with very distended adipocytes.I know that perhaps what I just wrote is jargonbut simply not eating foods with linseed rapeseed canola sunflower safflower or even olive oils and using actual butter will go a long ways to restoring proper metabolism and ultimately fat loss. We know that the stearate and oleates in butter and coconut oil are protective helping to mitigate the damage caused by reactive oxygen species ROS or free radicals that end in H.Just thought I would share because your comment seemed insightful and well considered.,Foodforthought,d2quihb,4,t5_2rete

Ill probably get jumped for it but here goes. Every time I read an article like this the same bells go off. The driving force behind so much of this seems to come from the same damned source time and again American conservatives and it doesnt even stop with them.gtthe fusion of antirationalism with antiintellectualismgtThe rise of idiot America today represents  for profit mainly but also and more cynically for political advantage in the pursuit of power  the breakdown of a consensus that the pursuit of knowledge is a good. It also represents the ascendancy of the notion that the people whom we should trust the least are the people who best know what they are talking about. In the new media age everybody is an expert.There are without question two forces working in tandem to promote the antirationalist and antiintellectualist movements today and the first is conservatism.Donald Trump told us that The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitiveIgnore all those scientists theyve been paid off by the liberals who have worked with china to fabricate climate change because they hate the oil industry and china fears we wont want to buy from their sweat shops anymore. This is the logical chain of thoughts that shipped along with Trumps proclamation. And many more like it have been the added baggage of science denial of all kinds for decades. But dont read what the scientists say dont notice that Trump buys from Chinese manufacturing ignore the moral ramifications of sweat shops dont examine anything that might get in the way of your total hatred of liberals and liberalism and certainly dont dare look closely at oil companies.And that takes me to the other parties involved the ones behind the conservative movement the mega corporations particularly oil  energy. We find it strange that voters from rural areas with long histories of distrusting large corporations and with good reason all the way back to those Grapes of Wrath days coupled with a severe hatred of the north dating back to those Gone with the Wind days should not only trust the politicians who are so obviously backed by the shadiest of our most powerful corporations and billionaires but so trust Donald Trump who is to use the rural parlance a slicktalking Yankee businessman from New York. New York City? Get a rope... Remember those days? They are gone replaced by a growing normalization of procorporate culture among all Americans regardless of politics or geography that should probably be its own discussion.How have they so duped the conservative American population into accepting the contradictions right in front of their eyes? How does a billionaire convince you he is for the working class? How does he assure you that your jobs will be safe from immigrant labor when he embraces the practice himself?Ignorance. Antirationalism. Antiintellectualism. And hate. And its been going on for a long time now.Thats how you make sure no intellectuals warnings can be heard you make them despise the liberals entirely invalidating their word on any number of subjects. Thats how you make them not notice Trump imports immigrant labor or buys from China you make them skeptical of everything outside of conservative sources.And they have gone to enormous lengths to provide conservative sources that keep them in the bubble. Conservapedia is perhaps the best example. All the misinformation and lies you could want to control your population with all in one tidy site that by the virtue of becoming the conservative goto for information neatly keeps them away from the dreaded wikipedia which clearly has that liberal bias of not being conservative. They cannot imagine that liberal and some moderate conservative intellectuals and scientists could possibly research topics without political bias as though every botanist and physics professor only put their findings in some sort of liberal light. Because the march of progress and enlightenment rolled over creationism and endangered the profits of climate change causing industries the voters must be made to resent refute and refuse all science lest rationalism alert them to their folly.That has been helped by a longstanding movement to undermine education in America both K and university. And it like many of these conservative movements is not the result of some star chambered cabal that cackles and twirls mustaches it is coming from so many directions each with their own set of beliefs to justify their actions and only loosely coordinated under a banner of conservatism. They are still pushing for school prayer because they need the religion to be state sanctioned for legitimacy. We have the jingoists who demand school must instill citizenship but of course it always turns more into indoctrination replete with oaths and flag waving and... fictitious history.Rewriting history? Texas tackles textbook debateThe Conservative Attempt to Rewrite the United States Progressive History Was Moses a Founding Father?Tea Party Groups In Tennessee Demand Textbooks Overlook U.S. Founders SlaveOwning HistoryBut then theres also a separate but related movement to mess with science coursesConservatives Pressure Textbook Publishers To Downplay Existence Of Climate Change EvolutionTexas New Public School Textbooks Promote Climate Change Denial and Downplay SegregationThe RevisionariesWhen thats not enough theres an entire movement for homeschoolingConservative Christian HomeschoolingHomeschooling Liberty and LibertarianismHomeschooling Americas Hidden Breeding Ground for Conservative IdeologyAnd a push to end public schooling entirely and close the department of education...Abolishing the Department of Education is the Right Thing to DoAnd lest we forget the historic call for an end to critical thinking courses in schools by the Texas GOP in .Then there are endless cuts to funding repeated inflation of class sizes the demonization of teachers and especially teachers unions and many more continual wellfunded and diligent attacks in this multipronged approach to tearing down education. And all of that that I just listed every link only concerns K. Then we move on to the my liberal students frighten me rhetoric flooding through the media.

I think our society has become quite dysfunctional when it comes to young people and sex. A few hundred years ago people started having sex shortly after puberty. This was due to factors such as high infant mortality and little need for education when most people were illiterate farmers. In modern times we need a lower birthrate and people are expected to continue their education into their late teens or early twenties. So there has been all kinds of effort put into changing peoples attitudes and suppressing teenage sexuality. But this does not change basic biological reality. Young people are interested in sex and if they dont learn about it from friendsfamily etc. theyll learn about it from other sources such as online porn. Maybe the real problem is that anything to do with sex makes people emotional and irrational. We cant simply find a practical and reasonable way to discuss and teach it.

Im saying I think there is value in informing other people of your triggers and asking them not to bring them up. Obviously that doesnt mean everyone I meet will get a lecture about my mental disorder. However it does mean that if I intend on spending regular time with someone I will mention it. The implication I got from your post is that I am somehow doing something wrong in this. gt But by limiting topics that can be discussed words that can be used arent you the one limiting everyone elses access to those discussion groups?Yes I am. By asking that we not talk about one topic. If you cant avoid a single topic for the sake of someone elses mental health then I think you need to do some serious soulsearching. Would you avoid talking about war zones if you were around a veteran with PTSD? Or would you get upset with that veteran for asking you not to talk about those things effectively limiting your discussion access? Most people would respect that not being able to talk about a single topic in an entire world of topics is not too much to ask. It seems to be that most people understand this concept...until they dont. Its completely reasonable not to talk to a mother about her child that recently passed away. Its reasonable not to talk about combat with a PTSDstricken veteran. But suddenly when its rape or molestation or violence thats too much to ask? Why?gt Maybe if you just cant handle anything about rabbits you should just excuse yourself from the rabbit lecture that week or not take a class on rabbits ? Other people have a right to their education too.Were not talking about rabbits so dont try to turn this into a discussion about complete bullshit. Were talking about genuine triggers for severe mental disorders. Sometimes that may be something common in which case it may or may not be reasonable to ask others not to talk about it. If you have PTSD regarding airplanes for whatever reason I dont think its unreasonable to ask people not to discuss aviation in general conversation. I do think its unreasonable to ask people not to talk about racism in a class about racism. Its a circumstantial issue that will change depending on the time place and topic. But I think its ridiculous and frankly ignorant to tell people with mental disorders to just handle their problem themselves as if its the easiest thing in the world and refuse to make concessions for them that you would make for other people in the exact same circumstance.,Foodforthought,d6w6fgh,0,t5_2rete

It may not be all of them or even a majority of them but its enough of them and loud enough of them to make this a real issue in campus culture. I didnt suggest the respondents are deliberately lying  but again this is a selfreported survey not a study of actual behavioral output when the issues in question come up.Edit Im also paging through the full study now and its a little more nuanced than you suggest.Students do appear to distinguish controversial views from what they see as hate. They believe colleges should be allowed to establish policies restricting language and behavior that are intentionally offensive to certain groups but not the expression of political views that may upset or offend members of certain groups.There is a real perception that campuses are not fully open environments. A slight majority of students  say the climate on their campus prevents some people from saying what they believe because others might find it offensive.When it comes to a free press  of college students and  of U.S. adults say students should not be able to prevent the press from covering protests on college campuses.But students are divided when evaluating certain specific reasons to curtail press access with nearly half saying the following reasons are legitimate to do so The people at the protest or public gathering believe reporters will be biased  the people at the protest say they have a right to be left alone  and the people at the protest want to tell their own story on the Internet and social media .So already theres a divide between theory and practice.,Foodforthought,d72aiq4,0,t5_2rete

The graphic representation counts answers of A lot of confidence as one category and lumps Some confidence and Little confidence into the same category.

Unfortunately this isnt editorialization from Vox  the original survey that they link to does the same thing.What is deceptive editorialization is this paragraphgtBy contrast a Gallup poll conducted during the same approximate time period found that the general public felt significantly differently toward these institutions than young folks  percent had some level of confidence in banks  percent in big business and  percent in the criminal justice system.The Gallup poll does further break down the answers  into Great deal quite a lot some very little none and no opinion. If we apply the same methodology of only counting people with the highest confidence intervals as having confidence in each institution then the results would be  confidence in banks  in big business and  confidence in the criminal justice system  just about in line with millennials. In fact the general population using that methodology would have even less confidence in banks and big business than millennials.

The marine corps in particular is practically religious about enlisted leadership and pushes responsibility down to the lowest possible level in the rank structure. Really nowhere else can a  year old corporal be given life and death responsibility and leadership over his juniors. Also a bit that you touched on is that roles in enlisted vs officer are different not only in scope but in type. An enlisted person is a specialist. They are a rifleman or a f mechanic or a radar tech etc etc. Officers otoh are expected to be generalists. Take an officer from one role and drop him in another and hes expected to learn his requirements and resources and direct those under him in such a way to achieve the goal.

How could they lose. gt...What Mook and company still cant fathom is that almost every national election is ultimately about economics or more properly how people feel about their economic security.Thats just not true.... and often when it is true its based on economic identities. Clinton would have been better likely for the white working class who have traditionally leaned democrat not least of all because of healthcare. Thats not what people are voting on. I agree Clinton ran a bad campaign she was weak on all messaging Im with her okay... but give me a reason to be with her?. Sanders and Trump made plenty of economically based identity claims and thats one of the reasons they were more successful than people expectedthey played identity well just like Reagan or B. Clinton played identity well.B. Clinton didnt win Southern electoral votes that Democrats havent won then or since because his economic message was better. Clinton won those because he connected with those voters they felt he sticks up for people like us hes got our best interests at heart. As a counferfacfual if H. Clinton could have done better identity politics and turned out Black voters in PA WI and MI she could have won. All the data hasnt been analyzed yet but one of the big problems of the Hillary coalition in those areas vs Obamas coalition was that Obama got much bigger turn outs in the black parts of Philadelphia Milwaukee and Detroit. Those votes would have been more than enough to win. The author also doesnt mention that Indiana is  Black and that really helped Obama as well not to mention that some of Indiana is in Illinois media markets so he had a small degree of home turf advantage in terms of pre election exposureobviously high black turn out wasnt the only thing that mattered in IN as the author writes but Obamas win would have been impossible without it.I really dislike how implicitly Marxist the left of center press is. It makes it harder for Democrats to see roads beyond very old fashioned class politics. Dont get me wrong I think that Hillarys campaign was very badly run using a very bad set of strategic assumptions and they should have had a clearer economic message for the working class for the middle class for the  for anyone really.

10513894,0,t1_dczty81,Im saying Milo should come and debate without the incentive to pay.  If hes passionate about his worldview surely hell be moved to do so without the prospect of being paid.  Im not moving the goalposts Im refusing to allow the goalposts of constructivr debate to be moved from where they stand.  In my mind theres a distinction.  Milos speeches are a threat to constructive dialogue in and of itself. Permitting him to speak is providing him with a mechanism in which he can do serious damage to constructive discourse. My big issue is that Milo doesnt advertise his agenda for what it is.  For example I dont think FOX or MSNBC broadcasting a show with a pundit making commentary should be called news. Its entertainment.  That doesnt make it wrong that doesnt mean it isnt useful but it should be advertised for what it is.  Calling it news appropriates a level of credibility that they arent entitled to.  Milo does the same thing. Hes targeting these universities with the several purposes.  He wants to undermine not just an opposing viewpoint hes trying to poison the discourse itself. Hes trying to gain attention to enrich himself.  If he made an earnest effort to make his view heard accomodations would be made so that he has a way to speak.  But he hasnt.  Hes nothing more than a troll.  Basic rule dont feed them.  We can argue over whether allowing him or preventing him from speaking is feeding him more but I dont think that hes earned the privilege to speak on a UC campus.  ,Foodforthought,dczv1t0,7,t5_2rete

So while you cannot say that uranium is NOT there unless we develop technology to detect a single atom in a sample it just wasnt detected by an analysis that can detect as low as ppb.

10994119,0,t1_dedx90v,gtNeil DeGrasse Tyson said it best Chimps are  of the DNA of humans. That  to  is the difference between prodding a stick in a hole to catch ants and a stellarator a fuge by Bach the charged coupled device evolution theory the theory of relativity and Apple computers. What would happen if an intelligence arose that was  further from us in the direction that we are removed from the chimps? Any intelligence would not even bother talking to us. Just as we dont bother talking to chimpanzees unless we study them and for no other reason.The problem with this specific paragraph notwithstanding the rest of the post is that it assumes that this conception of intelligence is wellfounded. However let me give you a reason to believe it is not there is a certain sense in which chimpanzees are at  humans are at  and it is very unlikely any agent which obeys quantum mechanics could be higher than  our language communication is Turingcomplete. This can be seen by constructing sentences such as the output of X turing machine. As such we can note that if a neural structure is able to record and recall information in a Turingcomplete format it has achieved a certain ability humans are the only animal with this ability. However we can also note that by the laws of physics no computational paradigm beyond Turingcompleteness can exist in a physical system. Thus in a certain sense human language is the most expressive possible. Continued investment in brainpower will not provide a more expressive language for human beings so Evolution in its infinite wisdom stopped. Similarly its not clear that continued investment in brainpower will produce better fugues computers or particle accelerators. No artificial intelligence will ever design a heat engine that beats the Ericsson cycle or a wind turbine that operates above . efficiency or beat humans at tictactoe. Not because its a computer but because those things are actually impossible period. This is particularly important when you notice that most of our advantages over the chimpanzees only appeared after we were able to harness the remarkable expressive power of our language in the form of writing. As such while I expect computers to supersede human abilities in many if not most areas I think its not likely that many of the frankly magical abilities postulated for AI will ever appear. Transforming the whole Universe into a computer would violate the laws of thermodynamics so we know it wont happen. Achieving perfect political harmony might be done with enough sociological datagathering but theres no way in hell a computer is going to simulate the wet and warm brains and bodies of billions of humans working from physical firstprinciples in order to calculate it. Such an achievement would be transcomputational,Foodforthought,dee5dbz,7,t5_2rete

Theyre real people who issued real pledges it wasnt some bizarre scare tactic devised by the DNC Overlords. with the intent being to demoralize his supporters by creating the impression that they just could not win? Seriously? How do you think superdelegates work exactly? gtTheir support of the establishment candidate was a foregone conclusion when the contest began. It was never in question.Except Clinton enjoyed exactly the same benefit in the  race. She had a massive lead in endorsements and superdelegate commitments going into the Iowa caucuses. The trend halted and finally reversed when Obama began catching up with her in the popular vote. He overtook her in the popular vote the week after Super Tuesday and it was a real fight from February th through May th. Obama clinched on June rd Clinton conceded June th.So we know that the superdelegates commitment to the establishment candidate was not at all beyond question because we just saw this story play out in the most recent open Democratic presidential primary! The superdelegates always gravitate to the popular vote leader. This makes them worthless but on the other hand I sure wish the GOP had some as a firewall against Trump.Sanders never did this.  He never came close.  He started out losing and stayed that way throughout the race.  I repeat he lost Alabama by  points.  It doesnt matter that he eked out a close win in Michigan by  points because Clinton ran up the vote tallies over and over again in every state in the Deep South  the home of the critical Black Vote for Democrats. In a popularvote primary thats fatal.Sanders lost because he didnt appeal to the majority of Democratic primary voters. There was a conspiracy to hobble him but it had no meaningful effect on the outcome because the race was never close.

Why not just include a blanket statement saying WE CAN KICK YOU OFF FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER?gt.... to indicate that the regulation applies to oversold flights. Youre really overthinking this. It means what it says and no more.As opposed to what? A flight is either oversold or its not.Again I ask the question if its axiomatic that an airline can kick you off of a flight whether its oversold or not why include the phrase in the event of an oversold flight?? Why not just say In the event of a flight? Or even better just not include the phrase at all and just state that airlines must inconvenience the fewest number of passengers possible.And further if what youre saying is true which its not then doesnt it seem odd that they wrote a rule addressing people getting kicked off of flights that ARE oversold but not addressing what happens when people get kicked off of flights that ARE NOT oversold? That seems unlikely. If they are already addressing oversold situations it wouldnt have taken a great deal more effort to write a rule addressing nonoversold situations.The issue is that you are underthinking this which I would expect from someone with no legal training and yes I am a lawyer.gtAlso a CFR is not a statute.
