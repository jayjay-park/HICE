Im in my phone but you can go to elementary update and look fot the tutorial what to do afyer installing Luna and the las part is about updating the kernel. Also if you are going to install gnome . I think its better a clean install. ,elementaryos,cg15pxd,1,t5_2t8qw

1996058,0,t3_2hh8yo,What did you expect? Luna is seriously outdated. Im surprised you even considered Luna this far into the game. Im not sure how familiar you are with the Linux distro scene but Ubuntu is quite well known to lag behind other distros in terms of being uptodate. Luna being based on . was already outdated when it was released.The trick for best compatibility with Linux distros in general is to ensure that the hardware youre using is reasonably older than the distro. The HP  was released well after . so unless you were planning on using the hardware enablement stack you were bound to run into compatibility issues.Im a developer myself Android embedded systems and Freya is reasonably stable for me for daily usework on my Dell XPS . Ill take the features better performance hardware compatibility and battery life any day over the occasional bugs. FWIW Im using the latest Liquorix kernel . with an upgraded graphics stack from the Oibaf ppa.My recommendation is to just use Freya but if youre afraid of running into scary bugs then stick with Ubuntu. If youre looking for something less bloated Xubuntu or Lubuntu are great choices and look decent too.,elementaryos,cktq4ip,2,t5_2t8qw

2322866,0,t3_2lwdxb,Im no expert on syslinux but it seems to be used for booting linux kernels from usb not for a windows installation iso. Did you just copy syslinux and the windows iso to the usb or is there some other tool you used? If you just copied them it wont work.Installing windows XP from USB is actually harder then you might think since microsoft never built an official way to do it usbs simply werent that common yet when XP was released. There are solutions but all that I could find are windows only. All tools for linux can only make USB installers for windows  or higher. If it is at all possible I would recommend you to burn your windows XP iso to a cd using a proper tool to burn isos dont just burn the iso file to the cd it wont work! or to use a windows pc to build an xp USB stick rufus seems easy.,elementaryos,clytj2m,2,t5_2t8qw

8896268,0,t3_5245ac,Id check if there was a backported kernel in the repositories first. Usually there is a newer kernel available there if you really need it. wgeting a kernel from someplace else really isnt safe unless its been signed by the kernel developers and youve checked that it matches the md signature of the official kernel. Manually upgrading the kernel this way prevents your package manager from properly keeping track of it to upgrade. aptget will know its there but cant really do anything with it. Plus you could have issues with dependencies and kernel headers breaking as drivers and low level components get updated assuming aptget doesnt give you an error when trying to update and prevent you from doing so. Id only recommend upgrading your kernel without a package manager or not from LokisUbuntus repos under dire circumstances.spId personally go with making a bug report then do anything recommended by the Elementary OS devs before switching kernels. If upgrading the kernel is all that is needed the fix it then that seems easy enough to fix with an OS update. spLoki was just released so Id expect a few tiny bugs here and there for the next  months as more people are using it and are able to find bugs more just from the sheer number of people using it. Id give the devs a chance to fix those bugs before rushing off to change major components of the OS. Otherwise Id make a pull request so that they can merge the fix so that everyone isnt off manually fixing Loki on their own.,elementaryos,d7h7d39,10,t5_2t8qw

9485186,0,t3_5apd5z,While Im not an eOS dev Im pretty sure that the upgrade process will be similar to that of Freya gt Loki especially since theyve done away with the standalone Software Updater the application responsible for upgrading Ubuntu releases which elementary is based on. Its quite a shame that its done this way as this is one of the things that holds me back from recommending the OS to friends. If they want an up to date version they have to dig through elementarys website figure out how to download the new version for free remember to back up their personal files find out how to make a USB or DVD installer and know how to reset up all of their applications. I understand there are drawbacks as outlined by the Linux Mint community but its certainly more convenient to just have a oneclick upgrade button to install a new OS release.,elementaryos,d9i93wp,1,t5_2t8qw

Upgrade will do so.If neither of these work try the elementary Stack Exchange. This answer might help you although it might be worth opening a new question as that one was from Freya and not Loki.

10253827,0,t1_dc64jjx,I was still pretty happy with the OS but the whole touch bar thing just pushed me over the edge. About three years ago I bought a maxed out Mac Mini as I wanted a machine I could use with my own displays. My plan was for it to be a placeholder as Id save for a bit then upgrade to a Mac Pro so Id have dedicated graphics. But when I was ready to buy I was told by Mac enthusiasts I should wait for it to be updated which everyone was repeatedly confident would happen at the next big event.After waiting years I already had to break and buy a PC for tasks I needed dedicated graphics on. I was still using my Mac Mini for my main work but it was starting to show its age so I was now waiting on a MacBook Pro update instead. When the update for professionals finally came and it pretty much consisted of taking away the escape key and function keys I use all the time they lost me. Im not about to drop    on hardware that still doesnt give me strong graphics and actually makes my work more difficult. end rantElementary OS is doing a wonderful job at presenting itself as a Mac and Windows alternative. When I decided I wanted out of Mac I specifically thought Id try Elementary rather than Linux in general because it looked like it would give me what I liked in MacOS. Its doing the world a great service.,elementaryos,dc6bsnh,2,t5_2t8qw
