2696301,0,t3_2qxmib,There have been staff and quite a few riders who have played with upgrading their bearings as well as even replacing the pulley bearing with ceramics.The upgrade to better bearings in the wheels with a good oil lube is noticeable when coasting and pushkicking. No one who replaced the pulley bearing noticed any difference or improvement and in fact the stock pulley bearing after it breaks in tends to be better than any replacement weve seen. The stock bearing is really high quality with stainless balls and races.The main difference with upgraded bearings can only be felt when coasting and not using the motors. There doesnt seem to be any range improvements.The biggest drawback to swapping the bearings is the maintenance. The stock bearings are really well sealed with a grease based lubricant. They take a while to break in sometimes a couple hundred miles but they also are almost zero maintenance. Most upgraded bearings arent sealed as well and they have lower viscosity lubes. This means that you need to frequently add more lube and clean your bearings every other week or so if you are commuting every day.The marginal improvement in coasting tends to not be worth all the extra maintenance. If you do push kick a lot to supplement your range you will enjoy the upgrade but make sure you keep up with the maintenance or the Swiss ceramics especially degrade in a couple months.,boostedboards,cnaixfz,4,t5_2y4ip

3800116,0,t3_33wi0j,Liran  thanks kindly for posting this. I think my noise is for better or worse a bit different. Ive posted a link below.   When Im on the board when its weight bearing you can hear the click. You cant hear it when Im just spinning the wheels. What you can hear is both a high pitch and a low pitch whine overunder the sound of the motor. The low pitch sounds like a warble or flat tire a bearing issue? The high pitch comes in under acceleration. Neither noises were present when the board first arrived and both noises started on the same day on the same start of a ride.I replaced all the bearings including the large radial bearing and both drive belts.  Made sure the drive wheel nuts were not overly tightened. The high pitch whine is so loud it actually scares people when Im on the trail. Suddenly Ive got people yelling at me when Im riding its that annoying. Ive done everything I know how to do  it will go into Boosted under warranty.,boostedboards,cqpfyjq,1,t5_2y4ip

If you look in the little windows on the end of the motor you may see that the windings look burned.The good news is I sent it in and got a new motor and now it works great again  Id forgotten how much power the dual motor is supposed to have.Do you ever use the motors to keep the board still when youre stopped on a grade? I did that before  I think thats probably bad for the motors since they are stuggling to keep the board still and not getting any cooling from air movement.

5349049,0,t1_cvuznad,I crashed going max speed on pro mode. The road I was riding on had a bike lane if you can call it that decline that I was half using half just going in the road when it was clear. Not much traffic during the time of the crash. I saw a big pile of gravel in the bike lane so I checked for cars real quick and I looked back just long enough not to notice a crack that was big enough to catch my front wheels and well thats exactly what happened. My wheels got stuck in the big crack in the road and my board stopped but I did not oh no I kept going like I was super man flying. Happened day  of ownership. Lucky me I did not break anything! I fall on an energy drink and squished it which I think bruised my ribs. Other than that I lost a lot of skin on my hands and right forearm. Funny thing is I was right around the corner from my house so I just hopped back on my board skinless and all and skated home. That was almost exactly  weeks ago. ,boostedboards,cvveggt,2,t5_2y4ip

5385653,0,t3_3o9ddw,As others have said on a walking street without cars it will be heard clearly. Strong acceleration increases the sound a lot even for a modest amount. Very slow acceleration at a pace like when youre crisscrossing among pedestrians is not very more noisy than just coasting.However the single most important variable is the ground surface. Coarse pavement makes the board vibrate and sound alot.Also a new board will make less noise than one where the bearings have started to wear or whatever it is that makes the weels a bit more noisy and other parts might have become a bit squeaky.,boostedboards,cw02t0s,1,t5_2y4ip

6809760,0,t1_d0o5on2,Sorry but that doesnt add up.. batteries dont have to be flexible for this to work. You just mount a battery box with rubber spacers that absorb the flex of the board. Its only ever going to flex downside to side not up so you can easily do this. You could also add the batteries horizontally across the underside to reduce the flex issue even further. From what I can tell they just didnt bother adding more because they think the current range is good enough for most people using it as a last mile device.

7424151,0,t1_d2m24i6,I made a belt replacement video not too long ago At  I am putting back in one of the socket cap screws just to show you the area Im talking about. Assuming youve never taken anything apart you probably dont have a a  hex wrench so you cant physically check to feel for a screw. Youre going to need to look in each slot for the socket cap screws and see if you still see one in there. If one is lost it should look different than the others. Hard to explain Id take a picture but Im at work atm. But if you see that all slots look the same than one is probably just loose and is about to fall out. Best bet is to get a belt replacement kit from boosted so you get both the screws  hex wrench and spare belts in case they snap in the future or just order the socket cap screws. You can get a pack of  screws for about  here and just get a  hex wrench from a hardware store or amazon. ,boostedboards,d2m2sve,3,t5_2y4ip
7446689,0,t1_d2obsox,The cycle life is the number of complete chargedischarge cycles that the battery is able to support before that its capacity falls under  of its original capacity. So if the battery is discharged to   and then charged to  it isnt a complete cycle. recharges from  to  is one cycle  charges from  to  is  cycleSimilar to a mechanical device that wears out faster with heavy use so also does the depth of discharge DoD determine the cycle count. The smaller the depth of discharge the longer the battery will last. If at all possible avoid frequent full discharges and charge more often between uses. If full discharges cannot be avoided try utilizing a larger battery. Partial discharge on Liion is fine there is no memory and the battery does not need periodic full discharge cycles other than to calibrate the fuel gauge on a smart battery.My point is that the batterys life will be longer if you do a partial discharge but its unrealistic in the boosted board scenario. Youre not gonna travel for . miles re charge the battery and travel for another . miles.,boostedboards,d2on3i6,1,t5_2y4ip

There are differences in belt tension wheel tension bearings etc.  So differences in wheel rotation is normal.Your motor mounts will continue to receive road scratches.  Normal wear and tear.Battery recalibration is suggested when your range becomes compromised.  I went from about a . mile range to . mile range after a few months.  Flip your board over.  Tape your trigger down and run your fully charged board to  three times.  I dont think you will need to recalibrate your board for a while.Enjoy your new ride!,boostedboards,d2p8wix,2,t5_2y4ip

They told me that I could come in after my initial purchase because I rode the board home to pick up the box that it came in for shipping that way I could send it back to you guys for repair and you guys were awesome about that even though its a used board we came to a mutual agreement that you guys would do a fullservice because of a miscommunication between me and one of your service reps... anyway....I now have no box to send it in no charge working and no way to contact the store that sold me their defective batterydamaged noncharging board.

I have plenty of board experience too not downhill lb and Ive never felt the need for that kind of protection. Anyways assess the risk of your activity and use an appropriate level of protection. You just wont see me out there dressed in Shoei gear on my  mile commute to work. Lets all have fun out there and watch out for cars!

Once you reach the speed required for a TBI to happen your helmet is unable to stop the impact from your brain hitting the inside of your skull.You can google it. Its why big sports like the NHL and NFL are redesigning helmets  since current helmets suck vs. TBI.No one here is saying not to wear a helmet. In fact everyone in here is saying helmets are great and people should wear them especially to prevent your head getting fractured or split open. The fact remains that they dont help a whole lot vs. TBI and concussions though and better helmets do need to be designed if we ever want them to help stop TBIs.,boostedboards,d80pg30,2,t5_2y4ip

10542695,0,t3_5qyno9,I like to think that Boosted is performing pretty terribly but RLoD and  issue with the motor is inconsequential. You have k boards out there. Failure rate is minimal. They fix broken boards. The issue is if they stop fixing broken boards.    The shit Im waiting for is the extended battery post to come at the end of January. We have a couple days left to find out how delayed the only remaining selling point will be.    ,boostedboards,dd34rjg,7,t5_2y4ip

Not only this but no water resistantance and a battery recall. A final slap in the face was a  credit towards accessories only in your website. I think you should offer us customers who stuck with you throughout some special deal to trade in the nd generation boosted to a rd generation when you likely announce in .

10668721,0,t3_5sn4hf,. Its rare that you will need to replace them  many go hundreds of miles with no issues  but a random stray rock or something can tear them sooner. You can pick extra sets up from here . The wheels handle pretty much everything you throw at them.. The grip tape will last years as long as you take care of it. Pick up some abrasive cleaner and clean it on occasion. As far as remote disconnections with the V Ive never had it lose connection once.The only other suggestions I would have are to pick up some bash guards from flatlandD to preserve the ends of your board and compressed air to clean hard to reach areas on the board.Hope that helped!

10758586,0,t3_5tjw5x,Boosted has enough investors from private to VCs.  They are located near the heart of Silicon Valley its easy to gauge where you stand out here because there is technology and startups everywhere. If for some reason then need help sourcing talent they are not coming to Reditt for it.  One of their VC is SV Angel they would have answers. Im sure they know what they are doing its just the angry mob waiting for their boards are getting impatient.

A quick swap batt with no tools required would be my only change to v extended so I could rock  miles in pro and have a second battery at the ready.

10979717,0,t1_deci178,Also to clarify why Boosted doesnt do this with their packs its simple. They have to make sure they meet a certain factor of safety. They cant afford to have battery issues like the one they recently had. So they have to use the super durable ones they currently use which also happen to meet the power output their motors require. Its the most obvious choice for them. The unfortunate aspect here is that its much more difficult to get longer range this way.,boostedboards,decilq2,7,t5_2y4ip
