5052934,0,t1_cuv1llx,I assumed because you are bringing up these points in a subreddit of the actual fangame that you are referring to the fangame. I dont understand why you would talk about it otherwise. So I guess while it seemed irrelevant to you it made sense to me. You probably should have said before that it doesnt apply to fangames its just your gripe with GameFreak. As a side note I do like the TM system but I dont think it should apply to all moves. I still think grinding for move swaps is a necessary evil when its involving stuff like old level up moves or special moves obtained with BP. TMs are TMs because they are supposed to be accessible. I dont feel like you should be able to swap to moves on a whim just to deal with anticipated threats. Good examples of this are things like Greninja or Gengar with  moveslot syndrome or various grass types with annoying status moves you wouldnt bother with outside of harder fights. If you remove the grinding it means you dont really have to think about your choices in the long run.If it was something unlocked for postgame though that would make more sense. It makes swapping movesets for competitive battlingendgame content easier if you cant acquire multiples of the same poke. But ingame story I think it would be counterproductive to having moveslots in the first place. on a similar note no more broken exp share plz,etherealgates,cuv2jbx,1,t5_37t89

6186861,0,t3_40an37,I think its due to the program they used to create the game. Same thing ash been happening to allot of people Its just one big area thats being rendered at once the developers are looking to fix it. ,etherealgates,cysvqnk,1,t5_37t89
