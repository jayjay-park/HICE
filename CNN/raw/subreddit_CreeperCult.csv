11455763,0,t3_61icjz,Just found this subreddit so Im late but this album is incredible!  I get a lot of old school AFI vibes from Poison Pens and a lot of Alkaline Trio vibes from Darling.  I love all of the singles this band is such a breath of fresh air these guys are gonna be huge!,CreeperCult,dfui3ps,1,t5_3hzir
