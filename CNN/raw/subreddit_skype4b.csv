6612991,0,t1_cz6wdzx,We started using Lync Desktop sharing over remote assistance in the service desk I used to work for. I would provide the user a quick instruction on how to share their desktop and have them give me control. It worked great for support purposes.,skype4b,d03c843,1,t5_34hwe

7468143,0,t3_4gsqu0,Something that sticks out thats a bit odd is I would expect this size of deployment to have gone with a standard Lync pool which does not require a back end SQL server.  If they are running an enterprise Lync pool that seems like overkill for  users and having a back end SQL server when you dont need to have one just seems like a lot of unnecessary cost.  I would be inclined to go with a standard pool with local SQL store on any new Skype server for a deployment of this size.  They really wont be missing anything as if they only have a single front end server they dont have any of the resilience of an enterprise pool anyway. If you just move the users to the new pool when its all up and running you wont have to worry about doing anything with the old SQL database.I guess what they have at the moment could be a standard server as I have a feeling  might have let you specify a non local SQL but I dont have any  to hand to be able to check that.  Skype  topology builder does not let you specify a non local SQL store on a standard server pool.If you do go with a standard server with a local SQL store you will find that much easier to setup as the installs pretty much do it all for you and you dont really have to have any SQL knowledge.I would agree with the other comments this seems a fairly risky thing to be taking on with no experience of LyncSkype.  ,skype4b,d2r2ykr,1,t5_34hwe

8652263,0,t3_4yd4fe,My junior admins asked for the same thing and I told them no way. Be part of the team and use it as support channel dont try to hide.  Having users contact you via Skype to try and get around the helpdesk is no different than the phone. You need to stand up for yourself and your policies and enforce them regardless its not that big of an interruption you really should just deal with it.,skype4b,d6n5a6m,3,t5_34hwe

9338571,0,t1_d8zhcr2,Getting these logs are not super easy. You will need to get familiar with the Lync Server  Resource Kit  there are a lot of blogs out there that will get you ramped up on how to use the Kit do a trace and analyze the logs using Snooper.The one thing I can quickly point out once you get familiar with everything is to do a trace on the FE and Edge servers with the S and SipStack Components selected,skype4b,d8zqd7j,1,t5_34hwe

11109685,0,t3_5yjuyo,The only thing I can think of at the moment is that in order to light up Cloud PBX PSTN Conferencing you will need to purchase addon licenses for each user that you want to be enable the ability to schedule DialIN meetings. So it might be a good idea to take a look at your current DialIn conferencing solution and do a comparison in terms of features.,skype4b,der9uen,1,t5_34hwe
