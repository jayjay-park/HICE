1251328,0,t1_ciac0ho,I totally agree. I havent had the time to really come up with this kind of end user training stuff. You may even notice that the CGB website is a little sparse on the subject. If you or anyone else ends up coming up with some good content I can post it to the official website. Of course it should be generic enough to benefit others and can be CGBized for the site. Such content would logically make its way into the CryptoTown guide.,GotCrypto,ciae1ej,1,t5_307at
