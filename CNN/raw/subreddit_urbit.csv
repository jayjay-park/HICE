WeChat manages to tie together what we do today with a bunch of separate services in a single unified UI.  Rather than bouncing between interfaces that all have their own login and siloed data  you communicate and manage your digital life in one place.  Third party services are just API connections.  We have desktop OSes that were designed for managing local data.  They do an okay job of connecting us to the web which is where most of our data is these days.  Somehow theres really nothing on the web that feels like an OS.  WeChat is the only early exception we have.  Theres a big difference between Urbit and WeChat of course Urbit is a general purpose computer.  It can never be as tightly or centrally controlled as WeChat.  Also WeChat isnt exactly the nicest looking UI.  Another way to think about it imagine youre building the Alto but your computer contains all of your cloud data and spans all of your connected devices.  What exactly does that look like?  I have an idea or two  which should probably end up in a blog post  but you get the idea.We talked about this vision of the future a bit on the Ether Review podcast the other day and I did my best to be sort of noncommittal about it.  Its difficult to tackle design problems in an open source way.  Building a cloud computer is a really ambitious goal.  Wed very much like to get all the way there.  Urbit is an OS and that has to be true through to the UI.So how exactly do we get there?  At a high level the path is simple first Urbit is a toy thats fun to play with.  Next Urbit is a mirror of all your existing data that lets you do new things.  Finally Urbit is the primary copy  your permanent personal archive on the network.Lets work forward from today Urbit is still somewhat unstable so its difficult to ask people to really invest time in building things on top.  Were working to stabilize the system over the next few months so we can focus more fully on evangelism.  In part this is outlined here Part of stabilizing Urbit is also getting the crypto system closer to being ready to use real live keys.  Urbit namespace isnt a currency but we do expect people to distribute it. Our next stability milestone is also the right time to try to really use Urbit to host the Urbit community.  Our tools for doing this are pretty rough and limited.  A while ago someone asked me When will there be a Facebook  of Urbit?  I think the answer is Early  mid .   Before Urbit is a fullfledged cloud computer as described above it has to be a kind of meta social network.  Your Urbit should connect to all your existing services so you can actually program with and control your diffuse cloud data.  Think IFTTT if it were actually a computer.  This is a fairly large and fun community undertaking.  Building API connectors UI components etc.  This can be worked on before we reach Full Continuity. Insert laundry list of technical milestones that are necessary for full continuity.  I think primarily in terms of things that an individual would use. Full continuity opens up a whole new set of potential applications.  With a secure and permanent network we can think about storing secrets financial and biomedical data.  Securely controlling physical devices and personal infrastructure.That creates most of the bridge from here to what I described above.  Are all these specifics going to be correct?  Probably not  but its a good rough guide.  The main thing is were pretty confident we can do it.  We also owe the world a good deal more communication on this front.  Which will come.,urbit,d9m4nxt,8,t5_2ylj3
