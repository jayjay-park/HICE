29128,0,t3_1uee3n,Wow this is a long post... im afraid i didnt read it all. Might i suggest that Mojang experiment with judgement to make it funner. I would suggest trying  second turns. Try letting players start with  of each resource for a quicker start and assistance for multiresource decks which they all are. They could also try other things like making enchantments less common in the selection screen or making rares more common  all the good scrolls are impossible to get you are left with the crappy ones. ,Scrolls,cehqydh,0,t5_2scq0

48601,0,t1_cejyhm0,Well  were a small team doing the best with what feedback we can collect and our own insight into the meta. Sometimes well make mistakes its not impossible this change is one of them but I think its far too early to tell. I dont see the harm in trying out changes that correspond to adjusting perceived issues. In this particular case Wings Captain was redesigned shortly before release and in the process I believe it was made a little too costeffective. Whether this change or something else will hit live remains to be seen.Were sharing these things on the dev blog to be as open as possible about development. The downside of course is that anything we discuss even on the less dev blog which is meant to be a less official source of information than the scrolls.com blog is often taken as finished decisions.,Scrolls,cejyovt,5,t5_2scq0

142339,0,t1_ceum44j,In what way are the mechanics of judgement bad? Yes removal is king in that mode but I dont find that thats super different from other games with similar types. Although good balance in all game modes is something that they must strive for to some degree nothing thats out right now is written in stone because its still in beta. On top of all of that theyve already stated that there are many more cards to come so i think commenting on the state of the game and bluntly saying its a failure is sort of short sighted. I can see by your many posts in this tread that this game put a bad taste in your mouth at some point and Im not trying to dissuade your opinions as much as understand it. When I bought in to this beta I bought it because I saw a game that I might enjoy that showed promise and so far I honestly think the devs have done pretty well making a game thats fun and has heart but I also understand that its nowhere near done yet. Along with that I also bought this with the understanding that it was a gamble The game wasand is in beta so it could change into something I resented or just collapse entirely.EDITkinda got rambly at the end there...sorry bout that,Scrolls,ceun5bi,2,t5_2scq0

590686,0,t1_cg7amjf,Even without Wild when you build multiresource decks you are going to have a lot more resources. There are many reasons for this including using resources cards thoughtout your deck which will most likely continue to be used later in the game giving you lots of spare resources. Its also because you wont always have the scrolls to use both resources so if you have  decay scrolls you cant use your energy giving you a lot left over. This means that resource pumping mechanics become a lot strong in this regard. You can pump a solemn giant every turn and still have no problem playing the other scrolls in your hand.,Scrolls,cg7ey19,1,t5_2scq0

Hes saying  gtEvery time I play it though I get destroyed and Im not really sure why. With other games strategy or TCG I can usually see what Ive done wrong its a little more quantifiable.This is probably because in Judgement I dont know the right cards to pick and in constructed I just dont have the cards to make a good deck but all the same Im finding it hard to learn.That means that hes saying that its probably because what cards he picks and that has nothing to do with rarities to be honest. This is why a lot has said that you can reach top  without rares because that means that playing good this doesnt mean having a good deck has a lot to say in this game.gtNo wrong again. The health of the game matters most.What? We were talking about reaching top but ok.gtThis game lacks progression and what you said is counter intuitive to new players. I have yet to see a new player follow that path when it requires you to spend your money very wisely and use player made bots. From a new players perspective the first good deck is not nearly as simple as you try to make it out to be.Ok I knew the price of the cards because a new player asked me to buy one Great Wolf because he cant successfully trade with ClockWork he had the trade button off so yeah new players are using the bots.gtAll you need is a  winrate and you too can barely make the top  with no rares. Amazing reasoning you have there!This doesnt mean that. You start the game with some free rares and not with  rares so for a pro gamer like Blinky he could reach top  with no rares but new players has actually rares what a surprise.

1573526,0,t1_cjcw88w,I think this is the best solution because it keeps the devs from having to worry about the possibility of unintended broken lingering effects if they choose to create any in the future that are very powerful on their own. We have some of those now potentially so by avoiding the decision to make them subpar dumbed down scrolls they can keep the power level the same as they are currently or make some of the lesser ones stronger. Besides we have antilingering scrolls so those allow a counter anyway. ,Scrolls,cjdikiu,2,t5_2scq0

None of the Growth Units work and that was the hint I was given.Starting to agree that this is just click bait.Edit So its spelled assasian in the hint but it actually wants you to type assassin which I must have typed accidentally before. This is so fucking shoddy.Edit nd hint was Frost  not mustache. I had already typed in Frostbeard before but I did it again. Still access denied.Edit After typing in assassin for  minutes straight I got the hint Below Nor Mountains. The answer is Khaile which gives you the hint the old name. Theres no old name for Khaile but I thought it was a reference to Jeb minecraft dev since its a name he goes by.

Grave Gruel Brace yourself Uhu pump to  resource followed by god hand is coming. Not sure i like this change. Stone Enigma Good change worth playing now. Skull Shrine Eh not sure if this is good enough may still be to good but we see. I think it should have linger . Somata Sift How do you talk balance about this card? I mean it is not overpowered until it cost  or possibly  so it is fine atm. Arbalestier Fair change dealing  damage on next unit instead of  has a impact. Mudo Fighter Dude you can use animovore on this guy now D . Not sure if he is good now people say he is so i will just trust their words. Slithering Form Interesting buff if i know i will face MES i have not hesistation to even splash this now. Stormknight I felt he was balanced before and did not need a nerf but fine then he is still good the health was not the important part. Ruse From bad against anything to nieche and that is fine to have in the game. This card is now good against Growth decent against Order bad against Decay and rather useless against Energy unless they play gravelock. Banner of Ordinance Not sure if i feel this is a buff or nerf i know it is meant to be a buff but this turned it from being a ward against lingering to be a lingering countdowner that you can activate with spells. Is that better? not sure. Clandestine Orchard Fair enough this is really double edge sworded. Fodder Pit Fair change. Roal Inspiration This is worth playing for many now as soon as you get dominion you draw  specific cards for  cost that is definetly worth. Gravelock Guard The effect itself i dont feel is amazing but he got now synergy with fodder pit with smuggler and ironclad so is that  total pillage units in the force that is enough to try fodder pit. Sinmarked Zealot Good change been asking for it for some time it is not exactly competitive but it is viable now.

It totally depends on how Microsoft wants to structure it.There is no such thing as legally required to maximize profits.  If you arent profitable your stock becomes unattractive to investors.  Thats all.  If interest in your stock becomes so low it can be delisted from the market.  Youll need to trade those stocks elsewhere.  The company can regain market listing if they raise the price.For example I think XM radio was delisted for a bit when it went from  bucks a share to  cents a share before they merged with Sirius.  NASDAQ requires generally speaking a dollar share price.  XM radio did not go to jail or suffer any kind of fines for a  cent stock price though.

One mana is much more valuable than one hp  Wings Shield is almost always better unless you need to fill out a curve.

2647331,0,t3_2q8cg7,In my view PW has two connotations. The first is gaining an advantage over others through having something they dont via cash purchases and the second is that there are plateaus in game which almost always necessitate a player spending money to advance.If we look at Scrolls then its immediately apparent that a player can Grind to Meta decks GM if they like the only plateau is skill and time. If a player was able to purchase all of the scrolls at the start then they may be able to breeze through the lower levels of ranked but they will still hit a plateau where other players will have equal decks andor greater skill than them.It is a requirement in all CCGs that a player plan their own journey gaining skill and experience and no amount of money can replicate this. What it will do however is give them everything they need to learn the game. Trials for example are effectively puzzles that are solved through applying skill andor specific scroll mechanics. So a new player is basically locked out of parts of the game when they dont have access to scrolls and more importantly with no visibility of the scrolls they dont have they cant look at all the rules of the game.The primary conflict is that were applying a very successful  year old business which only allowed players to purchase cards with real money to an online medium whose norm is to only allow acquisition through time and skill. There will always be strong differences of opinion as to what feels right but it fundamentally comes down to what is fair and what works as a business model.Id say there is a defensible position for Scrolls to have a  entry fee and to then allow players to spend more to acquire scrolls and cosmetics. A handy graphic comparing GM and Pay  Meta paths could illustrate exactly what youre getting for your cash i.e.   X hours Vs . A monthly cap on spending could be applied so the whales arent abused and there are a finite number of things for players to buy anyway so its not capitalising on frustration which leads to players throwing money at a game. Funnily enough one thought I had whilst writing this is what would happen to offline MtG if players could earn cards through simply playing? They pay their  to join and then turn up at their local store  to earn points to then convert to packs. Itd encourage more people to play as often its the sheer cost of keeping up with the meta that turns people away competitively.tldr CCGs were successfully built on being able to buy all the cards with cash online CCGs can simply add a second way to pay for them via time.,Scrolls,cn44z5e,11,t5_2scq0

2894187,0,t3_2t9x9b,Order is certainly more difficult to play than the average Growth deck but they are definitely not unviable. As for the growth matchup in general Order is even considered to be a counter to aggressive Growth the two doublearmored creatures Wings Shield and Gallant Defender provide excellent protection from all the small quick creatures that Growth commands and they with their lack of removal or displacement struggles to get around these.An important thing to note is that Order does without the proper scrolls struggle to come back from an empty board they operate much much better on a decently filled board as it allows for more cheap efficient and powerful options when using things like Speed and Haste. One of the comeback mechanics you might want to look into is Focus  Relentless creatures Royal and Ducal Skirmishers. Its an extremely cheap and unexpected little trick that can easily remove a unit or two extra for just the cost of a single order. Way of the Knight seems to lack this synergy which is included in almost every Order deck well besides LGO. It does have Mangonels  Speed though. Another popular comeback mechanic for slower decks. A fullon control order usually uses this and Arbalaister  Tempo Theft to efficiently clear a decently filled board. They are however far more hardcore when it comes to ramp and slowing down the opponent than Way of the Knight which seems to place itself somewhere between that and a midrange deck.Its true that Growth creatures are on their own usually more powerful than the order ones save for things like Wings Shield which is insanely strong but the sudden cheap countdown decreases attack buffs and displacement gives order an edge and allows it to modify the battlefield to come out on top whenever their creatures are about to attack. It is important to obtain board presence stand before your enemies when necessary under the protection of an armored warrior up front and then pick and choose what dies using displacement cooldown reduction and attack buffs.Order struggles more with coming back from an empty board than any other faction but when they are in control they can make extremely efficient plays. Midrange is all about losing somewhat in the early game and then coming back through defensive units that the enemy cant punch through followed by efficient offensive creatures such as General Arbalaister Reloras Skirmishers and Royal Vanguards. They make spells tricks attack buffs and CDR disgustingly efficient and that is the key. Good luck!TLDR Order needs established board to win gained through defensive units. Once they have they can pick and choose what dies and coordinate powerful attacks. Cheaper than any real removal out there.,Scrolls,cnx2mot,13,t5_2scq0
2926627,0,t3_2tn1k5,It wont always help but sometimes it will. If you are on the draw try not to play a creature down until u have a followup. for example. my opponent plays dust runner. i have dust runner and storm runner inhand but no  drop. ill wait until turn  to play my dust runner so that when turn  rolls around ive got a defensive option immediately. The other advantage of this is if they dont havea  turn  followup u are much safer on the edge. since their unit will be at  cd in the center when u play yours they wont be able to threaten the edge. Another option is baiting them into the bottom with something u dont much care about. when they move to threaten it u can play your followup in relative safety in the second lane and contest the center on subsequent turns ,Scrolls,co0rmm0,2,t5_2scq0

3079319,0,t3_2vf15x,Adding these thoughts from the Scrolls.com post just in case anyone missed them Blightseed Cost  down from .    The original proposal had Blightseed down to Cost  but we agree its probably wiser to step it down in a smaller increment first to observe the effects. Corpus Collector The summoned husk now has Countdown .    Players were unhappy with having yet another  Cost  Decay unit to choose from and probably for good reason. We went with a suggestion to reduce the countdown of the husk that he summons as its probably more of an interesting change. Husks normally have Countdown  Imperial Resources  No longer heals units.    The feedback on this was somewhat split but removing the unit healing proved to be the most popular decision. Mns was very conflicted about this change but has decided to go forward with it. Pother Now properly destroys Lockling Brood bug fix.    Weve decided against changing the scroll text and developed a workaround to the original issue with Pother targeting Lockling Brood. Fulmination Conduit  Now  from      We sneaked in an extra health from the previous proposal. Players were still not enthused about it even with the increased countdown  so its probably reasonable to bump up its presence on board to give players more options with this unit. Verdant Veil  Now costs  up from .    A lot of players expressed frustration with certain decks that center around stacking enchantments onto a single creature. While a complete rework of Ward is not something were ready to try  we are increasing the cost of the most powerful Ward scroll. This along with the health nerf to Earthborn Mystic is probably worth testing before more drastic changes are considered.,Scrolls,coh63ks,16,t5_2scq0

3109619,0,t3_2vq3th,Your suggestionsconcerns  Lots of people consider card draw cantrips amp otherwise to be an issue. I dont consider it to be an issue in itself but there are problem decks that use it. Of course every deck has weaknesss quick aggro decks can take these lategame behemoths down. There is no point where someone will have their whole deck in their hand especially not now when you can only sac for cards if you have less than  cards in hand. It isnt pure advantage these cards always cost something like resources which you have a finite amount of. Languid is such a cantrip i dont use it at the moment because it does less with  resources than you would get from other cards you could poison something so it dies with  growth but languid will never kill with  decay. It excels in the lategame when you have resources to spare but gives less value earlier on.  Hahaha yes that brings me back I used to complain about this a lot. People kept asking Mojang to let Baleful witch work on structures to give structures common subtypes so bloodline taint worked on them to do any manner of things. Sadly Mojang didnt for some reason. Im a pretty good decay player and to be honest I used to win most of my games against Energy Structure decks anyway. Still it was horribly unnerving and uninteractive not fun at all. I could only win by knowing exactly when and how to attack the idols i relied on scrolls like Searing Shackles kills an idol gradually Necrogeddon to burst the idols combo with watcher amp Loyal Darkling.  Mojang said they didnt want players to interact with each others hands or resources. You manage your own stuff and the fighting happens on the board. It does limit some interactions but it has a lot of charm and i prefer it this way worry about the units on the board not on counting the cards and resources your opponent has.   Of course they make subtypes flourish with each new set last set gravelocks amp undead amp beast decks became a thing but they still need a little more help. Cross pollination would be nice you can see a little but it is also a complex issue and might unbalance the future multiresource system they put in place.   They do some of that here and there. A lot of scrolls damage your own unit or increase current amp base countdown or even damage your idol like Regeniture. Taxing is another the cost of becoming more expensive.,Scrolls,cokb6wi,2,t5_2scq0

3782298,0,t1_cqnbkl9,gt Im interested to find out what this unreleased soldierscroll is that when put into context will turn an extremely unimaginative and dull  attack lingering spell into a well thought out addition to the game.        Maybe you misunderstood me but I was getting the point across that not every single scroll in a set is going to shoot off fireworks every time its played. Scrolls is a card game and certain cards that are developed that make sense within the games mechanics will be simpler than others.         Open the deck builder and type in s. Scroll through a bit. How many of those individually stand out as jawdropping board blasters? Not every single one. Royal Inspiration? Big whoop I draw some scrolls! Earthen Mirth double champion ring pfft! This same attitude toward scroll analysis can be applied to most scrolls that already exist within the game. But Waypoints and Rebellion as a whole had a huge effect on the game completely altered the types of decks that were out there and gave more viable options for each player using each deck.    Not even mentioning the fact that there are still a large number of impactful units and spells from Echoes that havent even been revealed.          Increasing and decreasing numbers are kind of what any spell will do in Scrolls. Im not arguing that Just Conviction is the most exciting Scroll  Im making the point that it makes sense to exist within the library of Scrolls.           Had we the luxury of having every single Scroll asset already completed for the next set we would certainly reveal them in a more interesting and coordinated way. When faced with either no spoiler for the week or spoiling Just Conviction  we chose to reveal Just Conviction. Furthermore every single Scroll from Echoes is subject to modification or tweaking. They move to the test server first for many reasons  one of them being that they might actually need adjusted for balance or in some cases possibly reworked.          The team is always very receptive to any sort of feedback or suggestions in this regard. Saying Just Conviction sucks is a lot less valuable to them than suggesting Hmm what if Just Conviction did this to Soldiers instead?    Id like to see a lot more of that attitude than the current flood of negativity that really gets us nowhere.,Scrolls,cqnes8m,12,t5_2scq0

Couple that with scrolls where you cant predict when they will draw or even offensive scrolls like Pushback and it becomes an additional gamble on top of a gamble that everyone even nondraw decks may need to start accounting for.Im okay with the idea to help against massdraw and I much prefer it to the current hand limit rule but the added luck is both avoidable and unneeded.

You could even replace the actually button text with just Activate. So loyal darkling would readDemise Deal  damage to opponent Idol on the same rowActivate Sacrifice Loyal DarlingAnd then the button would say activate.

4013775,0,t1_crdsl0o,I dont know why people around here like to downvote legitimate questions and think people are trolling. Like I said in the topic I am not a game developer so I am wondering what the deal is with the long wait between cards. From my perspective theres no way this should take so long. If they are switching between projects making everything take longer then thats just bad management. At this rate theres only going to be  card release per year.,Scrolls,crdsuvr,2,t5_2scq0

Other thoughts   Leeching ring buffed to also give  health electrify also includes automatons both a buff and makes sense lore wise mire curse can also target the ground unbind also increases current wild by  for each enchantment destroyed malevolent gaze hits three adjacent hexagons instead of just one creature  still only effects creatures damning curse with taxing added initial cost should be reduced to  pillar of disease I would change this to be similar to a structural version of Oum Las High Guard giving minus  attack and  move to the first opponents unit on the row,Scrolls,crpl3w4,0,t5_2scq0

I suggested a version where you only get decay for when your creatures die but your suggestion of only when your opponents die would be much easier to balance considering not just necrogeddon but the change they are considering to monstrous brood.

4407160,0,t1_csmcsjw,You might not like it but Hearthstones model is absurdly successful. A successful model means a game with the resources to continue and to expand. The current model is not successful. The game is slowing withering as a result.You simply cannot release a CCG in todays market without it being FP. If you make your game FP you need an alternate way to generate revenue. Unless you know of a model that isnt like Hearthstones I dont know what else they could do.,Scrolls,csmf6n9,2,t5_2scq0

Maybe you have not played the mode before but its basically impossible to keep bunnies alive without unusual amounts of enchants. If you cant hide any creature behind ward the game starts to favour direct idoldamage instead of playing creatures. The test games we played today might have been called spell only mode.,Scrolls,csq3xlh,2,t5_2scq0

4566821,0,t1_ct66a35,I dont make videos? I linked to a video from Extra Creditz and youre right Consumers do a poor job of doing whats best fear them. I know that a its not in a businesses best interest to be kind but that doesnt mean that blind packs arent blatantly problematic in a virtual space.The issues is that in real life everyone makes trades based on their time. I.E you trade time and work for a currency. You can then trade this money for things like services and products. In a virtual space that asks you to make a purchase for the service and then for your time to get the most out of the service it is unapealing. If the service was free to use then it is nearly identical to its real life counterpart. which literally has more valueIn the past I have said that this upfront cost makes it fair because we value real life as fair as we all have roughly the same time we can work. In a virtual space it really isnt as fair. Some people will ALWAYS have more time than you can.My idea here is that these trades people make are problematic yet we cant get rid of them the are very necessary for the game to run. Instead we make the fairer trade more valuable of a trade to make. If playing a campaign mode gets you all the cards and teaches you the game then it is a trade that will more or less be taken by most people. Of course there always be people who have very little time for this hobby. We could allow them to pay for all the cards when they buy the game as well.The issue at its deepest roots is that the trades people make in scrolls are merely fair and never beneficial. If you could pay market price for a pair of pants then its just okay. If you get a deal on pants then youve really gotten ahead right?,Scrolls,ct69fdu,1,t5_2scq0
