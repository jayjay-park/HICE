492537,0,t3_1zml3z,You can make the perimeter extrusion width a multiple of the thickness of the wall being printed.Also if youre XY jerk is too high that might explain why your steppers are skipping.  A value of  is good for most circumstances and for most repraps a value of  is too much.  I can get away with  but then I have oz in motors running at v.  Also make sure that your drivers are supplying the amount of current which your motors are rated for.  Acceleration might need to be reduced as well but since you are only getting this during tiny zigzag moves Im going to bet its some combination of XY jerk being too high and too little current to the motors.  Also your motors might be underpowered in terms of rated torque.  Whats the torque rating?  Running them at v I assume?To adjust the XY jerk you have to change your firmwares configuration or use the gcode command M Xnn where nn is the desired value.

They sell a few versions on Amazon and probably also your local hardware store.The kind Ive used has two parts a drill bit that makes a hole the right size for the second part and the extractor itself witch looks like a cone with spiralhelical grooves running down the outside. You drill into the center of your screw and then force the extractor into that hole. You then slowly but firmly use a wrench not a drill for this part unscrew the extractor and the screw along with it. The grooves on the extractor are such that turning it counterclockwise will make it bite into the screw more at least in theory.Good luck.,Reprap,cublz99,12,t5_2qq91

I have no idea what side effect that could have.Check the hobbed bolt teeth to see if its fouled.  It could be slipping.  I had to add a spacer to the top of my ED Lite to make it fit tight to the extruder cold end.  Check it.    I would pop open where the cold end clamps down on the filament.   Heat the hot end up to a normal extrusion temperature.   By hand push down on the filament with a constant pressure.  Does that fix the problem?  If it does the problem is in the upper cold end.  If the problem continues the problem is in the lower hot end section.  ,Reprap,cxjs2oz,1,t5_2qq91

Also check if the size of your nozzle is in any documentation or on the side of the nozzle itself. In Marlin you can go to tune flow rate and dial it down until youre happy or alternatively do that in your slicer. If its a problem of your printers extruder calibration being off you would need to recalculatetweak your extruder stepper motors steps per mm of filament called ESteps. Thats in the controlgtmotion menu in marlin. To begin print a calibration cube and start tweaking your flow rate until you get good results.

I went for the PSteel because of several reviews Link in which its stability and therefore better printscompared to other DIY printers for a still low price were praised. The stainless steel frame which I painted matt black  Love! is the main reason for its stability  because its quite heavy and since its manufactured by a laser cutting machine everything fits precisely. For me its weight is important for the following reason mentioned in the reviewgtAdditionally since steel is significantly heavier than aluminium the heavier frame of the printer prevents unpredictable vibrations that can compromise the final quality of D prints.I dont know if this applies to the Wilson as well which frame is probably made out of aluminium. Based on this without the intention to upgrade it I would have probably chosen the PSteel. But again you probably know more about the Wilson than I do and I could be wrong with my impression of it.
