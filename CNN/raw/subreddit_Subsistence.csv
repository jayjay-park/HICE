9467929,0,t3_5ae6vj,I tried playing today oct  and encountered a bug where I cant eat drink split or anything associated with the right click sub menus in my inventory. I have saved exited and come back in with the same issue. Even tried starting a new game but still had the issue. Finally I uninstalled and reinstalled but still the same issue. I can drag blueberries over water and get the sub menu and can click and combine and I can drag food to the action bar and then press the correct key and eat. I havent yet found a way to split items without the right click menu and I havent as yet got far enough to have  of one kind of food to see if the action bar fix will have me eat one or two of the food item.,Subsistence,d9g4kvo,1,t5_3h9wy
