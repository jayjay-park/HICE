882557,0,t1_ch4lg1i,Im skeptical as Ive never encountered something that suits my chicken needs so well. No jigsaw or anything like that needed?  I can just easily buy precut wood?. It fits  standard chickens like australorps?. Is it easy to clean just open it? And can be latched so predators can get in easily?Now Im just curiousWithout the dowels would it fit waterfowl?

1676032,0,t3_2dhj04,I can speak first hand as to how valuable good insulation is!  The house I am sitting in right now has R in the ceilings and R in the wall framing.  I was on the fence about the R I almost tried to talk my wife out of it.. I foolishly thought it might be overkill.I decided not to open my mouth and give the lady what she had asked for.  For a dumb guy like me that was a rare brilliant decision  In the winter I can heat this home easily regardless of what heating system I use.. In the summer the heavy insulation holds in the cool night temp until late afternoon.  Thats a wonderful thing when you come in from the field for lunch.  Energy costs will never get cheaper.  I can heat my home with the wood stoves or electric heating but one costs me money and the other costs me sweat.    No sense in wasting either.  Especially in the world we are all walking  into where oil electric etc. will never go down in price.. Insulate Insulate Insulate!  ,Homesteading,cjqfckr,2,t5_2r5dx

5457792,0,t1_cw8zw31,did you notice i used the word should up in my original comment? i didnt say must nor require nor need. i said should as in i suggest it is what they do but its not absolutely required.also you are one person selling an item. i imagine a higher priced item since it is not usually bought on impulse. you are an exception. many of the items being advertised are at a low enough price point where an impulse buy is possible. to keep people from spamming their link suggesting a coupon code seems like a good idea. i imagine some people would love to post a coupon that is valid for a limited time but not post repeatedly so that people only order when its discounted.Our way or go screw is exactly what is required of some communities.

5654606,0,t1_cwxz2si,gtis there a way to rehabilitate the soil or alter it to make it so we can use it? Yes but it can take YEARS to fix  time money effort  so know that upfront. Dont expect good yields at first. What some people do is grow plants on the best soil but let their livestock live on the lesserquality soil. Stocking rates for animals vary on the land itself though so the better the land the more animals it can support.I actually recommend getting smaller pieces of high quality land than getting a lot of notgreat land but thats just me. We looked at several properties that were  acres but the land was basically unusable for anything but timber so we opted instead for  better acres that also put us in range of things we care about like high speed internet access and a notterrible commute into town.

7744073,0,t3_4lcd0c,Fuzz.  Honestly its all about the fuzz.  You need to find someone who can discuss crimp fiber diameter and get a bit glossy eyed when heshe starts rambling on about microns etc.   The alpacas we breed are largely decided upon fiber quality. A bit leans to general hardiness though.  I have one female who is .. maybe a  on a  for fiber but extremely strong hardy and throws tough little cria like its nothing.   As in literally just drops the thing one morning and keeps grazing with an air of Oh another one.  Lets eat before messing with the fuzzball.   She is  give the lady a break!FYI use extreme caution buying alpacas right now.  Todays market is changing rapidly.  I have one male I am breeding with who sold last for k.  We paid like  for him.
