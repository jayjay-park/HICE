4555416,0,t1_ct4tg00,I would suggest getting it if you are into Neptunia. Alot of the gameplay is pretty easy and youll pretty much have no issues getting most of the trophies as usual the lily grind is stupidly long and imo not worth the time. Is it better than SKSV? Definite maybe. The storyline is pretty barebones compared to SK where each academy has a story and each individual character also has a story. NepNep has a singular story that could be described as ehh. The game hooked me for a few days and I enjoyed quite abit of my time playing it but the playtime was nowhere as long as SKSV.So while the story is not as good as SK imo the gameplay is really solid and it feels really fun to slash people up as your favorite CPU character. ,gamindustri,ct4tx5k,2,t5_2w8vg

4675903,0,t3_3ezi00,If you are asking if the combat has been improved from MK and MK then yes it has.If you are asking if they have changed the combat style with powerbreak and rush no they have not.So if you are looking for a flashier game than the originals then you will be pleasantly surprised. However if you had issue with the way the combat system worked before then nothing has really changed. You still have the breakrushpower system. They did add movement based combat which can be seen here but that still does not change the core way combat is done which is via rushbreakpower attacks.Bosses in general are health sponges. If you find the game too easy you can always use the fortify plans and make the game harder but if difficulty is something you are looking for this game series is not the best for it. While it does offer pleasant difficulty for most their goal is more on storytelling than hard bossesmechanics.There have been more changes than you would realize though. Here are a few examples of note Stellas Dungeon Added in RB minigame that allows you to gain resources and plans while you play the game or let the system idle  Man Parties Added in RB Allows for more party compositions Dungeon Changes Added in RB While most dungeons are the same as they have been in RB and RB RB has made the maps slightly larger by adding verticality or purely more run space Awakened Added in RB Allows for NonCpus to enter a Transformed state similar to HDD. Allows for more comp choices SPEXE gauge have been consolidated into one barAdded in RB This allows you to play very differently than you would before and allows you to use many more team compositions than you could before without gimping the team. Item Searching added in RB The game has finally added a feature that has been a real pain for alot of the other Nep games and that is the ability to look up in game where a certain material drops from. For a long time you needed the help of a master list compiled by others but with this addition that is no longer needed.So while the animations are better than the originals by a mile and pretty much all the character art is as well the combat has not changed much in terms of what you actually do when you get to the enemy. However looking at just those two changes would make you think the series has not improved much from its original versions which could not be farther from the truth.,gamindustri,ctjy47h,5,t5_2w8vg

6120325,0,t1_cyl7xnx,Id like to clarify something about the previous fiasco we had about the Steam Group and why he was removed.First off there were a lot of factors at play during that debacle and a lot of people whom were involved.I wasnt completely involved in the situation per se but I was more of a concerned bystander who saw almost everything unfold. Take everything I say with a grain of salt.The roots of the issue were two people both whom were in pretty close contact with one another.They ended up in an argument in the steam chat and one of them whom was a chat moderator of the steam group at that time ended up banning the other person. s This person is still banned on the steam group to this day by the way. The aforementioned was unbanned for a while but said person was banned again due to reasons I am very unsure about.Im not exactly sure what instigated this incident to occur but Ive heard that its an extremely sensitive and personal subject from some of my sources. However some people took this as an act of misused power. I cant really take my stands here since Im not entirely sure what had happened between them. Ive only heard from one source who may be rather biased about it so like I said Take everything I say with a grain of salt.And when people think power is misused they rebel. This caused the incident to blow completely out of proportion and lasted about  days or so. People started taking sides mostly against the chat moderator.After a considerable amount of harassment from the Steam Groups regular chat members the chat moderator left.This led to a celebration and people decided to act hastily crowning the rGamindustri exmoderator as a chat mod.I dont blame them. I didnt really like how the chat moderator handled things and acted but its over now. No point in hatred.Afterwards the exmoderator posted that rGamindustri would be merging with the steam group without consulting both of the other moderators at the time.Once again this led to a lot of drama and also is a major factor in what you mentioned The blind harassment towards the exchat mod. Once this drama had been passed along to the subreddit from the Steam Group everything went nuts for a bit.One of the moderators found out about it after coming back from work There was really a massive influx of hate posts towards the exsteam group chat moderator. He settled things with a moderator post after acquiring a lot of insight into the issue from about  sources. With that this led to the exrgamindustri moderator to be stripped of his mod status.Frankly I think that went a bit too far. If it were me I wouldve just gave him a warning and a grace period.Also currently we three mods are actually fine with the exmoderator for rgamindustri to be a mod again but were still thinking about the possibilities and implications. Itll take quite some time before we make a decision.Anyway I hope this clears up things. ,gamindustri,cylbg1r,5,t5_2w8vg

A handful of other people have done runs for RB as well but nobody is actively running the games currently.Generally Nep  Mk and Victory are done in NG since otherwise theyre really long runs RB and RB are done in NG with DLC. Nothing much in the way of glitches except near the end of RB where the Colosseum glitch is used to get a couple of weapons.If youre just looking to get into something easy go with RB Any grinding isnt needed apart from getting  level with Vert and aside from a few rough bosses its a fairly simple run.,gamindustri,cyn8av8,1,t5_2w8vg

7195373,0,t1_d1w0ttz,SPOILERS AHEADNO SERIOUSLY SPOILERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDRB Victorys StoryRei Ryghts attempts to foment revolution and topple the CPUs of Gamindustri despite their just rule and divine right. Despite literally saving Gamindustri from obliteration and acting as a pudding powered one man Nep Army she believes that the CPUs shouldnt exist due to interdimensional trauma from the Ultradimensions Rei Ryghts. Thanks to Croire Hyperdimension Rei gains some of the insane dimension bending power of the Ultradimension Rei and in her fit of rage against Neptune forcibly sends Neptune to the Ultradimension.After befriending the local Plutie and Noire Neptune begins her attempt to go home while also hearing about the  sages that are causing trouble for the CPUs of the Ultradimension. She also learns that she cannot enter HDD and that the aging process has begun on her. In order to not die Neptune takes the ambition to acquire a CPU memory to reactivate her goddess. This leads to eventual conflict with two of the  Sages Mr. Mouse and Ultradimension Arfoire.After deploying Actual Cannibal Sadist Plutia Nep and Noire gain CPU memories that Actual Absolute Monarch Iris Heart basically eminent domained from Mr. Mouse. Since Neppy is goddess in another dimension Neptune is already  certain that she has her divine mandate to gain HDD rather than becoming a derpy monster that most people become since they lack a divine mandate and Noires competitiveness forces her hand.Unfortunately Sadie also means that Neptune sold her body to Plutia I think this counts as slavery and Noire complains that she will do any  thing for Plutia. Although Noire complains that she had to jump over the bar raised by Neptune Noire gets off easy by washing Pluties back. Neptunes body still technically belongs to Plutia. I digress.Basically Neptune continues to work towards going home and defeating the Seven Sages. The Seven Sages incite Lowee to attack Lastation then sabotage Lastation directly. Noire complains and then gets tortured by Sadie for complaining about Lowee rather than going to Lowee. So Noire goes to Lowee directly where they meet tryingandfailingtohidheridentity Vert who joins the party as an observer. The party then engages and defeats White Heart. White Hearts loss is broadcasted to her nation by the  Sages who had already infiltrated her administration and they toss the Nepping Party into jail. While in jail Iris Heart acts nice to Blanc and befriends her. Plutia later says this is because she wanted to see Blanc built up so Iris Heart could crush Blanc even harder. Shes a real sadist.Thankfully to Blanc it just seems like Plutias being a friend. Vert who ditched the party when the broadcast started rolling remember that she is trying to hid her identity comes back and saves the day breaking them out of jail. Blanc joins the party and the party goes out to kick Mr. Badds ass. For Sadie she took that saying literally. Finally Nep seems to have enough shares to go home. However the  sages have not been fully defeated and Vert hasnt made her formal appearance yet. Nepgear falls through the use portal that Neptune was going to use to go home leaving the homefront Planeptune without a goddess and Ultradimension Planeptune with . Nepgear is also treated like garbage for the remainder of the game.Vert challenges the party to a fight which they win since they outnumber her vastly.Yadah yadah Nepgear gets HDD the Seven Sages cause more havoc and the basilicom takes in child IF child Compa and child Peashy because many children are going missing.Eventually it is revealed that the  sages are stealing children to force CPU memories down their throats in hopes of making their own little enslaved CPU. This accidentally happens when Peashy gets hungry and eats kidnapper Reis random purse item while Rei is distracted by Croire.With their repeated defeats Anonydeath urges Rei to go through with their plan B of founding a CPU lead nation in order to destroy CPU lead nations. This is what we call hypocrisy.Anonydeath makes a machine that powers the hell out of Peashy. The Neps also cannot fight Mr. Badds daughters since they were once humans and we refuse to accept the legitimacy of a strategy where killing enemy civilians to increase enemy war exhaustion is valid. Hence our offensives are all blunted by the  sages using the victims as essentially stockholm syndromed hostages and our CPUs are losing the war for  years or so in which time IF and Compa grow up.Meanwhile time goes by at a  day to  year rate in the hyperdimension so only  days have passed. even so Hyper!Rei is going bat shit crazy and raising an insurrection. Noire and Uni double down on their CPU duty by serving as regents over Planeptune while the Nep sisters are stuck in the Ultradimension.Our key to victory however is that the Seven Sages lack any cohesion. Through prior defeats and having been outright lied too Abnes Copypaste and Mr. Mouse flipped allegiance to the Nepping Party  Compa. This is decisive in informing the Nep Party about the machine and in destroying it the Neps finally have a chance to win. They find out that Yellow Heart is Peashy as well doubly committing them to total Victory.The Neps bring along numerous momentos of IFs Compas and Peashys childhood to help Peashy get unbrainwashed. Mr. Badd loses the will to fight anymore legitimately valuing his adopted family of the CPU memory victims. Anonydeath is more interested in stalking real Noire than being surrounded by fake Noires that Rei created and ultimately defects from Rei as well. Ultra!Rei regains her CPU power but is defeated at then hands of the CPUs. Rei comes to her senses and realizes that either her CPU energypower is imbued with some kind of evil or that she goes power mad but in any case realizes that the Hyperdimension has gone to shit because Ultra!Reis power got transferred over the Hyper!Rei. Rei explains her backstory of being a CPU of ancient Tari with some worsethanMSPaint drawings and wishes that she could help stop Hyper!Rei.Histoire calls to let Nep know that the Hyperdimension has gone to utter hell with Hyper!Rei literally raining hell and bombarding the cities. Hyper!Rei also starts to bombard the Ultradimension with her absurd powers calling Histoire to demand for Neptune and Gear to return. Historie opens up a portal that is stronger than expected and allegedly permanent. In any case the Entire Party of Ultradimension Nep girls marches into the Hyperdimension and takes the day defeating Hyper!Rei. Ultra!Rei comes and takes responsibility from Hyper!Rei stating that Hyper!Rei was becoming delusion to believe that she was the CPU of Tari when those had in fact been Ultra!Reis memories. After struggling with the dark ball of energy Hyper!Rei loses it and it tries to possess Iris Heart. Thankfully Iris Heart is an absolute dominatrix that cannot be bent by the dark power thing so it leaves Spoilers Croire ultimately takes it back.With the ambition of both Reis defeated peace is restored to Gamindustri. The only loose end is Croire who seem to be caught in a bug net Spoilers By Ultra!NeptuneThats all I got. If you dont understand VII I recommend you play it again since it came out really recently and all those spoilers are actual big spoilers on this sub contrast with the fact that Reis CPU form and Yellow Heart have been flairs you can choose.,gamindustri,d1w1ziv,2,t5_2w8vg

Alas I had to come up with a scenario that would see Ram as the antagonist for that particular Your flair scenario.This was what I was thinking at the time of thinking up the scenario for antagonist Ram I can imagine Ram becoming a deadly rebel if she loses her patience with people older than her for always treating her like a kid and shell go out and take revenge especially since she lacks discipline in the main games from what Ive seen from the ReBirth games.Its also probably due to my take on Ram being even more of a bad girl and more likely to hold grudges and take revenge This little mission of hers being solely fueled by her anger and childishness to build a world where neither her or Rom could get belittled  part of her mission was also for Roms sake.Or in a short summary its a very intense version of a little kid yelling I HATE YOU to you if they think youve wronged them even if youre trying to teach them a lesson.,gamindustri,d36v6lf,1,t5_2w8vg

She doesnt want potential competitors to be in the presence of her beloved when she isnt there even if they were kidnapped. She ends up running into IF who is trying to save Vert. Neptune catches Noire and Vert escapes and tells IF how horrible it was. Noire then goes and tries to hire a new secretary because her current one failed again.. Noire hired herself as her own secretary because all the rest let Neptune in.. Noire was rushing somewhere so she just brings Rom to the daycare that happens to be right beside her.. IF runs off right away as Noire kidnapped Vert earlier. Suddenly Neptune strolls in while thinking that her plan worked perfectly but suddenly Blanc breaks through the wall and starts yelling about how Noire put Rom in a daycare.THE END,gamindustri,d3ef044,3,t5_2w8vg

7817777,0,t3_4me4g8,I hope I dont miss my chance because of how long I took to type this out...Even though I could do this myself I want you to get busy with something I hope that will challenge you. Lets see...Id like you to try and visualise a small snippet from something Ive written on this subreddit  its a scenario where Plutia does the Conquest Ending herself with my own little twist to it.The bit I want you to try and visualise is bolded in the snippet below Ive kept all the contextual info as it might help you for setting up the scenegt As soon as Plutia held the cursed sword all of her friends went against her. Every single one of them bar Neptune and Nepgear turned their backs on Plutia calling her a disgrace and left Plutia standing by herself wielding the still dormant Gehaburn.Day by day each of the nations CPUs would try to take her down. Fuelled by her anger from betrayal Plutia did not hold herself back to attack her old friends with full force.gt Lastation was first to fall Noires overconfidence costed her one of her legs. She would then pay the price for attempting to continue fighting Plutia with only three limbs as Plutia sliced off the rest of them leaving her body to roll around like a fallen Russian doll. Now limbless it was only then that Noire realised her fate as Plutia stood before her. With no delay Plutia converted Noire to a temporary pedestal for the Gehaburn as she forced the blade through Noires body the forming pool of blood confirming the demise of Lastations CPU.gt A gunshot zipped in front of her eyes as she turned to Uni She had her gun pointing at Plutia visibly trembling and with tears pouring out of her eyes. Plutia started her slow advance towards Uni who was rapidly pulling the trigger to only hear clicking but no shots fired. She would soon lose all feeling from her right hand.gt Falling to her knees Uni grasps her right wrist and screams in agony at the excruciating pain as her gun and right hand landed about a metre to her right. Plutia simply stared at Uni with cold eyes before silencing her by using the Gehaburn to hack her head off. She felt a sudden warmth on her face as she watched Unis now decapitated body slump onto the ground before wiping the red splash off her face and rubbing the viscous liquid between her thumb and fingers.A few pointers My only requirement is that the picture looks as serious and grimdark as possible. Not overly grim that it would detract from the image but enough to make Plutia look very threatening and create fear for Unis imminent death. Featured characters are Plutia and Uni. If you want to feature the dismembered Noire in the background you can do that too. Obviously Plutia should wield the Gehaburn but you can give Uni any kind of gun that you see fit. If you can have Unis hand removed like in the snippet great! Itd also be nice to have a blood splatter or two to mark where the hand landed on the ground. If you cant remove Unis right hand you can just change it to a general wounded pose. Nothing to worry about. Theres no detail about the location so youre free to choose what fits.,gamindustri,d3us6zo,3,t5_2w8vg

Blackvoid can manipulate Space and Time. You guys arnt thinking with Portals properly.Heres some ideas to get you started. For example...We just saw Nepgear get cut down horribly in front of us right? She was the only healer of the group well at this moment in time! If only there was something we could do about it. You know like make an image of somethings physical state...and then possibly use that as a reference to write from...maybe give it a little acceleration and influence some local particles if were missing a few parts...And speaking of thinking with Portals...That warp arrow on Mato...Maybe if we tried thinking with Portals in a different way...gtAlso anything he says in the next few hours be careful in using as I wont be awake to confirm limitations!While I do encourage discussion as we should learn to use our abilities to their full potential I wash my hands of any responsibility that comes from you guys voting from any implications from my ideas.,gamindustri,d4b9wc0,5,t5_2w8vg

8444023,0,t3_4v7kcj,As a fan of Xbox since first seeing the original back in  I was naturally drawn to Vert as my favorite CPU.I love her character shes the resident teaser of the group and just an all around charming woman. But shes also the glue that holds the group together. Neptune is too immature Noire is too interested in being a show off and Blanc just wants to be left alone but Vert is none of those things and thats why shes the impromptu leader in situations where the group dynamic starts to fall apart.In my eyes she along with Blanc is the saddest CPU in the series due to her lack of a sister. Look at this this dream reveals a lot about Vert in just one scene. While the obvious is that she wants sisters there is more to this than it first appears.Initially those who see this scene just laugh it off as Vert finally getting sisters who are actually younger versions of herself but after some thinking on it Ive come to a different reaction. Vert is incredibly lonely she has no sisters to keep her company and being an immortal greatly limits the list of potential lovers she can have to a very small list.She plays off this loneliness by being rather upbeat and teasing to others but it only serves to highlight the problem even more. When shes among others the loneliness is the last thing on her mind that is until one of the candidates shows up then its pushed to the forefront of her thoughts.Everyday thats she by herself in Leanbox either playing games or doing work shes alone with these thoughts and the sadness of being without a sister increases. She has workers in the Basilicom who are around to be sure but they are doing their jobs and dont have time to be siblings to their CPU. She has to face her solitude every time she wakes up and starts the day and every time when she goes to sleep always so alone.So when Leanboxs citizens and other CPUs see her they see a front that Vert has created for herself to hide her problems away so that she doesnt appear weak to anyone. After all a weak goddess is a goddess without shares and is an easy target for conquest by other nations. The nation comes first personal problemstragedies come second this is how its always been.All this teasing and messing around with Nepgear both satisfies her desire for a sister and magnifies her lack of one even more. No matter how hard she may try having Nepgear as a sister wouldnt be the genuine article it would a facsimile. A falsehood and she knows it even if she tries to convince herself otherwise. Shes stuck in a hopeless situation with no way out and nothing she can do about it even with all her power as a goddess. She has to face the world everyday with this in mind. She does her best to be a lively and optimistic ruler so that her citizens never lose faith in their leader. She does her part to protect Gamindustri in the process protecting those who themselves have siblings including the other CPUs. She protects all that she can even though the world as a whole hasnt done all that much in terms of improving her personal life over her many years of rule. One day she could decide to become insular and turn Leanbox away from the other nations even going so far to proclaim that shell only fight to protect her citizens from now on but where would that get her? It would land her back at square one alone and sisterless. Its a circular loop for her.Even in the face of all this there is one bright spot one advantage to not having a sister when compared to the other CPUs. She can look at their relationships from the outside and offer advice when they start to falter ironically ending up as a big sister of sorts to them in the process. Its funny in a odd way when you think about it.Vert is my favorite she always will be but she is a very sad woman indeed.,gamindustri,d5x1ho0,7,t5_2w8vg

8648807,0,t3_4yb9ca,I decided to have a quick read of your previous chapters so I can hopefully provide some additional insight from another perspective. And yeah the issues Ive had you have already noticed yourself.gt Character balanceThis is the biggest problem in my opinion because its also the root cause of all the other issues you have with it. It means that characters are being spread thin and dont have a chance to really shine for themselves. Its hard to juggle as a writer and its hard to follow as a reader. I believe that if you can sort this out then the story and the characters as a whole are going to have significantly more impact.Following on from this and this is probably more of a personal issue but you have a ton of different conceptsmechanics going on that also make it a bit hard to follow. Although it doesnt help that I jumped into the middle of it instead of the beginning.gt Uzume as a protagonist is VERY weak in character at the momentFrom what Ive seen you havent been doing anything wrong necessarily. For the most part you have been pretty faithful to her character so I have you commend you on that. I think what you are looking for are more opportunities for her to shine to show off some more depth and again this goes back to that first point. Im confident that you can do her justice but if youre looking for a bit of inspiration Ill briefly go into why I think she is such a powerful character that stands out from the rest Uzume is the light in the darkness she never gives up hope no matter what. Even when everyone else falls into despair and are ready accept defeat she is always there to provide them with morale and bring them back into high spirits again. You need those high stakes real dangers and emotional extremes to really bring out character.gt Neptune has been in the shadowsAgain work out how you want to balance the characters and this will be easily solved.gt Lack of character development in generalI think what you need to focus on the most are relationships. Now I dont mean romantic relationships necessarily but you have a big cast of characters and every one of them is going to have unique opinion and connection with everyone else. For example Uzume likes Neptune but hates Kurome. What does Noire think about the two? How does that opinion affect her standing with Uzume? Having characters interact with one another is the simplest but most effective way to bring out all the different sides of them because people are going to behave differently in front of certain people. They may be willing to confide in them certain information depending on whether they are a friendenemylover whatever.gt Story itself feels weakIt could do with a bit more complexity more plot lines running in parallel. It can just be something minor like a character could have their own personal goalproblem or something on top of the main storyline. Something that occasionally diverts attention from the main issues at hand but is still relevant and important to the overall story can help to keep things fresh and interesting. And as I mentioned earlier things like having real threats and characters being pushed to extremes will help to give the story more impact.Hope that helps.,gamindustri,d6mpoev,1,t5_2w8vg

Though again this might be because I started on Hard. Im still disappointed that it doesnt do any justice to the Makai Ichiban Kan series seeing as how Trillion was actually pretty alright especially in terms of story but at least the gameplay doesnt disappoint.

9895052,0,t3_5h33af,I think they are ok depending on how they are done. I think a good example of multiple endings would be VII. The endings are not at all complicated to get and you get achieve multiple endings in the same save cutting down the time investment even more. An example of a bad way of doing multiple endings is RB. Not only are  of them worthless but the way you attain them wasnt really worth it. Grinding shares to get a half baked ending is not what most people are wanting to do. On top of that it is as much a quantity issue as it is a quality issue. Most people can handle multiple endings if each of them are seen as valuable but having  endings for the sake of having  endings is just pointless.I think as long as they stick with the formula they have been using for the past few games it will work out for the best. Having an ending that is the best as well as a medium or bad ending is nice as it helps fill in some of the what ifs people might have based on the events of the stories. I do feel like the best endings should be the easiest to attain though. As someone who enjoys going out of their way to earn trophies or commit to grinds it makes no sense to me why the actual end to the game would be the hardest one to get as not everyone enjoys having to jump through hoops to see the real end of the game.,gamindustri,daxckj3,2,t5_2w8vg

Many of the art Tsunako does is drawn at a max  for CGs and p for sprites icons and mugshots. This is to have a better time when scaling assets. Meganep has p all around but Tsunako hasnt drawn neps beyond p aside from the illustrations in the visual books.This size is not feasible yet for saving space and game size.To give you an idea a p image in raw format for packaging would be around  to  mb.  compressed. It would make nep games huge in size and loadtimes and load screens would increase as the bigger the image the longer it takes to load.,gamindustri,ddn7p4z,3,t5_2w8vg

Too many flaws from MK were kept some kept so badly that the way they copied elements over make things actually harder to unlock in ReBirth  than in MK and the game is literally a worse version of the game its a port of with the only exceptions being some things like extra characters and costumes. Theyre the same game with largely the same flaws but MK is fundamentally better. ReBirth  is a brand new game meanwhile while ReBirth  received more polish to compensate for the fact that like  they were copying most of the story over from its PS counterpart.Ive said it before but as it is ReBirth  just does not do anything to really justify its existence.

The original contest had over a hundred people voting for some of the matches so even if only a fraction of them draw edit or write something up for it theres still enough.We may waver on that if it gets pretty close but if only a couple of people enter it might not be as fair a fight and this way participation is encouraged as you have to actually enter to ensure theres even a prize to begin with.,gamindustri,ddrigb8,2,t5_2w8vg

11188555,0,t3_5zql51,Ok so I hate PlutiaIris so I was glad she did not appear in VII at allbesides scout cameo as I felt if she was handled wrong and given too much screen time I would hate the game. I also havent got the bad end so I dunno how bad it actually was. But adding shit to shit leaves shit ya know?  So I dont think Iris would make it better for me.As for why I personally dislike IrisPlutia? She is just a bully threatens and hurts people if they dont do what she wants in both formsthreatens to transform as Plutia at leastShe picks on friend and foe with no discrimination and even if she is angry at a foe she would attack a friend to relieve her stress if she couldnt fight the foe at the time.Heck she abuses people for no reason. Hello CPU candidates I know I should be saving the world with you guys but I have to introduce my whip to you first She also couldnt comprehend she was distressing kid IF and if I had a trigger it would adults picking on and causing harm to kids as they cant defend themselves.Also her power balance compared to  if we include Peashy is bullshit. Heck if  of them wanted to stop her it should have been easy. If the Next Forms failed to stop walking spoiler and she came in and stopped it I would hate her even more. What is worse is it fluctuates on a dime need to defeat a boss? God mode activate. Need to lose to progress story? e.g. yellow heart God mode off.That being said thats my opinion on her cannonRB appearance. In the anime and MegTag she is somewhat more tolerable. I still dislike her but it doesnt effect my opinion of the rest of the gameanime.I have yet to play Nep Vs Hard Girls I also skipped reading your part so I am curious to see if her appearance in that is tolerable like the other spin off media.,gamindustri,df07jwr,6,t5_2w8vg

11270102,0,t3_60ujdf,Job Job at the Guild. If I have stats then its completing quests. If not then Id ask IF or Histy how to raise stats and eventually after hard work I work at the guild completing quests.  Crazy things Guild has to deal with a lot of things so there are everything. First Ill try to work more on personal quests so Id hear a lot of personal stories some drama going on.. Eventually I would get involved in Guild life more overall.. Like on political matters like overtaking nations or forming coalitions to try to overthrow current Guild master.. Of course Id take IFs and Histys side as they helped me previously to gain stats and work as well as I like them personally.  Forming a team Well Id just work with someone who would take IFs and Histys side.. Id like to be partners with certain reddit users but I dont know if they would share my position here.. After all its ok even if we take opposite sides.. As long as friendship power wins in the end.. P  Special mode Id try to gain Histoires and IFs trust and friendship. How? By talking with hobbies we share they showing me their world and whats interesting in it I myself in return sharing things about this world.. In the end after I become closer to IF and Histoire Id have a chance to meet Nepgear. Maybe form love relationships with her.. How? Well flirting organizing something fun and touching to do together and every other stuff.. p  Epilogue mode Whether I stay or not depends on my goals.. If they were reached  sure staying there. If not  well Id have to think on it whether I want to continue working on current goals have new ones or travel back to my world. Also it depends on how Ill like that world overall.
