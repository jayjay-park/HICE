5758150,0,t3_3tyyny,Few random thoughts Im a fan of mistkings misters for humidity. Bark on logs gets shredded and eventually falls off. They should rarely be on the bottom so I opted for a clean floor thats trivial to sanitize. Theyve never been in a jungle theyll have no idea what those sounds are. Theyd be for you and could scare the ig until it learns to ignore them. Any stained wood or unstained cedar will be fine. Theyll scratch at it but theyre not going to eat it. ,iguanas,cxauq56,1,t5_2swll

6885573,0,t3_49xiji,The advice about food is great!  And that site has been very helpful to me in getting my ig huge and healthy!  And considering its been about two years since you got him and hes only  inches Im a tad concerned.  Mine a female started at about  inches head to tail when I got her May of  and is currently a few inches under five feet.  If you havent replaced the UVB bulb in the past six months I would try that in addition to a diet change!  The bulbs dont emit properly after about six months.  Im glad you asked though iguanas can be tough to manage!,iguanas,d0wsoju,1,t5_2swll
