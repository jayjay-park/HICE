95343,0,t3_1v4jru,I used to test as INTP but over time it became obvious that Im INFP. This statement suggests to me that you might be INTP thoughgt There are some traits of intp that I tend to reject like it seems they lack strong emotion. I can be very emotional but tend to bury it due to social norms.This sounds to me more like someone with weak Fe INTP than someone with strong Fi INFP. Fe users are more concerned about social norms than Fi users an INFP might bury their emotions but theyd be more likely to do it for their own reasons privacy preferring to be understated etc..But then again you cant really type someone based on one statement.,infp,cepa9k9,1,t5_2qn2o

180729,0,t3_1w5yop,I dont say it often and if I do it is usually only out of social courtesy. For example my mother will always say love you bye before she hangs up the phone where as Ill end on goodbye. I do love my mother but I never think on saying it as much as she does. So as much as I dont want to say it for some weird reason I do it just to make sure she does not feel hurt by my lack of saying it. Luckily my close friends do not say they love me but I know they appreciate me in a love like manner.For me I guess I just assume if Ive told you I loved you once then I should not have to say it every time we end a conversation or part ways for a time. However people are wired differently than me so I have to remember some people need to hear it all the time. However when I get really drunk I kind of get I love you maaann with my friends fitting the sterotype well.So to answer the question in short. Yes I too have a problem saying I love you to family and friends. There is nothing wrong with you. I have not got over it but Ive really never seen it as a problem. Actions are greater than words and all that. However some people do not notice actions and prefer words. ,infp,cez0rxd,5,t5_2qn2o

Its actually a little like being on a date and discovering we have so much in common  except her husband and my wife are sitting there being amused Say were talking about our jobs.

But we both totally get it and its such a relief not to feel ashamed something I feel sometimes talking to people who dont get it.Or in her work shes a therapist I totally relate to how she gets to know her clients. Or she gets how I solve problems at work.In isolation its really easy to feel like a weirdo because our personal reasons for behaving in certain ways just dont make sense to others in daily life  and as a result they might not make sense even to ourselves.

320153,0,t3_1xra17,Hey there. Thank you for asking. Ive been making positive life changes this year. I havent had any sugar. Ive kept to hot yoga I have done it or at least room temp yoga every day this year. Its toning me and Im getting stronger. I quit caffeine. I didnt drink at all in January. Ive been dedicating an hour to personal growth almost every day. All of these things have significantly reduced my anxiety and made me so much happier as a person. That being said I still struggle. Sometimes Im productive at work sometimes Im not at ALL. Sometimes I get enough sleep sometimes I go to bed at am and get up at  for yoga. Sometimes Im happy and sometimes like today Im feeling lonely. I have a lot to figure out about life purpose I am not great at pushing my comfort zone and leaving the house to be social I dont have very many friends and sometimes Im still bored. My job is definitely not what Im supposed to be doing with my life at least not  hoursweek. But alas it pays bills and generates a savings pretty well.But starting to get control of my life has definitely given me hope that all things are possible and that I will figure it out someday. Im not sure why it worked this time and didnt any other time. I think its some combination of finding what works and doesnt work for me the fact that Im beginning to believe in myself because of all the selfknowledge I gained last year and the fact that Id failed enough damn times at it that I was really tired of it. Perhaps failures are stored in a bank somewhere and once you get to a certain amount you are completely dissatisfied and angry about it.That was long. I feel happy. I hope others feel the same.

At best movies and TV shows can go in depth to show the complexities of how people interact with each other but rarely on the super nuanced development of one character.

461415,0,t3_1z86kb,Pretty much described how I feel.  Its like most people in my life dont understand me at all.  I usually get pegged as a pretty shallow and uninteresting person to extreme extroverts who tend to be the most dominating people in groups and then they kind of spread that image of me.  I guess it helps me find the most openminded people and separate them from those I wouldnt get along with anyways but it seems like Im always forced to break preconceived ideas of who I amwhat my capabilities are.  Once I get to know someone though I open right up and can be very outgoing.  It just sucks because Im not really great at making friends with everyone I see and shit like this usually puts up an even greater barrier.  There are some people I know that I secretly would love to just knock the shit out of.  I usually just ignore them but I love the chances I do get to prove them wrong and make them look like idiots.I think part of the issue is that INFPs tend to be pretty introverted but are fairly spontaneous and enjoy being stimulated at the same time.  It seems like it tends to make me more drawn to extroverts at least with a lot of my interests but then makes me seem inferior to groups because most of the people I hang out with are extroverts while Im not.  ,infp,cfspong,1,t5_2qn2o

I was crying about it the entire ride home after that. The reason it affected me so much was not only because of his mothers sadness but because it reminded me of all the times my own mother had done the same thing. Since were so sensitive to feelings and know them so well empathy comes easily for us  sometimes in the form of us projecting our own experiences and feelings onto an event that doesnt involve us.

725063,0,t3_22gqmm,Im an INFP. My best friend is also an INFP. As an adult the idea of having a best friend was something very weird and foreign to me. But with this guy well this is one of the closet relationships I have ever had. Heck hes trying to set me up with his wifes sister somewhat jokingly but deep down I know hes serious. He really feels like a brother to me. Its kinda cool.We climb mountains together on a consistent basis. We write novels during our weekly writing parties. We go on random drink runs at am and talk about how we can be more awesome if we could only do x y and z.INFPs are deep intuitive thinkers. I seem to get along with most Ns and especially INs. I love discussing and thinking about new ideas. I love seeing how abstract theories fit into my very complex very intricate and constantlychanging value system. Im fascinated by how others perceive the world. I love anything that deals with creativity or building or selfimprovement or making the world a better place. From the outside INFPs may appear as an amorphous enigma other MBTI types may be puzzled or frustrated by an INFPs tendency to appear so unpredictable and all over the place. Theres a reason they call us dreamers.Remember INFPs are not touchyfeely pansies that cry a lot as many people might guess. INFPs experience the world through the strange lens of introverted feeling. At first glance its tempting to think that INFPs are emotional pushoverslike a leaf blowing in the wind slaves to their whimsical passions and desires. False. INFPs have very rational thoughts its just that these thoughts are processed and evaluated and constantly reevaluated through a very powerful emotional filter. The best way to understand us is that we are heavily influenced but not intellectually dictated by how we feel. We live in a very rich innersanctum of feelings somuchso that our feelings can be thought of as the engine within us that innervates our very thoughts motivations and actions. So what motivates us? What moves us? What can we change? What changes our perspective? What makes us enthusiastic? Again it all leads back to how we feel. And when we feel enthusiastic about something this creates a causal link from desire to action to result. When we find someone that can energize us we LOVE IT and as a result we become extremely motivated active and productive.As an INFP part of my world experience is that I constantly secondguess myself and Im plagued by a nagging sense of selfcriticism. While that may sound terrible in actuality this pattern of selfcriticism can sometimes be energizing to me but only for a short while. Its enough for me to get off my ass and do what I need to do before I compromise one of my values being on time academic work job performance etc. Think procrastinationI do a LOT of things just because I know I would hate myself if I didnt conform to my internal valuesystem. Thats kind of how I live daytoday momenttomoment.INFPs need to be energized to be motivated. In my experience when an INFP remains focused and interested in a task they can accomplish almost anything they put their mind to theyre on fire. When around someone who continually reenergizes them things can get real exciting real fast. When actively focused on something theyre passionate about INFPs can attack a project with an incredible amount of thought energy and zeal. Im talking blood sweat and tears. Its like watching a slow explosion of awesome.So imagine an INFP saying to his ENTP friend Man I should go to the gym and workout. Im getting a little pudgy. The ENTP friend might go Huh yeah. We could afford to lose some weight I guess. Lets go next Saturday. Here the INFP was poised to go workout but the motivation probably wont stick. Chances are if pressured the INFP would probably go workout maybe once or twicebut begrudginglybefore losing interest and moving on.Now imagine the same situation but this time the conversation exists between two INFPs. The INFP friend might turn the initial statement of selfcriticism into something exciting. And this excitement leads to ACTION! Holy balls lets go workout and become greek gods! And just like that they both hit the gym on a consistent basis. At the gym Dude Im so pumped that were going to be sexy greek gods. We are so awesome. And they support each other in an exciting way. Having that extra person on the same wavelength as you can be hellamotivating.My brother is an ENTP and we can have a very groovy synergy when it comes to exploring new ideas. But my brother cant seem to keep me motivated beyond the initial excitement. He also tends to get irritated when he recognizes that my excitement has drained over time. So after a while I tend to get disgruntled and flaky when it comes to followthrough. Again if an INFP feels negatively about a certain task chances are they wont do it unless they become very selfcritical and force themselves to do it which over time can really stress them out. In contrast an INFP friend would intuitively understand my loss of excitement wouldnt get all butthurt about it and would work hard to get me excited again. Why? Because INFPs are naturally very patient forgiving and passionate people. They want to influence the world for good. They want to coax out positive changes in other peopleand just as important they want to coax out positive changes in themselves.TLDR As an INFP INFP friends are freaking awesome. We can continually and consistently energize each other with our normally shortlived hairbrained ideas in a synergistic manner which can lead to an enormous amount of selfactualization selfimprovement and incredible results. Together we are unfrigginstoppable.,infp,cgmoym2,60,t5_2qn2o

1445097,0,t3_2alme6,Two things that Im working on right now are  saying no to people without an explanation and  not apologizing so much.  Mostly this is about being more assertive.  But there is something else here.I think if you apologize about everything it sort of dilutes the sincerity of your apology They arent really sorry they say sorry about everything.  Indeed if you apologize for everything then you apologize for nothing.  It is like a person who thinks that everything is awesome. Words lose their meaning if they are overused. The second thing is to only apologize about things that you caused.  I used to say Im sorry to my friends when they told me that they couldnt sleep last night or when we got stuck in traffic. Neither thing is my fault and I shouldnt apologize of either.Finally I think that people will kind of view you as weak if you apologize for everything even things that arent your fault.,infp,cixf3rc,2,t5_2qn2o

Some of the films Ive really loved so far are Big Fish A very imaginative adventure that will make you laugh and make you cry but ultimately leave you with a good feeling. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind It has a very INFP feel to it and is just a great movie overall. One of those it will blow your mind movies.  centimeters per second A movie about lost love. Again this one has a very INFP feel to it. Its beautifully animated and told but will leave you a little sad. Best watched by yourself at night where you can think about it after and then go to sleep and forget about it in the morning. Where the Wild Things Are If you were an imaginative kid most INFPs are this movie will hit home. A very good view into the mind of introversion. Dont shy away because its a kids movie. Its one of those movies where itll have you thinking about it for the next few days. Howls Moving Castle Heres your adventure movie. Great characters one is almost definitely an infp whimsical fun and at sometimes even a little dark. Great animation and a very well done story. I would highly recommend this movie along with any other movie written or directed by Hayao Miyazaki Spirited Away Princess Mononoke My Neighbor TotoroIf you do a search for movies within the INFP sub youll find even more recommendations which are all great!edit I almost forgot about Her.

I believe Im drawn to other INFPs as well I seem to get along with them for obvious reasons. I also like cuddly people! And people who are very passionate about things. Theres only a few people I can have long thoughtful conversations with and I need to find someone like that to marry.   However theres one exception to my general type. Im weirdly attracted to aloof emotionlessseeming people who actually care very deeply about their friends or lovers. This usually happens with fictional characters though..examples would be Spock or Sherlock Holmes.Looks Im a  girl so I like tall guys. Preferably with large yet slender hands and nice forearms. I kinda like guys with a little bit of a soft tummy but they have to be willing to work out with me Im big into fitness and eating healthy. Both of those may not work well together but hey who said INFPs were realistic?

1623754,0,t1_cjj9exd,Im sorry but thats just too unrealistic society wasnt created over night and nor can it be changed in such a time its a highly immutable well oiled machine. An artists job isnt to bring about an upheaval of cultural phenomenon like fame and fortune and they shouldnt be expected to. What Andy Warhol did really well though was to create a rhetoric of modern society and the issues that came with it. He succeeded in changing peoples perspectives highlighting how easily influenced people are by the media and popular culture and displaying how we objectify people as idols seeing only what we want to see in them. Andy Warhol did that better than any other artist in the th century he distilled the Zeitgeist of the th century all the while not personally rejecting it.Current societal values are the reality we live in within western culture and I find it more noble to try and shape those values however big or small your impact may be than to reject that society completely. From the very day we were born that society has had an impact on who we are and the values we possess whether we reject that society or not. At the end of the day as much as we can reject it or say how against it we are were all slaves to capitalism in one form or another. The rejection of society just reminds me of a hipster attitude just like every counter cultural movement has been looking down on others because you take more of a stance on the issue than them when in reality were all swimming in the same pile of consumerist crap.You know what screw all that its all idealistic anyway. If anything just use society to propel you into a position in which you can do whatever you desire to do whether that be living out your days hedonistically or enhancing the lives of the less fortunate.,infp,cjju8rn,1,t5_2qn2o

See what is giving you trouble and work on improving those areas. For example break up with someone if youre in a really bad relationship. . Make sure that youre not spending too much time alone. I know that I tend to become reclusive when Im depressed it helps for a while but it does far more harm than good in the long run.  . Get outside. Fresh air and sunlight could help improve your mood. . Set up some daily routines. Yes yes I know Ne always wants a new shiny. But it has been proven that depressive symptoms can get better if the depressed person has a few daily routines they follow. Read a book before going to bed drink a cup of tea in the morning.  . Throw in some variety from time to time. While routines are good they over reliance on them can also causeworsen depression. Go out of town and visit a place youve never been to. Do something that youve always wanted to do but never have done for some reason.  . Talk about it with a trusted person. Family and friends should support you through thick and thin dont feel guilty about telling them whats bothering you. If you dont have anybody IRL you want to talk to then feel free to give me a PM.

1677899,0,t3_2dla1r,I test as an INFP or INFJ Im a bisexual somekindofgenderqueer an atheist and humanist. I would also say that in my attitude and instincts Im pretty conservative. I mean a pretty particular thing by that though so let me explain I say I am conservative because I instinctively favour the continued existence of actuallyexisting things of value. I have no desire to see people suffer to serve cruel or outdated dogma. Neither do I see the point in maintaining anything which has lost its value and purpose.      In the world today though I see things which are full of meaning and purpose in the lives of real people. I see such things casually and callously mocked degraded and destroyed by powerful people. Those same powerful people mock any expression of regret for the value which is destroyed whilst keeping a lions share of any new value created for themselves. Money is the only thing that means anything no thought for past future sympathy or community. No one is interested in anything larger than themselves. Real humanism is ignored. Hedonistic mean spirited individualism is the spirit of the age.  If that lot doesnt make me sound conservative I dont know what would...What I say above with about the human world of course applies just as much to our relationship with the nonhuman world. ,infp,cjqnu4y,0,t5_2qn2o

1756668,0,t3_2ek803,Its always seemed like INFPs have some sort of tragedy or dark part of their past. I guess the most profoundly impacting event in recent memory would be the sudden death of my father a few years back. I find myself more stable and emotionally aware. But most likely these events just made it clearer to me what I really want out of life and who I am as a person. I have been pretty reclusive since then and it allowed me the time to really introspect on what my values are. Also it showed me how fragile life is. You cant spend time on any BS albeit your own or others. You need the focus and willpower to cut all the excess out of your life and just keep the essentials needed to streamline whatever it is you want to be the best at. This includes those negative pointless thoughts that lead a lot of us into that silly downward spiral.      ,infp,ck0l399,3,t5_2qn2o

Ive send her a text wich consists in i want to tell you something important tommorow. The next day i said i love her i cried for  second and then i go after  hour of sincerity.

2174128,0,t1_clg4nrw,No problem The functions are very important for the mbti types. A lot of people take those tests online which are very flawed. I remember when I first learned about this someone encouraged me to look at the functions as well. INFPs tend to be very reserved with their emotions and inner thoughts unless they have a good level of trust with others. And we tend to take our time in our heads kind of formulating ways to communicate. You know how some people just talk nonstop without taking a pause? INFPs are like the opposite of that. We tend to carefully choose the right words so what we say is congruent with how we feel. Youve got it. But speaking from experience I used to go back and delete posts all the time. Not under this account but another one I had on reddit. Always question your motivation for doing things. Your real feelings on why you did something could be overshadowed by rationalizations you come up with to hide those feelings. I dont like to make presumptions over the internet though haha. Just saying as someone who used to rationalize the crap out of everything I was not very in touch with my feelings because I perceived them as a weakness or flaw I needed to hide. As an INFP your greatest tool for understanding yourself is your feelings. Heh I like to think of INFPs minds as water. We can be very flexible and were constantly building up our knowledge and testing it to see how it aligns with our own belief structure. ,infp,clg6n13,2,t5_2qn2o

Pantheists thus do not believe in a distinct personal or anthropomorphic god.  Some Eastern religions are considered to be pantheistically inclined.gtPantheism was popularised in the West as both a theology and philosophy based on the work of the thcentury philosopher Baruch Spinoza  p. whose book Ethics was an answer to Descartes famous dualist theory that the body and spirit are separate.  Spinoza held the monist view that the two are the same and monism is a fundamental part of his philosophy. He was described as a Godintoxicated man and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance.

Did extremely well in school graduated th in my class even took college classes while I was in high school and I dont mean AP classes. Once I graduated I went away for college wanted to get away from this shitty town. My depression eventually went away once I started becoming self sufficient around the time I was   got a job two cats my babies! had always wanted pets and met this one ENTJ. Moved in with him the first week we met  was the kind of ridiculous connection that you only hear about in movies. Thought he was the love of my life and he helped me to see life a lot differently. We were crazy about each other. Unfortunately he had some issues was really two faced too  and I was busy with collegework. Two years in he somewhat cheats on me.. pretty much just messaging a ton of girls really inappropriate things. I move back to this shitty town and I have to say I love it. Became closer with the friends I had made new friends much better relationship with my parents and now have a marketing job that I enjoy. Also I finally weigh  and way more active than I used to be and Im pretty proud of myself for that! I was never overweight but never fit either. Im  now  next month. Guess you could say Im happy now.

2433929,0,t3_2ma42z,I never fit into one group of people I had friends from various social circles but I felt distant from a lot of them for the most part. I played a varsity sport and was team captain. I was in regular and honors classes I was quiet and a loner yet I had friends I didnt drink smoke or do drugs but I hungout with people that did. I hated trying to socialize in groups. I had As and Fs. I skipped school a bunch. I was a procrastinator and a perfectionist. I played in our school orchestras for half of my life but quit during high school because I hated crowdsaudiences. I was extremely depressed and anxious. I felt like I was all over the place. My biggest advice is to try your best to focus and go through with things and not procrastinate. Push yourself out of your comfort zone when you know it will probably benefit you. Most of it all acceptance is key. Try to ask girls out that you like and accept that rejection is possible but you might be happily surprised. Take a risk! Believe in yourself and the fact that you have the potential to do anything and that things will be okay. Enjoy the present moment ,infp,cmcjfuk,1,t5_2qn2o

2665876,0,t1_cn5wu4s,Hey man Im  years old too.  Im just going to college so I havent really seen much of the real world.  Student life is still much of an isolated bubble.  But Ive been to Africa and Im in India travelling right now and what its taught me is to appreciate what we have in America.  The fact that we even have a choice in what job we want to pursue is a luxury.  These people are starving in the streets in IndiaAfrica.  Im staying at a nice fancy hotel and across the street are people in rags that look like theyre starving.  I study civil engineering right now but Im just as lost as you.  I dont know what I want to do yet.  I figure Ill see how this goes get my engineering degree and see if I enjoy doing that line of work.  Because I do see the potential in helping other people through civil engineering.  At the same time I dont really like doing math at all but Im capable if I force myself.  Id really like to pursue something more creative like photography or writing or even doing something that helps people directly such as massage therapy.  Maybe even singing.  Basically what Im doing is studying for my degree as a backup but developing these hobbies at the same time.  Have you found people that you love and want to spend time with?  Personally I had to work on my social skills a bit to find people that I liked.  Honestly it doesnt have to be that difficult.  Its more about getting comfortable being vulnerable and being okay when conversations get awkward. I dont know where you live but Ive found joining a club or fraternity rewarding just for the connections you make.  Also talking to a therapist helped me figure some things out on my own specifically the feeling hopeless part.  It sounds like you may have some selfesteem issues and a therapist can really help you deal with that.  And lovingkindness meditation.  One thing that helped me was just putting myself in uncomfortable positions and seeing what happens.  I would talk to a pretty girl I see and realize theyre just people too.

2675435,0,t1_cn7e0fp,hmm actually that ex seems more like an unhealthy INTJ to me. i cant imagine an INTP trying to organize someones cluttered room and desktop for no reason... thats very J. lots of INTJs have poor leadership skills too... the type itself isnt really a leadership type but they will lead if they feel like no one can better execute their vision i guess.i do think that there are more INTJs on reddit honestlyINTJs and INTPs have a very different way of writing I can usually spot. If someone is online getting super angry at someone yet is logical in other ways theyre probably an INTJ. INTPs are generally fairly mild when it comes to emotions and dont lose their shit in debates.INTJs are way more forceful and have a tendency to be more angry. INTPs are generally pretty chill. yeah ENFJ can be good. when they end i think its generally because the ENFJ sort of drowns out the INFP... like kinda talks them to death. in socionics this is the extinguishment relations which basically says that we are intrigued by eachother by ultimately our differences lead to kind of an explosion haha.

2677221,0,t1_cn7yeus,gt arrogance is a term created by the envious members of the society to frown upon gifted and talented people who believe in themselves. That seriously sounds like one of those quotes youd see on a meme accompanied by a picture of a neckbearded fedora guy in a trench coat... Not that I want to make a big deal of it or be insulting but I just thought it was funny. Now I know what people mean when they complain about N snobs in the cult of MBTI...Are you assuming that before choosing to meet up with a person from the internet I stay up all night talking to them? No thats not how it works. I spend like  mins max talking to them or just agree to it after a decent amount of back and forth exchanges of words over a few days or so. In other words definitely less time than if I were to go on a date.I dont need to know absolutely everything before dating someone I just think it would be good to know things that would be considered basic information like having a general idea of their lifestyle. With that being said I do believe knowledge is power and this is where we differ. Also I think you missed the gluten intolerant part of my post or you actually have no idea what gluten is to be fair I dont think celiac disease and gluten problems are big in Greece like they are in North America am I right?. You pretty much HAVE to go to a specialized restaurant for this type of diet. And if I knew someone was going to take me out for something that involves food I would tell them of my dietary restrictions. I think it would be cruel to let someone put effort into planning or preparing a meal for me and then tell them I cant eat it because I neglected to inform them of my dietary restrictions. In a case like that I would take the blame for it. But yes I would consider it a turn off if they dont bother to do their research and take it into consideration if I actually informed them. And yes I do consider narrowmindedness a turn off as well. Like anyone else there are aspects of personality that I can find attractive or unattractive. Most of your assumptions you stated about me arent too far off but Im  years old and think most goth fashion is tacky but I admit I liked it in my teens. The reason I seek out people who are similar to me is because for a lot of my life I had a feeling of being surrounded by people but all alone and constantly had the black sheep label put on me. In my high school years I had too many friends who just liked to talk about celebrities and gossip and I was always bored out of my mind. If someones interest are different but still fascinating I can appreciate them. To be honest most of my friends have  common interests with me but are otherwise pretty different. I also never actually have been in a serious relationship that started from the internet Im just saying Id try it and suggest it to others. I keep forgetting to mention it but if youre looking for something other than the typical heterosexual monogamous relationship you kind of HAVE to use a dating site because your dating pool is greatly reduced and we live in a culture where its assumed everyone is straight and monogamous. Its sort of the same with people in their s because again small dating pool and at that point everyone assumes youre married. Did you consider those types or only teens and something year olds in their dating prime when you said that people should just wait for things to happen instead of making an effort? At the end of the day I think its superficial to judge a relationship by the way it started or assume that just because it started in an unromantic way the rest of its going to proceed like that.Im in the same boat as you just trying to offer my own perspective and figure out where another perspective is coming from regardless of whether I agree with it. I didnt ask specifically for advice hence why Ill read it but probably not follow it. I mostly just wanted to see other INFPs thoughts on dating and already got my answer but I enjoy this sidetracked conversation nonetheless.,infp,cn818ey,1,t5_2qn2o

I can promise you that as long as you bail when things get hot and uncomfortable you will always be controlled by fear and anxiety and you will not be able to finish things worth finishing. Let me be an INFP for a moment and say that you can think of it as Quest. The Quest for the English Degree. Right now it is getting towards the mountain with the dragon and the whole thing took longer than you thought and while the treasure of an English degree sounded so great back home now looking at that final ascent up the mountain maybe is not as great as all that after all and you should trudge back home to the run down cottage on the dying farm empty handed and figure something else out. Well what kind of hero would you be then? Also I have to say that as someone who has a bachelors in English that it is great major and I would not have traded it for any other degree. Also there is no mountain or dragon. Not even metaphorically. You are actually on the down slope. You have lots of momentum here and if you keep moving you will be through it in no time. If you stop reverse course or change direction you will be fighting this momentum and quickly find yourself stuck. Again.So keep going!

3433234,0,t1_cpj3ixu,gt but I have practiced a couple different martial arts styles and can tell you that you will hurt other people and other people will hurt you. Not badly but its an inevitable part of practicing any martial art.Its only as inevitable as getting hurt while doing any physical activity.  Ive known people who had to go to the hospital for injuries sustained while running a foot race practicing yoga and getting stung by a bee while taking a dump outdoors.  In my experience aikido isnt any more dangerous than any of these activities.gt Youre talking about acquiring a skill that is fundamentally predicated on hurting people and avoiding getting hurt by people who are deliberately trying to hurt you.Thats the historical basis daitoryu perhaps  I havent studied it but that doesnt mean its the goal of todays practitioners and aikido is definitely not about hurting people even those who attack you.  If you see people leaving aikido practice with injuries with any regularity Id suggest you find a different dojo.Archery was also fundamentally predicated on hurting people but if I certainly hope that nobody goes to archery class expecting to get shot!gt That aside I think aikido and frankly most martial arts are structured more like a mindbody sport than a serious combat system.This is awfully dismissive.  There are vanishingly few combat systems in the world today which are actually about winning a fight at all costs.  Just get a gun.  Game over.gt So if you treat it like a sport to condition your body and and center your mind instead of a feelgood damselindistresssaver then youll have a much richer experience while practicing.This is a pretty specific recommendation about aikido training from someone who claims to have no experience with it.  |,infp,cpjm4y0,1,t5_2qn2o

I usually let myself down but that doesnt mean I ask anyone else for anything. I just decide to suffer in silence and let everything fall to pieces instead of asking for help.I never ask or expect anything of anyone else so Im resentful when they have expectations for me. But the people around me particularly men that I am involved with well they end up giving so much. and I end up taking. and taking and taking and not really giving much back. I guess I feel like since I can take it or leave it and I dont really deeply want to be with that person Im with them just for the sake of it it doesnt matter what they think of me. If they dont like it they can leave Ill be fine. Maybe this is from witnessing the relationship dynamics between my parents.

It happens to be a positive quality that we can put our partners needs first especially physically. Its not just for them however for some INFPs a lot of us. We enjoy intimacy better when we find ways to make intimacy better for our partners. I dont see this as being a doormat however I am enjoying their enjoyment.  I am not saying this quality has not been taken advantage of. I am loyal and benevolent to those I have decided to put high on my priority list. However I can turn my loyalty and love on and off if someone displeases me greatly or my principles a switch turns off in my head and they then become shit to me and I do not feel the need to treat them so highly or regard their feelings whatsoever.

We used to joke that we were the same person in two bodies and when were together for long enough sadly we currently live in different towns we get on the same wavelength where well laugh at jokes before the other person says them because we know what the other is going to say. And as for how we help each other we can fulfill the need for deeper meaningful conversations for each other. She helps me actually realize things and to do things  to get out of the planning stage. I dont know if this is typical for other INFJs but my friend can be very insecure though other people would never guess that and I think my tendency towards being demonstrative with my affection and the fact that I rarely judge her as she feels others do helps some. We also tend to mesh really well in beliefs the only things that we strongly disagree on at this point is liking Jack Black and Jurassic Park lol. And we understand the need for space. So if we end up not hanging out for a couple of weeks neither of us gets upset. We can always pick up where we left off and its great.And my host sisters are an ENFP and an INTJ and I love them to pieces. Spending time with both of them is so much fun and when I lived with them was like a golden time in my life lol.

You are causing you suffering. You lived what? ? ? ? years perfectly well without her and these feelings will change and you will continue to live perfectly well without her or with her if things go that way it doesnt matter the feelings will still change. Fourth dont do anything stupidly permanent over temporary feelings. Do temporarily stupid things if you must. It is a great way to learn. Fifth be kind to yourself.

As an INFP when something starts to trouble me I lose my focus. I get overwhelmed. I cannot see a point in time past whatever is bothering me and as such I cant effectively handle the issue or my emotions. So I go to the gym. That time to focus on just physical body mechanics and the music I am listening to gives me the mental space to get away from my problems long enough that when I am done I can examine my problems with a level head and actually plan on how to fix it.My advice may sound contrite but its what works for me and I fail to see why it shouldnt be mentioned.

4410334,0,t3_3bj09p,Its been that way for as long as I can remember. The question You posed is one Ive been trying to answer for months. At first You get to know someone or a group of people. You dont talk much instead You observe get to know what each person is about. After a while You kind of understand the dynamic of the relationship who is closer to You who inspires You in some way what You appreciate in a certain person. Often a person or people become more than interesting but not quite fascinating to You somewhere in between. Seeing as You havent really exposed Your jellylike malleable self to them in fact You havent told them almost anything You come to the conclusion that You are willing to invest in that relationship to learn from those people to try to appropriate from them what You feel is good or noble. You are willing to help them to aid them with little regard to Your own needs after all it is You who wants their knowledge. You invest a lot more than You take but You rationalise it by claiming that Youre enduring this to get somethinng worthwhile something that You dont yet have. After a while You become the default helping guy which immediately doesnt feel all that great. You play that role until sooner or later You are fed up. You angrily respond to any pleads for help just to prove Yourself that You can You can be the nothelping guy. In a way You realize that it looks funny and out of character but You dont know what else to do. Your ego is hit by the lack of reciprocation lack of investment on their part. Someone might say find different friends. No they still have that precious knowledge that distinctive feeling about them that trait or flaw that connects them to You that makes them important.

When you trust them and when you cannot keep for yourself your troubles. Since my last breakup I keep to myself a lot. I dont want to brother anyone with my life and my inner world. Its a fear actually. Im very anxious about it. Being a burden is something I really really fear. Im so afraid about it that I might be too private actually I dont let people get to really know me. Anyway you may have relied too much on your friend. That wasnt very healthy. But cant it be fixed ? Perhaps you should let some time to your friend to get over it and to let some time to yourself to be alone a bit and to think alone. What do you need ? Someone to listen to you? A friend ? Or something else other than people ? I dont know your life neither do I know your problems but you might need to think about it. You may try to write that helps. And about your relationship with your friend how was it? Was it only rant from you? You may try to truly share with him and to ask him about him his life etc not only ranting. And please dont be sorry for ranting here. Nobody will get mad at you or will reproach you to rant. Do it if you need to and dont regret it. If you need to talk Im here.

4572667,1,t3_3dnval,I think there are woman on the other side of the fence that feel the same way or more importantly have the same dilemma.I personally would say that women overall are attracted to stoicism. I think they respond positively if they feel like we can run things and maintain a positive stature and outlook has to come from a good place and not just faked when things go wrong. And things will go wrong even in the most ideal circumstances. I remember on the Morning Show Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda were talking about menwomen dynamic related stuff and basically Kathies interpretation of the what the guest star said was that the ideal man was a Cave man that considered the womans thoughts. Something to that effect.I know what your saying about thinking that it would have been better to be born as a woman but look it like this though.When your girlfriendwife is being very feminine in the way she acts your doing a good job. A woman doesnt want to be burdened with being masculine around her man because it stifles her ability to be feminine around you. How she wants to be professionally is vastly different from what she wants to be like at home especially if shes a high powered career type.You can be who you are. All men have some female traits. All women have some male traits. Its what makes us human. If a man can be a caretaker for a child and a woman can be a fire fighter it shows the amount of diversity we hold in our hands.As long as you can foster a persona where you are self confident  a decision maker and emotionally healthy to a good extent I dont see why any woman wouldnt want you.We all have this within us.,infp,ct6zt8j,-1,t5_2qn2o

Heres a good exampleI once went to Six Flags as a teen with a group. One of the guys there had been fighting with his girlfriend the entire time. After a day at the park we get to the parking lot and see them standing there on both sides of the car. I was the driver and asked what had happened. The girl had obviously been crying and said that they had been sitting there for hours because he got angry about her talking to someone. I was annoyed but calmly helped her into the car and put the guy on the opposite side. Later we got to the hotel room and the continued fighting. Eventually he stormed out at around pm and she started crying again and telling him to come back. Being late at night near Colfax in Denver I could understand her worry so I told her to wait there and I went out and found him sulking near a drainage ditch a mile away. I told him he needed to come back but first he needed to calm down. He came back but immediately got back into fighting with the girl and he slept on the floor near to the door. I woke up the next morning to fighting. Shes still crying hes still jumping down her throat. Calmly I told him if this continued I would have to call the police. He shut up for a little while and we got back in the car. This entire time the whole group was anxious and stressed from this guys behavior. We started to drive down the interstate when he starts screaming at the girl again. After about twenty minutes she snaps and screams back and he reached over and slammed her against the door. I pulled over to the side of the road and flicked on the emergency blinkers. I got out walked over to his door pulled it open and threw him onto the pavement. Im  and he was only about  so this wasnt hard. Then I slammed his suitcase on top of him got back in the car and drove off without ever having said a word. Our hometown was more than  hours away and everyone had been dead silent for about  of those hours after the incident. No one protested though. I got yelled at by his mother four days later because apparently he had to walk all the way back into Denver with his suitcase in tow borrow a cell phone to call her then spend the night asleep behind a hotel. His wallet had been left in the car so he didnt have money or even proper ID. I explained what had happened and her mood shifted from anger toward me to fuming rage directed at him. She told me she was sorry for his behavior and walked off. TldrI got so angry I threw a guy out of a car and drove off stranding him hundreds of miles from home. ,infp,ctcs3zy,4,t5_2qn2o
4631965,0,t3_3efd59,I was born into a Methodist family and later started going to a Southern Baptist church when I was . In college I tried to maintain a role in my religion and local churches but it grew more difficult and I eventually considered myself backslid a term youll hear often in SB churches.It all ended for me when I was  when someone tried to console me over something and unintentionally said that religion was the cause of most of my problems. It seems strange looking back because she herself was a semidevout Christian  one of those people who wants to talk about God when drunk  and was trying to convince me to turn to God or pray about something and that my problems were only a trial and other things.I have some general ideas about the afterlife that arent really based on anything  I could just as easily expect oblivion or a nonbelievers hell. Other than that I consider myself an apatheist.,infp,ctefg6b,3,t5_2qn2o

4641179,0,t3_3e7lgs,Ive recently found out my mum is an INFP as well which makes a lot of sense when my dad says youre just like your mother thats not said with any kind of affection either. I have a very emotionaly distant relationship with my dad. I try to get along with him but it doesnt seem to work. Im now at the point that soon as I move out I am going to break contact with my dad and my older brother. Probably not so much my dad but my older brother definitely. Anyway onto my upbringing. Ive been to  different schools lived on two continents. Im from the UK and when I was younger we moved to New Jersey until we moved back because my parents got divorced. When we moved back to the UK thats when my  years of hell began. I started getting bullied at school. Im not sure why maybe because I had an American accent maybe because I was a little bit different maybe a little of both. My mum met her future ex husband. He was abusive rarely physicallyit did happen when he was drunk but the majority of time it was emotional. He was a sergeant in the army and he treated us like soldiers. He used to use stuff against me like saying my depression wasnt real that I was making it up and depression isnt real. A few years later he used my mums depression against me saying that I helped cause it and that I was basically the antichrist. He used to yell at me for the pettiest of things. He didnt just yell for a short time it would go on for hours and hours. I could go on for a lot longer about how horrible he was but that would take so long. You would also think that seeing my dad on weekends would be some sort of sanctuary well you would be wrong. My older brother was abusive to me he used to beat me and was genuinely horrible to me. It got so bad once one of his friends stepped in and told him to leave me a fuck alone my dad now denies that my brother was ever abusive to me. My dad definitely favours my other brothers which is definitely not in my head as my mum and grand parents and even my younger brother has noticedI dont know if my older brother has noticed because I dont speak to him unless its about football My younger brother is the favourite. For my prom my parents wouldnt let me buy a suit but had to rent one which isnt so bad but my dad outright bought my younger brothers suit which he has to pay him back for. He bought my younger brother an expensive racing bike despite for years him saying no to me for me wanting one. Theres plenty of incidents like that. I know gifts arent the be all and end all of everything but my gifts pale in comparison by a long stretch.Over the last  or  years I have slowly started to get my life back together. Ive been to see a therapist Ive started to discover hobbies I enjoy and Im to make new friends within these hobbies. Im  now. Im going back to college to study Psychology. Then on to university to hopefully to become a psychiatrist or councillor. I just want to help people. If you have any questions about certain parts as Im aware they are quite vague. Im on my phone so I couldnt be bothered in going in to great detail.,infp,ctfl5gc,1,t5_2qn2o

4744110,0,t3_3fviui,I married an ISTJ. We generally reach the same conclusions through completely different means. Where Im better with the big picture thinking and terrible with details she is better at the smaller details that add up to a big picture. Where I like to prioritize and have reasons for doing certain things at certain times she often wants everything done now without regard to a strategically best waytime to do things. But she will listen and realize that my big picture reasoning makes sense. At the same time she gets me off my butt to actually do stuff that needs to be done instead of sitting around thinking about the big questions. We both have similar super snarky senses of humor. The two types are pretty different. Youve come across one of the downsides to MBTI in that it can sometimes not be very reliable. It can often be based on your mood and its easily manipulated into what you want it to be. Your type generally doesnt change but if you have an idealistic view of certain types you might falsely imprint those feelings and answers causing your test to be wonky. Its one of the reasons its generally regarded as poor science. ,infp,ctsjg1u,3,t5_2qn2o

I really just like to use evocative words ordered by feeling rather than logic like instead of He threw the man out of the house I would write He threw the wretched old scumbag onto the cold and earthy lawn where he will freeze in the cold of the night. On the opposite side Ti is very condensed. I once had an INTP English teacher who would cut half of my writing and get me to write it in a more technical fashion.

5064266,0,t3_3kc3u8,I recently just read that INFPs are the most likely to be depressed and consider suicide during the college years. I can definitely relate. The American college atmosphere is almost in complete contrast with an INFPs way of life. Ive definitely had my downs mostly during my high school and early college years. I was about to get on antidepressants but I was very hesitant. My SOs sister was on them and though she didnt have as many suicidal thoughts she still had them and her mood swings were much more common and extreme. I decided to just stick it out I slowly made positive changes in my life. Eating better working out a few times a week etc. Looking back now Im glad I didnt get on antidepressants. Life is full of ups and downs. My personal opinion on the matter is that antidepressants are given out to frequently to people who may not even need them. If youve had long term depression problems you may want to look into them but I feel that us INFPs need to approach them with more caution due to our temperament. ,infp,cuwfpgu,6,t5_2qn2o

I take positive criticism well Ill usually try something if the person is nice about itEdit another interesting thing is that I could be talking to someone about something that I dont really have an opinion on but if they have a strong stance on it and I can see that they wouldnt be interested in changing that stance I tend to take up the opposing stance and defend it whether I agree with it or not.

5252461,0,t1_cvi4g7w,MBTI isnt strictly about how you perceive yourself...not sure where that comes from. And how someone presents themselves gives clues to their MBTI.  When looking at someone trying to figure out their type I am looking at dozens of different things at once and comparing to what I already learned and have seen with other people. Steven Colbert is so unlikely to be an INFP it is ridiculous.,infp,cvj3z17,0,t5_2qn2o
5255238,0,t1_cvj7lw9,I think that a good way of INFPs can slightly overcome that is by adopting caricatures or personas.  Or atleast thats how I tend to interact with my friends.  Personally it allows me a sort of release where I dont actually have to stress about if certain opinions and ideals conform to my standards because I am basically creating a fake shell for me to interact with others.  Even though this is exhausting to do it brings me amusement to entertain my close friends because I can trust they know that it isnt the real me.  This allows me and I assume other INFPs to be seemingly extroverted because the pressure of presenting my real identity is gone and I can essentially play with my social group of friends.For example Ill sort of play dumb in order to sort of passively aggressively tell someone how silly they are being especially if the real me doesnt like the choices they are making.  My friend realizes that I am criticizing them but is caught up in my own humor and selfdeprecating entertainment that they arent offended and since theyve gotten to know me better they understand what Im doing.I feel Colbert is the same way and this is why hes so successful.  Hes never fully hostile in interviews and if he is its a sort of playful banter. He basically plays a character thats really dumb but the key is that when hes interviewing someone he may not particularly agree with he never actually criticizes them directly or harshly.  Instead he uses seemingly dumb or simple questions and assumptions as forms of deciphering the logic in a nice way.  If he ever insults them he does so passively aggressively sometimes adopting their beliefs and ideals with his character and basically mocking those ideals because he knows directly how they dont fit in line with his own personal ideals.  This was always an extreme caricature on The Colbert Report but he still sort of does this on his new show too just a little bit reserved.Watching his recent interview with Donald Trump is a good example of all of thisThis is pretty much a staple way of a INFP avoiding conflict by being nice but still passively aggressively questioning someones own ideals that conflict with their own beliefs.  He also utilizes somewhat ridiculous imagery to add to all that a typical INFP way of making points.  He is also vulnerable to imagery as he also breaks down a bit from hearing about the Beautiful Big Door.  Colbert has ultimately gained so much experience with interviewing people that he has basically mastered this entire system without fault.EDIT  Looking at his other interviews it really does become more apparent that he really is an INFP.  What I forgot to mention above is that even though he may disagree with someone he still wants to be nice and respect them to a certain extent which is why he utilizes being silly to someone because he probably couldnt handle it comfortably if it he was serious.But on the opposite end of the silly spectrum in his interview with Ted Cruz he puts on a really strong and serious persona possibly because he strongly researched his points and finds no real faults in them.  He wants to validate his own Authenticity.  And even though he feels strongly concerned with Ted Cruzs stances he is still has enough respect and desire to avoid conflict that he genuinely stops his audience from booing him near the end.

5387249,0,t1_cw055yj,gt I guess the paradox for me though is that emotional experiences in themselves are not bad or good because we also have things like hope elation joy for all the suffering. And really can you understand suffering without knowing happiness and vice versa? To me apathy is the greater curse. You can only have great suffering if you have great happiness to contrast it with. You can only have life steal your optimism if you had optimism in the first place to steal. If life steals your optimism is it really gone or has life yet to steal your pessimism?I agree with most of this if were applying it to someone who isnt clinically depressed. ,infp,cw0a579,1,t5_2qn2o

5615859,0,t1_cwt12k4,Where did you find this text from? Its very difficult for me to read. I have to read every paragraph two times before anything starts to make sense. Take the third paragraph for example. It talks about sympathy in introverted people.To the outer world or to the blind eyes of the extravert this sympathy looks like coldness for it does nothing visibly and an extraverted consciousness is unable to believe in invisible forces.So basically Extroverts see introverts as cold people because the sympathy of introverts doesnt show outside. Why does this have to phrased in such a difficult way? Its not that complex and no I dont think it is very specific constructive or eyeopening.Its so difficult to talk about personality in a nonvague way. Words like harmonious and ambitious are all fairly vague ways to describe a personality. They can mean so many different things. I did see that this text then proceeds to explain what it means with those words but the explanation is unnecessarily complicated.

5736087,0,t1_cx72ult,I see. Well I think if you ask people how to tell the difference between types they will simply end up indirectly typing you as the question you pose pretty much requires them to send you through their typing process.But you bring up a very good point. If you say you have a decent understanding of it youre probably hitting a point where the information you use to type people has progressed beyond the point where it makes sense to fully differentiate the types.Since we cannot exactly measure or test our actual mental processes but we can measure or test our actual actions I think obsessively typing yourself as X because of Y and Z may actually be counterproductive on the whole.What I mean by that is you probably exhibit hints of both INTJ and INF. So your next steps could be to spend your entire life trying to fit into the current JungMyersBriggs system go into psychology or neuroscience and further the discipline yourself or simply move on using the conclusion that there are major limitations to the system and that every person belongs to a point on a spectrum or multiple spectrums. What I would do in your situation is instead of going deeper into the micro aspects of the system or its functions zoom out in a macro sense and place yourself where you think you fit best based on the generally accepted ethos of each type. Then create caveats to that understanding of yourself.For example this is a little window into how I progressed in my understanding. I consider myself INFP but I place great importance on science logic and business among other things and most people would assume I am INTP or INTJ based on my precise language extreme emotional reservedness and annoyance at fallacious reasoning or incorrect facts. I thought I was INTP for the longest time but realized that while the general description for INFPs paints a picture of a dreamer who has no consideration for facts  an SJW living in his ivory tower  I still belonged to the overall essence of INFP and that Ive simply developed in a way that made it hard to realize that. I know that was a bit of a ramble but I hope it helped you understand a little bit better what you might be experiencing. EDIT Also this from uPoropopper is very good.gt MBTI in general is comparative if you do not know INTJs or INFPs you will struggle to type yourself. Its a good idea to get a feel for famous INTJs and famous INFP personalities so that you have a basis to type people by. This will help you understand the ethos of each type that I referenced.,infp,cx8497n,2,t5_2qn2o

6091499,0,t3_3yz9r2,Hi  Id like to start this out by saying that I loved reading your post and I think this is something we should do more on this subreddit. Reading someones description about themselves and leaving it as an open conversation is both interesting and comforting to me! Makes the internet feel more real.Anyway my name is Malina. Im a college student with a blonde pixie cut and blue eyes. My major is Elementary Education and Im very passionate about it Ive wanted to be a teacher for a very long time. Im laying on the bed of my boyfriends apartment in Arizona right now. Were in a long distance relationship and Ive visiting him for the holidays. He got a new phone today so hes been messing with it for the past few hours. Were both INFPs so we enjoy solitude and chilling as opposed to more happening places. Were about to binge watch Game of Thrones into . Edit I hope to see more friendly gathering posts like this one in the future. I feel that its perfect for INFPs and it would be really great if I could start recognizing usernames on this sub. We should all be a bunch of friends lol,infp,cyi1gib,5,t5_2qn2o
6099921,0,t3_3z2xt8,INFPs can make great leaders.  Your personality type has little to nothing to do with it.  Stay focused on your goals and on understanding and improving yourself.  Know your strengths opportunities weaknesses and threats.  Find a mentor.  Listen to people and treat them with kindness and respect.  If you have a spouse or close friend their feedback can be tremendously valuable over time.There are many different effective leadership styles its not necessarily about being assertive and powerful over people.,infp,cyizz2j,4,t5_2qn2o

6132772,0,t1_cymkeyb,I have a degree in audio engineering and recording plus some certifications in logic and protools.  I moved to LA right after because I had an internship at a major studio in Hollywood and was excited to start a career as an engineer.  Quit after only a few months.  I just wasnt prepared for that lifestyle because if youre not already aware there is little to no room for creativity.  You start off as an intern cleaning and cleaning til one day they decide they need you inside wrapping cables.  If your lucky one day the engineer allows you to sit and watch him work and so on but its a never ending process of being told what to do cause essentially you are a tool of the artist.  You do everything their way and sure you can put your own twist on it but there is very little wiggle room on that.  Oh and up to  hour work days quite regularly.  The head engineer at that studio had gone up to over a month without a single day off working insane hours.  After I left I just worked on my production for a while til I met some artists wanting a ghost producer so now I do that while in the process of getting signed myself as a solo artist.  I just wanted to share my experience in this field because its a very tough line of work.  If audio engineering really is your calling though dont let this deter you.  Work your ass off day to day and be extremely likeable is gonna be key in getting past intern stage or even assistant engineer at a major studio.  Good luck to you buddy!,infp,cymqcyk,4,t5_2qn2o

Is she having feelings for this other person?The minute someone branches out and starts feeling for someone else is when you should stop trying to get them back. At least imo. Its very likely that it was not your fault at all shes just being unfaithful and trying to push you away for this other person. Maybe nothing is bringing her back to you because the real problem is that she is unfaithful and wants someone else and sadly theres not much you can do about that.I just wanna say that unless you were doing something absolutely awful then Im pretty sure this is her fault not yours. I dont know if the others will agree with me but maybe you just need to get out of that marriage cut her out of your life and begin to build yourself back up again dude.Once again I feel for you. the breakdown of something like a marriage must be seriously painful. but you can come back strong from this no matter how it is going. and if youre having a hard time you can always check back in with us.,infp,cz555x9,1,t5_2qn2o

And people can be authentic and still move out if their depression. Still be authentic in their INFPness without it. Its just written with  what I find to be a tone of distasteful intolerance.

Saying them quietly gives more impact to fucking not inherently but by the silly rules society has placed on the word. This overall annoys me because people act like theres some etymological authority that commands that words have a certain meaning.

6604747,0,t3_460og4,I used to get so stressed out over things like this for the longest time. But at some point I began to question my faith for other reasons not the desire to sin. I just wanted to know the truth and researched it endlessly. I came to the conclusion that there is no god. Even so I am still highly motivated by morality and continue to identify as an INFP. I dont lie cheat or steal but I do smoke pot on occasion because there is nothing morally wrong with it other than that God says it is wrong. I would encourage you to do some research of your own so that you could maybe be released from the fear of hell. Its definitely a personal decision whether you do or not but I also know that its a horrible feeling believing youre going to go to hell. I wouldnt wish it on anyone and I want to help people lose that fear. Its the most terrifying thing in the world and it used to haunt me too. Losing my faith lead me to a huge identity crisis similar to the one youre going through just by believing youre going to hell and it was arguably the most painful realization Ive ever come to when I decided there was no god.

6616788,0,t3_46afty,Therapy. Please. You may be exaggerating by saying part of you wants to die or you have actually considered it. Either way when we have those thoughts they are strong indictors of being in crisis.You sound burnt out and could possibly experiencing depression. I went through a lot of shit when I was your age with my family. It took a great toll on me.  I wish I had admitted to myself I couldnt handle it on my own and sought out therapy. Seeking out therapy is more courageous than suffering in isolation even though intuitively we think the opposite is true.You need a neutral party to help you sort things out now that the crisis has eased. As for your parents if you let go of your need to get an apology then you empower yourself. Now that you are coming into your own as an adult you are starting to see that your parents dont have the skills they need to tackle all that life throws at them. They have been coping and hoping no one notices. Now you are mature enough to see them for what they are they are human beings and flawed like everyone else. They are trying to reestablish order by slipping back into familiar patterns. You cant change your parents you can only change how you react to them. You need to be in control of your boundaries. I spent years being angry with my parents until I let the anger go and dealt with my depression. It took a huge toulon other areas of my life and I wish I had sought out help sooner.,infp,d03qdly,2,t5_2qn2o

6796427,0,t3_48u8y6,I realized that I was not as ultralogical andor theorydriven as the typical INTP. I think the values part of Fi also resonated with me. I think the reason for my believing they were logical values was because I created real rational arguments in defense of them. Of course logic is seen in many arguments but that does not define what I believe it means to be INTPINFP.I also thought I was rather emotionless but I now contribute that to a deep unhappiness. I am definitely an emotional person to an extent but I dont let my emotions guide me like the stereotypical wispy description of INFPs. Well no more than a normal person anyway. I think such ideas as ambitionoveetc. can generally be tied to emotion in any person. So I will say that I definitely prescribe to being an idealist.,infp,d0mnzdi,11,t5_2qn2o

7121524,0,t3_4cznnp,I wanted to be popular when I was in middle schoolhigh school but I think that was just wanting to fit in.  I knew I was different from my peers and I constantly worried that something was wrong with me because I never had weekend social plans or a consistent friend group to sit with it lunch.  Instead I floated around between activities and social groups.  Known to everyone but friends with no one.  I was a true lone wolf.My school was also a little weird in that  of the popular kids were also in theaterbandarthonors and AP classes.  Of those  all of them have advanced degrees or a technical bachelors like nursing so none of them were the stereotypical dumb jockcheerleaders.  I think if they were the popular stereotype I wouldnt have wanted it as badly.  Knowing there was a group that was popular in the top  of the class and going places in life really really made me feel inadequate.  Its weird I often find myself craving a particular thing like popularity or becoming an actress.  But really its never about the thing I want and more a subconscious recognition of what I need to work on in this case being more socialless anxious around people.

Never feel bad when you get no reaction as they might be in a whole other setting.A smiley once in a while is generally regarded normalnice as reaction especially if your text could be misinterpreted without visual signals.Of course it depends on the agepersonality of the person and your relation with them. I often keep smileys as basic as possible when texting people who are more stiff and older than me also tend to use  only as they might feel an overuse is childish or unprofessional.

7284989,0,t1_d2675l8,Well at least it took you one hour to come up with that response to my weak comment. And you are implying that youre no longer denying that you are stereotyping. Or do you still stand by your first response I am not stereotyping. I am trying to understand...?All INFPs are introverts  yes I think you could call that a stereotype. In fact all MBTI types are stereotypes because thats what models inherently are  stereotypes. And I hope we all agree that none of these models can fully describe a person or accurately predict their behaviour. No theory can do that. They are not able to because they focus on some factors and leave others out and thats what a stereotype is a generalization that is by default incomplete. So in your original post you are coming up with your own stereotypes for instance this one Your thinking is last which makes you more difficult to talk to especially when claiming yourselves to be intelligent you dont even analyze. Yet this is based on your perception which you now describe as clouded up by subjective emotion. So we could reasonably deduct that those are stereotypes that come from your subjective point of view which is also influenced by emotion.So this theory of yours is supposed to be reasonable i.e. as you imply not influenced by emotion and allows you to deduct that a group of people identified as INFPs are just more likely to become assholes. Still you are denying that your perspective is just as subjective as anyone elses. Another difference between stating that all INFPs are introverts and claims like You guys are just more likely to become assholes is that introvert is in the MBTI model a neutral term to describe certain traits while asshole is generally a swearword used to insult somebody. So are you still claiming that you used pure logic in this and that the majority of INFPs arent able to ever do that? ,infp,d26965m,5,t5_2qn2o

My health coach told me the other day  You can only own your own feelings.  Dont try to take responsibility for everyone elses.  She said that to me because I work with the public and I tend to try to put myself in the other persons shoes to figure out what they might be upset about frustrated by worried about etc.  Well thats expecting negative emotion from them and it invokes a fear response in me and thats kinda a bad circle jerk.  And its maybe not even true but only created in my own imagination.    Actually after practicing her suggestion Ive just found out its probably not even true... Id been stressing for years and only just now found out that the people I see are often happy satisfied relieved at a smooth transaction etc.  Wow!!She said I really need to Smile as I great each person you can smile as you post each comment! and expect that the transaction will go well.  Expect the best.    She also said that Ive been thinking in a negative way for a long time and its like water washing down a mountain gully in its wellworn path.  She says my job is to reroute my thinking... to try to make new positive channels for my thought process to run down to block up the old waterways of thought so they can become overgrown and grassy.  So that when Im thinking Im expecting the best Im positive Im empowered and Im planning on a good outcome.  Its a challenge to try to think in this new way.  The old way was like a security blanket to prepare for the worst.  But then I was always unhappy because I kinda expected the worst.  So I think its better to sometimes run into something bad you didnt expect than to plan for bad things to happen.  Better to plan for great things to happen and to look forward to them and make a happy circlejerk in life!,infp,d2natmq,3,t5_2qn2o

Society tries to associate these concepts with liberation freedom and openness i.e. religion should be accepting family should be an escape or someone you can go to marriage is when you find someone to live happily ever after with. But as we know by now they dont practice what they preach. All of those concepts actually can make you less open and put you in a trap.Now you have to realize that for some people they do find a good partner and they do have the marriage that is promised. Or they do get a family they get along with and have the connection that is promised. However this is a matter of chance and some luck. In your case and anyone else you cannot choose which family you are born into. You cannot and in fact you should not change who they are or who you are this doesnt mean dont be civil or dont try to get along with them. It means stop forcing peopleincluding yourself to be something they are not. So lets say you are born into a family that is aligned with things x y and z in life. But you are aligned naturally with a b and c. You will only suffer when you try to line yourself up with your family. You would suffer less and be closer to other peoplefriends that are also types a b and c. I do think its wrong to shit on your family and act like they are all bad guys which Im not accusing you of. They are just different. But more importantly I dont think there is anything wrong with aligning yourself with what is right with you. And you know this family is not right for you. So just accept that you werent lucky enough to get the closeknit family that society promises and be at peace with it. Then go find the things in life that do align with you. Lifes too short to waste your time lingering where you dont belong. ,infp,d3923nb,1,t5_2qn2o

7654559,0,t1_d3bw6nd,Also I think it is totally cool that you are dedicated to the technique and psychology of acting. I started taking classes again after quitting in high school as a hobby. My teacher did the Stanislavsky method which as a PhD student in literature I loved. Some of the greatest actors of our time studied acting for the same reasons you did. Cate Blanchett limits the films she agrees to do because she sees herself first and foremost as a stage actor and wants to do interesting and artistic things through her theater company. Its about more than the spotlight As you know and it seems like you have a really cool mindset that is more rare these days. Definitely talk to your professors. Is there an advisor in your department youcan trust? A teacher who has a similar philosophy to you and who may be a good advocate for your needs? Just remember self care is the best gift to give yourself and if you need to take some leave to deal with mental health that is a commendable choice.

You say that one of the biggest troubles you have found with ESFJs is that they cant fully engageappreciate your depth because they are Sensors.However isnt depth usually referring to that which is beneath the surface? If so then an INFPs depth is not in their Intuition as we are Extroverted intuitives and not even dominant ones at that but in their Feelings due to Introverted feeling Dom. We dont have particularly deep ideas as introverted intuitives might. We just simply have a lot of various ideas that are loosely connected. If you want someone to appreciate your depth wouldnt you want someone that would be able to appreciate and draw out the innerfelt and deep convictions?

For instance if Beyonce had never worked as hard as she did maybe she never would have discovered her talent.  Or maybe she discovered it but instead ends up as a journalist so she never develops her talent.  My point is  inclinations make it easier to pick up skills but you still have to put in the work.

7884318,0,t3_4n9krp,I see it as a historical tug and pull between competing economic ideologies. There are many in the government today including both Democrats and Republicans who subscribe to neoliberal economic policies. Their ostensible argument is that privatizing everything in society leads to better consequences for the majority of the population. The pervasiveness of their ideology though is not really due to the actual merits of their policies over the past  years neoliberal policies have actually been shown to not produce positive results for the majority only for the superwealthy minority. Rather the reason why neoliberalism is gaining ground is because most of the politicians promoting this ideology are personally receiving financial benefits from the corporations and multinationals that want to privatize every aspect of our society. The counter to this is the social market economic ideology promoted by a minority of fringe politicians they are considered fringe in American politics but pretty mainstream in Europe and other westernized governments. Their belief is that the market needs to be regulated to some degree and basic services like education utilities healthcare and elderly care need to be provided collectively by society in order to promote the general welfare of the population. If we do not have at least some restraints and oversight of the market economy it leads to monopolization and tremendous wealthpower concentration in the hands of only a few corporations and individuals. The peak success of this ideology was the New Deal era following the Great Depression. Many people feel we need to return to more of these Keynesian policies because they led to general prosperity for most Americans up until the s when neoliberalism prevailed and there was a much more equitable distribution of wealth and correspondingly power in American society.Even if you disagree on the best economic policy to pursue any rational person would have to admit that a fairer distribution of wealth in a society is much more SUSTAINABLE than a highly disparate distribution of wealth and power which is what is emerging throughout the world right now. Historically there is a reason why people revolt and begin revolutions like the French Revolution or the communist revolutions of the th century. When people become educated and realize that their productivity and labor are being usurped by a small minority who control most of the wealth and power the uproar of the masses ultimately reaches a tipping point. When it arrives at that point the population will upend the entire system because they would rather replace the economic system with something new that MIGHT benefit them versus staying in an old system that they already KNOW will exploit and marginalize them. As the global economy becomes more and more polarized the number of dissatisfied people in the population is only going to grow and grow towards that tipping point. ,infp,d429qi9,8,t5_2qn2o

Girl who looks hot but spent most of the early years getting a great personality and still doesnt know how pretty she is despite you telling her all the time.   I agree that most marriages have these totally unappealing interactions where one partner views life entirely functionally so sees the other as someone to serve their needs or the needs of the household. I would rather burn my eyes out with a hot poker than find myself in such a relationship. I wonder if these guys married a woman who looked hot but didnt actually love them. You need a girl who loves you for you and if you get an idealist its possible shed be more likely to do that. Im not sure but it figures. Im one of the few people who my guy mates say obviously love my husb for who he is and they envy it for themselves. Im INFP.  And I do probably like you just love for the persons sake as opposed to love for other outcomes.  As for limiting the guy following his passions a good woman wont do that but it depends on the passions  some things will effectively mean youre living like a single man because youre away so much and thats not a relationship Id wait around for as a woman. Best to stay single if your hobbies are incompatible with marriageor are uncompromisable to keep your spouse reasonably happy I mean reasonable as inits reasonable the compromise youre making. all marriages go through a disappointment stage as the idealism wears off  I find most stay in this stage as the two partners fail to navigate those deep waters  but as an INFP you are more than adequately equipped to negotiate your way through.  That seems to be the time when you get women who are touchy and grumpy  theyre usually let down or disappointed in their men. Discovered their husb watching porn. Realised hes not the romantic sexual beast she wanted. Realised he cant fulfil her ?unrealistic need for constant attention and is just sitting blankly farting in front of the tv.  The man is usually equally let down by her not being what his dreams entailed also. What happens in a good marriage is that you now see each other without the rosetinteds as you really are with no idealism. And you clash but keep working together and chipping away until what you love is not their idealised image but this living breathing flawed individual in front of you.  I think that feeling is behind John Legends song to his wife All of Me and whilst some would find it unromantic to mention your spouse is flawed I have come to value that real gritty persistent type of love that just sees the obstacles but keeps coming keeps moving towards keeps loving despite all of it.  Its my feeling that you HAVE to be sexually attracted to your life partner.  And there are girls out there with an awesome personality that look amazing too.  Just dont settle for a boring but hot girl like your mates. INFPs could never be content with just aesthetics. I married a hot one but he more importantly is a total nutter like me and we crack up constantly. Best time to crack up is when one is having a tantrum and the other laughs in their face  risky but when it pays off its hilarious. When it doesnt well its not too bad having to sleep on the deck....P,infp,d4xie72,2,t5_2qn2o

8215854,0,t3_4rvs7i,I sure hope you dont wish to speak using internet slang like lol.The only issue I have with talking is not really stuttering but rather I consider too many possible wordings at the same time and sometimes I jumble them up creating some gibberish. I am not a native English speaker but I often do something along the lines of saying Hilo! when I cant make up my mind whether to say hi or hello. Sometimes I cant find a good way to say something at all and then I take a long time to reply.What I would suggest is to exercise speaking slower. Nobody is in such a hurry that they cant wait for a few seconds to hear your reply. You can think about what to say then say it. That is what you do when you write and if you are as confident in your writing as you say then it should eventually carry over to speech. Slowing down while talking is an amazing skill. Your thoughts sound more thoughtout because they are and you give the impression of wisdom and confidence. I know that since the speech issue is due to you being nervous it is not really just a simple thing to stop being nervous and slowly think about your speech but try it out in comfortable situations first talk to your mirror extremely slowly make it a habit.,infp,d54jbx3,8,t5_2qn2o

I made the mistake of opening this during my break in my class and I started to get watery eyed so I had to stare down blankly into my phone for a couple minutes to regain my composure. Funnily my friend aforementioned in the OP actually sits next to me in this class. Weve been friends since nd grade and shes never seen me cry apart from being physically hurt after falling off my bike in the th grade lol. Yeah I just dont understand this behavior of us constructive criticism because I naturally see the best in people. Thats not to say that I dont notice their flaws but focusing on them never even crosses my mind so when people do that to me I just feel so hurt. And if I have a problem with someone I try to let them know in he most polite and constructive way. I guess I need to remember that they have a different way of thinking than I do. Ive come a long way since high school in learning how to be happier. The first and most helpful thing was eliminating my habitual practice of comparing myself to anyone who was remotely comparable to myself. Since Ive learned to stop doing that it really sucks when someone else does it for me I feel like Im taking two steps back theyre pushing me two steps back. I promise that I want to say luv u too but it can be difficult for me to show affection at first. Just know that despite you being a complete stranger you saying luv u dood has actually made all the difference to me.

8285956,0,t3_4sy25c,Being alone when youre older is a beautiful thing in its own right. Take it from someone who is older and alone.Hey Id love a close friend or a soulmate to share my life with but relationships come with their own difficulties as well and likewise being alone comes with its own joys. Maybe Ill luck out and meet someone wonderful before Im old and grey but I wont give up enjoying life as best I can while Im alone. Its a good skill to learn  learning to live deeply when youre alone  laughing alone crying alone.At your age you should probably get out a bit more and make friends. Youll find and make new friends easily if you go to college or a trade school. Or if you join an interest group of likeminded people. To be honest I should get out and socialize more too. Having people in our lives is important. Were social animals. Relationships and support networks are important. You grow equally as much through relationships as from being alone. Both are important. But I think we should be able to thrive no matter our given circumstance... within reason.Every path has its scenery good and bad. None is ultimately better than the other in the end... In the end. The quality of a life is in ones ability to be present for it. Satisfaction comes from selfknowledge and growth and your relationship to yourself as much as anything else. We have to do the best with what we have. Dont worry about what anyone else has. Comparison wont help you live the life youve been dealt.Youre in a difficult phase in your life. That age is difficult for most people. Big life transitions are always scary and difficult. High School can be stressful and depressing for a lot of INFPs for a lot of people in general. College can be too. I dont know what the answer is there. Ive yet to figure it out myself. Im still lost in regard to career or life goals.I do think our idealism can be a big source of depression especially when it comes to relationships. Relationships can never be idealized. Youll never find an ideal relationship an ideal friend or an ideal lover. Youll never find someone who gives you everything you need or who understands you completely through and through. Its depressing if youre idealistic. But if you try you can find the beauty in the imperfect. And its not too hard to get what you need in life. Its just that sometimes a lot of times you have to learn to provide for yourself  be your own friend nurture yourself support yourself emotionally. But people will give you the minimum of what you need if you reach out.I highly recommend a book called The Upward Spiral for learning to manage depression. It can help a little bit at least. You can skip over the scientific jargon and just read the suggestions. You can probably find a summary of the book on the internet somewhere for free. I also highly recommend a book by Alan Watts called The Wisdom Of Insecurity. I first read it when I was around  I think. Im about to reread it again now. Its not quite what youd expect from the title.Dont stress too much. If you manage to find happiness and meaning at some point in your life the past wont matter much because youll merely see it as the path that got you there. Your not alone. No one knows what theyre doing in this life no matter their age. We just get used to the patterns of our confusion a little bit as we age.Its okay to choose the wrong path again and again. Youll learn about yourself each time you have to turn around and ultimately be a better more rounded person for it. If you willingly try to learn that is. Those kinds of mistakes are okay. Most of our lives are really just one mistake after another anyways. In that sense its no big deal.TLDR Being alone is not so bad but friends are important too. Every path has value. Satisfaction in life comes from growth in your relationships both with others and with yourself. Read The Upward Spiral and The Wisdom Of Insecurity.,infp,d5daxd2,3,t5_2qn2o

Now of course youre doing that empathy shtick because you realized that your argument was complete and utter shit.  That was after her first condescending response. If youre trying to make an actual argument out of what I said try again but this time try opening your eyes. Youre completely dismissing her original actions and intent which makes your points irrelevant and nonsensical.  What a joke stop being blind.gtBullshit. So you believe youre owned that just because you post on a public forum. Its entertaining seeing you pull things out of your ears explain to me how I was owned.  Is being rude to someone asking advice  owning them? Then thats hardly something to be proud of. Honestly your defense is weak you know shes in the wrong public forum or not.

I have wrestled with similar anxieties my whole life Ive manged to get to a point where those anxieties dont seem to be a ruling force any longer partly because I am less focused on my perception of how others view me and tend not to let it cloud my life. I try to be the best person I can be and make who that is better all the time how I choose to conduct myself and how I choose to relate to the world around me are things I ultimately have some amount of control over Ill never be able to make anyone like me or think or feel a certain way and I wouldnt want that power even if I could all I can do is try to be a person that the right people will appreciate and love as much as I appreciate and love them.,infp,d6lyl9h,5,t5_2qn2o

Its interesting that you point out the scarf as a negative aspect because I actually really like it. Personally its important to step away from my work and come at it with fresh eyes amp mind at a different time because I tend to get wrapped up in my own selfcriticisms. What I enjoy most out of seeing all your guys artwork is how you create the pieces through your own perceptions...not always mirroring exactly what the naked eye sees. Of course drawing or painting something exactly as it appears to everyone else in nature requires extreme admirable talent but when I see some skew of imagination in there Im loving it even more. You have your own style I dig this as it is. Id like to see more as you become more comfortable with your skills. But thats just my two cents whatever its worth ,infp,d6ng4au,3,t5_2qn2o

8684664,0,t3_4yxjgo,Okay so far its pretty clear that youre a lot more invested in the relationship than him.  This can already cause problems since both of you want pretty different things.  While I am not going to rule out the possibility that he sees you as a potential partner Im leaning towards the idea that he doesnt really see you that way.  If I were you Id consider either letting yourself get over him or be honest and tell him how you feel.  To keep up the relationship in its current state is already taking its toll on you and to stay that level of emotionally involved in it may cause some hurt.   ,infp,d6r7j8z,2,t5_2qn2o

8688180,0,t1_d6rm93z,I agree with u. But there is always gonna be some kind of guy that wants more than the other guy. Government is a parody of itself but its also a required parody in a way. Most government started because some crazy psychopath found a way to get people together to rape and pillage. But at this point in time almost all governments are filled with culturally adapted versions of those same power hungry psychopaths. The best manipulators are always going to rise to the top. I wasnt trying to break it down between capitalism vs communism. I was in fact trying to stress that I was NOT trying to do that. What Im saying is at the current point in time capitalism is the best mechanism. Because it would require every other government to hop on board with the one government that wants to do what you suggested for world peace to occur. I believe we have the tech knowledge and power to make happen what you mentioned. But even if our government wasnt full of assholes wed still get no where because somewhere else thered be an asshole whod take advantage of say us having no military in order help the public. If war ended I think everyone could live comfortably. But I just dont think that will ever happen because theres always someone who wants to live more than comfortably. The way this ties in was in my half assed defense of capitalism. Capitalism is currently the best not because it itself works but any more beneficial thing for example true socialism where everyone is a healthy equal cant work because others would still find a way to take advantage. Whether thats within the system or externally. If everyone threw down their weapons accepted we could all be equal and comfortable and started focusing on beneficial technology wed be better off. But that wont ever happen. Because there will always be one person that wants more than someone else and the cost of a defense against that sort of personpeople becomes a parody of itself. ,infp,d6rnep6,1,t5_2qn2o

8744805,0,t1_d6yndoa,Thank you for your detailed answer that is very helpful. I have much to think about. Im considering evening courses which will lead to some kind of bachelor in that field BA over  months but it starts in  weeks so Im trying to make up my mind Ill have to wait another year if i dont go for it now but its quite a financial investment if I do.. The pressure is not helping me but the experience you shared gives me food for thought. I definitely dont like writing or producing documents. Making art out of my reports and spreadsheets will not satisfy me. The analysis part although I can be good at it usually gets boring quickly for me as I like to see the results or be more hands on. Now I like the collaboration with varied people having a bigger picture of a project and knowing what it involves in terms of costs and risks etc.. I like the fact that its a new field for me compared to the strictly technical part of IT. Im really not sure this would be my thing but dont see many other options available.Thanks for taking the time to write all of this after days of searching I havent found anything relevant or honest about this field so this really helps in my decision making process.,infp,d6yr5j9,1,t5_2qn2o

8758659,0,t1_d70gvhx,This explains what actually happened. Essentially Eduardo wasnt doing a good job as CFO so Mark used dirty tricks to get around him. Mark created a new Facebook company to acquire the original company and made himself the sole director Eduardo signed the contract to authorize this ostensibly because it allowed the project to expand but by doing so he was able to reallocate the companys shares. So he then diluted Eduardos shares dramatically so that he was effectively no longer part of the company.In real life though Eduardo had also been doing dirty business things He ran unauthorized ads on Facebook. Worse the ads were for a startup Saverin was running entirely on his own a job boards site called Joboozle.Also before any of this went down Mark with Eduardos approval fucked over two other Harvard students the Winklevoss twins by telling them he would design a website for them The Harvard Connection and then proceeding to create the same website for himself under a different name. Heres an IM Mark sent at the time I feel like the right thing to do is finish the facebook and wait until the last day before Im supposed to have their thing ready and then be like look yours isnt as good.,infp,d70hpya,12,t5_2qn2o

8801337,0,t3_50nvov,You are powerful and important !  And can choose to listen carefully to people including body language and try and say the simple words that will provide them love.  Its as simple as laughing when they make a joke even if its not that funny it doesnt matter!  Them feeling at ease will help make you feel like your existence is providing value to them which is what you want because if you put love and care into your words and actions it will provide value to other people.What Ive been learning lately is separating other peoples enjoyment of our conversation from my own.  The more vulnerable you can be the more you can say your honest feelings and what you want to another person the more youll feel like you are being heard and accepted.  Family members are just arbitrary other people.  You will become very close with some not care about others and some are downright toxic.  My own mother can be highly toxic to my emotional wellbeing if Im not careful.  But not everybody will come close to understanding what I really care about and I can usually tell within the first few minutes of speaking to someone if they will.  With family members I dont care about I still feel love for them like I feel love for all humans and animals and plants my goal is to make them feel validated and loved as quickly as possible and take what pleasure I can in the conversation and be open to enjoying it and their presence.  So anyways I just spent a bunch of time typing all this out and another long post because I think its fascinating and you seem like a nice person.  So I hope you read this and I hope it helps and I hope it helps give you some clarity about how much the right words at the right time can provide to people.  ,infp,d75suku,7,t5_2qn2o

8996743,0,t3_53gw0u,Im in a long term relationship with a man who is somewhat on the both the aromantic and asexual spectrum.  years total. He wouldnt use those terms though. He always says Im not heterosexual. Im vegetablesareawesomesexual. Hes  and Im the only person hes been even remotely romantically attracted to.My  honest advice is not to get too involved especially if youre expecting the relationship to eventually fulfill all your romantic desires.I love him more than anything. He has a lot of amazing qualities and I want him in my life. But I am not fulfilled and were struggling with it a lot. We havent had sex in three weeks and yesterday when I asked him about it he said Oh has it been that long? I had been thinking about it every day since the last time we had sex and it hadnt even crossed his mind.That level of consistent sexual rejection alone would be pretty crushing to most infps but its more than that. I dont feel wanted. He feels like as the main financial provider of our partnership hes doing all he can to make me feel special and loved but I know I need more.One of the main conflicts of our relationship right now is that I love going out to the bar alone. It feels so cold going home to someone who cant even make eye contact with me when hes tired.Me Hey babe. How was your day?SO  consumed in a video game  Alright.Me ...Okay. Can I snuggle you while you play your game?SO No. I dont feel like it right now.Me Okay. Guess Ill just go fuck myself... Love you.SO K. Love you too.Then I stumble in drunk at am and accidentally wake him up. Hes mad at me and wants to know why I always do this. It sounds superficial but it just feels so good to bathe in the adoration of acquaintances and strangers. Sometimes I feel like I can be more emotionally vulnerable with them than I can with the love of my life.Youre so sexy. Hes never once said this to me and yet I seem to hear it every time I go out.Youre so intelligent. Why do you hang out at a place like this?If you really had a boyfriend hed be out here showing you off.Sorry for the megarant. Im currently trying to sort out my relationship in the context of his aromanticism and my codependency. He says he doesnt want to give up but I dont see how either of us could try any harder.So as an infp I know youre an idealist.

9174155,0,t3_55y3ip,I passed for the first time but... it wasnt easy at all. I was soo fucking nervous my engine went off for like  times before I managed to go a straight line. The guy wasnt very helpful and only did some snarky remarks and sighed loudly whenever I did something slightly wrong even yelled at me when I failed to turn left on a big intersection and went forward instead. But... I didnt do anything significantly wrong or dangerous sooo even though I was sweating like hell and my hands were shaking I managed to pass with my first try! Ive already did over k kilometers after my exam and I consider myself a pretty good driver it turns out that driving without a passenger screaming at you can even be fun!. So the moral of the story is  even if you are nervous it is still possible to just do it. I considered taking some pills before the exam to calm tf down but I like challenges and doing this naturally gave me a huge confidence boost. Nowadays I drive a big bus Peugeot Boxer .d everyday and I know that after I managed to pass an exam with a screaming cunt sitting next to me then immediately switched to driving a big ass car in traffic  I can handle myself and my car in most of the usual road situations with ease Best of luck to you! ,infp,d8ew443,2,t5_2qn2o

Not every job is casual work environment with service oriented production though that is becoming more common in U.S. Some companies just want code monkeys to hammer out code in the most productive manner possibly to churn out productor just feature after product. Quantity more important than Quality in this case as long as it doesnt cause criticallevel bugs. I know I would die in this setting.. One side of CS  the side we enjoy  is an art the other side is a science. Science as in analytical tedious INTPtype stuff where every little knob needs to be known and evaluated in order to tweak some settings and get a tiny performance gain from the system.That being said I recall reading that programming along with some other analytical jobs can still be good fits for us especially if we can keep our minds on the creative aspect of the work and not get bogged down too much by tedium,infp,d8fsyvd,4,t5_2qn2o

I feel comfortable with some aspects but not my own profession I am just hoping for that miracle moment when everything just clicks because that is how I learn. I think being left to my own devices no guidance not clear deadlines especially lately has pushed me into a zone where I dont actively engage in things.

This organisation I ended up in does do excursions outside the country sometimes so it pretty much is the thing I wanted to do as a kid.As a kid I always wanted to be a paleontologist because Ive seen Jurasic Park but the studies where to hard for me to handle and my past quite messed me up aswell. Besides if I really wanted to go study for it I would probably ended up teaching a class or so and thats not really the thing I want to do. If you want to go for it just do it. Im currently  years old now so its possible. Yes I do get emotional sometimes when Im analyzing those fossils and I would probably get emotional aswell when Im finally will be going on my first excursion.

9322579,0,t3_583j23,interesting... I always thought that was a very unINFP thing. Im very much the opposite almost toooo much of an independent thinker if that makes sense.The only advice I can give you is to trust your own opinions and yourself. All of your thoughts are valid.That being said if other people bring up really good points it doesnt make you gullible to change your opinion. It makes you smart! Just as long as you take the information given to you and come to your own conclusions.Regarding the apartment situation Ive learned to never make decisions right away. Once proposed with an idea I need time to mull it over and do research. If theres ever a case where theyre pushing you to act now then just say no. An honest salesman would never push you to make a hurried decision.Hope that helps!,infp,d8xpei1,5,t5_2qn2o

People who try to follow their dreams at any cost probably will end up depressed and miserable when they realise you ACTUALY are judged by your surface and top artists are a very few Most of our Idols just play a mask. We like their quotes their insights about life and their art. But after all they are just rich people with some talent and very much coincidental luck. In  years nobody will hype about things we are hyped about now. Not even reddit. Altough some people may still remember reddit and current era in  years from now. Most art is shit. I see many people who create scenes dress up like thieir Idols and behave like them. And in the end most art is just about creating a marketing niche to sell products for.

My alonetime is entirely independent. I usually end up taking a bubble bath and drink tea while I read a book. I also will play video games or tidy my space. If I go out of the house it will be because I want to hike. I save all errands and chores for after I get off work and when Im in for the night Im in. If I go and visit a friend it must be because I really like them and understand that Im needed for something.

Im an ENTJ dont you think I would have a lot more criteria than that? LOLBut to answer the why INFP question.... Ive heard were ideal matches seems weird considering our stereotypes but then again I have that inner INFP idealist and yall supposed to have that inner ENTJ as well. Its said that we want the same thing but we approach it differently so theoretically i see decent common ground.   For me personally Ive known a great number of INFPs. Sure many of you can be a multitude of negative adjectives that youre probably all aware of from flighty to illogical but for the most part once the introversion doesnt kick in yall are chill people only  INFPs I know are NOT chill Yall actually often kinda smart provide insights that I mightnt have been aware of a different perspectiveway of looking at things.... If not at least when Im talking to yall yall have an opinion on things which makes yall better than SO many other people for me conversation wise   Considering That theoretically and anecdotally were decent matches once not immature I have to consider the option that if a soul mate exists then that soul mate is very likely an INFP so I came to consult the INFP hive for tactics to use to secure one   gt Weird and creepy   Weird and creepy gt Plain and boring unless plain and boring is more efficient but thats another story mate,infp,da13x50,1,t5_2qn2o

There are no perfect people in this world and I think thats what makes people so beautiful. There is no need to strive for some idealized perfection but rather embrace who you are understand yourself and find a path that makes you happy. Get the image of who you should be out of your head and simply enjoy who you are. Of course you can work to improve yourself but sometimes our greatest flaws arent really flaws at all.

The Ace Attorney series if you dont mind visual novelesque puzzlers is phenomenally written. Ghost Trick is a game by the creator of Ace Attorney and is also a ton of fun. Its also not a series so its one and done if youre into that!The DS Fire Emblems are a ton of fun. I have to agree with uMollaby though Birthright is written horribly. Conquest was much more fun for me and Awakening has a place in my heart forever as one of my favorite adventures.Metal Gear has some of the most amazing character development I have ever seen in fiction. Its complicated its a long series and its spectacular. I did not think I would enjoy the stealth aspect at all but its so much fun.

I think I recognised a pattern When a partner remains at a distance at which I can still fantasise about him it works when he wants to get into my head understand my motivation wants to make sure I get him right etc it doesnt. I observed that once I start down the road to explain myself I feel unwell if they dont get the hole picture once I know too much about them there is a chance there are not enough gaps left to fill up with my own fantasised version of them or the arrangement stops working because I realise I dont like them.

So this other man it sounds horrible.... but we met at church after he gave a speech and I just wanted to say thank you to him because I felt the need I felt just like him as he was talking. So after that he Sledge for my email and let me know if I ever wanted to talk that we should. And it took off from there. I wasnt looking for anything it all just happened. And the more we talked the deeper the connection. He said he had gotten married but that the second he did he felt this heavy weight of not  marrying the one. So he has gone through  years of feeling depressed and that he made a mistake. So as you may guess he saw me and instantly recognized me and was head over heels willing to give up everything for me. I pushed him away at first though. I knew he was married so I set boundaries and tried to convince him that everyone feels this way about their lives that its just human nature to always feel lonely. So yes I guess it mustve been an emotional affair. My husband is very different and incapable of showing feelings or love. He is ISTP and I didnt know about these personality test til this week so that would explain a lot.

Donald Trump never boasted about grabbing anyone by the dick.The office of the presidency hasnt been occupied by forty five consecutive women and what would your opinion be if it had been?.Theres an important caveat to most of the points you brought up when men by and large occupy a dominant position in society when society puts women in a box when we limit their potential to really live and work does it seem so weird that they dont get injured or die as much in the workplace? Do you expect homemaking to have a particularly high mortality rate? I speak as a feminist and as someone who knows a lot of them the idea of having more women as steel workers as truck drivers as sargeants and colonels as farmworkers it sounds great Im inspired by that idea. If thats not feminism I dont know what is. I suspect it might make some of the typical MRA talking points disappear however.Ill wrap up this thought by saying this There are lots of very legitimate disparities between men and women that favor women. There are social norms enforcing the idea that men need to be masculine and women need to be feminine and in some contexts the behaviors and lifestyles that society sees as masculine are far more perilous than the feminine ones. Feminism is ultimately the fight against these social norms as a whole. I would actually argue youll never see the disparities you brought up go away without it. Maybe its a fight you should join.gtAnd not to be that guy but do you know what demograpgic kills the most black people? It isnt police its other black people. You were just talking about men being murdered more no? Given theyre by and large being killed by other men this isnt really a selfconsistent view with the other conversation.Ive never really been impressed with the view itself either. If blacks largely live around other blacks is it really surprising that blacks tend to kill other blacks just statistically speaking?In any case BLM isnt really a generalist Save every black person from any crime ever movement. Its a reaction to oppression and violence perpetuated by police in a world where racial profiling never stopped being a thing not even a little bit. I suspect you might feel differently about the movement if you were being pulled over or searched on the basis of your skin color on a regular basis but Ill let you speak for yourself.,infp,dcr7uke,9,t5_2qn2o

10649352,0,t3_5sef5m,INFP man here.   I  NF  P so Im not quite an extreme though Ive tested with these percentiles very consistently.  Its difficult to say something on the matter outside of hes an anxious mess and were bad at planning stuffsticking to schedules.  If I were in his position given the displayed behavior Id probably act like this due to past experience.For one INFPs tend to not keep schedules very well.  Im constantly forgetting thingsdates and need to set alarms on my phone a lot of the time since I get caught up in whatever Im doing at the moment.  The anxious rush when I realize I miss a deadline or appointment is what hes experiencing when he shows up late.  He desperately wants to be the guy who you can depend on but the dissonance comes when his personality clashes with his desires.  Since INFPs are forgetful in these matters they can appear aloof and uncaring.  Theres also the social stigma that states that men shouldnt text a girl they like every single day.  The belief is that a woman is looking for a man who goes his own way pursues his own dreams and seems mysteriouselusive.  Obviously this is a flagrant generalization and hardly indicative of the reality of many people.  If this is something really bothering you sit him down and talk to him gently.  Tell him that you want to see some initiative on his part.  A good tip is to keep a good swathe of free time on hand.  If he wants to coordinate a date or go somewhere for a date be prepared to not do it at X time on Y day precisely.  A date from him will more likely be an outing.  If you make yourself flexible and dont hold him to a time hell become more relaxed and probably respond much faster.   ,infp,ddeecvu,2,t5_2qn2o

Often times Ill give my thoughts and give a reason as to why whatever conclusion Ive come to works for me.  Then Ill basically describe their side of it and how I see it.  Basically empathizing with their side of the argument and saying I definitely see how someone could come to that conclusion.This in my opinion is the right thing to do.  For whatever reason though thats when the other person thinks oh so they do kinda understand my side of it. and they push ten times harder to get me to fully agree with them.This is the part of the conversation where I get mad and tell them Im done discussing it.  Sometimes they keep going anyway though because theyre morons and the burden is placed on me to let them know how ignorant they are which in their opinion could NEVER be the case.That turned into a vent lololIn review dont become overemotional when discussing things that hardly matter and respect peoples boundaries.,infp,ddi4xm5,1,t5_2qn2o

It may hurt sometimes but when people say its easy to open up to me I feel really happy to have provided that for them.I think in more recent years my dad has begun to understand my sensitivity isnt just a hormonal thing and he says he worries itll hurt me but hes proud that I am able to think of others in that way.Like you said control is important and Im still getting a handle on that.

10716628,0,t3_5t7i0g,I noticed a lot of your points on both the negatives and positives are focused around your work environment.Im not surprised that you dont consider your engineering process to be an art but some do  helping people by making something possible in a device or whatever. Even math gets used in more practical ways which eventually helps people  but for me as well that attention to detail and monotony can be so draining that it just doesnt matter whether I feel important by creating the product or not.The only things you mention in a positive way is music and traveling yet you shut down music as a choice because it is a competitive environment.I dont know much about EE and the jobs available but maybe there is a company which needs an EE to travel around and inspect things? The bad thing about this is that youd probably have to meet people wherever you go and report on things when you get back.More MBTIfocused you seem to hate all those things which either require more Te external Thinking which is usually an INFPs weakest function though it can still be goodimproved or being unable to express yourself in your environment.

Did I mention the excess of lavender farms and people who homestead in residential neighborhoods? Friends of ours moved to Vancouver Washington and lived in a house with people that had a big garden and a ton of chickens. In the city. The weather is almost always cool and on glorious clear days there is warmth to be found and an extra dose of beauty and fitting of cozying up by a fire and reading a book. The culture is really open and creative I guess because of the hippie influence. Its really an anything goes attitude.

I had depression and I never told anyone not even my family but the company that i was around like my friends and family made me forget about all of that but afterwards i used to get depressed again. To deal with your depression is to find out the reason of your depression.Once you found out try to think against that thought something positive if your depressed for no reason still think positive or at least try your best. Then just forget about it. If the depression comes again then think positive and forget about it. Second be in good company like friends and family that dont downgrade you or make you feel like trash. And dont hang with drugies cus theyre depressed people anyway.Play games read books or watch movies to deal with it. Even do activities like sports or martial arts or something you love doing because i would keep you distracted from negative emotions.I WATCH OUT from the music im listening to or the movie im watching  or the book i would read because they can have a big influence on your feelings.

I dont think its anything to do with personality type because Ive seen all kinds of people do it including maybe especially people who have basically no awareness of their own emotions. Its just something people do when theyre insecure about something or dont like themselves.You didnt ask for advice but if you want some dont tell people what they thinkhow they feel about you and try not to get too involved withattached to your thoughts about what people thinkfeel about you. Meditation can help with this but the general idea is when you have a thought like this e.g. friend A doesnt like me you recognize that its just a thought and that thinking something doesnt mean its true and you let it go.,infp,dek77ac,8,t5_2qn2o

I learned we werent a good match and I learned what my standards are what I highly value and need in a relationship as well as learning to be realistic about love. The ideal love doesnt exist youll die looking for it. A good love is one that makes you happy for the most part and challenges you to grow as a person on the other part.

11727668,0,t3_670lss,Wonderful quote. It speaks to some of the many motivations for writing. Here he stresses a cluster of serious concerns writing as a mission to help others and reading as an attempt to find some form of salvation or consolation as well as a compulsion to express something like the prophet who could not turn away from delivering his burning message. And he conveys the notion too of high standardswrite your best wisdom from the deepest parts of yourself. At some moments it might help to remember that there are other models for writing too other motivations other standards...some more playful and not as deadly serious. I do believe that many INFPs have a native intensity about their forms of expression a sense of mission and an attempt at creating or conveying meaning or intense intimacy. And I also believe that these same INFPs can sometimes feel so weighed down by the seriousness of what theyre attempting that its good to balance themselves by remembering some of the lighter perspectives on writing and selfexpression.Again though great quoteand thanks for sharing it!Also I think its cool that youve gone retro and use a typewriter.,infp,dgpd140,1,t5_2qn2o
11734650,0,t3_677kuk,Yes I have pretty often that I say to myself I wont smoke weed today. But then end up doing it anyways. But my and a friend of mine are taking a one month break together because we want to lower our resistance and because we where almost using it more as a way of changing reality in a form of eacapism. Now we both still have around  days to go But I am feeling confident!,infp,dgq5hui,1,t5_2qn2o

11759739,0,t1_dgszmm2,I believe were thinking along the same lines. Keeping those thoughts busy helps me avoid the large truth of it all sometimes.For an INFP Im use to people probably assuming Im ruled over by my emotions. So I dont think many would understand when I try to explain this way of thinking.,infp,dgszvh3,1,t5_2qn2o

Being that military occupation was its downfall I dont see how you can claim its system failed it.If youre not gonna read what I say or anything about the subject were talking about it what am I doing here.,infp,dgx9i48,1,t5_2qn2o
11806057,0,t1_dgy8t87,i agree that it depends heavily on the context but in general if you just walk up smile and give them a compliment about the way they look i guarantee that you will get a boyfriend. being nervous is a choice ,infp,dgy99vt,0,t5_2qn2o
