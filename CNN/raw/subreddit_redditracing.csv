523182,0,t1_cfzl32q,Yea I see what you mean but its mostly for fun its not a competitive event.  The Mazda also is probably what the majority chose too. ,redditracing,cfzqp21,0,t5_2ui37
683381,0,t1_cghxjij,Wait this is an actual thing? And it wasnt really a practice. Just got lobby settings in order and managed to confirm that the Viper and  are indeed identical twins. Though Im sure Term begs to differ.,redditracing,cghy9k9,1,t5_2ui37

1046092,0,t1_chn6pc0,The Viper actually doesnt. Ivery tested them out and it makes the braking points more uniform but probably detracts the s advantage. Ill allow mm front tires on those that had race brakes. ,redditracing,chn71pt,1,t5_2ui37
1195705,0,t1_ci43ia4,haha it takes a lot of practice and patience thats for sure. I probably spend about  hours on painting alone in FM but most of that was creating decals that I wanted that people butchered on the SF. ,redditracing,ci44vny,1,t5_2ui37

7662270,0,t1_d3d5gd4,I was all for it until we did it with the NASCARs. It doesnt always grid the field next to each other and since you race a  gear it will destroy your car.Maybe once they optimize it more.,redditracing,d3d5n8l,1,t5_2ui37

10637182,0,t1_ddd50a2,The correct McLaren is only a tad faster than the Z so slow as hell. I dont really understand the BOP since it handles exactly the same as the Vette while having about  MPH less at the end of the straight and only slightly better brakes. ,redditracing,ddd56ps,1,t5_2ui37
