2297760,0,t3_2lkwep,This is my EDC.  I like this knife so much I just bought another ... just in case I ever lose mine er something.  For some reason Amazon gave me  off but added  tax.  At checkout it just said  off  so I wonder if thats a thing for today er something?Anyhow Ive sharpened the blade a few times ... it sharpens as easily as HC IMO.  I havent done any sorta scientific study to show that it retains its edge any longer.  I think it does.  Im very happy with it anyhow.  I use it for everything ... and when ya do the blade will dull no matter what its made of.Its a very thinlight knife to carry.  It opens smoothly and quickly but only when I want it to.  I particularly like the texturing on the scales very much like skateboard tape without the mess.Another excellent feature of this knife is the reversible clip.  I prefer tipup carry and switching the clip around was quick and simple. in blade so IIRC if ya get hung up downtown youre ok there? IIRC in is the limit?.  That said I dont know whether assistedopen is ok downtown?  Even if it was it might vary by officer.I also like the ZT  ... particularly for the price.  But for EDC its quite a bit heavier and nearly twice the price regardless.  But if I was to upgrade from the SV Blur I know of nothing comparable between it and the ZT.,MnGuns,clvpvuf,1,t5_2wxh7

But I agree on the idea that frequently small towns have excellent schools especially in those pockets where the small town is reasonably well off compared to some the rural ghettos in other parts of the state.,MnGuns,crccw9a,2,t5_2wxh7
