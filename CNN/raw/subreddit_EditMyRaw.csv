6995339,0,t1_d1994uz,Right now I am using DXO Optics Pro . Its sharpening and noise reduction are greatly superior to those offered by Camera Raw as are the controls for exposure and contrast. ,EditMyRaw,d199jhh,2,t5_3cja1

7681645,0,t1_d3f9ixc,Good job!Sharpening looks great.  Still loving the colors in the sky.  Contrast looks great as well.  Nice crisp colorful photo.Did you update your original post with the new image as well?  I was trying to compare them but I couldnt tell a difference between the two!,EditMyRaw,d3fcub0,2,t5_3cja1

8441739,0,t1_d5wpnh9,Im in awe right now.  Up to this point I have been using the original image as a smart object and running silver amp color efex filters so that I could have more control if I wanted to change things.  Thats heavy processing time on my  year old walmart laptop.  So to see this process that would be more lightweight with the added ability to see what general color changes are going to result from the bampw blend it is just mind blowing right now.Thank you.,EditMyRaw,d5wr8id,2,t5_3cja1
8530113,0,t3_4weuhi,I agree with uBittlegeuss that gradients help with this sort of time. Heres my go,EditMyRaw,d67tti9,3,t5_3cja1
8538106,0,t3_4wm2dy,Congrats on a really nice camera! You should have lots of fun with it over the years. For the first image in terms of numbering I really like the composition. It always looks nice to have the subject at a third and facing in the general direction of the empty space. For me the biggest challenge is getting the skin tone right especially when adding a filmy tint to the overall image. Here is my try at the first one The second image has even more of a landscape component to it even though a person is again the subject. Im always torn with this kind of image when its this zoomed out. Sometimes it works better to have the person be a silhouette and other times I like more detail. I went with the second approach here since strong contrast didnt seem to be the order of the day with the bigger picture. In terms of framing or cropping Im not sure what I would do here so I just didnt do anything. Im more drawn to the right side of the picture but the gaze  log  etc are all pointing left and there is also the sun to complicate things. Its very much a personal taste call. Here is my take on the second one ,EditMyRaw,d68tw90,1,t5_3cja1

9278171,0,t1_d8s1k15,Actually Im pretty sure it was the filter that I didnt have time to completely wipe down since some of the whole series was taken during the rain while also holding an umbrella.  That said  I cant remember if it was on or off at this point either...thinking off based on the clouds having detail and not being as soft.  I appreciate the recognition though since I certainly have spent too much time with water spots and censor spots along the year.  Also  I like the edit.  There so much color potential in the sky that itd been difficult to figure out where to go with it.,EditMyRaw,d8s2pmm,3,t5_3cja1
9815051,0,t1_dal1rq3,Well it depends what you want to learn. If color correction then yes I find pictures with more color more challenging to edit. On the other hand photos like this are really good to train exposure light balancing and tonal value on  a.k.a. getting rich tones everywhere without blowing out the lights.,EditMyRaw,damx39u,1,t5_3cja1

9914906,0,t1_dazn3dq,Thanks. That combination definitely works. Did you apply the pairs to highlights vs shadows or was it done like a gradient filter?,EditMyRaw,dazxpgf,1,t5_3cja1

10415461,0,t3_5l2rh4, photos here with really subtle differences. In the first I just went into photoshop and upped the contrast on certain parts the reflection some of the trees and a few leaves. The nd image is just straight out of Lightroom.Played around with the hues and temperature definitely warmer and added a little grain. Hope you like it!,EditMyRaw,dconsek,1,t5_3cja1

11556269,0,t3_64y8jc,My editNot super happy with the contrast and levels in my edit but I really think the colors look great. If I werent too lazy I would properly do an additional edit exclusively focusing on the luminosity and then overlaying it with this edit and only keep the colors. ,EditMyRaw,dg5wntt,5,t5_3cja1
11644007,0,t1_dgewpqa,Sure. I did some basic touching up with the highlightlowlight sliders dehazed upped the exposure a touch then I used  graduated filters to up exposure on the stars and keep the noise down on the lower area and up the exposure further on the right side then another one to add clarity contrast  and some extra color on the stars. I did fidget with the hue of the sky a touch to make it bluer.,EditMyRaw,dgfv1bx,1,t5_3cja1
