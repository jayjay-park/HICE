Yeah you get a game over screen but remember that you only get the breathing ending if certain parameters are met during the game. The best thing you can do if you decide to embrace IT is honestly form your own ending. Most people here and in rmasseffect call it head canon. You decide what happened after you woke up. Once I got over the initial WTF?! outrage and discovered IT I bought in and formed my own ending for each Shepard I finished the game with.,Indoctrinated,cfleffp,2,t5_2tsqu
559146,0,t3_20i8ye,My interpretation of the IT is Shepard never actually took the beam up. Everything after getting hit with Harbingers beam is a hallucination. The actual architecture of the Citadel as portrayed doesnt really matter. After Shepard gets blasted thats where the narrative starts to take on a dreamlike quality and doesnt make a lot of sense when you think about it.,Indoctrinated,cg3ty4h,10,t5_2tsqu

6390144,0,t1_cus6mne,This. The name of the game includes the name of the next nearest galaxy Andromeda so they dont have much of a reason to mention whats been happening in the Milky Way which is where all the events of the first ME trilogy take place. As much as Id like to believe that theyd make the ME ending right I dont think theyll even reference the events in the first ME trilogy. It just doesnt make sense to me without the IT being canon.ampnbspHowever it would be odd if the Reapers are confined to the Milky Way with their cycle of extinction. IRL Andromeda is . million lightyears away from Earth. In the ME Codex entries on The Reapers it states that they can travel nearly  lightyears in a hour period.  Entry here. Calculations would put their travel time to Andromeda from Earth given those speeds at about a quarter over  years. Only possibility I see for IT in MEA is if the Reapers are mentioned in some way in the game. ,Indoctrinated,czfzroh,1,t5_2tsqu
