6213767,0,t3_40mvmq,First off I highly recommend Shyvana jungle players of all skill levels to watch this video. Its nearly  minutes long but he makes some very good points all throughout it. I almost guarantee you will learn something new.Secondly I tried some of the things he suggested I like the jungle path he uses. Its faster and safer overall. Ill probably start using this clear from now on. Dont like Rapid Fire Cannon. Although it has nice synergy with Shyvanas kit it has zero synergy with Sated Devourer. By the time you have both Devourer and RFC you almost have sated so compared to items like BotRK Titanic and Rageblade it falls short especially past  minutes. The masteries he is using are interesting. I like how Strength of the Ages synergises with Titanic even though he doesnt build Titanic and I havnt really noticed a massive difference in burstdps from not going Thunderlords. Might start using these masteries now. Another thing to note is that he goes flask instead of  pots. Because the clear is so easy now you can quite safely go flask and later build it into Hunters ,shyvanamains,cyvxsjn,1,t5_390ht

7508653,0,t3_4i6nef,Just won a ranked game with something similar the build is pretty funny but it leaves you squishy. I was thinking about building thornmail next because I THINK you would also heal off the thornmail damage.,shyvanamains,d2vp2a9,1,t5_390ht

8102178,0,t3_4q6eqt,I dont think youll be able to clear well with Hybrid Pen marks. Theyre great for fighting champions but Im fairly sure small jungle creeps have  armor and MR and youd still kill the big one faster with attack speed.As for items I only build Trinity Force in the following case  A Im moderately to significantly ahead.  B The enemy team is primarily squishies.Otherwise it seems fine. I prefer Bloodrazor to Cinderhulk but both are viable. I dont think Gunblade is necessarily bad but when youre ulting into a teamfight your damage is mostly AoE and you get a reduced heal from it so Im not sure how effective it is.,shyvanamains,d4qralz,1,t5_390ht

9069579,0,t1_d7zq3qv,Unyielding is better than Recovery you dont need hp regen in the jungle so you might aswell aim for more tankiness later in the game same goes for Perseverance just go with Insight especially if you run Exaust or Ghost.,shyvanamains,d820ltb,1,t5_390ht
9244782,0,t1_d8lu3em,Sorry to chime in but what are your thoughts on Ghostblade? The active can help stick to targets and its extremely powerful in the early game. Could sell it for something else once you reach  items.,shyvanamains,d8nudk8,1,t5_390ht

9591131,0,t1_d9v9v3z,Seems like deathfire touch and the new guinsoo might be an interesting combination but Im not sure if riot is willing to push her AP ratios especially now that her Es ratio was nerfed only to be situationally stronger during dragon form.    However I think some of those changes are stronger than what they seem. NoCC ulti can be pretty big between getting killing an adc and getting killed and those little details can snowball entire games. Theres less incentive for flat health items but more for armor resist items. I am worried however that her new passive may be too situational.    Biggest thing is the items though. The items are what made Shyvana viable in the past. Guinsoos blade will give shyvana everything she needs offensively AD AS AP and a pseudodevourer passive. BOTRK is also getting buffed for tankingshredding as a viable alternative.,shyvanamains,d9vaxda,1,t5_390ht

10289188,0,t1_dcabsnz,She still have one of the fastest clears. But I didnt think that farm junglers are consistent way to climb right now. Thats why she feels like she doing nothing but by removing  bonus damage to monsters from her w nowhere makes her from S tier clear speed to drop to F. I still think she belongs in top  fastest clearing junglers. Also the thing about the jungle is that if you clear camps faster lets say  or  sec each camp you will lose less health  on each camp.,shyvanamains,dcac2yr,1,t5_390ht

10815650,0,t3_5su14t,I have switch between flash and exhaust multiple times over the seasons right now I heavily prefer the flash as it allows you to go for very deep counter jungling. The flash is also much better if you go for a more damage heavy build like bloodrazer into BORK since you cant afford to just run at someone in teamfight with this build as you would take to much damage. Also when you build BORK you still get a good slow with a much lower cooldown than exhaust.,shyvanamains,ddvk3ml,1,t5_390ht
11196534,0,t3_5zm6sc,Simple dont get yourself into situations like that.  Better to back off than get kited and die hardly ever engage on shyv without your ult it should be up really quick all the time just hit stuff and farm go after objectives etc so they have to come to you a lot of shyv play is manipulating engagements into your favor by making the enemy team react to you.  Even blowing your ult and running away into your team and baiting etc is better than chasing kiters you cant kill just dont do it.,shyvanamains,df143oc,1,t5_390ht

11523705,0,t1_dg2772d,Titanic damage will scale with the increased health but youre still behind in damage the while the active is up. With the  bonus titanic damage is slightly higher but autos will still hit like wet lettuce.I guess Ill have to test both and see if Im using the active to wade in or disengage from my crazy engages. If its the former then Ill definitely switch to titanic.,shyvanamains,dg27plp,2,t5_390ht
