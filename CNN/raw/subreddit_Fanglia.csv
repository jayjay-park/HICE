10204674,0,t1_dc0qbrt,The main post is interesting. Only  people left Night  and only  last night. I wonder if thats a result of awesome Ozzys or smart HII plays.,Fanglia,dc0r9l6,4,t5_3i9bp
10212995,0,t1_dc1p2x7,So Im relooking at your initial post since I initially thought this up while walking to lunch and didnt have the exact wording. You claim that you were protected with the immunity necklace. This isnt the same thing as saved by an attack. The rest of your posts make it look like you were saved and that this clears you. Maybe this is the source of confusion.,Fanglia,dc1p8lt,7,t5_3i9bp
10214228,0,t3_5m45r4,OK since Im just full of wild ideas today Ill throw out another one. Each night there was one vote for the person eliminated by the villains Kass and ohmamari. What if the same person voted for them both times? What if this person is a villain who voted to eliminate them at tribal council in the hopes that they their first choice target would be eliminated by the vote leaving their second choice to be eliminated by the villain attack? If this is the case based on the votes revealed the only people who could vote for both of them would be one of uFancyZombie ujfinner uPenguinJassy or uRavenclawmuggleThoughts? I know I sound like Im shouting crazed things atop my soapbox but I figure its better to just throw ideas out and see what sticks.Edit as I wrote this PenguinJassy recorded their vote and it wasnt for both of them.,Fanglia,dc1u9pv,4,t5_3i9bp
