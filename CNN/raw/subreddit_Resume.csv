11122964,0,t1_desjlfe,It might be the word that is used indeed doing a search for submatriculant which is what I had to do not because I didnt know what it meant but because I wanted to know the genesis brought up several results from UPenn HOWEVER I have dealt with many hiring managers and many many ivy grads and a pattern emerges where the language of resumes far outpaces what those doing the hiring want to see... IE if you dont use  words in normal conversation then you dont need to put them on the resume and even if you do it might be worth toning it down. I understand that your program iswas called submatriculating but for a reader who doesnt encounter that language often it will come off a bit... arrogant. Again just my experience  if you feel it helps you and every word should help you on your resume then of course keep the language.,Resume,dess1s2,2,t5_2qv6z
