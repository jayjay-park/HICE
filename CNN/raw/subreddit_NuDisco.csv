11042396,0,t1_dejmssb,Thanks! Yeah I definitely think producers need to keep iterating the genre instead of just producing the same throwback music. NuDisco is a great genre with a lot of potential and its always interesting to see musicians such as yourself innovating the genre. Keep up the good work!,NuDisco,dejmwxk,3,t5_2sb0y
