57277,0,t1_cegbh1z,I admit i got the weaponvehicleblack market mod with longer and stronger grapple and infinite ammo. Those missions are pretty easy then. Dual wield either the small machine guns or the revolvers while carrying the rocket launcher and you will dominate even elite soldiers. Having it on the easiest mode is too easy with the mods though. No challenge at all. ,justcause2,ceky9ba,2,t5_2rlds

3681817,0,t1_cqbqvri,It looks like there is nothing you can do at the moment. Maybe you could find a mod that enables a dev console or something of the sort?Anyway this game isnt about stealth evasion or efficiency its just about shooting everything you see. If you get shot its okay because you heal instantly. This isnt really a game for strategy its rather a game to relax and blow things up Michael Bay style.,justcause2,cqby98w,3,t5_2rlds
