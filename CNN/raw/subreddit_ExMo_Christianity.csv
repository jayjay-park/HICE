11718498,0,t3_5yur8w,The youversion Bible app is really good to use because you can easily switch versions and get a clear understanding of what is being said.My go to is usually the NLT which provides a good allrounder especially with foot notes included. My backups are AMP which goes into detail with words and the message if I want to read something nice,ExMo_Christianity,dgobjxo,1,t5_3hzra
