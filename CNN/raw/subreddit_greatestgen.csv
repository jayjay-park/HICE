9971717,0,t1_db70wf2,See this is exactly why I didnt want to get into this you turned a fun Star Trek podcast into a political debate. And to what end? To get your rocks off? To make political points in your mind? If you cant handle the Pod you shouldnt download.I could spend an hour with you refuting your points and making you look like a fool but its as much a waste of my time as it will be to yours since it will be falling on deaf ears. Not to mention the fact that this is not the appropriate forum if you want to argue politics maybe go over to the politics Forum or republican or conservative or whatever you classify yourself as. If you cant just enjoy the podcast stop listening. If you want to be here tolerate the political satire and shut up.  P.S. if youre having trouble now your heads really going to explode when we hit Times Arrow. Thats the one where they explain how right wing philosophies and racism were destroyed by the Federation.,greatestgen,db7cb7t,3,t5_3er7i
