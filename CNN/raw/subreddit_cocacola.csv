4943965,0,t1_cuhp99o,Maybe your taste have changed or maybe your local bottler has done something different with the water.  If Im not mistaken all the coke syrup is made by coke themselves and shipped to the local bottlers.  On a side note I bet if you let coke and your bottler know they may a some info or maybe something for your inconvenience.Oh you could try one of the Mexican cokes with real sugar.  In some stores with a Mexican food section they have glass bottles made with real sugar.  I cant remember if they where bottled there or what the deal was.  My mom gets them every once in a while and I can tell a big difference may be something to look out for. ,cocacola,cuhq5u2,1,t5_2skfn

5503741,0,t1_cw8bjxr,Thanks for the info the rumor mill is in full swing and its hard not to buy into some of them especially being so close to Chicago.I figured the vacation buy was going to be cut so I am going to buy a week and use it early in the year so I at least have one more week next year. If we go down to two weeks Im out though.I did hear Reyes doesnt use Runzheimer for vehicle policy and instead just pays govt rate mileage very excited about that since it means I dont have to have a new car for the  business miles I put on a year.  Thanks again,cocacola,cwf5key,1,t5_2skfn

7007089,0,t1_d1abj2l,The best tastinggod tier is in a glass glass or a glass bottle surrounded by friends and family rejoicing and consoling after a long week. Nothing other is correct or valid.,cocacola,d1alk8e,1,t5_2skfn
7060757,0,t3_4c7zwa,One of the Coke recruiters here. If you have merchandiser experience youre a leg up on half the people we send through. We dont always get back hiring reports so I cant honestly tell you what your chances are. However Id say your chances are pretty good.On a side note if you dont hear back from the person who interviewed you by tomorrow give him a call tomorrow. If Im not mistaken the guy who interviewed you is one of the CFRs which are the kind of Lead Recruiters. Due to the current structure some of the CFRs are swamped with work. So if he doesnt call you its likely because he got super busy and forgotjust hasnt gotten around to it yet. Giving him a call is  the right thing to do if you havent heard back.,cocacola,d1gp4ca,2,t5_2skfn

7988302,0,t3_4om51o,Honestly the amount of times Ive asked for Coke and been given pepsi is crazy. I like that some servers at least let you know that they dont sell Coke. I usually just ask for water instead of being a dick about it.,cocacola,d4dymhj,5,t5_2skfn
