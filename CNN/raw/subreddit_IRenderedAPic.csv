1125820,0,t1_chvxd0t,Thanks I think that the need to get it done outweighed the render settings. I may just redo it as far as rendering and postwork goes.I wish I could show more recent work of mine but I dont produce enough. My back catalog could and I exaggerate fill up this subreddit though. I may take some of my best work from over the years post them here and date them.,IRenderedAPic,chw9i1g,2,t5_2thbd
2556779,0,t1_cmsb01c,Yeah taking on a project you know you cant do perfectly is a good way to learn. Its an endless cycle of trial and cringe. Also looked at the batfan and a few videos cool channel not sure if you only worked on this one video or what.,IRenderedAPic,cmsb4cn,1,t5_2thbd
2879119,0,t1_cnvc3w8,thanks! I was going for a flat portraiture style lighting. I like the plasticky look that cd render engine produces.  ,IRenderedAPic,cnvcw0j,1,t5_2thbd
4271413,0,t3_39w4iw,The lighting looks kind of splotchy IM subdivs too low? Im guessing theyre about  Id go for .Still some noise on the floor reflection.The blanket looks a bit plasticy because of the shine. The model for it looks a bit thick and stiff.You could try using Marvelous Designer to make the pillows they look pretty weird.Something with the concrete blocks texture seems off maybe the scaling also it doesnt line up in some places.Sampling in general seems a bit jaggy in places noticed that in the second image mirror frame reflection and in other fine details.Did you do any sharpening? By filter in the render or in post? Id suggest doing an area filter in the render to blur it a bit render at a big resolution and then do the sharpening and resizing as needed in post.I assume youre not using the newest VRay with the GGX BRDF? I think that would help with some of the simpler materials so they dont look so CG. Id really want to get .. but havent been able to find anything newer than .. in... you know... places...Other than that pretty good job on the modeling some stuff like the twigs and windows with the blinds does look a bit underdetailed though.,IRenderedAPic,cs73t0i,3,t5_2thbd
4953270,0,t1_cuiub81,Well yeah its not visible at all. There is no context to tell its a daylight scene you are maybe missing it because you made it and are used to how it looks. Maybe model an exterior or figure out a background tu put there just gray looks weird if its daytime and the light is coming from the outside there should be a really bright scene outside.If its a daytime scene I would suggest first of all turning off all the interior lights just for now and turning on only the outside light  sun amp sky system or an hdri. Make sure your camera settings make sense for a daylight interior scene you can just look up what shutter speed and ISO makes sense for this so youre working with real physically accurate numbers.Now for testing set the render quality to really low no aa small resolution etc. Adjust the lighting so that the room looks like it should look if its a daylight scene.Now you can turn on the interior lights but set them to a realistic value  maybe  lumens you can look up what lights produce how many lumens if you need to.In a daytime scene the interior lights should make almost no difference to the scene but in your render looks like theyre all there is. Try turning on a light in real life when its a bright day it will have almost no effect because the light from the sun amp sky is way brighter than our artificial light sources.Herearesomereferences.,IRenderedAPic,cuiwek5,2,t5_2thbd
6860811,0,t1_d0tyx1z,Yeah idk if max has an auto smooth function but what youre describing should also work. If you need further help with blender the folks over on rblender are usually happy to help.,IRenderedAPic,d0tzddm,1,t5_2thbd
