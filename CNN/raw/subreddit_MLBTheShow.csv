3647067,0,t1_cq7ymzn,One of the many reasons I love this game is that it is realistic when it comes to pitching. Curves and sliders are more likely to fall outside of the strike zone. Curves left in the zone wait on it and crush it. Also working the count actually works because of the variability in the accuracy of off speed pitches. You are more likely to get a fastball  count than than . I have noticed that in  the pitch speed is not as fast as  which makes contact a little more realistic as you can wait on pitches a little more. ,MLBTheShow,cq7zr7j,12,t5_2tjde

Does it matter what base the runner is on when they hit HR? They have plenty of on base threats to put on top of the order. Looks like Travis and Donaldson will be  and Tulo will bat cleanup between Bautista and Encarnacion.

I was simply explaining that businesses dont always go to the extreme because of capitalism.In baseball teams have done their research and found out that people think a lot of things at the ballpark are expensive so many teams are offering value food and merchandise.  hats. . drinks and hot dogs. Things like that in addition to the expensive stuff. But you would have told those complainers that it was just capitalism and to suck it up. Real businesspeople who understand capitalism knew to lower the prices on certain items to entice those people to come to the ballpark. Maybe theyll do their research and they might learn theres too many ads and theyll tone it down in the future. Maybe theres enough ads.

6580147,0,t1_czzxigy,Damn that is impressive. I simply cant play online enough to get myself that highly ranked. My DD had a record roughly  but most of it was against CPU. I see guys who have hundreds and hundreds of games played each season and I envy it. I just cant find the time. I just wish they had a system that rewarded teams that challenged themselves. So for example if I play a highly ranked team its a close game and I lose late in the game....I should get a boost to my ranking instead of a decline. Obviously the winner deserves a much larger boost but the loser shouldnt be punished for losing to a great opponent. Currently you can just play a bunch of bums and level up your team as long as you do not lose any games and that is a shame. People are too afraid of failure when in reality its baseball and all of the best teams lose plenty of games each season. I remember many times last year where teams would back out on me during the stadium select screen because I had every field unlocked and they could tell that I was decent.

Reliever data is typically oriented around splits versus team e.g. Royals vs White Sox White Sox hitters have a . avg versus Herrera this season.

6875884,0,t3_49p06u,I have an SP from the Blue Jays that I carried over from MLB  the show. ie no Tulo or Donaldson on the Blue Jays.The Rays are god tier in the AL East. In Edwin Encarnacions contract year he ended up going to Tampa. So their  are Edwin Myers and Longoria. All of whom are  still and the Rays lead the league in several offensive categories. Meanwhile the rest of the AL East is full of sub  overall players outside of some big names. The Yankees number  hitter is Gardner who is backed up by Tex in the  hole. Needless to say theyre in last place. Red Sox have Giancarlo and Pedroia but beyond that their offense isnt very good. Xander never really got good at hitting in my league. Orioles are still strong in terms of offense but their SP holds them back in second behind the BoSox. They have Chris Davis Adam Jones and Josh Hamilton. As a LHP I love facing the Orioles. They do well in most offensive categories in the AL but they definitely lead in Ks. The Jays who drafted me are lead by Adam Lind. Joey Batts and Nelson Cruz are both around s overall. Theyre not very good and so run support is hard to come by. Melky is about the only hitter with an OBP above ..

One example is your approach at the plate and being able to kind of guess what pitches the pitcher is likely to throw depending on the count.  And it works backwards too playing this game will increase your appreciation of the real sport.

8089260,0,t1_d4pa09w,Neither of those two ARods are probably the ones he has. There has been  Mariners ARod sold the faster one. There has been no Rangers ARods sold. The one he has is most likely this one which you get for completing the AL collection. If its the Mariners ARod then none of the past few posts even matter since youre better off playing him at SS and then youre basically weighing whether or not you should play Cano or Machado. That ARod has  CONPWR vs. R but only  contact vs. L with  PWR.  speed and  stealing.  fielding and  reactions. If you play him at B he has  fielding and  reactions. And you seriously think flashback Murphy is a joke? Do you even know that he has a  rated postseason flashback card I never mentioned live series Murphy in my posts. Not once. So let me spell this out for you cause youre clearly not reading the details. With his current lineupvs. RDonaldson  CON  PWR  CON  PWR with inside edge if were being generousRodriguez  CON  PWR FBs dont have IE so your point about Murphy makes no sensevs. LDonaldson  CON  PWR  CON  PWR with inside edge if were being generousRodriguez  CON  PWRB defense  fielding reactions speedB defense  fielding reactions speedMy proposed lineupvs. RRodriguez  CON  PWRCano  CON  PWR  CON  PWR  on IE if were being generousB defense  fielding reactions speedB defense  fielding reactions speedvs. LDonaldson  CON  PWR  CON  PWR with inside edge if were being generousFB Zobrist  CON  PWR no IEB defense  fielding reactions speedB defense  fielding reactions speedYou improve vs. righties in general since you keep ARod but replace Donaldsons mediocre bat vs. righties with a better bat in Cano. You lose power vs. lefties if you play Zobrist but your defense is also  points higher. Thats a big difference. So basically you sacrifice  in power for  defense. Zobrist is also a great utility player in general so having him on the bench isnt even a bad thing. Basically youre wasting one bench spot for this. Not to mention that Zobrist is actually faster than ARod and has decent stealing stats as well  stealing. And you have no idea that ARod would only commit one error every  games. Have you been playing guys out of position like this? If youve ever played against the Yetis you know how much playing out of position can cost you defensively. You picked the wrong side of this stupid argument. ,MLBTheShow,d4pb226,0,t5_2tjde

Weird how the feed card is NatsExpos Gary Carter though who was easy to feedNationalscardinals  I actually had a combo roster of both teams since they both had small innings to complete and I wasnt forced to play with shitty guys. Easy enough innings and feeding was easy. Rendon was a silver and only going for ish stubs so I kept buying him and feeding since high bronze players were going for ish stubs. Ozzie was easy to feed as well.Padres  i hate playing with this team.

Id say same for Harper and when cutch was diamond. Marte is way better than cutch in the game but was about k cheaper!!

8532527,0,t1_d684dm8,Its down to a couple of factors  the biggest one being overall rating compared to the other players in your team in the same position.   If youre a LF with someone like the Yankees  theres a good chance youll be in the majors quickly with nobody holding you back but if youre on the Indians with Brantley already there  its going to hold you back for quite some time.  You can request a trade  but I had one rtts player that I had to wait out  full years before I could leave the Yankees in free agency. Also  fielding ratings play a big part in whether a team will call you up  you could be  overall and hitting  and they wont call you up because you might only have  fielding and  reaction.,MLBTheShow,d684pof,2,t5_2tjde

8765989,1,t3_505n0o,As the guy who got  FB Beltrans in one BR round I can tell you its doable. Never give up hope. For every  good run I have I have  bad ones. Thankfully Im at a point in the game where my lineup is stacked. I have s at nearly every position. So at this point BR is my way of trying to luck into rare FB players. With BR you need to throw everything you traditionally do out the window. Dont I repeat dont play it like a normal  inning game. If you have to bunt a ton do it. Play to your players strengths. If I have FB Reyes you better believe Im seeing some pitches and then bunting when his infield moves back. And stealing every damn base. BR has gotten me so livid at times. Ive gotten to  and then my game froze in the th game when I was up. Ive been bunt cheesed. Ive been ddosed. Ive had everything happen. Ive even had times where my reward was so garbage I just quit. But there have been times where my  bonus was  arod allowing me to complete about  collections by selling him. Or the time I got  Beltran at  and  Beltran at .

9162851,0,t1_d8dfmh7,Yep read up in this sub before I started playing and am a zone hitter. I just need better discipline and better guessing maybe. If I get to  strikes I normally leave the aim right down the middle and leave my thumb off the placement which may be a mistake I suppose. My reflexes may not be good enough to move the reticle after the pitch so often I will just let go if I feel that the pitch isnt going to hit the mark. I should be hitting with more power with my levels  in hitting and  in power. Discipline and timing are both in the low s. Maybe I just need more practice or something is wrong with my technique. With my current slg at around . Im obviously hitting many singles when they should be doubles or better. it just seems like the power swing has failed me when I guess the pitch is the only time Ive used it for choppers and pop ups most of the time and Id rather just get on base. Its funny because the teams Ive played for hit me in the  spots yet Im not all that clutch and my power performance has been abysmal. Id like to think that because my guy is only  that hell get better But I know its me. Like I said though enjoying the challenge but open to suggestions!,MLBTheShow,d8dgid7,1,t5_2tjde

9167242,0,t3_55vicf,I can see hope it being true. Unless I get lucky by pulling a Beltran or winning one I have no chance of playing with that card or his prime. Now that the year is almost over seems like they are introducing other ways for players like me not good to be able to play with those cards and spending hundreds of dollars buying it outright.Edit I think I misunderstood the post. I was thinking it would roll out just like the ReyesDickey LS missions. If you own LS Beltran you could unlock Rookie Beltran which would lead to Prime Beltran. Seems like thatd make a lot of sense if they did that. No reason having an ultraexclusive card after the season with no way to eventually obtain it beyond packbuying.,MLBTheShow,d8e0jt3,1,t5_2tjde

9195884,0,t3_56aad8,I dont think youll meet anyone whos gone through as many lefties as me...I really cant hit with righties so lefties are my go to. Ill go through quite a few here. Ill also throw some switch hitters in because theyre super useful. Ted Williams  . By far my favorite batter in MLB. The guy kills the ball when its anywhere in the strike zone. Prime Jacoby  . I like Jacoby but the problem for me is he only does  things. Home run infield single or fly out. I still recommend him if you need someone who crushes righties.Prime Ortiz  . Tons of power good contact dont really like the huge leg kick.LS Cano  . Great contact hitter with great power vs righties. Probably a platoon though as his splits arent great.Yogi Berra  . If you need a left handed batting catcher hes a great option although he only hit . for me he hit clutch home runs and plenty of gappers.FB Carl Crawford  . When Im in a situation where I NEED a hit I trust Crawford more than anyone else except Teddy. The guy has great pop vs righties too.FB Sizemore  . Has plenty of power but always seems to get over or under the ball.LS Lindor  . Switch hitter good contact both ways and has pop. Always seems to come in clutch.George Brett  . Great contact pretty good power and great vision. Hes a solid bat for sure.Rod Carew  . If you need a guy to get singles hes your dude. Very little power but hes similar to Ichiro. Great contact hitter.FB Ichiro  . Been my leadoff hitter since I first got him. People always challenge him up and in so sit your PCI there and hell get tons of hits.FB Hamilton  . Dude crushes righties but its either a home run or a fly out almost every time for me. FB McCann  . Solid batter with good contact both ways and some good pop even with  power. Id recommend if you can put up with Oh and McCann McCANT get a glove on this one and its by to the backstop.Eddie Mathews  . This man hits BOMBS. No idea why he hits so well for me but that  power is for real.LS Dee Gordon  . If he had more power hed be a  but hes a guy who will put the ball in play  and hey hits out of a lot of those.LS Bryce Harper  . Pre Downgrade I absolutely love his stance and swing so much so I made my CAP have it. He hits so well for me finds gaps hits bomb the whole package. LS Freddie Freeman  . Very solid batter. Crushes almost anything in the zone. Gets tons of doubles for me.FB Jim Edmonds  . Great power and solid contact. Lots of pop ups though. LS Daniel Murphy  . HIGHLY recommend him. Hes an on base machine. Everything he hits seems to find a way through at least twice a game.RookiePrime Reyes  . Both of these cards hit very well. I highly recommend either.Prime Rollins  . I dont understand it but he has insane pop he always picks up at least  HR or  warning track fly out per game. I love this card.Prime Utley  . Very smooth swing with great power. Another card Id recommend.Prime Howard  . Great power but I feel there are better all round options at B.LS Votto   Only used him briefly  games but he has great contact and enough power to crush the ball. FB Choo   . Usually keep this guy on my bench for pinch hitting. Great contact and power with a very nice swing.Prime Fielder  . Lots of power but strikes out lotd for me. Still love him at B and dont think thatll ever change.LS Carpenter  . Hits well but seems to be lots of ground outsgrounding into DPsLS CarGo  . With IE he was constantly at  vs righties which led to tons of bomb. However his Prime was a let down. LS Blackmon  . Again with IE this guy was dangerous. Still a good contact hitter.LS Seager  . Took me about  times of buyingselling to finally get going with him but he has crazy contact ability with good power.FB Ethier  . Great power but a slow bat at least for me.Tony Gwynn  . Another fantastic contact hitter always seems to get on base for me. LS Brandon Belt  . With IE this guy hit fucking EVERYTHING. With IE not happening everyday Im not sure if hell make it into my lineup.And of course Reggie Stocker  .. Not as good as Teddy as Teddy has a very fast bat and things explode off of it but Stocker is fucking Bonds. Crazy power both ways and people are scared to pitch to him which leads to errors. Thats all Ive got. Im sure Ive used more but I feel this is long enough. On another note hows Rizzo?? One player I havent tried but really want to.,MLBTheShow,d8hn9pi,12,t5_2tjde

I only have the Rockies Giants and Dodgers  cards total to get before finishing all the collections and getting Jackie. But to keep it a bit more fresh I play normal games with a mission in mind but not with an entire roster devoted to one mission.Grinding against the yetis gets incredibly boring so Ill usually opt to do that when I dont have enough time to play a few games through.

10256697,0,t1_dbzu6z7,Bunting in general isnt cheese at all especially sac bunts. If you use players that are supposed to be good at bunting or it would make sense to do so like a player without much power but a lot of speed and is great at stealing. Tons of players just take advantage of how broken the bunting mechanic is by bunting with literally every player including big slow players with a ton of power. I think people who are unfamiliar with baseball think that unless a player gets on base every single at bat they must suck so they bunt with everyone and since the success rate for bunting is WAY higher than trying to swing the bat they do it. These same players also inexplicably try to steal with every single player too. I cant count how many times ive picked off a baserunner because they took a humongous  step lead or thrown out a guy trying to steal by a mile because they try it with someone with  speed and  stealing ability. Tldr if bunting makes sense a fast player without much hitting ability or trying to bunt the runner into scoring position its perfectly fine but spamming it to take advantage of the mechanic is a huge dickhead move,MLBTheShow,dc6nif0,2,t5_2tjde

10567785,0,t3_5rb30m,I like this idea but a modified version of it that Ive been an advocate of for a while which is a badgeset system.  And if you want to separate it from MUT make it only an earned badge and set system.  Have four types of badges Seasons HH Battle Royale and Solos.  Make sets with different unique players that people can choose to allocate those badges towards.  Earn solo badges by grinding out offline solos.  Earn one BR badge for  wins two more for   more for  and  more for   a unique BR exclusive card.  In HH seasons you would earn these badges by having successful seasons obviously.  In regular HH you earn badges by moving up the ranks.  Maybe the HH badge sets only require one badge and each tier has  different players to choose from.  If you make it to the DS you get to choose between  overall players.  The CS .  The WS nets you a  overall player.  This way the game would operate kind of like a meritocracy for those of us who are competitive but still offers avenues to get really good cards for those who arent as good or are disinterested in playing competitively.  ,MLBTheShow,dd5z7tp,3,t5_2tjde

I was arguing that the user base is large enough that there is a reasonable expectation that you have an audience to support the early stages of an Esport.  That could be inferring causation when its only an apparent correlation but I think that if they could really market it through social media and ingame loading screens that user base would translate into viewership.  If they do a sponsored twitch tourney for a modest prize and stream it over the course of  days with a structured schedule all they would need is somewhere between k and .k viewers to make it worth it at that scale.  Maybe not even that much.  We arent talking about a Madden tournament where they are giving k to the winner.  Just a small scale tournament or two to see exactly what kind of market is there.  If they fall short of expectations they dont really lose much at all.  If they meet them they know exactly what scale they are capable of.  If they exceed expectations they can start talking about upping the scope a little bit.  ,MLBTheShow,ddm5n7s,2,t5_2tjde

But again these DD people spend a ridiculous amount of money. If they add a feature in DD that gets people to spend even more money on it it makes up for people like us who arent buying. Im honestly not sure how to fix this other than to not buy the game and shame the people spending unreasonable money on a game mode that should be free.

Your reputation of babying developers who are asking for our cash and shielding them from any criticism is warranted.I personally understand why not every mode gets a full makeover every year but franchise players have been waiting a long time. Coupled with the fact that this is the only AAA baseball sim on the market I can see why people would call Sony complacent.They brag about their increased sales every year but it doesnt seem like their budget or staff gets increased because we hear the same exact things every year about how this is a small team and not the most popular sports franchise.I lay the blame right at Sony. ,MLBTheShow,denk9mu,22,t5_2tjde

This lets you see pitches to recognize them better and has the added benefit of getting you into some hitters counts where you can accurately predict fastballs.

Also have had decent luck in Madden last  years too pulling a number of limiteds in pro packs. Im disappointed but it could be worse I guess. Like I said at least I got good golds if I got like the worst golds on top off no diamonds then Id be salty as hell. Ninja edit I wish theyd make a system where if you open X amount of packs you are assured at least  diamond. I know HS and other card games have a similar system. Kinda protect people from super bad RNG. I know MLB is a bit different but I dont think  say every  packs or something is that unreasonable. ,MLBTheShow,dfklexj,0,t5_2tjde

I track my pitches when Im pitching to try and get the tracking down for hitting.Pitching PulseHitting Zone with WEDGE shape.Biggest hitting tips I can give are Mess around with the shape of your bat reticle until you get one that resonates. Wedge was it for me.  Follow the ball all the way through the zone with your eyes. Relax your hands and disassociate your left thumb from your right. Once disassociated always track the ball with your left thumb. Try and track until you are hitting the bottom to middle third of the baseball especially with power hitters. Wait for your pitch in a hot zone or move your zone to where the pitcher has been trending to cheat a bit. Keep your eyes locked on where you first see the ball in the pitchers hand i.e. batters eye.,MLBTheShow,dflqnw9,3,t5_2tjde

11462571,0,t3_63mgw2,best guess is they dont program the game to do a good job of handling connection issues.  one of the harder things to do with a web based application is to react when the connection is bad packet loss high latency etc even briefly.  some of it is that it is because with online gaming getting information from the host servers in real time is critical for the flow of the game ignoring old data is better than trying to play catchup.  some of it is that it is hard to do and testing isnt always transparent or easy.  you have to create a testing environment that simulates what happens when conditions suck and that environment has to simulate that suckiness accurately.  lastly you have to code it to react gracefully in these failure scenarios.  if you dont do those things simulate test and error handle then you get applications that freeze and wait for the next instruction that will never come.so here even when playing offline this game is constantly reporting back statistics and events to a server and when that fails we get what we get.this is a combination of servers overtaxed with capacity issues with an application that hasnt been load tested properly and software that doesnt handle errors well.from a capacity perspective this feels like a lack of preparation.  most companies like this use cloud based systems where they can turn up and down capacity based on need.  I am not on their tech staff so I do not know how they manage systems but there are systems in place for the exact scenario of a game release scale up and scale down based on demand but sadly they have either failed to use a system like that or have implemented it so poorly that it does not effectively manage the environment.,MLBTheShow,dfv9x6f,1,t5_2tjde

That being said its only worth trading in if you truly dont see yourself getting better or lack the interest in continuing to try and get better.I was absolutely jack shit at this game a week ago. Its been the first Show Ive actually tried grinding and I personally ran into the issue of pitching.  I couldnt pitch for shit! I either threw balls in the dirt or left them up in the zone and gave up homeruns.  I decided to make a RTTS guy on dynamic skill level so that as I progressed the game got harder and harder.  I still got shelled on Hall of Fame but I found myself able to compete on All Star and its helped a lot in the online game modes. I can normally get a run or two in a game and now that Im able to hold the opponent its become more enjoyable.  Its super frustrating at times still but the enjoyable moments are what makes it worth it.If you cant find a way to get better dont force it bud.Maybe put it down for a little bit and try again in a week or so anyways good luck!,MLBTheShow,dfy069f,1,t5_2tjde

Did I understand this right that ALL games should eventually count? Well Im owed like  wins in events conquest and seasons all included. The in game  content better properly compensate us for hourrrs of lost stats and   I personally was stuck at  in events for  days so all that time got me a silver...

AllStar is when the game turns into baseball as you know it.This is coming from someone whos spent most of the past month grinding Play vs. CPUTeam Epic stuff to level IV and when I go into an Events game or Ranked Seasons can immediately sense how much my skills have declined thanks to the CPUs tendencies on those two difficulties.,MLBTheShow,dgvq3bh,1,t5_2tjde
