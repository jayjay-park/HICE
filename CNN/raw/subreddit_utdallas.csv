Who cares? Theyre paying tens of thousands of dollars to be guinea pigs so the school can have a learning experience of its own?I would say a good  of the classes I took were TAs reading a script from a professor pointing to free tutorials on the internet and being unable to answer any technical questions.Its not worth it.,utdallas,cfu8z0g,4,t5_2s4is

A few of the professors Ive really liked have included Charles Shields Nathan Dodge Zalman Balanov Dinesh Bhatia Jung Lee Mohammad Saquib and Lawrence Overzet all for various reasons. In general though I agree with professor ratings found on websites like thisgtAlso if Im required to take a meal plan do just recommend paying for the cheapest one and then grocery shopping for the meals that the plan will not provide me with?You are required to have one of the weekly   or  meal plans if you live in the res halls. The problem with getting the cheapest meal plan is that they are really cost inefficient and you will not have a kitchen in your dorm so I would probably just bite the bullet and get the meal plan that you think you will use. I found that  meals a day was pretty good because its a buffet so you can eat as much as you want.gtWould you recommend moving out after the first semester and paying to live somewhere else that is near campus?You arent required to live on campus so if you have the option of living somewhere for cheaper you might consider it if money is tight. That being said I feel like living on campus has pretty good benefits and the apartments on campus are a pretty good deal month but same internet problems  ,utdallas,cg7zcit,3,t5_2s4is

833636,0,t3_23n4vt,UTD sounds like a great fit for you man! Its one of the best kept secrets in Texas and our Engineering and Computer Science programs are top notch in hot topic fields such as but not limited to Cybersecurity Cloud Computing Natural LanguageSpeech Processing Microelectronics Nanotechnology Analog Electronics Signal Processing among many others. Campus placement is great too a lot of people end up at great gradmedlaw schools all over the country and youd be amazed at how many companies come to recruit as well as getting hired beyond the DFW area like Intel NVIDIA Silicon Labs Cirrus Logic Motorola IBM Freescale Semiconductor Qualcomm Microsoft Amazon Google Virgin Galactic Ball Aerospace etc. If theres one thing UTD taught me its that the college experience is truly what you make of it and that means to not just sit passively and wait for things to happen but rather to be very proactive and make things happen. What to get involved in research? Email and talk to lots of professors and express your interests. Want to start an organization of your own interest? Register with SOC and gather some friends and start one. Even applying for internships go online and apply for them as well as going to ECS Intern Fair. Wow thats a lot but hopefully you get my point. UTD will be a great fit for you.,utdallas,cgz1bze,1,t5_2s4is

1302206,0,t1_cifzuqj,awh makes sense now.  As a transfer if you have over  cumulative transferable hours and a . or higher cumulative transferable GPA you are automatically admitted at UT Dallas.   The credits do not automatically transfer because they are other system schools and the degree plans are different  UT Dallas does not require foreign language or PE for our core.  Honestly if you spend a year at UT Austin and do not get admitted to their CS program you could be better off just to graduate and do a masters in CS.  If you transfer back to UT Dallas in Fall   no matter how many hours you have complete you would have at least a full year or  hours to complete at UTD before you could graduate.

Class attendance is not required as he understands a lot of people work but I would personally recommend it as he goes through how to complete your weekly HW assignment during class. I went into this class with  knowledge or interest in the material and ended up making an A in the class and a  on my final.

11438023,0,t3_62umeq,Pro Growth. The school is growing.  The CS program is evolving.  UTD is really getting their name out and companies are recognizing UTD as a great school for computer science.  Networking going to career fairs and just showing up will help a student land a job or internship.  UTD has a great K outreach program  Dr. Veerasamy has been putting a lot of effort encouraging younger students to pursue computer science.  This right here shows how much effort the university is putting into the next generation of computer scientists.  Con Ranking. Whatever source you choose to look at for best CS program UTD still has a ways to go.  Some prospective students swear by these rankings and will choose a school base on that number.  The rankings are inconsistent so choose your sources wisely.I dont regret choosing UTD knowing there were better schools in the state and in the nation for computer science.  I still have a close relation to UTD I work with the university on a frequent basis.  That alone makes my years there worthwhile.,utdallas,dfshm3t,1,t5_2s4is

11470298,0,t3_63pwaw,I took it and it was definitely interesting to me. Expect to look at and discuss a lot of paintings sculptures photographs architecture movie clips music and various internet clips. The professor is pretty funny and has a lot of interesting stories and insight into the different works being discussed. That being said it does take a lot of work compared to other classes. There are  major  page essays over works of art that you have to go see on your own time and bring back a program from them. One painting one dancetheater and one music and you can see them on campus. The grading is fairly lenient on those. There is also one big project at the end of the semester that requires you to do an art piece with a group and a short  page essay detailing what it is about and what you contributed. There are also  moderately difficult  question quizzes throughout the semester. He drops the lowest . It might seem easy but the answers are actually pretty obscure. To get an A you will probably need to attend  school performances. He announces these not very soon in advance but there are around  total each giving you a point bonus on your final grade. So in general although it was a little stressful I can definitely say I enjoyed the class. But I would recommend searching for some less workintensive classes before this one. ,utdallas,dfw5i5p,3,t5_2s4is

11601781,0,t1_dgb07w2,Personally I feel that UTD TV Radio and The Mercury are... crap to say the least. Content isnt as diverse and focuses too much on the tastes of the handful of people running the place. Meanwhile The Mercury just doesnt do a good job of covering stories. I have never ever ran across anyone that regularly follows The Mercury. And as I have stated here before I mainly get the newspaper to use as kindling or as protective covering for surfaces. The AMP though has decent material and thoughtprovoking articles. Granted half the stuff they write about are things I dont necessarily agree with but they do a good enough job of writing why theyve taken up a positionviewside or at least why the subject has done so. Unfortunately I can also say that I have never ran across anyone that regularly follows AMP. Maybe they just need to focus on how to get more of the student body interested in the student media?,utdallas,dgb2kb8,18,t5_2s4is
