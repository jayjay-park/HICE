3476202,0,t1_cpoifpj,Well written Jon.  Like Jon I owe a great deal to the organization and try to pay back whenever possible I remain connected because I CHOOSE to do so.  Too many positive things have occurred through NEACUHO for myself and others not to maintain my involvement.  The organization continues to evolve to provide professional development opportunities for the members either through the variety and it gets broader and more in depth it seems each year of professional development alternatives.  The hidden gem is the competency acquisition through serving in an elected position or appointed position.  You step up perhaps you are choseelected you have duties you serve you move along.  Personally and professionally.  As one of the more mature active members Ive watched each group attempt improve the organization through their sincere efforts and make their mark.  But its not always necessary and quite often I watched as perhaps the philosophy was this really isnt broken but lets fix it!  The bylaws when I was President in  YIKESthats more years ago than some of the folks reading this! seemed to be a bit simpler as NEACUHO delivered the same product as being delivered now.positive professional development through primarily conferences information exchange and building relationships.  When did it get so complicated?  Id love to read a presidential platform statement that basically says.lets do nothing but catch our breath enjoy each others company and learn stuff to help students living on campus and staff helping those students living on campus.   KISC keep it simple Chuck! works for me.  The other thing you pick up through participation in NEACUHO at the more than just going to the annual conference level is the respect of other professionals your peers your colleagues.  Jon Conlogue is one of those and I firmly believe we should heed his advice.  We are a profession that goes  miles an hour most of the time and just as we shouldnt be texting when driving  MPH we shouldnt be making decisions like this without pulling into the rest area stretching our legs and making sure all are heading in same direction.  Hit the pause button on this one and untangle the silly string that seems to have been shot out from a number of directions.  Vote no for this proposed reorg and lets talk through this at a time when a significant number of members can provide inputobviously at the annual conference.  The continuing evolution of NEACUHO wont stop its forward movement if its even needed if we pause for  days.  Id rather see the organization simply update the web page!  Cruising around it today a bit I found individuals listed for duties who went out of office  years ago! Hmmm.       Chuck Lamb  ,NEACUHO,cpoign7,2,t5_37cn0
