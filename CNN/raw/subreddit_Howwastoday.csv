Being with him was the highlight of my day as our funny banters and casual conversations made me forget my worries and negative thoughts. He didnt have to exert so much effort to make me smile from eartoear even on the day after we hung out. Hes my happy pill and Im lucky to have him as my friend.,Howwastoday,dgjtivx,3,t5_3ikjt

Hopefully I can find someone to hangout with me so Im not enjoying it all alone. I really dont want to sit around after my test so Im hoping someone will want to do something fun. This is just the break I needed. Make your day great guys! ,Howwastoday,dgvlupr,2,t5_3ikjt
