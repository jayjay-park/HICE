115566,0,t1_ceqzcp3,I think I got this sorted out.  Refer to the transcribed POH spiral dive recovery procedure in my earlier comment.  The Juniors POH procedure applies to entering the spiral dive from an excessively steep angle of bank say  degrees and when that happens the stick will be all the way back full elevator and towards the outside of the turn where a moment before this aileron and elevator pressure was countering the tendency to over bank.  So at the moment of entering the spiral dive you dont have aileron authority to reduce the bank and holding the stick back does not arrest the airspeed acceleration and most importantly the airspeed is increasing rapidly.  If you continue to hold the stick back the Gforce and speed will just increase fatally. Someone who knows SZD Juniors well confirmed that once the glider enters the spiral dive the POH procedure step  including notintuitively pushing the stick slightly forward will stop the spiral dive.  At that point the glider is still in a steep bank but not a spiral dive and PIC may want to adjust that to a more controlled slightly less steep bankturn.  By a somewhat weird logic the POH omits step . which would be the use of coordinated controls to reduce the bank Its logical to omit this step because it comes after you have technically exited from the spiral dive.  And if you do choose to reduce the bank then youre in what the POH calls a symmetrical dive step  going fast and perhaps accelerating by not spiraling and if you choose to and as the POH says you can ease back on the stick to reduce the speed.Back to your earlier exercise.  It is common to teach spiral dive recovery from a shallow bank but in that case the pilot does indeed have aileron authority to reduce the bank and exit the initial stages of the spiral dive aka the benign spiral.  And as noted you stop the exercise at  degrees bank.  If the spiral dive was entered from excessive bank the pilot would not have aileron authority to reduce the bank until after he exited the spiral.It is true that most low hour pilots will probably never bank steep enough to enter the spiral dive from a steep bank and so the POH push stick forward procedure is irrelevant.  And a CFI is certainly not going to demonstrate entry into a spiral dive from a steep angle of bank.  If a more advanced pilot enters a spiral dive from a steep bank he may mistake it for a spin and apply the spin recovery procedure which happily coincides with the spiral dive recovery procedure.,Gliding,cerl993,1,t5_2rfef

6282266,0,t3_41mels,As a CFI Id say its very useful. It will make you learn how to actually fly as opposed to just pointing the propeller in the right direction. Im obviously exaggerating a little here but I can usually tell if someone started their career as a glider pilot. They just fly better.,Gliding,cz3q1i2,9,t5_2rfef
6289727,0,t1_cz4g75w,Its the opposite for my Greater Boston Soaring Club in America. Hours from Power Rating can apply to Gliding but not the other way around. Most people who want both start off with Power so theyd spend less time gliding to get their gliding rating. I personally only enjoy gliding so I just go for the gliding only since more hour gliding mean more fun for me Im in no rush to get the license.,Gliding,cz4kkki,2,t5_2rfef

They are metal and usually tied out in the rain.  The SGS  is roughly equivalent to the Junior and there are a few SGS .  The  are very popular as both club and private gliders.  Due to the very low performance it is considered a point of pride to fly XC in a  and they are one of the safest gliders to land out due to very low stall speed  knots and a front skid for quick stops.  If you wreck the glider youre out  and being metal they absorb a lot of crash energy and protect the pilot from injury.  One drawback to the SGS is that they are difficult to assemble but this is only a hassle after a landout and the once a year assemblydisassembly.  The  provides another level of fun for the .The Junior will stay up on a weak day for a lot longer than the  so you spend less money on tows.  The SGS gliders provide a lot of tow income for clubs so theyre much more cost effective than the Juniors.The problem with the SGS is that people dont progress to glass and very few people progress to XC in the .,Gliding,d0jwy05,2,t5_2rfef

7902473,0,t3_4nggyp,US Glider pilot here Endorsements I dont know why logbook manufacturers have only one or two empty endorsement blocks for flight reviews.  Many pilots have a log book that has only a few dozen flights every year and when there are only two places for the . flight review those are used up after only a few pages of flight entries. I think that its awful that so many pilots have such flimsy log books.  the paperback ones are awful. I think that Tom Knauffs hardcover logbook is the best one around.  Before you go designing one of your own you should really look at this one ,Gliding,d44b9s3,1,t5_2rfef
8524860,0,t1_d674jv6,Can you explain what was wrong with that to someone who has only done a couple of air experience flights? My guess is when pitched straight down you gain too much speed too quickly and risk the wings perhaps? A normal spin doesnt increase your speed so fast?How you induced the stall was a lot less violent than I imagined  I was expecting a hammer head style move  ,Gliding,d6764mr,1,t5_2rfef
