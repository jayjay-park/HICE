4272164,0,t3_39rzxm,In our ED the scribes use whats referred to as a cheat sheet to help us keep track of what information has been entered into the system. On this sheet I jot down the name of the patient and more importantly the room number check off whether or not I have entered the lab results imaging results EKG physical exam and review of systems. I use Allscripts so Im not sure how different our systems are but I hope this helps! ,medicalscribe,cs76uth,2,t5_2z7w8

That said scribes have been paired with physicians in departments as varied as internistsGPspeds hospitalists cardiologists dermatologists GIs neurologists...really depends upon what the physician or physician group is looking to get out of scribe services. ,medicalscribe,cswnyph,1,t5_2z7w8

10269704,0,t1_dbjgiqn,I currently work for  manage an ED site for ScribeAmerica. Whenever I have this problem with my trainees and they are willing to put in the extra time I always give it to them. . every single time. I would much rather have someone who doesnt have the skills and WANTS to be there than someone who can type hella fast and doesnt give  shits about the job. Institutional failure to the max man. they shouldve def worked harder with you. ,medicalscribe,dc84l7n,3,t5_2z7w8
