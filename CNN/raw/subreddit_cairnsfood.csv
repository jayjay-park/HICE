If youre there for dinner expect a wait theyre very popular.PricingOn par with Cairns apparent benchmark of keep everything under  Ganbaranba is no different with most meals between the  and  mark.ServiceYou get a warm welcome when entering dont feel embaressed and if theres a spare table ready expect to be seated immediately. Someone will take your order which will be ready very quickly it is Ramen after all.StyleWhile I havent yet been to Japan to visit an authentic ramen house I have been told it is authentic enough slightly westernised but overall keeping the authentic theme. Small tables usually suited to singles doubles and a few four seaters. If youre thinking about bringing  people you wont be sitting together. But then again Ganbaranba isnt really a party restaurant.OverallThey serve ramen they also hand make gyoza highly recommended there isnt much to say other than if youre craving authentic Japanese ramen then this is definitely on the top of your list.,cairnsfood,cjlo990,1,t5_3273t
