8634449,0,t3_4y4dkl,It really depends on the industry kind of the company and its culture but from my experience I work for ParadisoLMS companies usually decide to try and eventually purchase our product when they begin to grow hire more employees or upgrade qualifications of existing employees. eLearning is the most effective and cheapest way to do it.Some companies also educate their customers and use LMSs as a lead nurturing tool.You can read more about the capabilities of LMSs and ways to choose it in our companys ebook here  ,elearning,d6kww3d,1,t5_2qhkz
10308005,0,t3_5nkhja,I use these in ILT but they could be using in WBT as well. How I do it is this. I break the class into teams. Usually when I use them its a process class or an ethics class. Something that has a clear process that you can flowchart. Ill have master cards and action cards. The master cards are for me the instructor. The action cards are for the learners. For a small class Ill have oe group but for large classes I break the class down into groups. I give an action card to each group. The action is like a scenario. The action cards are dealt out the group members. They are asked to place the action cards in the order that they should happen. Action cards can also branch off because sometimes there is more than one action. Think of a flowchart that has a if yes then and if no then kind of a structure. The teams are instructed to have the member who has the best card play it. There will be some debate among group members as to who has the best card to play. Then they are advised to take turns placing cards and to skip a turn if they dont have a card to place. After everyones done we play out some of the scenarios as a class. The key thing is to make sure each group has enough cards to complete the scenario. So keep them organized. If I were going to automate this which I havent done I could give a deck the participant and then present them with the action card. Have them play the cards in the right order. This is good for concept stuff that happens in sequence. Ive never done this in elearning because Ive really never had the opportunity. A good concept that I can think of is the ADDIE model. I could give a scenario and have them determine if its a training issue or not and then play the correct steps and throw in some more cards that include both right and wrong answers. You can also change the scenario part way through. Thats true if automated or not. You can always play another action card. Finally I dont call then Learning Battle Cards. Battle just doesnt seem like a good word for what they are. Ill call it TOPIC Playing Card Game. ,elearning,dccguv7,3,t5_2qhkz
