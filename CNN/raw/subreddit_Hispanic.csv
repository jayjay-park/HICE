5540997,0,t3_3r0ths,When will Latino become a race itself? We are clearly not White Asian Black or Native American we may be all of them as is my case but culturally we dont have a similar culture with any we kind of do our own thing. It is noteworthy the first Mestizo  NativeSpanish mix was born around  years ago isint it time to demand to be recognized by as a unique group of people since when was there a comitte saying only the  mentioned groups are a race? Well we were certainly not invited lol. Arent we all African? Like historians and archeologists speculate. Then there should only be African but no. Its time for Latino to be considered a race! Not doing so is simply divide and conquer. However Latinos are colorist and its an issue that needs to be addressed. Its time to transcend over the stats quo and unite to demand our recognition as a distinct race! ,Hispanic,cwjwsxz,-2,t5_2szlc

7833555,0,t3_4mm219,I think it has to do with tradition. I know a lot of Hispanics who arent really that devout but since abuelita is a fervent Catholic and your mom is you just go with it. They dont really choose to explore other denominations until someone presents other doctrine to them.,Hispanic,d3wk5h0,3,t5_2szlc

9527633,0,t3_5b98vk,So I dont really have an answer cause I find myself wondering the same thing. But heres my take youre the one that ultimately says yes or no right? Not your buddies teasing you. Arent you the one that identifies yourself as part of a group or not?I struggle with this cause Im very pale and  IrishFrenchBritish. But... my grandma was a Cordova from Puerto Rico and to say Im not at all Hispanic would be erasing her existence and Im not ok with that. She gave me life just as much as my other ancestors.Sure mi Espaol sucks. Is fluency of the language the ultimate test? I dont think so. Is it how many Hispanic friends you have? Uh that seems weird. Is it whether you celebrate Hispanic holidays? Well maybe the day to day influence of the culture has something to do with it. But there isnt a test you have to pass. If some fraction of your dna is from a Spanish influenced country and you want to say yes for me say yes. But others may have their own opinions.,Hispanic,d9nhde9,1,t5_2szlc
