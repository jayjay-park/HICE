1796840,0,t1_ck5lrsq,Yea unfortunately some charactersvns make for bad flairs. If its a character you want realllly badly we can try our hardest to get a flair out for them but itll be challenging to make flairs for a whole cast if the art doesnt work well with our small flair sizes.,The_Dvls_Advocate,ck5n1yn,1,t5_31gga
2259302,0,t3_2l2wqy,I wake up with a massive headache and head into the common room. I look around to see the others who I assume to be in the same situation as me. Thinking back on the words of our host I decide on the best course of action and speak up.So we cant kill each other at least not yet. That means anyone you betray can get you back making people angry is risky. For the time being Im going to stay neutral. I will consider all of you my allies. However if you betray my good will and attack me YOU WILL REGRET IT truth. I will no longer prioritize my own survival and instead make it my sole mission to ensure your demise. I will use any resources at my disposal to make sure you meet an unpleasant end. So lets get along for now at least.That said I understand not all of you will choose to avoid harming others. In light of this lets say Im not beyond being bribed. I wont declare anyone my enemy but if forced to pick sides between allies I will help whoever gives me the best offer. I hope no one takes this personally its just business. Despite what I said earlier I do want to survive this ordealAfter speaking my piece and sit down in a comfortable armchair and watch the faces of my allies as I await their response.,The_Dvls_Advocate,clqyykc,6,t5_31gga
2267824,0,t1_clrzepi,Yeah... I guess. I can understand you being shocked as well. ,The_Dvls_Advocate,cls0twx,4,t5_31gga
2267872,0,t1_cls0d9w,How could you even see my face when coming from behind? Oh wait someone might misinterpret that we should quiet down a little. As far as I can remember it was pretty dark too. I mean its alright if you want to succumb to the feminine wiles but you shouldnt spout such obvious lies.,The_Dvls_Advocate,cls11l1,5,t5_31gga

2300441,0,t1_clw1nv9,Id say here but mention it over there in case there are people who want to come read.Its not the most active subreddit and I feel like days of this would kinda clog it up especially for those without any real context,The_Dvls_Advocate,clw1uf6,6,t5_31gga
2306562,0,t1_clwt13i,Im really surprised everyone realised how evil I really was. Perhaps the flair was too much after all. I was considering Archer for a while but decided this was more suitable. ,The_Dvls_Advocate,clwt33g,6,t5_31gga
2487403,0,t1_cmj7v5r,Though not that much happens in the last twothree days of my route. I was locked out of all alliances barely had any information and no one was really helping me. If thats a concern to anyone else maybe we could choose two routes instead. Or would this cause more problems than it would solve?,The_Dvls_Advocate,cmj8pvb,2,t5_31gga
2541136,0,t1_cmq7x0j,Everything looks good about it to me. I did not find any mistakes when I checked the pastebin earlier and I dont see any formatting errors now that it is on the site.,The_Dvls_Advocate,cmq9ha6,4,t5_31gga
