242088,0,t1_cf549tp,Dude Valerie is SO awesome at A rank if you evolve her once she gets over  stats shes so frigging useful in tournaments id trade her for vermillion anytime!,quizrpg,cf5ueup,1,t5_2yccp
249997,0,t1_cf6cfg4,Yea I think its true too! Its so much easier to get red s trees than yellow. Yea definitely,quizrpg,cf6nzxp,1,t5_2yccp

273278,0,t1_cf6nzxp,Well basically today all I have done is run the  star level every time I had the natural MP regen.  Ive gotten  S Red  A red  S blue.  Not a single yellow.Ive ran it maybe  times.  I know this statistically is not a large sample and could just be an odd cluster of information but its honestly infuriating waiting an entire week to progress because of a bad run of luck. I wonder if deck composition that you go into the level with plays a part.  ,quizrpg,cf934q6,1,t5_2yccp
315686,0,t3_1vzh5i,Thank goodness for Infinite Obliesk!  I have an abundance of S trees thanks to it!  Now I need to actually get the other evo mats to drop and level up too so I can have the cost to support them all ,quizrpg,cfdhngr,1,t5_2yccp
957060,0,t1_chd1ug0,The most important traits youre looking for in spirits to build strong decks are healing answer skills and embleming special skills. In this event the only Spirits Im personally aiming for are a fully evolved Phina and an Elenoir but thats because I have pretty strong decks already.Kiannas medium HP heal makes her a good spirit for someone working their way up but her stats arent amazing and she wont ultimately end up in your decks. But shell help you get to those decks much like Baron. Hes fine up to his second evo but by the time you have the materials to evolve him to his final stage youve outgrown him.Rose is pretty junky  attacks in a row is just her regular attack divided by  but she might still be an okay holdover until you get better fires.  HP and  ATK are okay stats.I think Phina is your best bet and then work on grinding for a Kianna. If you get all of the spirits you need to evolve both of those then work on a Rose because why not?,quizrpg,chd2r80,2,t5_2yccp
958242,0,t1_chcyvq9,I would go with  yellow but its still a bit of a gamble if you get emblemtrolled.   I did my first run crystal with an extra Viela drop! but I got emblemtrolled early on in my second run and lost one of my spirits and then even after reviving got emblem trolled again for a total of  crystals used in that run.  This is one of the more difficult  star bosses in my opinion because the mobs can heal and are rarely water on your way up and then the final battle is the superboss with support spirits that can hit fairly hard and one of them makes your spirits weaker to water.My team is Aialt!FelichLenartCynthiaClaris though I am going to switch out Lenart with Cyrus for a third emblemer.   Theyre all maxed for reference.,quizrpg,chd7lrk,1,t5_2yccp

1537928,0,t3_2bucek,Yes its just luck. If you use red and face triple blue immediately its almost certain you will die. If you used yellow and get triple red in the first fight same. Just keep trying. ,quizrpg,cj91ykm,1,t5_2yccp
1823971,0,t1_ck8wmwk,Thank you.  I forgot to mention you need healers.  Its been so long since I lacked healers and it has become such a staple of all boss event strategies.,quizrpg,ck8z8cu,1,t5_2yccp

2136544,0,t1_clbdf0t,Maybe I was mistaken.  It was a few days ago when they reintroduced Rulbell into the mix.  I could have sworn they said in one line Invoke Rulbell and other spirits in preparation for gatedefenders.,quizrpg,clbegwl,1,t5_2yccp
