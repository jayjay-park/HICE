1015296,0,t3_25q4ao,Im so disgusted that rcommunism is controlled by this group of sick cultists.  It is a stupid meaningless section of a stupid website but still bothers me for some reason.  I guess because it is how Stalinist have been able to lay claim to the word communism aided and abetted by procapitalists who want communism to be Stalinism.   Is there a way to overthrow a sub?  ,leftcommunism,chjp2sj,13,t5_2tx0h

2140863,0,t3_2jhjpo,the struggles it will likely see will be mainly due to scarcity or decisions based on the resources availablenot available Along with things such as natural disasters international crises etc which we have nowOnce needs have been fulfilled what is done with surplus resources will need to be looked at. Possibly enough to give more to everyone and if not what should be done with the remainder. Distribution will change rapidly and will need to be looked at often either due to good or bad harvests new resources being found or a resource running low. There will need to be a process in which this is handled over a wide area to designate what would be the better methods of distribution to each community. ,leftcommunism,clby8s3,3,t5_2tx0h

5368615,0,t1_cvxo83k,Something like that. Just a synopsis. Heres an example of a similar description. No idea if this is adequate lets just edit until were happy with it or draw up something new. Mostly lifted from marxists.orggtLeft Communism refers to those Marxists who supported the  Russian Revolution i.e. the uprising of the peasants and workers but differed with the Bolsheviks over a number of issues including the formation of the Soviet government in the U.S.S.R. the reformist tactics of the Comintern rd International in Europe and America the role of autonomous and spontaneous organisations of the working class as opposed to the political parties participation in Parliament the relationship with the conservative trade unions and the trade union leadership. There are two main currents of left communism on one hand the Council Communists the term used by the Dutch and German left communists after  who criticised the elitist practices of the Bolshevik Party and increasingly emphasised the autonomous organisations of the working class reminiscent in some ways of the anarchosyndicalists and left communists of the preWorld War One period rejecting compromise with the institutions of bourgeois society and the dictatorship over the proletariat. The main point of difference with the Bolsheviks was over the role of the Party and the workers state concept. On the other hand there were UltraLeft communists especially some of the English and the Italians who upheld the role of a Party in leading the working class but criticised the Bolsheviks for various forms of opportunism such as advocating participation in Parliament and the conservative trade unions.,leftcommunism,cvxwfpd,2,t5_2tx0h

That is not how you get communism. what moves the world toward communism is the completion of worldwide capitalist modernisationindustrialisationwhatever and its stagnation and decline. it really does not matter what the identity or political allegiance of the president is to working people because political positions arent the vehicle of historytldr bernard is obama mk.  it wont make a substantial difference to your lifel,leftcommunism,cz1gye8,14,t5_2tx0h
6370752,0,t1_czdryn7,I would say that it was the end of the bourgeois revolutions and the beginning of an independent proletarian movement more of the latter than the former depending on where.  The point Im trying to make is that unlike the bourgeois revolutions which were localised took effect in different places often centuries apart and in part were in fact due to an expansion of capital and accumulation into new territories proletarian revolutions were rather more international and took place closer to each other in time frame with geographical location being secondary because of the international ties that capitalism has created.  ,leftcommunism,czds8v9,1,t5_2tx0h

7052976,0,t1_d1fqzry,gtBecause we are taking the concepts that are within dialectical materialism Marxs methods generally and idealizing them trying to apply them to wherever we think they can fit.Im not sure I understand totally what you mean. You say that Marx applied his method of analysis to economics and sociology and that it worked out great but that when other people try to do the same thing with other things its idealism.

7407520,0,t1_d2k69d0,gthe basically outlines how completely inadequate current organisational structures are at handling any potential changes in what their systems may spit up. He really does go into all systems in an abstract methodological sense dealing with how layers can interact with other layers to generate more and more system complexity and how current manangerial structures basically ignore this complexityThats all well and good but the glaring issue with this is that something like this can easily be put to use making a corporation like Walmart or Tesco or something more efficient. This kind of wastecutting efficiency maximizing organizational restructuring is every capitalists wet dream. Youll never get communism out of efficient planning or powerful computing. gtHis analyses speaks so much to the inadequacy of this system in doing anything but causing bureaucratic institutional misery The most heinous kind that its proponents and readers i.e people who get what hes saying are fundamentally heterodox to the establishmentWhile Im no fan of sprawling labyrinthine bureaucracy I cant help but see this sort of technofetishist dream as equally dangerous. I dont see much difference in having your job and work quotas assigned to you by some faceless bureaucrat versus an equally faceless computer. gtbut it communism remains an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence. Hopefully that shows how little we can truly claim to know on what to do. And moreover how much more demands knowing.Wow way to totally butcher that Marx quote. Ive seen tankies on rsocialism make the same misquotation and this is particularly egregious. You really ought to realize here that Marx is saying that communism isnt an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself. You talk about limits on what we know and Marx is certainly something you know little about. Also word of advice theres the enter key on your keyboard for a reason.

8410029,0,t3_4uttww,I think this framework of competing ahistorical ideologies being lined up side by side can lead you straight into the shit to begin with. Theres a question raised by the questions. What are Leninism and Left Communism and whateverthefuckelseism where did they come from?Leninism became a thing when codified in Stalins Foundations of Leninism. He called it the Marxism of the era of imperialism  revolution others would call it the ideological expression of the counterrevolution. That was its moment. Left communism became a thing vaguely and broadly in reaction to and as a part of the dreary circumstances thrown up by the th centurys flops. The figures you mentioned Bordiga and Pannekoek and so on were directly a part of that movement. They critiqued the USSR they critiqued Leninism and to do was to critique capital as well without the obfuscations of the Communist International. Which meant returning to the critique of political economy. This is the reason Marx gets the attention he does. Exposing actual political economy as a sham developing and following the commodity as use valueexchange value to all its ugly conclusions isolating the sale of labour power not labour as the crucial point which gives the game way is what you get from Marx that the others failed to do.The point is that the historical moment of left communism was last century. The USSR is done and so is Leninism. But so is left communism. Repackaging it now as it was except for online identificiation purposes where historical baggage can linger forever is superfluous. What the ultra left should signify now is a refusal to get stuck in historical games Who betrayed who? but what if x? which amount to little more than masturbation and that despite considerably different circumstances now the critique of political economy is depressingly as relevant as it ever was. Being able to say that much and not get lost in ideological bullshit is enough to be branded ultra left. People may disagree Im probably full of it but Id suggest leaving the historical writers for later and reading Dauves Eclipse and Reemergence particularly Leninism and the Ultra Left andor Endnotes History of Separation. The former would probably answer your actual questions too now that I remember those. ,leftcommunism,d5ssqww,28,t5_2tx0h

9261748,0,t3_55qbdp,Counciists are opposed to unions and parties at least as is typically understood. Councilists wish to merge the two to in time of revolutionary fervor organize workers into revolutionary unions so to speak. They want these unions to carry out the role of the party while still maintaining their link to the proletariat by still being part of the work environment itself thus avoiding the separation between the vanguard and proletariat as happens under Leninism.
