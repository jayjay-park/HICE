4247800,0,t3_39kstp,Im sorry I cant do a video as away from house but try this. Add a shape and make it a rectangle of the size you want the circle to expand to. Go to fx and mask and set it to clip next module. Now add a shape and make it a circle. This will be the circle as it looks before expanding. Place it within the rectangle. Now add a global and make it an onoff switch. Call it circle if you like. Add a touch setting to the circle when you press it it will activate your global circle. Now add an animation to the circle I think its scale in you need. Set the animation to trigger when your global circle  is activated. Make sure that the scaling animation is set to a high enough percentage to fully cover the rectangle. Now hopefully when you press the circle it should expand to fill the rectangle. Let me know if not and will try and figure out whats going on ,kustom,cs4fu5c,3,t5_37c31

7330023,0,t3_4ek6nv,Besides what uEnglandsfinest said maybe you could try setting an animation on formula with something like     ifmistate!playing   and have the animation set to fade out or something. For the messaging I think youd have to use some Tasker integration for that. Having unread messages show up might be a little tricker but making a notification of sorts in KLWP with Tasker when you receive a text messageread the message shouldnt be difficult and I believe there are tutorials on it. ,kustom,d2bdh1v,1,t5_37c31
7439275,0,t3_4h4dbf,Looks like a bug. I know there is a limitation with touch areas always being rectangles. But I have never noticed a complete offset like this before... I think your best bet is to position each icon where you want it to be and then rotate them individually. Nice theme by the way I like the angled scroll. ,kustom,d2nsq01,1,t5_37c31

8845339,0,t3_5195wm,In this case when you are using bitmaps as icons you would write an IF function that outputs either the file path or global variable of the correct iconHeres the global variable version. Add  bitmap global variables one for each icon you want.. Add a bitmap module and place it where you want it.. Checkmark the Bitmap setting and select the calculator icon in the top right.. Select the empty area of the bitmap setting and enter this kode into the formula editorifbrtasker tvariable   gvbitmap gvbitmapampnbspRemember to edit the variable names and number to your situationThe IF function basically states If the tasker variable named tvariable equals  then display the global variable named bitmap otherwise display the global variable named bitmap.,kustom,d7b31ub,1,t5_37c31

11645039,0,t1_dgfy9mm,Ah I think I get what youre after.  Thats why you were going to clip it down to a single digit...the only thing I noticed that I didnt specifically mention in the notes is that your last attributethe if statement isnt in double quotes.  Thats required for the for loop to work.  Which is what was giving me so much goddamned trouble with concatenating text.  That change would explain why ifdfHmm cistart gtdfHmm   works when isolated.  Its not relying on the quotes for the fl to process.  Doesnt explain why it works with lt but not gt though.EDIT  FIGURED IT OUT! I thinkIf statements!    ifvariable gt variable then elseThis has three attributes.  The conditional the true return value and the false return value.  Your if statement only has two attributes.  The conditional the true return value.    ifvariable gt variable thenWeve misunderstood what happens when youre missing an attribute though. It seems that the true return value is not the attribute that is retained when dropping an attribute.  Its the false return value that remains.  So the if statement actually looks like this    ifvariable gt variable elseThats why it works when you change the greater thanless than sign.  You can test it by adding the attribute to your if statement.  Try    ifvariable gt variable NULL elseand you should get something like NULLNULL instead of nothing.,kustom,dgfz92i,1,t5_37c31
