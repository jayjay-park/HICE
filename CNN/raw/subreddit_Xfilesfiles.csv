1729542,0,t1_cjwzdzz,I think the episode proves that this show doesnt hold up without the combination of Mulder and Scully together. Even in episodes where their only interaction is on the phone Duchovny and Anderson make it work. No one really wants to see Mulder running around without Scully and certainly no one wants to see him making out with some random vampire chick.That aside the episode is just bad. The story in and of itself is terrible. What does Mulder even think hes going to accomplish here? Maybe I feel this strongly because I didnt see this episode until after I had already seen Seasons  amp  maybe even FTF and they started showing reruns on FX beginning with the pilot so I was able to catch up with the episodes Id missed. After seeing how amazing the show is watching  is pretty damn dreadful.,Xfilesfiles,cjx699u,1,t5_322o9
1750366,0,t1_cjzhdpq,Agreed.  Especially El Rey.  Its like one big horrible movie channel with some XFiles episodes thrown in. But I kinda like it.,Xfilesfiles,cjzsizl,2,t5_322o9

2019441,0,t1_cjk8frj,I mean for all intents and purposes she was pretty hot. Is that sexist? Yes. But what I really think was going on is that the producers were tring to circumvent the platonic relationship between Mulder and Scully with letting Mulder have a love interest for an episode. Oh hey guys I have a super hot girlfriend who wouldnt mind working. Thus . ,Xfilesfiles,ckwjez6,1,t5_322o9
2194594,0,t1_clingm1,Agreed.  I tend to break up the podcast myself just pausing as needed.  One of the best parts of the podcast is that all of the discussion for two episodes are completely self contained in that one cast.  Watch two episodes listen to one xfilesfiles rinse repeat.,Xfilesfiles,clisc2n,3,t5_322o9
2294275,0,t3_2lfkwz,Agreed with everybody  this was a really great episode of the show well Anasazi was at least and a really great episode of the podcast.  Really enjoyed Devins insights on the MJ  documents and the other real conspiracies.  Also I had a thought about Scully being shot at in Mulders apartment that Id never considered before  what if they werent trying to shoot Mulder at all?  What if whomever was watching his apartment shot at Scully and missed on purpose to try and scare her off to deter her from helping Mulder?  A warning shot across the bow so to speak.  All the stuff with Mulders dad is great and Skinner putting Mulder in a headlock like a champ.  And CSMs burn it! at the end  holy shit what a badass.  All you baby philes will never know the anguish of having to wait all summer to find out how Mulder was going to make it out of that boxcar.  Excruciating!  Oh yeah going back to Our Town  the guy who played the sheriff shows up again in the first movie.  And I know Devin mentioned Scully not having much to do in that episode but was I the only one thinking the opposite?  They dredge up a giant net full of bones in the river and Scullys the only pathologist!  I kept waiting for her to have a Bad Blood moment and snap at Mulder do you seriously expect me to identify all these remains?  By myself?  Mulder I didnt even get to finish my bucket of chicken!,Xfilesfiles,clvaeep,7,t5_322o9

Her theory is that UFOs are actually nocturnal insect swarms passing through electrical air fields.Scully Her name is Bambi? ,Xfilesfiles,cnitq5k,8,t5_322o9
2871316,0,t1_cnufs0k,lol yeah!!!Although let me give a possible point of further legitimacy to the exXFiles crew wearing XFiles tshirts on the SPN set XFiles stopped filming in Vancouver after its th season in . So it was like  or  years later of XFiles either not being on location in Vancouver or canceled amp the Van crew on the SPN set were still wearing XFiles tshirts proudly! Prometheus does literally show up in an ep of SPN yes! lol. Although to be fair the XFiles ep titled Post Modern Promotheus was meant metaphorically I think. Also the ep of SPN featuring Prometheus was a bit lackluster imo... The XFiles episode with vampire amp Luke Wilson  the episode Bad Blood. I likened it to SPNs episode Tall Tales because it follows a similar comedic format of the actors acting out their partners hyperbolic perceptions of them during a retelling of the past hopefully that makes sense there lol.The sunflower seeds throw at Ronnie amp Ronnies need to pick them up though? That whole concept got transplanted into another episode of Supernatural called Clap Your Hands If You Believe which HOLY SHIT I FORGOT THIS. This episode SE literally spoofs XFiles directly with this unique second introduction.Enjoy! DEdit in terms of source I used to be a hardcore XPhile AOL chatrooms back in the day what uuuuup!!!lol amp the only other show Ive ever been as into since XFiles wasis Supernatural.,Xfilesfiles,cnugwpr,1,t5_322o9
