11223083,0,t3_606i72,I had a game similar to this exept everyone only had smite and either flash or tp no one told me the jungler about this and shaco stole my jg to the point that I had to tell him to stay at Blue side while I stay at red side. Everyone had Jungle items except or mid lane Brand who along with myself and the adc carried the game with their bot lane destroyed. But good job there.Also have tou heard of snipit? Its already installed on your computer and it takes screenshots so you dont have to take a picture of the monitor.Edit just noticed that you went AP Nautilus and got fed. Thats something you dont see everyday,LeagueofFailures,df44f9t,1,t5_3izie
