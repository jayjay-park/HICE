2272451,0,t3_2l8g19,Guys.  Keep in mind This is for a soundtrack.  This isnt a song Chvrches wrote and then had featured in a movie its a song they wrote for the movie.  Sometimes  they have to write music outside of their sound or comfort zone because this is a part of a score not a bside to the Bones Of What You Believe.All in all  its a very good song.  I just woke up but Im excited to hear a higher quality audio copy.,chvrches,clsle40,6,t5_2vsur

7277962,0,t1_d250qcw,Soon well no longer see them performing at these festivals in daylight.  They did headline the SPIN party at last months SXSW and demonstrated that they deserved the spot even after following the Deftones. The freakin DEFTONES! Yes it was a cool gig.,chvrches,d25gezr,3,t5_2vsur

8248267,0,t1_d57q50c,Not a huge fan of the one for Gun tbh it looks very cool but its still of the band members playing instruments variety  I prefer ones that tell a story like this one Empty Threat or Clearest Blue.,chvrches,d58l7wh,1,t5_2vsur
8385282,0,t1_d5paofs,I was there too and met the band afterward as they came out. I just got back from the Block Party where they just killed it.,chvrches,d5ppinl,1,t5_2vsur

9493074,0,t3_5aocpk,Eh its okay. Im not a huge fan of this electronic genre but I am also surprised that the label didnt want it it seems like the perfect remix for them to release kinda like the Clearest Blue Gryffin remix which got a bit popular when it came out.,chvrches,d9j83cq,2,t5_2vsur
9583506,0,t3_5c2h0r,First of all yes people who vote for Trump are at least by association racist and misogynistic because they vote for a candidate who is. Its called endorsing.Secondly as was said elsewhere Lauren has free speech and if what she says offends you well tough shit. I know your candidate is against the first amendment but it is still enforced in the EU and the US. So you can whine all you want its not going to change anything.,chvrches,d9ud28q,21,t5_2vsur

11790906,0,t3_682k1i,I really like the version of this song I think its really cool how they can translate the song so well into something more acoustic. The video is also not bad but I expected a bit more its really quite pointless. Especially for something which is meant to be supporting a cause it was really just another stupid glittery video attempting to pass itself off as profound and it also really just focused on Lauren which is annoying. The lack of a connection to the project and actual meaninglessness bugs me. What does closeup shots of Laurens face and hands have to do with supporting safe sex education and procedures for women in tough positions?,chvrches,dgwjesw,2,t5_2vsur
