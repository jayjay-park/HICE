5817052,0,t1_cxi3reu,They are positioned next to my aquarium which has lights enough for live aquatic plants I should probably try to rig up another light. I have a  liquid fertilizer which I keep meaning to use on them. I am failing them they are overrun by pests they need to be repotted and I am not providing adequate lightfood. ,indoorgardening,cxi5rec,1,t5_2upc2

9177358,0,t3_56019f,It may be because you overwatered it. Or because you watered it the same amount and it is getting less sunlight shorter days here in the Northern Hemisphere.I would scoop the mold off adjust your watering and see if it come back. If it does find a new variable to adjust new pot different soil fertilizer etc..,indoorgardening,d8fapkl,1,t5_2upc2

11212195,0,t3_601rv2,I learned on this same sub that spider plants are actually super picky about the water the want! Unwanted chemicals like chlorine can make the tips brown. If your using tap water let it sit out for a day or two before hand. This lets any chemicals like chlorine dissolve ,indoorgardening,df2w12a,3,t5_2upc2
11262774,0,t1_df8lcd5,I have  plants if not more. Currently they are in a small space between my desk and my partners. I dont think I can increase the area. I am open to dispering them through the house my problem then becomes lighting for each. Since I do not have windows all over and even then my windows are typically not open seeing as how we dont have sun most of the time.The current wattage iswas its on its deathbed afterall W. Im certainly not against increasing just not sure the implications of either. I understand it would be more power and simulate more full sun conditions just dont know if there isnt something else Im not considering.,indoorgardening,df8magt,2,t5_2upc2
11277118,0,t1_df9xb6k,Will do. The sun is coming back so if I get a decent enough income for summer I might be able to do it but doubt it. Will probably get a single light before summers end. Heres to hoping,indoorgardening,dfa8tug,2,t5_2upc2
