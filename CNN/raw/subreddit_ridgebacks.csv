994185,0,t3_25g1sc,My ridgeback  yo neutered male usually stays away from small dogs. He knows how large he is and what he can do to them so he usually shys away from smaller dogs. The only issue I have had with him is at the dog park. He has never ever started a fight. But if any med to large dog makes any attempt to dominate him trying to mount him or putting there head over his shoulders it is ON and over in about  sec. Large dobiesshepherdsboxerslabshuskies he has even been double teamed a couple of times by dogs the live together. These are not fights but brief domination spats. No dog has ever dominated him or put him on his back in about  attempts. These dogs are bad ass dont mess with them and they wont mess with you. He also plays with a lot of other dogs and breeds just fine as long as they do not attempt to dominate him. I also had a female for  years she was a very timid dog and was never in a fight never bit anyone of my  kids that grew up with her. My male has also never bit anyone.You just need to watch them all the time at a dog park those are like a prison yards. He has lived with a  yo lbs yellow lab for  years now with no fights. Best breed I have ever been around. ,ridgebacks,chhanz7,3,t5_2tw6i

4647114,0,t1_ctfmb9g,In Rhodesians you are correct the autosomal gene is also why the chance of having a ridgeless rhodesian is   .. However as I was speaking to non rhodesianthai ridgebacks the gene for a ridged back is recessive and rare. This rare gene can create a pattern of hair growing in reverse but generally without the highly distinct pattern of the Rhodesian or patterns of the Thai. ,ridgebacks,ctgbzdk,0,t5_2tw6i
4741849,0,t3_3fsnkq,Mine doesnt hate it but it does make her vomit. I give her either Dramamine regular people Dramamine or Cerenia before a car ride and then she is good to go. We tried a Thundershirt just for the hell of it and I dont think it made much of a difference in her comfort level.,ridgebacks,cts96d0,1,t5_2tw6i
9022936,0,t3_53l02m,Thank you to everyone who replied!! Im so happy that exercise is not as insane as I had originally pictured with the image people are always throwing out saying theyre dogs bred to run  miles a day in the Sahara and such.Im starting to love this breed so much more.Does anyone know some good breeders in possibly CentralSouthern California? I would like to meet some people maybe meet the dogs be put on a waiting list. I just want a dog that is loyal aloof with strangers loves to exercise solid  hours of exercise minimum more on certain days possibly minimal shedding and HEALTHY! This breed seems to fill those spots in wonderfully.Thanks so much for the amazing answers! ,ridgebacks,d7wez4y,1,t5_2tw6i
