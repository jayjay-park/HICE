3340811,0,t1_cp91w1w,. Placing the door forces Minecraft to recalculate all the villages ergo it would mess EVERYTHING up. I definitely wont be a happy camper if that happens but I trust everyone to not do anything stupid. . I can build it close to the build limit so it wont be that unsightly should we decide to build anything under it. Though personally Id argue against the desert being the location of the marketplace because deserts make trees grass and greenery look sad and dilapidated. Id personally suggest somewhere near Smittys place or a little ways off by the coast but we can have it not interrupt the marketplace design save for the lack of doors but markets are supposed to be open spaces anyway right?. All in all this is a pretty simple design. The other design I linked goes pretty high compared to the Titan and is wide enough to affect the design of the market. If we build the Titan at build limit then have it just drop the iron to a small storage system the footprint of the thing would basically be the storage system well be having for it and the splotch of shadow on the ground. . Id argue that this is more of a playstyle thing and that people would be free to not use the system the same way that they are free to not create a blacksmith villager with perfect trades pair it with another villager with a decent breadcarrotpotato trade and just churn out loads of diamond gear on the spot. What were just doing here is giving more people the option to do things they wont be able to do with resource constraints the way they are. Alternatively people who cant be on all the time to mine wouldnt be too left behind by other players. Wed basically free players to focus on whatever their talents are in Minecraft say aesthetic building redstoning PvP or just plain grinding furthering their engagement with the server beyond i haz more things and basically performing another real life job grinding within a game thats supposed to be a getaway from that sort of thing. Just my opinion though. Minecraft is a very accommodating game when it comes to playstyles and we can make the necessary accommodations like locking out people who want to use mined iron instead of the farm via Lockette ,VanillaPlus,cp92s4u,1,t5_36lb8
