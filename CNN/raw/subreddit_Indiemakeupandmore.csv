107248,0,t3_1vaz1k,One of the things about the indie world that frustrates me so much is how much of a break people are willing to give and how many indie owners use that to their advantage. Because its a small world and both owners and customers tend to hang out in the same corners of the internet the lines cross and it becomes harder to demand what youve paid for because theyre so nicefriendlyhaving personal problemswhatever. I feel bad for you that this situation has arisen but I cant feel sympathy for a business owner who has been running and I use that term loosely her  business by the skin of its teeth for a year at least now. And she always has some bullshit but plausible excuse. The time has come for people to stop giving her the benefit of the doubt  she cant get her shit together and other people are out financially because of it. ,Indiemakeupandmore,ceqn44s,15,t5_2w8pb

151102,0,t1_cevmz4g,It really depends with the post office I have dropped things off and its taken about  business days to update or no updates at all and then it just finds its way. Sometimes I am about  days behind schedule only because I ship out the next business day and because of my work and school schedule its normally past the time the post office closes so it shows as  hours. But with USPS its nothing but normal for it to either take no time at all or a lot of time. I have over  packages that havent updated that have been dropped off from Friday but I like to say its the holiday weather and weekend all combined.

194216,0,t3_1wa8wf,Offering my two cents as a buyer not a seller. This has already been said but good customer service is key. Also communication and HONESTY. I really hate it when indie stores say their TAT is going to be one thing then jerk you around for weeks  Id rather just get an email that says Hey your order is running a bit behind but it will be out soon! than get the neverupdated ClicknShip tracking number of doom.                    As for the actual shop having really good swatches helps a lot. If you lack the skillsequipment to take good swatch photos you might be able to team up with a blogger for that  products in exchange for use of their photos. Speaking of bloggers as your company is starting out it might be nice to offer a discounted blogger sampler pack for purchase  a lot of indies do it and its a good way to encourage people to write about your brand on their blogs which is good for your business!                 This is not a must but having creativelythemed collections and fun packaging sometimes encourages me to buy things. When I say fun packaging that could even mean something as simple as a cool illustrated sticker on the jar  just something to make it stand out.  Oh and samples  it doesnt need to be a lot but including a couple little sample baggies or clamshells with the order makes people happy and sometimes encourages them to want to try new stuff from your product line.,Indiemakeupandmore,cf0k8r5,4,t5_2w8pb

318871,0,t1_cfdrqka,I guess in the end yes. However its more a matter of communication and seeing an authentic personality on the other end. Bigger companies have social media outlets but theyre geared for PR purposes. With indie companies youre seeing the owner and maybe the few people theyve hired. A fair few of them probably started as a hobby and then enough close friendsfamily encouraged them to sell their product and now they just happen to be cool people who get to make money off of what started as a hobby or experiment. Their personal interests and artistry get put into the work and we know this because they are out out there talking about things they love and being normal people on the internet as well as company owners.I understand that maybe not every indie company is like that but the companies that are are the ones I tend to order fromTLDR You get to know indie owners through social media and see how their personality integrates into the products they make.

I woke up the next day and my skin was very hydrated! Its worth noting that I did get a cystic pimple for the first time in a while but I cant tell if that was hormones or another factor which it easily could have been.

352192,0,t3_1y3who,Point of Interest is a blog that I found through this sub that has been really helpful to me in understanding the creation process. Like others have said it would be wise to worry about getting your process nailed down before you even think about selling. If you get too far ahead of yourself its easy to get sloppy and earn a less than stellar reputation... Also as far as your repackaging concern people can correct me if Im horribly wrong but Im fairly certain repackaging is literally taking micas as you bought them and selling them as your own creation. The proper thing to do would be to blend different micas together with a base you create and adding oxidesultramarines ect. to come out the other end with something totally unique. ,Indiemakeupandmore,cfh9t57,8,t5_2w8pb

541886,0,t3_20ce5y,Pretty Zombie Cosmetics are the brand that started me thinking about this  they make a purple matte lipstick that I really want to try but it really bothers me that the owner so blatantly ripped off My Pretty Zombie brand name.It may seem small to others but this isnt imitation for flattery but IMO a deliberate attempt to rip off the original brand and trick consumers I actually got really confused about the difference back when. What just makes it so much worse is Andrea from MPZ is lovely and her products are truly fantastic which almost illogically just makes it that much more unacceptable IMO.What do you guys think?Fyrinnae is now on my nobuy list  they make great products but I dont want to have to deal with their sporadic closing and awful customer service again and am  sure I can find dupes for everything I like from them. Id still recommend them though since theres nothing inherently wrong with their products or their company. Update I literally just placed my farewell order with them and added a little note basically saying that as I already have lots of their shadows would they mind the complimentary shadow being one I didnt already have then I listed half a dozen options their reply nope cant do that thanks for buying from us anyway! UghProject Undefined or anything by Emily Whitcher really she just seems like a big bag of crazy to start with steals photos sells potentially unsafe cosmetics and so many other things  this post explains the deals of her sketchiness. Im not even on the fence about this  she and her products dont seem to have any redeeming features.And finally I know Lime Crime is going to come up probably a lot but heres my c on why actually even though theyre one of the most widely disliked indies I personally dont actually have a huge problem with themSure she repackaged once  I have a problem that she lied about it definitely but IMO there are SO many repacked products in the world not just cosmetics that are sold infinitely higher just because someone stuck a brand name on them. This is a moot point for me since honestly if a brand I liked and trusted was selling repackaged mica and I knew this Id probably rather buy it from them in small sizes and practical jars etc at a higher cost than have to deal with bulk supplier pages which I find overwhelming. The lipgloss hair  yup gross but after all wasnt it just one product one time? I mean shit happens  its so much better if it doesnt but one hair isnt enough to turn me off a company or restaurant forever. Ive spent a lot of time on farmsfirst aid situations and just am not particularly squeamish so I think this might just be a personal thing. The whole racist China Doll add  without going into too much detail I just can not see it as being racist tacky and obvious yes but derogatory to south east asian people and cultures? Nope. It may or may not be relevant to mention Im partially Chinese grew up there and travel there a lot. At this point it just feels like a witch hunt to me.Having said that her products are overpriced overhyped and she doesnt seem like the most sincere person so I wouldnt buy from her again but Im not morally upset with myself that I knowingly bought something from her.,Indiemakeupandmore,cg1vaep,38,t5_2w8pb

Their etsy is closed at the moment and I havent yet bought an unscented full size so Im not quite sure about that. I do expect that Id be able to smell the ingredients I think there was something in the description about the scent being added to cancel out the ingredient smell.Silk Naturals has a cream foundation which I dont think has any added fragrances but I havent tried it myself.

685865,0,t3_220r1r,For practical information about the order These were a personal gift from a friend but I think the post still falls under the purchased category let me know if it doesnt so I can flair accordingly. The order was placed on March th and arrived yesterday. That means there was a total of four days between the order being placed and it arriving in my mailbox. The samples  are th teaspoon so I do consider these to be actual samples rather than mini versions in a bag. Having used them once Id say each sample is good for  looks. I dont own any of the mattes in full sizes but from what I can tell on the website it is likely the same jaramount as the nonmatte full sizes. Now I did receive these as contest winnings from Dawn and you can see how packed the full sizes are. After removing the sifter I turned some of them upside down and it didnt even budge.  The matte prices are double what the other colors are  for a sample vs. . . for a full size vs. . so they do seem quite pricey alongside the other offerings. They have some discounts if you purchase entire sets pastels neutrals smokey eyes all the samples or full sizes in multiples of .  Domestic shipping is . for orders under . and free otherwise. International shipping at least to the UK I just tested it out now seems to be a flat rate of ..  For actual information about the products   As I noted in the last picture they do have a teeny tiny bit of sparkle for some of the darker colors in the swatches. Im using cranberry and dark taupe right now on my eyes and cant seem to find anything shiny. Im also wearing cream and peach. All of these colors apply and blend well. They dont look or feel like chalk or dirt and theyre not powdery. I dont have any information about wear time yet but in general Im not the best person to ask for that sort of information everything sticks to my eyelids especially flakes of skin... I digress. Ill update if they disappear after  hours though! Initial thoughts  I feel like I have been doing life wrong. I stupidly have misplaced my camera in the mess I call my room so no pictures sorry! but Im wearing them right now and... Why dont I own more mattes? I know the website is unwieldy organized by collection with no option to view by color but the mattes are conveniently all on this page which I think everyone should at least check out.As always feel free to ask any questions. ,Indiemakeupandmore,cgi8ft8,7,t5_2w8pb

The lime is less prominent in the solid with more of an emphasis on the salt and milk. ,Indiemakeupandmore,chlizai,2,t5_2w8pb

However I put on teensy dabs of both Thunderstorm and Snow when I posted originally for the sake of accuracy and also because I hadnt played with them for a while and while theres not a lot of throw on either of them I can still smell them both.  Its been about  minutes and my skin chemistry is not kind to fragrances particularly alcoholbased ones so the fact that I can still smell them at all is kind of a big deal.

To hold that off a tiny bit of vitamin E tocepherol acetate in the oil would be ideal.

1446120,0,t1_cixiwoj,Ikeas shipping prices are beyond insane. Ill bet you find something eventually especially if you think outside the box. Im glad your masters is going well! While I was in college the accreditation board for pharmacy schools changed the rules and all classes below me were required to obtain like  unpaid internship hours. It was also the only college in the university that required a lot of shadowing and volunteering. Theyre also trying to move toward mandatory year programs instead of  and year residencies for everyone not just clinical pharmacists. Its getting out of hand. You might as well be a medical doctor. ,Indiemakeupandmore,cixjpqu,2,t5_2w8pb
1447375,0,t1_cixl0q2,Eye shadow gradients are harder to do on a gel mani than a regular gradient with regular nail polish.  Once you put on the eye shadow a really thin layer sticks to the residue.  You cant push this shadow around to smudge or blend it.  If you try to add more shadow on top of this layer it doesnt stick.  After I did the initial three stripes I put on and cured another layer of topcoat then just put the top and bottom colors on my nails bringing them pretty far into the middle.  I sealed that layer then put the middle color on trying to only get the smallest  amount to overlap the other two colors.  So its sort of a faked gradient.  The colors arent blended on my nails.  Theyre in layers of different opacity.Does that make any sense?,Indiemakeupandmore,cixpdfi,1,t5_2w8pb

2166801,0,t3_2js0zq,When I get them I try to keep my delighted squeals to a minimum. And then grab my scale coin and take all the photos. And then delete at least half because you can see the shipping label. One day Ill learn to black those out before taking photos.When it comes to application I usually do an arm swatch first and always in the daytime  I take a look under artificial light and then another look outside. A lot of sparkle and duochrome shades seem to come up much better in sunlight. I usually do a little patch of primer a little patch of NYX Milk and bare skin between and when I get it a little patch of Glitter Glue for each one  that way I can also check the spacing before I find out that I do not have enough arm. And then put the colours over the top to photograph. The hardest part honestly is getting the angles right for duochromes!For using them I usually have a few specific looks in mind but I also like to play a little and see what looks good. Shiros Remake for example doesnt look half bad as an allover lid colour bordered with a warm taupe or brown.For lip swatches  use a balm to remove any lip colour between swatches and use your phones back camera in front of a mirror better quality usually. Take your time with the photos. I havent done any lip swatches in sunlight but I dont have any glittery lip products that I feel will look truer to colour in sunlight. Perfumes I find are the hardest to do. I have to do them one at a time and in my last order I had a few days where I couldnt test them because I had hayfever and couldnt smell anything.,Indiemakeupandmore,clf91iq,1,t5_2w8pb

2214942,0,t3_2khjkz,Short answer Yes. Long answer Yes. But as others have said youll need a sticky primer. I sort of also think that duochromes and arcanes are slightly different at least In my head lol. I think of the traditional duochrome as a base colour with an overlay  which is quite evident and whilst the arcanes do have a base you may not see the colour changedifference until the right angle of lightlight source changes. Youll also get different hues between base and secondary base colour if that makes sense. Im sure theres some sort of magic about particle size or coating that Im glossing over but..Im going with that explanation lol.,Indiemakeupandmore,clldeyd,3,t5_2w8pb

My opinion is that if you truly believe and feel passionate about something you make you want it to be presented to others in its best form possible. Sometimes I see listings on etsy where its obvious the store owner put about five minutes effort into listing their product. The pictures will be blurry or dimly lit snapped quickly with a cell phone camera the product is shot on their dining room table or crookedly and messily swatched  When I see listings like that I think You dont seem to care much about your product so why should I?,Indiemakeupandmore,clnldf5,5,t5_2w8pb

2331638,0,t1_clzuiwd,I find GG much easier to use then PE tbh. In my experience its hard to blend sometimes over PE and you absolutely have to wait for it to dry fully otherwise it ends up getting patchy and I dont find that to be the case with GG.I think Ladyhawke can suit a variety of skin tones because the teal shift is so strong over a sticky base. It is more subtle without it but it also works well as a transition shade.,Indiemakeupandmore,clzwjj7,1,t5_2w8pb

2377277,0,t1_cm4ifk7,I just replied to uFelidarSovereign about One of Us!  One of Us doesnt look like it does in the online swatches. Its much more brown in real life. Its still pretty but I was expecting something very different. Heres a swatch I did on Sunday its the second one from the top.Call Me Ishmeow is a beautiful shimmery white with a tiny hint of blue sheen. I would say that if the blue isnt a selling point to you then youd do better with a plain shimmery white or something more like Fyrinnaes Crimson Ghost.The Color Purrple is pretty true to its swatch so if you dont think youd wear it then Id say youre better off getting a sample only if at all.Portrait of Purrian Gray is also a surprisingly hard color to pair. I have a massive eyeshadow collection and I found it difficult to find anything that looked really good with it. That being said it looks beautiful on its own if thats something youre prone to doing.Catticus Finch and Franz Katfka are gorgeous though nothing remotely negative to say and I still love the ones above just trying to help a homie out financially.  ,Indiemakeupandmore,cm5jgex,1,t5_2w8pb

I also like seeing reviews that distinguish between product quality and personal preferences as well as customer service vs product qualities.There are indie shops with great quality products but lacking in customer service and there are indies with great customer service lacking in product service.At the same time there are products that have an awesome quality that one personally hates because it doesnt work for them or they dont like it for some other reason eg an eyeshadow looking too cool or too warm.

If its overwhelming for you itll be even more overwhelming when orders start rolling in and you have to make pack and ship it all in a timely manner. The amount of information can be overwhelming but I never felt overwhelmed in the making if that makes sense.If you start mixing things and find youre not really enjoying it as much youd probably do better finding something else as a craft. All the test runs and failed formulas and almostperfects make the actual final formula feel like such a win. It should be a positive not a source of stress!

However this applies to the entirety of Reddit including the massively popular subs where linking to things you find on external sources is popular like rmusic rworldnews rtodayilearned raww and rpics. The  Reddit suggestion was made to encourage people to also post their own things and not just rehash other peoples work .We are a user content driven sub. Its what we do. We could post other peoples content for  of our submissions like Reddit suggests if you read the rule as a post little OC rather than as a post OC dammit guideline but that would be rather hard unless we were to set up a roster of when to post each others things.Edit The  rule is actually in the Please Do section and the entire thing readsgt Feel free to post links to your own content within reason. But if thats all you ever post or it always seems to get voted down take a good hard look in the mirror  you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the  ratio i.e. only  out of every  of your submissions should be your own content.It is an encouragement to post your own things. Not the other way around. There is nothing under the Please Dont section of the Reddiquette that attempts to limit posting frequency other than one saying not to flood the New queue.

This was an unexpected love for me add I owned it for months and even used it before discovering it is basically a perfect allover lid shade on its own. Medium grey shifting purple nothing wild easy to wear anything but boring.  Performance Colors lipstick in Rosewood. Tough call as I only got  colours and they just came in about a week ago. Since then Ive been wearing all  on rotation. But as a darker neutral shade its unbeatable.  Shiro eyeshadow in War of Five Armies. This is my goto liner shade and I get a little rush of pleasure knowing its a Hobbit shade. Shiro owns my soul. I literally cant list all the shadows I love here.  Meow Cosmetics foundation in Flawless Feline. Despite having a less than stellar customer service experience with them recently I have to admit this foundation is the only thing I wear absolutely every day. Its the perfect colour for me Naughty Abyssinian and a lovely nondrying formulation that really does make my skin look flawless.  Fyrinnae... uh. Shit. Book of the Dead? Are You My Mummy? Very Vampire? Sloth Snuggles? All of those get extensive wear despite my not having anywhere more exciting to go than walks around the neighborhood. ,Indiemakeupandmore,cn75db9,2,t5_2w8pb

Mad As A Hatter is a really interesting nag champachocolate blend with a little bit of oakmoss to give it a colognelike feeling rather than strictly foodie.  Samurai Surprise is very similar to that but more feminine chocolate and nag champa and amber with hints of citrus and florals.

2733278,0,t1_cneq8cb,IMO youre preaching to the choir this community is a huge support for small businesses and we interact with brand owners on a regular basis and have a lot of respect for them.But as informed consumers we shouldnt feel pressured to buy from a brand based on a friendship with an owner or a single persons views. We all have our own standards and make our own decisions.  Id also like to make a point that workers rights arent so black and white in China in regards to manufacturing it would start a whole debate if I started on this topic but it was an area of study for me so I think I have a more objective view on the matter after researching all sides and I dont know if those ethical issues would fit within this sub I never stated that I disagreed with your views or with your blog however I do disagree with that fact that you are pushing your views on me.

2854121,0,t1_cnsa9g0,I personally love EE solid lotions. Ive tried a bunch of scents. I havent tried Ispahan yet although tempted! but it sounds amazing. Ive tried a lot of solid lotions from different shops and the ones from Epically Epic are the best. They dont get sticky or too greasy. As solid lotions they dont sink in super fast none do but these sink in more quickly than most. And leave my hands so soft and leave them feeling soft for a long time and through several hand washings. My favorite use for them is as a cuticle butter  I never have problems with my cuticles anymore. And they last forever! Id order more but I ordered two last time and still have a ton left!Hope that was at least a bit helpful!

Looking at it all written out in a postknowing I just got my Fyrinnae and that Femme Fetale Lifes Entropty and Haus of Gloi are all on the waymakes me think I might need an intervention soon.

2926881,0,t3_2tmqum, Hello Waffle  amp Debussey My first time using these shades and I understand why everyone raves about them.  is absolutely gorgeous. Very pink on me but I think it looks great with my brown eyes. Debussey leans very very gold on me which I loooove. I put it all over the lid with  in the crease. Ill have to post a picture sometime  its so lovely I think itll become a regular nighttime look for me.  Shiro Cake amp Sweet Honey I love the simplicity of Sweet Honey its such a great alloverlid colour. I like it better than Bakers Boy simply because Bakers Boy looks so sheer on my skin tone. Cake on the other hand... I dont know if its because its in a sample baggy although Ive never noticed this with other sample baggies but I always seem to get too much on the brush and it goes EVERYWHERE when I try to apply it on my lid. Its pretty easy to blend out but I always end up with more than I anticipated. It seems finer and messier than other Shiro shadows somehow. Hello Waffle Sweet Tea Blush Finally figured out how to put this insanely pigmented blush on without looking like a clown and I LOVE it! I have very yellow undertones and this is such a lovely warm colour on me. I love everything about it. Haus of Gloi Pumpkin Butter in Absinthe MMMMMMM. I read a review of this scent that said it smelt like black licorice so at first that was all I smelt. After about a week and a half of using it though... Im addicted. Its lemony and minty balanced out with a murkiness. I use it as a hand cream as I bought the sample size and I stop typing every few minutes just to sniff my hands. The formula is also great for my absurdly dry overwashed hands. I would buy it as a perfume but the perfume oils I got in the same order either smell really bad to me Troika or go funny on me and smell like sour powder within twenty minutes of wear Vice. ,Indiemakeupandmore,co0so2f,3,t5_2w8pb

And the Little Sparrow products last longer. So LS is my diamond standard. ltShiro makes a pretty good gloss but I would recommend the custom option over the blusheyeshadow one. Um Im also fond of KaeQ but you should try some of the other shades as eyeshadow! I wouldnt recommend this with Mulberry Mango or Lychee.

You only get the foiled look when you apply too much PE which most people do I guess. What I usually do is just touch the doefoot to my lid and then spread out the PE by dabbing it all over with my finger.

Then very carefully snip off the entire ziplocking closure portion of the bag so straight across. Lets call the other side the left side... snip the left side seam up either halfway or completely. Finally hold the bag over the jar take a small spoon or popsicle stick and push the contents out from the bottom right corner into the jar.You know how when you crease a piece of paper and tilt it everything just slides down it easily? Its the same idea turning the  baggie into a creased flat piece of paper.Sorry that was terribly inarticulate!

3157743,0,t3_2w9sfl,The easiest way to do multiple colors is the  and  blend which is putting one color in the corner of your inner eye and then taking the other color and starting from the other end of the eye as this will be your heaviest application gently brush inwards to meet the pop in your corner you can do this with colors that contrast or complement though contrast is a bit more fun. I like doing this when I begin judging myself for doing a neutral with an eyeliner. ALSO something you might like is doing your normal look then taking another color I usually use a sparkle or white as I use black eyeliner on my waterline and above my lashline and below your wing of the eyeliner smudge the color until you meet the edge of your eye and then repeat on the corner of your eye smudging until you reach the edge of your bottom lashes. This will make your eye look more polished and is super easy! ,Indiemakeupandmore,copaqb9,1,t5_2w8pb

3231686,0,t3_2x4oy9,Nope! Actual glitter is not safe for your eyes. Actual glitter is made of plastic PTE amp its got a big particle size. If you got a tiny piece of plastic in your eye ball it would be bummer city. amp a double bummer if you made it amp labeled it as eye safe amp a customer got an eye injury from it amp sued you.I think that major companies like UD amp NYX can get away with stuff like that because they are a huge company that makes lots of money amp can afford regular lawyers. Hahah. If you look at the labels of anything that has actual glitter in it it will probably say not safe for use around the eyes even if its marketed as an eye product. There are tons of eye safe sparkle things out there though! The vendor should have everything labeled as eye safe or not. amp if they dont I wont buy anything from them hahah just make sure you are super careful about stuff like that amp when you think you have done enough research do even more! ,Indiemakeupandmore,cowyx8i,12,t5_2w8pb

3241644,0,t3_2x8w53,Lovely swatches. I ended up cancelling VC a few months ago as I felt the colors got a bit repetitive and the quality wasnt up there with my other shadows. I am a bit sad to be missing GoT though!Also just a quick PSA from their FB page in regards to the lip balm some are reporting a soapy taste?  Lavender Vanilla was used in small amounts in the secret flavoring of our Crush Kisser. Dont eat your balms because this flavor oil matured in our balm base and does not have a pleasant taste. This will be corrected in the March VC by using the same flavor mix without lavender vanilla. In the meantime I know a lot of you love the scent. Our handcrafted balm base can also be used as a solid perfume base too,Indiemakeupandmore,coy059l,3,t5_2w8pb

3303681,0,t1_cp4u34y,Some people with dry eyelids can probably get away with using a base without a primer. As someone with oily eyelids I get creasing in  hours if I just use a base.Primer is intended to increase the adhesion and longevity of your eyeshadows.Base is intended to increase the intensity and decrease fallout of your eyeshadows. Base without primer can make eyeshadows look amazing but because the ingredients are different they will crease in a shorter period of time. It actually says in the Pixie Epoxy description on Fyrinnaes website that it isnt a primer but is intended to be used OVER one to make eyeshadows pop.YMMV but as an oilyeyelid person I absolutely cannot wear a sticky base without a primer if I want to avoid creasing. I guess the most helpful comparison would be lip gloss vs lipstick. Upon application lip gloss is glossy and colourful and pretty. But if you eat or drink or even wait a few hours it fades away because its not a longlasting product. Most lipsticks are formulated to stick around and adhere to your lips better so theyre not as glossy. Layering lip gloss over lipstick can give you both effects  the colour the gloss and increased longevity. I hope that explanation helps!,Indiemakeupandmore,cp4uh2q,5,t5_2w8pb

3381338,0,t3_2yw2mh,Today marks one year since my stroke. Upside since I was told to abstain from alcohol for at least a year after my injury I can finally imbibe lychee martinis once more.  Yall some of the bureaucratic nonsense I dealt with this past year was hard to handle  sober like that time UCSHIP was Schrodingers Insurance and I was both insured yet somehow simultaneously not insured according to my case manager.  Dont ask nobody understood how that even happened.  This past week my insurance decided Im in physical therapy after a horrible car accident in December and wanted accident details before theyd pay for the month.  When I called them to correct the issue the rep actually asked me if I was sure I hadnt been injured in a traffic accident insteaed.  Um can I talk to someone whose caffeine has kicked in please? Downside I wish I were further along in my recovery... What else?  One of my profs was really nice and let me turn in two essays late.  Today I finish my paperwork to retroactively withdraw from the quarter that was messed up due to the stroke it happened right before finals and two of my professors still expected me to somehow get to school to take my exams so they failed me when I was a noshow so my GPA should bump up a little.The Dude is still around.  I like him more and more and I wish I didnt.  He revealed he doesnt want to examine his feelings let alone act upon them and ugh I dont want to deal with that mess.  Apparently he cant decide if he wants our arrangement to be a romantic relationship or simply a friends with benefits thing and he feels the latter when hes hungry andor anxious.  Which is actually hilarious to me  I sympathize!  I told him I wont force him to break that habit because I am sick of training people how to be decent human beings only to have them ditch me for someone else but he has to realize that what we have only works because I dont want to date right now so this uncategorized fling actually suits my needs just fine.  But it wont always be that way and if he still wont confront feelings by that time then there will be nothing to stop me from walking away to protect myself from his cowardice.  Until that moment Im content to wait to burn that bridge when we get to it.Im going to a zoo with a mandatory monkey minimum with him later today.,Indiemakeupandmore,cpdp4pd,7,t5_2w8pb

My personal other favorite companies that do a good job of producing a variety of finishes are WingDust Collections Girly Bits Model City Polish Arcane Lacquer Alchemy Lacquers and Elevation Polish.Holos are still popular though so I can see why indies just make them.

Plus I have been a student these last six years and I am under strict orders to not buy her anything while Im still studying  she thinks I should be spending my money on myself instead of her. So unless I somehow get a job in my field before Mothers Day shes not getting anything. And even if I do I probably wont get her anything. Because she hates things.

A few people were getting annoyed that it was even being brought up in the Sunday Swap thread though which I dont think is fair it wasnt the mod shilling for her own sub it was other users bringing it up as an alternative  it may not be officially affiliated but satellite subs arent always.I agree though anyone I sell to or buy from I just double check that its not some random new account that isnt used at all. And you can always ask the person who is selling for verification pictures or any additional information.

3771556,0,t3_33knb7,I just got my Nocturne Alchemy Santalum White and Pyramid Vanille holy fast TAT I ordered on the st of April!  days ago!!!I love them and am wearing them layered. The combo is very airy and white. Something in the Santalum White gives me a hint of coconut which I get none of from the original Santalum. I love it its very summery. It is beachyairy in that weird way that melds sandcoconutsunscreen but not in a sharp way. I actually smell like I spent all day playing at the beach and just came inside to eat something with vanilla frosting...wow I need a vacation bad. I also think the Santalum White will be great layered with fruity notes because it has a slightly gourmand feel which the original doesnt. Pyramid Vanille is nice as well very light nonboozey. My only other true vanilla perfume I own is Cenobite from Solstice Scents and this is a nice change from the syrupy vanilla which I imagine to be the color of molasses. This is like...vanilla bean flecked sugar. Something Ina Garten would give you as a homemade present to subtly make you feel inferior.Also my Japanese mother described my Santalum as the smell of a kimono yesterday which I thought was so evocative and cool. I know exactly what she means too it smells like taking a beautiful soft silk item out of tissue paper from a drawer. Not like mothballs mind you but like a sweet woodsy natural skin scent. Mmm.,Indiemakeupandmore,cqm6o3j,5,t5_2w8pb
3778048,0,t3_33odrw,I think you also need to block Reddit and Imgur as well because this community is also a huge enabler. Honestly I really adore this community but damn  the consumerism culture is next level like Pokemon style consumerism aka gotta catch them all.Might also be worth unfollowing the Facebook groups and pages and Instagram for each indie brand too so that it doesnt come up on your feed.Other options include a lowbuy aka a set budget for each month or a replacement only No Buy. Not spending is like a muscle  you gotta keep exercising it! All the best ,Indiemakeupandmore,cqmxbcd,35,t5_2w8pb
3783669,0,t3_33qyn0,Mine has been interesting. I have finally started freelancing as a makeup artist after a long time of building a kit. However I found out that I cant actually be a makeup artist in Idaho without a FULL cosmetology license. I had researched this before I quit my other job and never found anything so I assumed I was good to go. Now I either have to move or give up on my dream because I am not shelling out the cash required to get a license when you barely learn anything about makeup. But I have time to focus on formulating my own products! I have perfected a cream blush and a cream shadow and I am working on a liquid foundation.,Indiemakeupandmore,cqnkfbj,4,t5_2w8pb

3888560,0,t1_cqzisbw, Its no problem really! Sorry I inundated you with so much information! Im currently visiting my parents and dont have my stash with me but the Silk Naturals shadow I use most frequently is Bailey  they describe it as tea with milk in it but unless youre adding a LOT of milk Id say its paler than that. Its in their suede finish which is slightly more glimmery than satin amp is freaking gorgeous for neutral eye looks for people with a lightmedium skin tone.May I ask what your colouring is? It might be easier to suggest colours if we know what your skin depthhair coloureye colour are amp even better if you know what undertones you have though thats not entirely necessary.Also I want to stress you do not need brushes as expensive as the shu N it definitely helped me up my makeup game but many people do without! Having said that I do strongly recommend a paddlelaydown brush amp a blending brush to start.ETA In general I think the Silk Naturals suede finish is really lovely for neutral eye looks amp would also suggest Cloudberry amp Juiced in that finish. Boom is also a great lightmedium colour amp I believe a lot of people love Adorn.As for Shiro a lot of my favourites have been discontinued. Of the neutrals that havent been I really like When the Thrush Knocks No Men Like Me a bit hard to work with to get even so Im not sure I would recommend for a beginner Salt amp Stone which is very strong colourwise but the finish lets me use it as a neutral Chimera Full of Craft Genius Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist this is VERY WARM and I prefer When the Thrush Knocks personally The Red Viper my alltime favourite Shiro eyeshadow this blends out quite mustardy amp is great for autumnal looks but it might not be an easy colour to work with for a beginnerI use Detrivores Ossuary as my everyday blending shade but depending on your skin tone you might want to try Porcelain or Autopsy instead.,Indiemakeupandmore,cqzj2qc,3,t5_2w8pb

4009020,0,t3_36eakb,I think I would be more comfortable with the mod team consisting of non brand owners. I dont think benoit would abuse her mod privileges at all but I think if she were to remain a mod it would set a precedent for having more brand owner mods in the future.  And I think IMAM is a community thats more consumeroriented and that feeling could change by having a brand owner mod.  Brand owners are of course welcome on here to talk about their own brand or their own experiences and thats great and most of their discussions are related to consumer interests anyway product releases reviews etc.  In the end rather than any drastic change its all a matter of perception.  By having the mod team comprised of consumers it gives a more unbiased image since this sub is mainly made up of consumers  like the mod team would all be on the same level.  If there were brand owner mods I could also see the argument of well why was the owner of that particular brand made a mod  it could look like the mod team was biased even if thats not the case. And there would be people who take it that way anyway.  Plus I think people sometimes hold back when talking about brands or products on here and having a brand owner mod may foster the feeling that they need to be even more careful. It could send a message about the sub being proowner even though its neutral. Or that its biased towards a specific owner.  tldr I think if this were a sub where people spoke more freely about their opinions it wouldnt make a difference.  But having a brand owner mod would probably cause people to censor themselves even more. And I also think brand owners should be treated equally in the sub. Giving a specific brand owner mod privileges kind of singles them out. I hope that made sense and I didnt ramble too much.,Indiemakeupandmore,crd9bow,16,t5_2w8pb

4034896,0,t1_crg6qo1,I cant express how perfectly this explains everything thats happened recently. Now that theres imamcj iiom and imamdiscussion... This sub seems to be left with all the drama llamas imo.  I used to love coming onto this sub and catching up with everything im in the UK. Im not a huge poster but every so often I would and get great feedback and sometimes a discussion. Basically since January this sub has became very hostile and I dont want to post. Ive seen users give fair opinions to be downvoted to oblivion on that post and then every other post theyve made. Theres select brand owners on here I wont name but I refuse to give my business to them anymore on how unprofessional theyve been in certain situations.  I completely get that with sub growth it attracts new members and becomes harder to handle im not blaming the new members though. I think the lack of guidelines between shop owner and customer is the problem. Theres a huge grey area right now about posting honest opinions being scared of brand owners and calling popular brands out on things. I dont want owners to leaveI just think a post needs to be made where its outlined that a negative review is ok if theres evidence. A bad product? Show us. Rude owner? Scrn shot it.      Finally I love seeing haul posts. But theyve all gone? Its mammoth to ask for swatches every haul when maybe you bought  samples or  full sizes. Sometimes I cba reading a small essay and I just want the pictures damn it so I can live through you one day theyll be mine!      its cool to do bestworst of x for a discussion. But that leads to a closed answer. Product  a is best! Product b is worst! Then thats it. Maybe we should do more show me your collectionrosegoldsbest purpleleast favourite and why or incorporate your favourite label art into a craft for my creative homies here. I dunno just more fun stuff I guess.  the last month has been hell for me with finishing uni and deadlines so after next week Ill also be more active D  TLDR  why go on this sub when theres nicer more suitable ones? Crystal clear rules and guidelines need to be made regarding negative reviews. Bring back haul posts! Some creative things would be cool maybe     WOOO NO MORE UNI!    ,Indiemakeupandmore,crg7isj,14,t5_2w8pb

Then I guess she chose the ones she liked the best. She sent me out clamshells of her lip glazes to swatch which was really fun! Swatching is so enjoyable to me for some reason. I think because I like to have record on my lip of all of my makeup products... that way I can go back and reference how it looks later on. ,Indiemakeupandmore,csa2a1b,3,t5_2w8pb
4298184,0,t3_3a75my,I dont believe that owner interaction has pushed me to like products more but if I know someone that I trust as a reviewer here just opened a shop I may be more willing to try their new company mostly because I know it exists and because I trust them to take safety and quality seriously if they look for that in other companies. But Ill usually just go for samples on first purchase and I am generally objective when reviewing their products. However one of my favorite brands is also one that does some terribly disrespectful and nonsensical stuff on social media whining about how customers are mean for bringing up legit concerns via email?. So I havent ordered anything since because I dont support that sort of behavior. Basically positive interactions are nice and give me an overall positive feeling about the brand and my purchase basically good customer service adds to a good customer experience but bad social media behavior can ruin my opinion of a company which isnt limited to indies Im a fan of voting with my wallet. A good experience with a brand owner may make me more excited to try a new product of theirs if the quality has been better than or equal to other companies with no social media contact or negative social media experiences. ,Indiemakeupandmore,csa4n4w,7,t5_2w8pb

Licorice orange and a bunch of subtle notes that all work together well. That being said some of the ones I tried from her were very sweet and not very interesting on my skin. Dalliance was beautiful cucumber tea at first but became overpoweringly sugary and floral after wearing for a while. I liked Neroli XXIII for a subtle fresh orange blossom.

It had gone through many seasons and they couldnt vouch for the smell but were giving them away in case you were curious and you just had to pay shipping. I got a few that I had samples of and surprisingly they smelled the same! Thats years ago now and I keep those bottles separately from the rest of my stash and they still smell great.

4485235,0,t3_3cg0xa,I ordered  of her new glosses and some samples of the glitters. The glitters are glitter lol not much else to say. The lip elixirs are okay they are easily opaque and the colors shown no worries there. ie heres my ig pic of the blue Skeptic no filters or photoshop etc    I did have two tubes leak one in transit and one while it was sitting on my table ? I still dunno how and I contacted the owner with pics. She refunded me for both tubes even though I had not implied that was necessary. Formulawise theyre ok they do give me a slight headachey feeling on application because the musty smell of the hemp oil is strong even over the peppermint oil. It dissipates after a bit and then everything is ok for me. They also do tend to featherbleed into liplines Ive had the Life Entropy liptar dupes do that on me as well. Overall theyre an ok product I dont hate them but Id only buy them if you see a color you really want.

If this has been an ongoing issue and thousands of tubes have been sold well until we figure out what the actual problem is its on hold. My best guess is a wax discolouration if candelilla wax is overheated it can take on a dark yellow tint but that wont affect all final products and dye lot variation is possible too.

4747452,0,t1_ctsykor,On me heres my notes from when I received it! but Id say it was overall an atmospheric gourmand so more like the experience of eatingdrinking in woodsy lodge with smoky air than a straight cup of maple chai This smells like bacon and maple straightaway. Liquid smoke and a candied maple background. Maple fades a bit from initial prominence but is still there. I detect the vanilla chai on the drydown as well as the woods which are a bit cedarlike. This really smells like sitting  in a lodge drinking maple chai. I love the chai note but..already own Sycamore Chai. This is not differentiated enough for me to buy a fullsize. I hear this one settles SO nicely as it ages so I will keep my sample and try again in a few months. If the maple becomes more prominent the more it sits Ill spring for a full bottle. This would be a LOVELY fall scent for sure. ,Indiemakeupandmore,ctsymbh,2,t5_2w8pb

4883100,0,t1_cua181q,From the layering notes I also have Musc dEgypte and Miel both of which are straight up single notes but not just flat and simple.Musc is a very light skin musk and not at all incensey.  Its more powdery in a way but it avoids smelling like old lady perfume or wardrobe.  Id say the wear time is slightly shorter than Earl Grey though and it still has a mediumlow throw. Miel smells like honey on the comb to me probably more like woodland or heather honey rather than blossom honey.  Its sweet but theres a hint of beeswax and a slight woody floral tang it morphs towards honey cookies by the end of the day not the kind with spices.  Id say this wears about the same as Earl Grey but has a lower throw.  ,Indiemakeupandmore,cua1wtn,1,t5_2w8pb

Using a VA Pheromone accord based on the essential oils of deep bergamot grapefruit violet and Hungarian Oakmoss thus began a search for the ultimate scent of what we would have Dracula be part of this Vampyre Collection. Introducing Black Amber to the blend created a texture of scent that was both noble aristocratic and mysterious. There was one thing left a touch of Earl Grey Tea and this perfume was Dracula and a drop of Hungarian Incense.Mina  Hungarian Blue Jasmine Eternal Ankh Vanilla Blue Sandalwood Rosewood Musk Santalum White Sandalwood N sweet Musk Egyptian Musk and Sensual White Musk.I have some of your Buffy scents but I havent gotten around to trying them out!

Mango Tea smells exactly like mango flavored black tea its a really refreshing scent for bath stuff. But Chiquita...wow. Its banana but its not just banana and the dry down is sweet and a tiny bit spicy. They describe it as sexy banana and it is. Theres really no other way to describe it. If you like bananas at all even if wearing them as perfume seems weird you should pick up a sample and try it on. I had the same head shop problem at first but over time thats faded.

If it has happened once you know it has happened more than that to someone who wouldnt speak up and would instead just go back to lurking or leave altogether. The lack of response to me shows that theres more scrambling behind the scenes to try to justify and defend instead of owning up to some really out of line behavior.  It mirrors the decision to take down the open letter last night. Being criticized for doing the wrong thing is difficult.

While I can give my parents authority to pick up or sign for parcels on my behalf its such a PITA to do that Id rather have nothing coming in while Im away. But in general Ill probably be on a lowbuy until the exchange rate picks up. Right now its pretty awful US for Arcana GC decants comes out to AU. Im down to Canadian sellers and destashers and Femme Fatale now.At the moment Im wishlisting anything I know cant be held which is more or less everything since I dont think many sellers will do holds for that long. Im really tempted by the Arcana GC decant circle but Im waiting to hear back from the person running it if they can hold my parcel. I know doramajoo can definitely hold my Scalia decants if worst comes to worst though Im hoping itll come in before I have to start thinking about asking for a hold.Ive also been going back over my old wishlist and seeing what is way too similar or what I know Im not into anymore or has been DCd or is being reformulated. Im also trying to find more Australian indie sellers since the exchange rates cant bite me there. If it comes down to it Ill probably try to organize or get into GOs or decant circles in the future if the exchange rate doesnt improve.But my rule for orders is Check the shipping first. THEN CHECK IT AGAIN. Check it a third time just in case. Unless its flatrate. ILY everyone who does flatrate shipping. Check the exchange rate. Check it again.  If it all comes out to more than  recheck the entire order in case maybe theres something I can cut from it to bring it under . Whatever was cut goes into the wishlist for better times. No soaps lotions or other bulky items. They only make the shipping worse. If its still way too much or if the shipping is more than half of the order cost see if I cant find a locallybased stockist. Femme Fatale has been so helpful on that front. If after all that its still too expense into the wishlist.

5140097,0,t1_cv4w8rz,Ive found that in the last year of dabbling in oil perfumes what I thought I wanted to smell like has changed. There are perfumes Ive bought that didnt totally appeal to me on paper but that ended up evoking such a strong feeling in me the need to express that small part of me that really related to it meant picking it up in a full size. Darling Clandestines Vardogr for instance reminds me of roaming around in the creek and sewers when I was a kid or Solstice Scents Gibbons Boarding School has that wonderful nostalgic scent of book paperand neither of those are the more sophisticated or traditional scents I assumed Id want to smell like in the beginning of this venture. Youve been well advised to just experience and experiment with perfumes to start delineating between particular notes but Id suggest picking up a variety of things too!

Also while personally it didnt work on me if you like candy and aquatics in the same perfumes VMSF Dunk Tank is also a good one. Darling Clandestines aquatics are a lot more naturey. Monstre Delicat smells like rain and awesomeness. Mishigami is sand and lake and summer camp. I also love Arcanas Strawberries Crave Waterfalls which is a gorgeous fresh wild aquatic.

I have absolutely had frustrated moments with CS and Ive had my mixed experiences of stellar vs. not great response time and quality so I empathize with the disappointment.I can understand completely that youre not pleased with the treatment youve gotten and again its up to everyone individually what they will tolerate as a consumer but I just dont want you to miss out on what I know are good companies with truly generous owners because of an unrealistic time frame. Also its embarrassing how frequently Ill fuck up two things in the same order chain.

5438657,0,t1_cw6u2cs,Youre welcome! Not sure how it will shake out once the perfume ages but here are my notes from first impressions when I received the bottleOn the drydown this is wild dark incense.The chocolate note has morphed into a true cacao scent like the smell of a very dark unsweetened bar of highquality chocolate. It reminds me of a nonweirdo version of Possets Mayan Queen Bloodletting Sacrifice because the copal incense and dark greenish note the cardamom musk have the same wild jungly vibe. I get a sort of impression of jasmine a little like some nightblooming white flower but not in an overwhelming way. Mostly DARK copal incense with a hint of sexy warm cacao plenty of green cardamom and all lightened by a dash of the white floral component.,Indiemakeupandmore,cw6ubjw,1,t5_2w8pb

The closest colourmatch I had for my brows was Dark Blonde by bareMinerals which to me looks darker than the LE blonde but not quite dark enough to be in the browns yet. I like the bareMinerals kit but if LEs version would be quicker to use Id prefer it because Im lazy.Do you have any swatches for any of the Silk Naturals colours?

My fianc his brother and his best friend all work there in different departments. I interviewed with the department head and then the owner and they sent me for a drug test. Hopefully I find out today. Its a job by myself at a desk away from customers. As an introvert I am VERY EXCITED. Send your happy thoughts my way!  Edit well I got the job but its MUCH less pay than I thought it would be. Im pretty disappointed honestly.   Cocoa Pink Black Friday sale starts today! Im ordering some linen sprays for all the girls in my family and hoping they come in on time for Christmas. Also maybe a few things for me...   Not a bad week. The job Im at now closes its doors the week after next and its been desperately slow.   We went to a Cider Mill last weekend with my fiances family and had lots of fun.

5587021,0,t3_3rnbn4,Fingers crossed that someone will come through with more knowledge!  Ive dabbled with incensey scents since my skin seems to love them but Im by no means an expert hahaha.For me I love amber.  Its warm and slightly smoky HOGs Haus Amber is one of my favorites. Its a sweeter amber but I think it balances out the woodsy smoky quality. I avoid smoke scents because it amps up on my skin... amber smoke is a little different harder to explain.I also really like frankincense.  To me it smells like aged wood with a faint hint of lemon. Church pews is probably the best way Ive seen it described and thats what it makes me think of. Arcana Holy Terror leans heavily towards frankincense on me it also has sandalwood and myrrh although I havent tried it on its own I have two blends that I really really enjoy Arcana Apples Crave Terror cold crisp apple note that pairs so well with the incense and Pumpkins Crave Terror warmer creamier like dessert in an old church.Most of the sandalwood Ive smelled is of the sweeter creamier spiced type. I quite enjoy it as well!  I wish I could describe it better.I have a lovehate relationship with patchouli.  Personally I love the smell but my skin amps it up like nothing else so it gets overpowering. And not everyone loves it.  Ive tried it paired with all sorts of other notes and usually it tends to overpower.  Arcana Fugue does a good job at tempering the patchouli with creamy vanilla notes IMO but you can definitely tell patchouli is in there which is how Ive scored it at a great price in destashes hahaha. I also really like rose  patchouli HOG Rose City comes to mind as thats when I first encountered it but I know there are some others around that might have a better rose note.Clove is another favorite. Its sweet and spicy with some smoke to it.  You can actually buy little baggies of whole cloves at the grocery store if you want a cheap smell. The cheaper packets are often in the Hispanic food section... I buy all my spices there! Sixteen Bela Lugosis Dead is one of the best clovebased perfumes Ive come across. Its a bit smokier than clove typically is due to the other notes but I quite like it.I would also recommend seeing if you can get single note samples. Parfums Raffy sells ml samples for  a piece Ive not ordered from them personally. I actually think this is a great way to get familiar with perfume notes and something I want to do soon.Nocturnal Apothecary NAVA also creates some lovely incensey scents I honestly havent come across many NAVAs that were disappointments!  end wall of text ,Indiemakeupandmore,cwpmekn,3,t5_2w8pb

6466247,0,t3_447ucp, minutes  Powder foundation blush and tinted lip balm. I am very fairskinned so any little acne bump no matter how small really shows up on me. I also have really neutral skin without much color so a good blush makes me look like a little more alive. minutes  Everything above  undereye concealer eyeliner and mascara. I look super tired all of the time thanks to my thin undereye skin so using a bit of concealer works wonders! minutes  Everything above  brow pencil and wax. This takes me WAY too long to do but since I recently started filling and shaping my eyebrows Ive been really amazed at how much of a difference it makes! I have naturally dark brows but theyre quite patchy probably from over plucking in my youth filling in helps a lot.Anything over that and Ill do eyeshadow. Now Im quite horrible at eyeshadow. I lust and lust after everyones EOTD but no matter how much I practice I can only seem to do simple looks without looking like some kind of gutter creature.  That doesnt stop me from trying though!! So sometimes this is the part that feels most like a chore because Ill get frustrated blending into oblivion.As for the most dramatic change I would probably say using brightening products around my eyes. With undereye concealer and a light skintoned shadow all around my eyelid I look SO much more awake!,Indiemakeupandmore,czo5lke,5,t5_2w8pb
6467592,0,t1_czoa4gv,lol I live in Texas and have classes MonThurs so even when its not sunny the sun is still out to kill me. Im lucky that I mostly dont leave the house on weekends so I can avoid using it for  days. I use Biores UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel because I can get big bottles of it! I buy packs of three in the ml bottles off Ebay and they tend to last me about     months a bottle if not longer I only use them on my face and neck I use cheap grocery store stuff on my body. Its a hydrating formula and feels just as light as the other Biore sunscreens but I just refuse to spend so much on the other PA sunscreens considering how small the bottles usually are. I end up blasting through them! I think Nivea has a Korean sunscreen that comes in a ml too.I buy my  packs from this seller if youre interested!,Indiemakeupandmore,czoamdh,3,t5_2w8pb

6598616,0,t1_czk7s70,Hey kind of a late reply but I have a bunch of both so I thought Id give my two cents!  I love both formulas.  The lip whips are wayyy more smudge proof than JS and hand in hand a little more drynoticeable feeling on the lips especially at first.  For me its a reasonable trade off to be able to last forever with no touch ups though and theyre definitely not as drying as some.  I find them slightly harder to apply than JS lippies which pretty much are at max color as soon as they touch your lips and I like the applicator better.  The formula isnt quite as watery feeling as the JS ones. The lip whips especially the dark colors do build up if you apply more so it can look a little uneven if youre not careful I mean noone else would probably notice but it can be annoying.  HOWEVER I think the fact that theyre not  opacity instantly mind you still very pigmented nonetheless gives them their beautiful finish.  Like Cranberry Stiletto has such a rich magical finish to it better than any other red lipsticks Ive tried and I think its because it makes kind of a natural ombre on the lips when you apply it.  Every time I wear any of these I get so many compliments and people demanding to know the brand haha.  Id definitely recommend them.  They have a really nice finish in person especially cranberry stiletto.  Theyre definitely different feeling than the JS liquid lipsticks but if you like his lippies youll probably like these too.  edit hit submit too early like a noob ,Indiemakeupandmore,d01umvu,2,t5_2w8pb

6769770,0,t3_48gd77,I saw some Femme Fatale swatches on rMakeupAddiction and I became really intrigued by duochromes. Shades like Exorcism were blowing my mind  this is purple...but its also green! How?!  so I ordered a sample pack of  shades back when they existed. Once they came in it was love at first swatch. Then I started placing orders here and there and now Im drowning in eyeshadow. So what I like about indie eyeshadows is how crazy the range of colors can be theyre also quite exclusive and in so many cool finishes. Im more confident now about wearing color than I was before.But once I found myself with enough eyeshadow to last me three lifetimes I decided to explore perfume oils because they seemed exquisit and I didnt wear perfume because I never found a scent I really liked. Evocative scent descriptions such as The scent of solitude among laughter release through isolation. The distant merriment of boardwalk salt and sand under the soft beckoning of a tragic sea. are very appealing and I became very curious about finding out how can people make scents that smell like these scenarios.So I also have a lot of perfume oils now but not for three lifetimes though its cool.,Indiemakeupandmore,d0jmuf6,3,t5_2w8pb

6789010,0,t1_d0ljp6o,if I remember correctly perfume oils are too thick to be sprayed from an atomizer. Youd have to mix the oil with alcohol base in order to spray it. As of opening a sample vial I put my thumb on the side of the cap and just push to gently pop it open and it usually does so cleanly. Another option you have my favorite option is to decant perfume oils into rollerballs. You can get rollerballs on Amazon ebay etc. in different sizes. That makes them a lot easier to apply. I only put my full sizes into rollerballs but thats because I get  mL rollerballs they have smaller ones that you could put samples into. ,Indiemakeupandmore,d0ltm9i,2,t5_2w8pb

6826883,0,t3_498y8v,Ooooooh thats a very good question! And also very hard haha. But lets give it a whack and see how it goes okay? cBest mattes would have to be a tie between Corvus and Hello Waffle. They blend so smoothly and make great bases and they also go really nicely on the crease! I use Skin Walker from Corvus as a base shade for blending a lot and I really love using Oh Krieger San from Hello Waffle with rose golds.  I personally prefer them to Blackbird who seems to get raved about here a lot. I cant blend them they all turn the same shade of grey on my skintone and whilst I have had good experiences with their customer service when I ordered several of my friends have had honestly terrible customer service from them which has turnt me off. Best liquid lipstick? Well I really enjoyed Eccentric Cosmetics formula. Very light weight and wears well. They dont stand up to food very well but I dont really expect that from my liquid lipsticks. Best tradtional lipsticks would have to go to Hello Waffle. Theyre so comfortable and leave a very nice stain cI really like The Keyhole Maraschino and Outstretched.Best duochromes would have to go to Femme Fatale. They dont even need a sticky base thats how strong the shift is!! Im a really big fan of Seven Lost Lords and Witch Country at the minute.Best primer is another tie between Eccentric Cosmetics and Femme Fatale. They make my shadows last for ages!!For glittery eyeshadows Im a really big fan of Hello Waffle. Ive been using a lot of  a lovely rose gold lately. Im also a big fan of their recently released overshadows the Tr na ng collection. I like layering Clodhna over  to make an extra sparkly rose gold o I love their regular shadows semi loose formula and the versatility of the overshadows which makes them the best for me.,Indiemakeupandmore,d0q4kpf,7,t5_2w8pb

The Helmer is so cute but was such a pain in the ass to put together. I can see all my little indie jars now though I put a tray on top that I want to paint to keep all of my perfumes together. I love how my Grandparents frame is a little vanity tooI also hung up a mirror this thing his mom gave us and a mail sorter I drilled holes pushed in drywall plugs and screwed in screws.

They have to be all done by the end of April. Ive had to reschedule this test twice because the material is weird and arbitrary and Ive been having trouble with it. Im praying I can pull a passing grade which is all I need as it will be really difficult to retake the test moneywise. In happier news my masters thesis advisor didnt hate the poems I sent her. Im so busy with studying for these exams my thesis has kind of fallen by the wayside. But Im hoping I can start thinking of writing not as work but as play. Which is hard for me. I love to write but its hard. Anyway Im thinking of doing some found language stuffs and maybe forcing myself into using language I wouldnt use otherwise might add a bit of interest to my work. Oh and the heat is not off in my classrooms yet. Which Im hoping maybe it gets cooler next week? My first class was so bad I said fuck it I dont get paid enough to teach like this and we went outside. I was teaching Thoreau. It felt like the right thing to do. In happier news I got my first visage box the day before yesterday. I almost didnt claim my spot but Im really glad I did. Im a dork and I wore the whole full look yesterday and I felt like an amazing glowy goddess the whole time. The bronzer is really lovely and Im pale and cool enough bronzer sometimes looks... not cute. Im hoping to buy a full size of the liquid lipstick later this month. Its a great color.

6933053,0,t1_d125xy9,When I first started getting into indie scents years ago and smelled Lace Draped Spectre the first really carnationcentric perfume I tried I got this very visceral lonely melancholy feeling. Maybe the association of carnations as a funeral flower? Maybe TMI but it made me think of when I was in high school and my grandma that my parents and I lived with was deteriorating from Alzheimers and we were kind of cut off from many resources or family willing to help us at the time this was about  years ago and we were pretty alone and home was a very sad place. Those feelings for some reason came back to me when I smelled that scent. Its really a beautiful floral and Ive come to appreciate carnation and dont avoid it in scents and dont always get that impression depending on its usage and accompanying notes but that first one was a very intense strange scent memory.

7034895,0,t3_4br7lb,I will almost never blind buy even from brands I adore because I worry about dropping that much money on something Ill hate. Im also not the type to reselljust too lazy. I have two exceptions.Im totally fine blind buying certain nonperfume FS Haus of Gloi products. Whipped soaps are great as long as theyre not gourmand because I feel like the scent isnt very strong and doesnt really hang around after its washed off. Plus theyre reasonably priced and Im obsessed with the formula so I just grab a few at a time of whatever Im curious about. I have also had good experiences blind buying their pumpkin butters because theyre usually something Im going to put on while lounging at home. So I have some that I like but dont love and thats not a huge deal. That said as much as I love HoG as a whole Im split on the perfumes Ive tried its either love or hate for me so Ive maybe gotten lucky.NAVA is probably the one company I can see myself blind buying FS perfumes from. Ive gotten quite a few samplesdecantsa few FS from resellers and at this point I have adored every single one. There are some notes Ill gravitate to and some I know to avoid but I have a feeling Im going to end up dropping a buttload of money on some of their limited FS scents soon. I just wish their website wasnt so damn overwhelming.I probably would consider blind buying Possets too but theyre absolutely fantastic about samples.I dont know if the practice actually hurts companies a lot. I do think it depends on if they offer some samples but not others IE  NAVA or if they entirely stop selling samples altogether. I think the latter would be a huge deterrent for a lot of casual customers especially if they havent had an opportunity to fall in love with the brand yet.,Indiemakeupandmore,d1dret0,2,t5_2w8pb

Once it gets rereleased this summer Im definitely going to pick this up in a full size.  ,Indiemakeupandmore,d1kb3dw,8,t5_2w8pb

7149426,0,t3_4ddgvg,Hmm I think Im most intrigued by Enchanted and Sandy Coconut. South Beach Cabana Ibiza and Kailua Beach I think will be a pass for me. SBC for the weakness Ibiza Trance because Im not very into lemon scents and Kailua Beach because it seems to be a predominant floral. Seychelles Islands Im on the fence about. Im trying to stay clear of that coconut and vanilla scent that seems to be the predominant scent out there when coconut is involved. But the lime and pikake blooms have me intrigued. I also like sandalwood but my skin chemistry seems to REALLY like sandalwood. All of my samples from Possets that have sandalwood in them always bull all sandalwood on me. Enchanted seems absolutely lovely. I just LOVE a good fruity scent that doesnt turn to plastic or candy.Im surprised by Sandy Coconut. It was one I was on the fence about. I have a banana scent by Alchemic muse that I really liked but the perfume turned a bit rusty on me. This seems to be sweeter than that one though and I love a good tropical banana smell.

7193152,0,t3_4dzpnz,Out of my limited stash of scents Ive noticed that Solstice Scents White Fox and Smokewood Apiary last the entire day on me but scents like Corvins Apple Fest and Lavender Vanilla dont. Haus of Glois Cozy Rose lasts a decent amount of time on me too just not for that long and it becomes mostly incense on me. I havent found any scents that completely disappear on me but admittedly I havent tried that many. So far the scents that stick around for a while on me are musk dirt smokebooze notes and spices but the ones that do not last as long arent as powerful are florals except lavender and vanilla notes. Like the other people have said it has to do mostly with body chemistry. Your skin might amp something that smells great in the bottle into something horrible or vice versa. Also the more you use of the perfume the more strong the scent is and the longer it lasts.Something else not a lot of people talk about here is that everyones noses are different you might pick out a note that nobody else smells for some reason or not smell something others do. My boyfriend thinks White Fox by Solstice Scents smells like flowers and I think its pretty far away from that! Our noses have their own funny chemistry and that heavily affects if you can smell a particular ravedabout note or not or even if its tolerable to you. The smell or strength might be there you just could have gotten acclimated to it and no longer smell it or are super sensitive to it! ,Indiemakeupandmore,d1vsvui,1,t5_2w8pb

Another recommendation is the PumpkinampPoppy inner glow powder in Aphrodite This is brightening on an other way it contains a hint of shimmer and makes your skin look perfected. I really like it. I havent tried it myself for that function but it says in the listing it can be used for underneath your eyes. Hope thats helpful! ,Indiemakeupandmore,d4r10k9,1,t5_2w8pb

8261716,0,t3_4sljwb,So the sun is finally shining and I got to swatch my Hello Waffle hiatus haul.I split up the haul into two for categorization and put up the eyeshadows first. I will do the facial products later or tomorrow I seriously underestimated the time needed to do this from swatching to taking pics and so on. I now know how much I owe bloggers amp other posters for their beautiful swatch pics. Mine are nowhere near as good but I did my best so hope this helps.Swatches are done over Eccentric Cosmetics Primer in Lust. The swatches are done opaquely so I dont think that Lusts gold sheen will be affecting my swatches. I used Zoevas Luxe Shader brush in a patting motion so as not to lose the sheen.I have worn them all in eye looks at least once but have not posted any pics up because Im not comfy about posting my face online.  my impressions are based on these looks primarily.Overall impressions all shadows behave beautifully easy to blend. With a primer amp careful handling fallout is minimal during application amp non existent during wear. I have dry skin but I do have Asian hooded eyes amp wore the shadows in tropical weather so bear that in mind when I say these shadows lasted  hours on me with minimal creasing amp fading. Im NC right now but I guess my arm is closer to NC?My favorites of the bunch are A Half Apple and Pool of Tears.A Half Apple gives me a darker warmer vibe of Femme Fatales Candied Apple. So for those who found Candied Apple to be too light for you A Half Apple might be your jam.  A Half Apples shift is strong but the overlay doesnt overwhelm the base so Im giving it bonus points.Pool of Tears is damn near blinding and I mean that in the best possible way. The sheen is so complete amp unbroken it is a complete dream to work with. Even my husband says its his fave of the bunch his other choice is Beyond the Mountains and yes I was instructed by him to type it here P.The other shadows are also gorgeous and very nice to work with. If you guys notice these shadows are sparkly or have a sheen. Fallout wasnt a big issue though even when blending. Catticus Finch is surprisingly wearable on my skin tone I paired it with Shiros Theres No Such Thing as Magic and it was office appropriate imho. Not sure why there is an uneven patch in my swatch I left it as is to have a consistent comparison with the rest of the other shadows I applied.Beyond The Mountains is gorg. As with Half Apple the base isnt lost under the blue shift. My husband is nagging me to wear it to the office but thatll probably happen if its an eyeliner or an outer third color.Yellowgold is probably the weakest color in my collection so Light of the Sun is pretty much the best one I have. Its a true metallic gold. Sadly the pics dont translate the greenish sparkles I see in it in real life. Frankly though I cant say there is a shift although HWs description says there is maybe over a sticky base?The Great Catsby is great as a liner it also pairs very well as an outer third color for Pool of Tears. No problems blending it as well.Anyway thats it for now. I can answer other questions you might have. Hope this helps some of you. ,Indiemakeupandmore,d5a9tni,4,t5_2w8pb

8346291,0,t3_4trxiv,My hubby wears Flintlock and Outpost from Solstice Scents almost exclusively. Flintlock is his daily jam and every time he walks by I swear it evokes a rugged cowboy on horseback on a wooded trail out West. It has the woodsmoke the woods everything. It really is incredible. I actually stole Outpost today and am wearing it it is a bit more masculine than I usually go for but if he likes anything Spruce or Fir then this is definitely worth checking out and the sugar crystals and amber keep it from going into TOO PINEY territory. Neither of these scents get as much love as they deserve IMHO. That said SS High Noon sounds like a great manly cowboy scent but I actually found that one to be too feminine and powdery for me but YMMV.Firebird has a Gin and Tonic perfume oil that smells straight up like the real thing if he thinks he might like it.

They should behave like veggie dyes for the most part so for it to damage your hair is very odd. Or was it done at a salonschool? Ive found a lot of stylists are really weird about not wanting to use demi color to the point that Ive had some lie to my face about actually using it on me.Also shame on that school for bleaching your hair over and over!

There are strong notes of ambrette marjoram and oakmoss. My other fav is Petrichor which is much warmer and rainier than Drowned Earth. Drowned Earth smells like sunny mornings and Petrichor smells like rainy afternoons. They both have their leafy qualities but two very different takes.  Pine Cone is very green but more forestlike. I recently tried a sample of November which sounded perfect but ended up being too mushroomy and dark for me. Moss amp Ivy on the other hand was beautiful. Similar to Drowned Earth but much sharper. Its difficult to find leafy scents that dont have galbanum a truly vegetal note that I absolutely loathe. None of these perfumes have that  terpene smell... theyre softer and to my knowledge galbanumfree.,Indiemakeupandmore,d7aqpx8,3,t5_2w8pb

8952749,0,t1_d7nvv0y,Youre welcome! I would highly recommend samples from any company before buying full sizes. Several of them offer bulk pricing too if youre into stockpiling so that you dont have to order as often. Personally I order six bars from Chagrin Valley every  months so that I save on shipping and time but thats just me.   Also like others do I slice all of my bars of soap shampoo and body soap bars as soon as I receive them in the mail and put them back in the bag. So whenever I am ready to use a new slice I can just grab one out of the bag. This also helps them to last longer. My husband and I usually use the same shampoo bar in the shower and to give you an idea a full size bar . oz. lasts us . months between the two of us. So it may last longer for you depending on how often you wash your hair.,Indiemakeupandmore,d7nzjfi,2,t5_2w8pb

This is the relevant part of their FAQPerfumes and fragrances are synthetic chemicals that do not have any medicinal or aroma therapeutic value.  Pure products smell delicious because what you smell is real. The wonderful aromas in  Pure products are from real fruits pure essential oils and pure absolutes. There are never any synthetic fragrances or anything artificial in  Pure products.They use fruit extracts and essential oils with the latter being used as kind of natural preservatives too. I would assume the scent is mainly coming from Rubus Fruticosus Fruit Extract Blackberry Extract  which if you google you can buy.

And really nothing quite wakes you up to just how much you have than having to pack it all up to move. I was a bit ashamed of how many samples of perfumes I had  especially ones I hadnt even worn.

Also perhaps I am missing context but I am uncomfortable with the description colored girls? I know that AfroSheila is from Bowies Young Americans and perhaps colored may be appropriate for the time period but theres such heavy historical connotation that Im a bit...perplexed at the word choice?

Id recommend getting a fullsize gloss in whatever color premade or custom youd like to wearthough I have a special fondness for The Blood of My Enemies a rust so rich it appears more like a lacquer than a gloss. My opaque custom gloss in Warboy is also a favorite a muted dusty violet that I cant quite dupe anywhere else.I havent tried their highlighters but I assume that suggestions would vary depending on your skin tone. Same goes for eyeshadows really. But as someone with NCish skin on MACs scale I personally like the following best Workhorse neutrals Hodor soft taupe with the slightest silvery satin sheen Little Bird satin rosy mauve My Minds Telling Me No rosy brown with a subtle copper sheen Climbing Chaos rich bronzey brown packed with shimmer Interesting notquiteneutrals Constant Vigilance! lustrous deep antique gold I Loved a Maid rusty base with a shimmering pale green shift Mother of Dragons bruisey purple with a silver overlay Glitterbombs Alkahestry lilac base and a riot of blue sparkle The Largest Moon of Still Not a Planet gray taupe with blue and gold shimmer,Indiemakeupandmore,dc2u6qp,3,t5_2w8pb

YMMV  comments  take them for what they are worth. Sunscreen.  And the recommendation to go to rSkincareAddiction with your qualifications for crueltyfree and vegan is a good one.  I would also ask this at rAsianBeauty.  Prevention is a heck of a lot easier than repair. Youve EARNED your wrinkles!  I developed what I fondly call my Klingon mark a very deep wrinkle between my eyes at about  because of all of the time spent squinting over books learning and living.

Every single one has been the utmost quality even if it wasnt my taste. Actually most that I tried and did not like went on a list to purchase full sizes for gifts. Im not sure about Kytheria fitting with your list though. Its quite a heavy perfume with the rose and the pepper is quite sexy but in an intense sort of way.

10989211,0,t1_dedj0l8,Welcome! The classic aftershave scent tends to be a fougere which features a combination of lavender and oakmoss but also often includes herbs like mint anise thyme etc. But mens cologne I associate with either the freshclean category where you would be looking at a lot of calone a synthetic melony aquatic note and possibly metallic notes or a more oldfashioned mens cologne which would often feature leather tobacco and moss. Personally the cologney notes that give me nasty headaches and often cause headaches as I understand it are calone so I avoid aquatics and Iso E Super which is really more perfumey in general than specifically cologney  it can have a rubbing alcohol impression if mainstream perfumes smell like alcohol to you it could be the culprit rather than the perfumers alcohol it is extremely common but is also more velvety or cedary in some contexts. It is almost never listed as a perfume note and is sometimes just used to enhance the perfume overall but is often included in sandalwood or blond wood accords. But in indies where I think theres some Iso E Super it rarely bothers me as much as it does in mainstream scents so I dont worry about it. I dont know whether its because less is used or because the oil format doesnt make it as intense. Neither of them are found in allnatural perfumes so if youre still getting headaches with For Strange Women youll have to look for other culprits.,Indiemakeupandmore,dedlbz3,3,t5_2w8pb

11450250,0,t1_dftmwhh,Wow thats pretty blatant  good catch! Ill definitely start doing that as well when Im considering new shops.ampnbspTo add and Im probably being petty here but there seems to be a lot of copying from For Strange Women. The frosted glasspineconeshapedheartshaped bottles are identical not that theyre exclusive to FSW but I mean its IDENTICAL and having a scent called Summer Kitty? Really?ampnbspEdit The owner name is literally Lucy ElfenLied. ,Indiemakeupandmore,dftvkcw,8,t5_2w8pb

11553738,0,t1_dg573w8,Could you elaborate on why you use dry shampoo  more hair oil if your hair gets too oily? Instead of not putting more oil in it.

11604015,0,t3_65jdc3,Death Notes AlmondCherry they smell the same to me and thats just awful. Always like cough syrupy and strong as hell on me.  Leather Always really strong and overwhelming. Oakmoss This seems to read mens cologne on my skin which I love on my husband but less on myself.  Vetiver Ive yet to have a good experience with it.  Powdery anything If I see powdered anything in a description I know its not for me. Dream Notes Violet Affectionately my ride or die scent. It never goes powdery on my skin and just smells amazing.  Peach Not a fan of the food but love the scent.  Coconut With the caveat that it not be plasticky.  Gardenia easily a favorite floral for me. It smells just amazing on my skin.  Honey this is more recent since I thought I hated it but like always I was wrong. So perfect this spring for me. ,Indiemakeupandmore,dgbbp2i,3,t5_2w8pb
11621258,0,t3_65ubd1,Deconstructing Eden  No.  Vanilla bourbon absolute bulgarian rose absolute tonka bean butter poppy sheer white musksRose is such a tricky note in perfume for me I usually end up not liking it.  But this one is so nice!  I think its working because its not an inyourface rose its rose but a kind of watery rose if that makes sense its a light rose like fresh sweet wafting by in the breeze.  I think the tonka bean butter and vanilla bourbon must help this somehow.  The description I read for the scent of tonka bean butter is Very rich almondlike powderysweet aroma as of newly mown hay with a warm herbal and soft tobaccolike undertone.  I dont get almond here but maybe the hay is what neutralizes the rose a bit I dont know.  It doesnt come across as perfumey like rose usually does for me. Im bummed because it took quite a while to get my order she had to ship  orders in  days I guess! and now its gone from the shop boo ,Indiemakeupandmore,dgda3vh,5,t5_2w8pb

11711870,0,t3_66q3gj,After the reformulation a year ago the sales were very few so its not worth it for something which is very timeconsuming to produce.

11738335,0,t1_dgqjxuk,Yes I agree. From my perspective as a consumer if the sale is marketed as a singular and special occasion the likelihood of the pricequality comparison might be lessened because I know this sales isnt something that is the norm.

11747699,0,t1_dgrgl4y,Moonstone is really strong on me too. I usually put dabs everywhere trying to preserve scent on me and with Moonstone its like... lightly dab one wrist press wrists together oh no I put on too much. Interestingly even though my mom definitely lived in the s she thought Moonstone was an ancient scent. ,Indiemakeupandmore,dgrmqa5,1,t5_2w8pb
