When I Upsized my tires I changed the speedometer driven gear with one bolt and clip which are  speedway motors or ford dealer schematic part no.  tooth specific codes vary and available on ranger type forums  ford ranger tireaxle swap search . However upsizing tire size will drop your rpm at speed thereby horsepower available for acceleration. tiresizeconversion.com will give you a good idea of tire diameters to rim sizes with that you can do a simple ratio of current tire dianew tire dia.

Generally the stability control system relies on the ABS system. If you have a handheld oscope by chance you can test the wheel speed sensor. You might be able to use a multimeter as well but it depends. With a multimeter set it to read the voltage AC and set the range to like VAC.

Your philosophy towards it mirrors mine as well.  I love it more than any vehicle Ive ever owned and it has been a labor of love.  Ive done a ton of work to it and a lot of it has been a great learning experience.

My initial problem was that I would always try and rush to get a job done but my experience has taught me that I do a much better job when I take my time.  If you can go without the truck for a few days while youre working on something all the better.  My other advice is to invest heavily in good penetrating oil and a torch.

7857464,0,t3_4mrb21,If you intend to tow a car on a trailer I dont think this is the ideal vehicle for you. Once you factor in the combined weight of the car and trailer youll be well over the tow rating of the ranger. Coming from someone who has towed a car with theirs a short distance and mine is with the larger . motor the braking absolutely sucks and taking off from complete stop is brutal. I would not recommend it and wouldnt do it again. Also you say all the cosmetic rust has been fixed. Im not sure what you mean by that but if you can tell the cosmetic rust was fixed by looking at it then it definitely wasnt fixed correctly because if it was you shouldnt be able to tell it was ever repaired. As far as if the trucks worth it I cant really tell you. Your best bet is to look at some comparable ones on Craigslist and see what people are asking for them. I love my ranger. Its super fun to drive and Im actually looking at buying another newer one but if you want to tow a car I think you would be better off with a full size truck. ,fordranger,d3z906g,1,t5_2x2r3

Only  picture and something about the quality that I cant seem to put my finger on... They all look like they belong on a magazine cover or something not somebodys cell phone picture.  The other thing that tips me off is the odd number for pricing.  Nobody is going to put  in there that is actually for real at least from what Ive seen.  Open up Google Images and drag that image onto the search bar I guarantee it will show up on a bunch of other sites.  Or copy the description and paste it into Google surrounded by quotes and theres a good chance even that was ripped off of another ad.  A few months ago I found a  Cummins as clean as that Ranger with a lift tires and rims for  I think it was.
