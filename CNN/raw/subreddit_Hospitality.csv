I went through your website and my first impression is that from a consumer point of view when they book with you the experience is more like booking an allinclusive timeshare destination wedding or maybe a cruise. So I wonder if you shouldnt try to focus on BB marketing and try to get references and referral links on travel agent and destination management websites. If you dont have an established mailbox for your corporate office at your primary resort I would also see what it would take to get one and use that as the primary address for TAYelp and direct all your current attendees to submit their feedback there and lead with which trip they went on.,Hospitality,cm7z9a7,2,t5_2qxgy
