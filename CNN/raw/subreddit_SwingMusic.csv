Just an example though. dont get overwhelmed though start with majors get used to the instrument and move on you will get good in no time. Also do not forget to do long tones while it is easy to produce a sound on clarinet it is hard to produce a good tone on it all throughout its registers.,SwingMusic,cit46cx,2,t5_2tmjc
