205210,0,t1_cf1p959,Hasnt really seen a rise in his freshman numbers but still an overall great talent. BC coaching split up him and McCoshen since they are so low on good blueliners so thats hurt his effectiveness.

10357449,0,t3_5obsxl,Hi Folks Im uFreeCandyVanDriver a mod from the rwildhockey subreddit and I come bearing gifts again.You might remember that I posted my Weekly NHL Update last week and that I was also working on a larger project for the whole of the reddit hockey community.  Well that project is done  and  I have opened a new subreddit rNHLstatheads to host it.  rNHLstatheads does not allow any user submissions meaning that there is no other post other than the Daily NHL Update every day.  Its meant to just enable you folks to have literally every stat available to you in a single post  in fact it contains all the information in this post along with detailed breakdowns of each game that day viewing information for every game and a topfive NHL Individual stat leaders for  different stats.I would post the whole thing here but there is a ton of custom formatting that is required to have it all work. The goal was to make everything as slick and easy to read as possible you can see todays Daily NHL Update by clicking HERE. Anyways I hope that you enjoy these handassembled stats  and as always if you have any feedback either on the Weekly NHL Update or on the new subreddit rNHLstatheads please feel free to leave it here or PM me.Cheers  FCVDPS  Mods Please feel free to pull whatever tables of information from my Daily NHL Update on rNHLstatheads to use on your subreddit. These will continue to be posted everyday between AM and PM ET  all I ask is that you please just sort the source if you do so. The information and tables come preformatted for you. If you want all of the custom images to appear on your subreddit it will take some playing with the CSS. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have questions on how to do this.,FloridaPanthers,dci2smr,5,t5_2rqi7

Only scoring on two rebounds? Thats inexcusable. Not being able to even touch the puck in OT? Thats inexcusable.

11068028,0,t1_dembzmk,Hes by far the worst player we have when it comes to effort. Hes so lazy and skates so fucking slow. Jagr is slow but Jokinen is like molasses. He is lazy when he clears the zone and hes constantly taking penalties when he gets beat. I will say hes the player I hate on because he gives you so much to hate. Bench him and Bjugstad and bring up someone whos going to give you full effort and play smart. Watch jokinen take dumb penalties allllll day and give lack luster effort when clearing the zone. We dont need that shit while we try to steal a wildcard spot. ,FloridaPanthers,demjtsf,0,t5_2rqi7

11469144,0,t3_63oeod,My offseason wish list is something like this... . Before this team does ANYTHING.... Rowe. Gone. Nothing else needs to be said about that. . At the draft lets keep our pick. Draft isnt that deep but unless were getting a great deal for our top  pick then trade it. We can use some prospect depth as all our top prospects are in or making their way to the NHL. . Trade for a young goalie. Lu isnt gonna be here for long and Reimer is gonna need someone to back him up soon. I dont believe any of our Goalies in the system are anywhere near NHL caliber. Alternatively draft a goalie with our st  nd pick in the draft. . Get some help up front. Jagr probably wont be playing nd line minutes next season. Hes getting old. We need someone to fill his roster spot! Or bring back Vanek. I think hes been pretty good actually. GET RID OF KINDL FFS I NEVER WANT TO SEE HIM IN A PANTHERS UNIFORM AGAINThats pretty much it. Idk what else we can really get done. The expansion draft does throw in a curveball so we will have to see what happens with that before anything honestly. ,FloridaPanthers,dfw0sfu,1,t5_2rqi7
