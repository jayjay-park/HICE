6374538,0,t3_42ydv8,Ive had a vasectomy  years ago took a while to get comfortable mentally with the idea that I am really shooting blanks and cant get a women pregnant anymore. But it worked as advertised and I have not had any problems. I would think a desk job after  days would pose no problem at all!,Vasectomy,cze7r3r,2,t5_2uzy2

I stopped the pain killer the day before percocet is awesome to watch sports and read comic books with but I continued using tylenol when I needed it and kept using the ice pack and dialed back my activity for a few days.  ,Vasectomy,d7w4kod,2,t5_2uzy2
