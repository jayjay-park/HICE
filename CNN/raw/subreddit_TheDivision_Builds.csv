10368449,0,t1_dbbu8pt,Thats a cracking shout mate.In . i used xLS plus whatever and it was great using it with smart cover...As mentioned there is nothing sweeter than knowing you can chuck upto  rounds of death down range and if something does get up close whip out the shotty! With the added bonus of switching weapons quickly to get instant reload  awesome fun!! Was using  M and  at that time...Will give it another shot mate thank you ,TheDivision_Builds,dcjbqko,1,t5_3hwyi
