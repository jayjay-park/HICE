1935362,0,t3_2gr3ne,Theres also a stunning amount of brilliant innovative mathematical and engineering minds that have been squandered doing tasks that dont benefit society actually at all. Much of that is thanks to the efforts of  institutions like Harvard Business School. Where the best and brightest are set loose on society with a set of all the wrong motivations warped ethics and predatory goals.Its shocking to consider all the brilliant engineers pulled away from worthwhile lives for financial security in a very precarious economy. There are people with the intelligence to be engineering and reimagining the very fabric of society but instead due to market forces that talent is lost and benefits only the very wealthy. Squandered on elaborate schemes of finetuning market trading algorithms to help a CEO snatch an extra point of insider trading profit on a market churn. Or crafting military drone systems that kill quietly and anonymously. Or figuring out how to better skim data and snare customers money for a products or services that they dont actually need.The unquenchable demand for profit vs. survival has warped our societys ethos into increased profit at all costs the rest of humanity be damned.,ConcentrationOfWealth,ckmeci3,2,t5_32pp6
