165120,0,t3_1vyn3h,Stubbornness. It sounds bad but stubbornness used correctly is a brilliant thing. Say that you are going to achieve something get stubborn about doing it no matter what gets in the way it turns into persistence. Peer pressure at home work or socially pushing you to not do house work not follow safety rules do drugs or any other thing that you dont feel likeshouldnt be doing get stubborn about it and no one can push you in to anything that you dont want to do. Kind of turns into strength of character and confidence in your own decisions then. Want to learn about something and the book or video gets boring halfway through? Stubbornness will make you focus and finish it.Channeling your stubbornness can teach  you a whole bunch of positive traits.,Life,cex8n44,3,t5_2qr6q

But new cars are filtrating them better unlike open smokers   other related posts  about eating GMOs viruses this is another topic with bigger compounds and different mecanisms  Im trying to buy sane stuff but Im quite skinny this maybe explains sensibility to any kind of smoke,Life,ch37win,0,t5_2qr6q

2088239,0,t3_2hk9fl,I totally agree growing up in a religious family definitely had me realize this sooner but it was always instilled thats it is ok to change beliefs for your ideals to change but my relationship belief whatever you want to call it has always been individual with god. Church can be great but Catholicism has also ruined religion for many. Organized religion is our attempt at humanizing god. Like you said this is what causes wars. I could never understand what it meant in the bible to fear God but you hit the nail on the head. You have learned to fear God.,Life,cl59f9k,1,t5_2qr6q

4841408,0,t3_3h61nu,Your friend finished his work on earth and left the stage in a manner that leaves those of us left behind with a cry of agony in our hearts as the fragile thread of our faith is dealt with so violently. Is anyone strong enough to stay conscious through such teaching as you are receiving? Probably very few. And even they would only have a whisper of equanimity and peace amidst the screaming trumpets of their rage grief horror and desolation.I cant assuage your pain with any words nor should I. For your pain is your friends legacy to you. Not that he or I would inflict such pain by choice but there it is. And it must burn its purifying way to completion. For something in you dies when you bear the unbearable and it is only in that dark night of the soul that you are prepared to see as God sees and to love as God loves.Now is the time to let your grief find expression. No false strength. Now is the time to sit quietly and speak to him and thank your friend for being with you through your life and encourage him to go on with whatever his work is knowing that you will grow in compassion and wisdom from this experience. In my heart I know that you and him will meet again and again and recognize the many ways in which you have known each other. And when you meet you will know in a flash what now it is not given to you to know Why this had to be the way it was.Our rational minds can never understand what has happened but our hearts  if we can keep them open to God  will find their own intuitive way. Your friend came through you to do his work on earth which includes his manner of death. Now his soul is free and the love that you can share with him is invulnerable to the winds of changing time and space.May his soul find an incarnation he may live with.,Life,cu4sp5s,1,t5_2qr6q

5346950,0,t1_cvurnie,Ive never had a seizure in the past. However I may think this is a seizure caused by anxiety. I heard the gunshot from the gun my mother used to kill herself a year ago. Ive witnessed murder. Ive witnessed a woman setting her self on fire in a parking lot. Ive seen a little  year old get hit by a car when he ran into the street to get his brothers baseball. Ive seen things that I still can not forget. Also I have those deja vu moments as well. I see something in my life that I foresaw in a dream and my body shuts down for a second. Its almost confused. Like my body just became a paradox.But I think these are anxiety seizures. Im going to ask my doctor.,Life,cvv4t1n,1,t5_2qr6q
5396458,0,t3_3ouc52,Life is what you make of it. There is nothing that suggests that it is fair. It just is what it is. You see the glass either as half full or half empty. There are people whom are in worse situation than you and people whom are in better situation. The sooner you learn to take life for what it is and build from where you are right now the sooner youll enjoy everything. If you dont like something change it even if its small changes small changes over time makes big changes. Even the richest of the rich can be unhappy. The enjoyment in life is in the perspective. Everything can be changed and you can change yourself to be closer to whom and where you want to be. You just need to believe it enough to do something about it. Any excuses you make are only things stopping yourself for every excuse there is a solution if you want it bad enough. And if you dont make it in this life time atleast you died trying to achieve what you wanted.,Life,cw1ghc2,1,t5_2qr6q
5585583,0,t3_3r853u,I used to think like this too. I truly believed it was all pointless. I was certain that I was just a lone wolf type of person. After having spent a lot of my time in solitude with very little else but my thoughts I began to develop a longing for a partner. I wanted someone I could confide in someone who understood me and could accept who I am. I believe everyone eventually suffers a deep longing for this kind of acceptance. Marriages and relationships are agreements made by people who are willing to make those compromises that many others would not. If you ignore all the abstract and look at it more objectively you might see it as two people bonding together to become stronger. We pair up with someone else who supports us and accepts us and they empower us. We gain confidence we feel happier we feel accepted in the world. Its a mutually beneficial contract. I think when it comes down to it sex and physical attraction matter very little. Its the person youthey are thats important. Sex is great dont get me wrong but I feel like a relationship based on sex and appearances may collapse under the weight of many of lifes challenges.,Life,cwpfz3b,1,t5_2qr6q
