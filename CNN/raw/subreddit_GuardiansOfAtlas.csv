8970131,0,t1_d7pyxu9,The only reason it could be considered comical is that after three years of being developed Artillery games pulled the plug on Atlas within a month of being open to the public  Its crazy to think it went through so much time and effort only to fail now its kind of funny how much work went into it and to get so close to release that it falls apart as soon as people start to play it.,GuardiansOfAtlas,d7q2nub,15,t5_3cbzr
9129078,0,t3_54wmmo,I think the reason Atlas failed was largely due to lack of strong product marketingmanagement.This game suffered from a number of identity crises related to its image and place in the RTS cannon. Despite being wellbuilt and enjoyable at what it was trying to do it had few tools to grab and retain players in addition to being far too hesitant to embrace its own change of direction midship and properly temper player expectations.I have a laundry list of nongameplayrelated marketing issues with Atlas and while many of them were very small they added up over time.  And at least a few of them were critical issues that raised some big red flags for me. Everything from graphics and worldbuilding too afraid to look different than Starcraft resulting in a monochrome palette too little flavorstorylines to follow to lack of devPR blogs to lack of ladderranking tools to encourage people to keep playing to being too scared to apply the MOBA tag to the game until open Alpha hit. I wish I could have gotten my hands on their marketingconversion plan because I think parts of it were extremely sparse. ,GuardiansOfAtlas,d896czv,3,t5_3cbzr
