Just about everything is delicious and not outrageously priced. The orange chicken is my favorite. Pasta risotto pizza polenta garlic fries mini meatballs asparagus and all the party hors doeuvres always end up in our cart too. Its a little spendy but their sausages and premarinated meats in the fridge section are my fav for throwing on the BBQ.

517393,0,t1_cfywajo,gtThe popular meaning of the term third world has only recently shifted from meaning poor to meaning nonaligned.    Completely false Nasser died over  years ago. When he was alive and the Cold War was in full swing it was pretty clear what the term Third World meant. If anything the opposite of what you said is true. Third World came to mean poor as more and more poor countries joined the Nonaligned Movement and I could argue that the term became pejorative in the West due to its potential to threaten the neoliberal status quo. But history aside the popular definition remains poor  look no further than those subtly racist First World Problems and Third World Kid memes that everyone on this website is obsessed with.    And regardless of your implication the overwhelming majority of Egypt is poor and underdeveloped. Ive also never met an Egyptian who considered American fast food to be any kind of an indicator of success.

1138251,0,t1_chxn2be,Not that I agree with him or anything but for the sake of balance I would just like to say a few things.In his example I think he is implying that one would naturally ask Tom to help you lets say unclog a toilet and not Shelly. Although in nature that is sexist but thats the way it is. I doubt hes asking you to actively hate women.As for Women who play sports once again this is me just speculating I think he cant stand them the way that some people cant stand the so called Gamer Girls. Women who take more pictures of them holding SNES controllers then actually playing with them. In this case its women making thousands of sports related facebook posts. Using a medium that is considered to be male dominated in order to make themselves more interestingattractive. Im not saying that its true. Im just saying some people seem to think so. I dont think anybodys trying to argue against the rights of Women or their ability to enjoyplay sports but there is two sides to every coin. ,ExpectationVsReality,chxnwum,-34,t5_2t6xs

Theres a lot of reasons people get fat or stay fat. But its not like we decided we want to be that way. For me I try to eat well but I have major depressive disorder and all the things that suck about it make it really hard to do things like accomplish goals.

9613495,0,t1_d9y26me,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,ExpectationVsReality,d9y26rf,4,t5_2t6xs

10029874,0,t1_dbeugdp,Which is why using a scale is useful. For me its easier and more precise to say a serving is g and spoon out that much into a measuring cup and dump it on my plate so I can move on. It takes me a lot less time to rinse out my cup than to break it down by calories in a table spoon and its relatively easy to over fill and underestimate. A tablespoon of peanut butter can rapidly become  calories more depending how generous you take a spoonful to be. Not everyone cares about that though and not every method works best for everyone.

Hell even today a coworker became one of the Ten Thousand  Assuming that because you understand something everyone else should is not only the higest form of conceit its also extremely condescending.. Common Sense is defined by wikipedia as Common sense is a basic ability to perceive understand and judge things that are shared by common to nearly all people and can reasonably be expected of nearly all people without need for debate. I know tons of people who havent the slightest idea WTF an atom is.  Because atoms dont affect  of the population on a daily basis.  . If youve never worked in an Art related service industry.  MANY customers come in with a picture in their head and lack the tools to describe that image in their head.  Often lots of thingys and doodadas are used in the description.  The onus is on the shop owner to ensure they understand  what it is the customer is asking for this is absolutely a failing in OP. MerriamWebster defines literal as free from exaggeration or embellishment however you say literally the only thing that comes up but when you google you get dozens of different results sure they share a similar theme but if I was a baker I wouldnt know which one to pick!  Which of those are Science Atoms and which of those are Art AtomsAnyway theres literally nothing to argue about here.  uTimothyGonzalez was being a dick and I was merely pointing out that there are different points of view.  I agree with you that yea baker could have come up with something better than this...  And hell IM so guilty of YOU IDIOT! THIS IS SO OBVIOUS! WHY ARE YOU AN IDIOT!... but then when I take the time to figure out why it wasnt so obvious it usually turns out I did a shitty job training to begin with... So just remember.

I cant remember if I dryheaved after the first bite but just thinking on it makes me queasy. It was so disgusting I emailed the company a complaint. I felt like an old lady asking for the manager doing so but I sent in the lot number on the box and the store I bought them at because in my mind the packaging people or machinery at the plant they are made in should totally have a way to make sure there is actual food inside the thing right? Surprisingly they replied apologized for the experience and mailed me about  coupons for free Hot Pockets. It was a nice gesture but I gave them away to friends because I was against ever eating one again.
