Some will accept hzinput for p things but many will not. hz at k is the input and if the tv is a true hz panel will flash each frame twice. Nvidia supports  if your tv does but Im pretty sure amd cards do not. Again this only matters of your tv even supports it,4kTV,d1i45si,2,t5_2wowt
7345495,0,t3_4fv304,I have the same tv. I love it. But I have not really compared it to other k tvs or done much research prior to buying it. But i can say it is a solid tv excellent picture and k netflix looks great.,4kTV,d2d4rka,1,t5_2wowt
7433519,0,t1_d2molur,Yeah I know theres a dedicated linux distro specifically for Kodi but the HTPC doesnt have the graphical umph for k either way unfortunately! Im using a low cost low power AMD APU for the job currently and the MicroAtx motherboard doesnt even have HDMI . so only outputs k at fps which is a shame.I really did build it to be perfect for HD shame I didnt realise I would get k so soon!,4kTV,d2n56wi,1,t5_2wowt
9041316,0,t1_d7yi9rv,Well the option edge lighting ... well thats piss poor as well. If the local backlight might be distracting in parts of the screen in dark scenes edge lighting fucks up the whole screen.,4kTV,d7ymeig,1,t5_2wowt

9435127,0,t1_d9bvaod,That is the right one. Yeah everything else it looks amazing. Only time u can notice it is when its a solid white background ,4kTV,d9byv1o,1,t5_2wowt
9704442,0,t3_5e0exe,Another option is the Sony XD  for the  inch model gets slightly lower rating as the Samsung on RTINGS.com for some things but equal for gaming and K HDR.  I have one and Im happy with it.,4kTV,da9a40r,2,t5_2wowt
9719846,0,t3_5eb7re,Thats a good question.  at  feet is certainly small. A friend of mines living room is about that far away and he has a  I thought it was a  from that distance until I walked up to it so  might feel sort of like a .In terms of overall quality the  LG isnt anywhere near the OLED. So looking at it compared to its nearest comps  it has a great color gamut but very poor contrast. So for example a bright scene might have great colors but a dark scene with bright highlights or vice versa will just look okay. Its black uniformity is also poor.If you want to go with the  use the link below and select the LG UH Samsung KU Sony XD and Vizio MSeries. Just pick whichever one you like most. Only the Sony meets HDR requirements bit color channel with  color gamut. They can all receive HDR though so the LG will still look very good and the Samsung will get you better contrast but  worse color it has about  color gamut but its also the brightest with highest contrast ratio,4kTV,dab6krd,2,t5_2wowt
9802059,0,t1_dakluhv,LG models are the only ones that tempt me because every nonOLED TV I look at feels like theyre slapping the kitchen sink onto a sinking boat.  In the best cases blacks and contrast are still garbage.That said I need the TV to be between  and  inches since its going to replace a inch that I use as my monitorslashTV.  And I also need the input lag to be much better than the ms LG gets in nonHDR mode let alone the ms it gets in HDR.  My current TV gets ms.  It also happens to be an LG.Happily LG must now be painfully aware of the fact that they have an input lag problem and will almost certainly rectify the issue in future models.  Plus they dont seem to share Samsungs inexplicable input lag problems with  mode.  So all I need from them now is a smaller TV.,4kTV,dalbcf0,2,t5_2wowt
9837023,0,t3_5g5xeq,The apps on the tv support K some with HDR too for YouTube Netflix and Amazon etc.If you want the best K experience with HDR though a K BluRay player like the Samsung k or an Xbox One S will give you the highest quality with UHD HDR discs. ,4kTV,dapsby6,3,t5_2wowt
10349180,0,t1_dch4ioz,Thanks i figured it wouldnt be easy. I was just wondering if there was some type of device that you could somehow connect to my laptop to do what the graphics card and hardware is supposed to do i know wishful thinking but with technology these days..who knows  or if the only option is to upgrade my laptop. Otherwise will a USB play the file with everything being displayed at its fullest capability? I have a k tv that supports  bit just my laptop is lacking. ,4kTV,dch514k,1,t5_2wowt
10357267,0,t1_dchyhuq,I really appreciate the input. Im in similar upgrade situation as I have a  sharp from  that I never liked and these days seeing new Tvs makes my current tv look even worse. I am a fan of dark room for gaming and sometimes movies but it never is truly dark anyway. Good to know about the Netflix source as thats my only HDR source at the moment more so just future proofing my purchase for when HDR is more common in the coming monthsyears. Last question what method are you streaming these HDR? Built in software or external? Currently I have a fire tv box that supports K but fairly certain its not capable of HDR which is disappointing as I cut my cord and use the fire tv for most of my content. The rare time I want to watch cable I have a sling box at a family member house thats headless so its only controlled by me and I have accepted the quality will suck on a K as it max out at I assume p maybe  for the stream but is so minor in my daily tv needs I dont care I may get cable TV again when I move in April so K tv is a possibility. ,4kTV,dci21uk,1,t5_2wowt
10446715,0,t3_5plqu9,I just bought the KS last week  Im super happy with it. The blacks arent anything like the OLEDs Ive seen that said Im still super happy with them.I have the  version and use it for streaming with the Tizen apps and as my main computer display.,4kTV,dcs816q,2,t5_2wowt
10479100,0,t3_5q1pbe,Does it look the same when you sit directly in front of the TV instead of at such an angle?  Also do you have smart led set to high? ,4kTV,dcvwxb9,2,t5_2wowt
10498881,0,t3_5pw7xn,If you have no plans on purchasing something that also transmits HDR like an Xbox One S or PS Pro youll be fine with nonHDR and not only that but HDR is imperfect atm and will expand in the future as tech always does.     Also to reiterate Grimms comment the EF has limited HDR that also requires HDR to be transmitted via HDMI.    Note The potential deal breaker is input delay. If you do gaming of any kind the EF will be a struggle.,4kTV,dcy5q6w,1,t5_2wowt

11294324,0,t1_dfc4ol4,Thanks a bunch. I currently have an LG and it failed on me after  years. My old Samsung lasted . So Im leaning Samsung.I like how the Samsung is direct lit the edge lighting always bothered me on my LG. But the LG seems to please everyone who uses it.I hate shopping haha. I always feel the need tomorrow analyze everything. When really the differences are so minute that Im going to be happy either way. Im.just stoked to watch planet Earth  in k.,4kTV,dfc71pa,1,t5_2wowt
