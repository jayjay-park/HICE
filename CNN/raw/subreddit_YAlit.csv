I think if you like reading books that are different from the usual you are happy tostick with a book and like books that are well written then you should try it. Its part fantasy part adventure a time bit of romance. A sequal has just been published. ,YAlit,cfp2an9,1,t5_2shof

1151414,0,t3_27arum,Because its like the gateway drug of the book world. Even my friends who had never read a book in their entire life wanted to read it...and then they asked me if they could borrow other books! Its not a complicated book and honestly John Greens ideas arent even original but its the way he writes. I feel like most YA authors dumb themselves down when writing for our age group but John Green doesnt...he writes intelligently and drops hints about other literature and art like Sylvia Plath and Ren Magritte that make you want to know more. Honestly after I read The Fault In Our Stars I ordered The Bell Jar and spent an embarrassing amount of time googling The Treachery of Images. I may have even painted a version of it for my French class. Basically I love the book because John Green takes teenagers seriously and doesnt underestimate us when most other YA authors and adults in general do.,YAlit,chz5cp0,8,t5_2shof

1347162,0,t3_29381f,I think you should check out the author Kelley Armstrong. Shes great imo. She has several young adult series my favorite of which is the Darkest Powers trilogy she also has some awesome albeit more adult books that if you like these you should check out. Her book Bitten about werewolves is part of a series that I didnt love but Bitten is one of my favorites by her. Definitely more adult themed tho. Kristin Cashore has some fun books too I liked Graceling best. Another one Id check out is summers at castle auburn by sharon shinn. Those books are all fun theyre not as emotionally gripping as some of the other suggestions here which are all great ones too and are much more beach reads. Good luck on all your flights!,YAlit,cil66s0,1,t5_2shof

3022871,0,t1_cob9pq0,I think the first one is the slowest though all of them are written in sort of an oblique way.  The books kind of give you information surrounding a topic and leave you to fill in the blanks. Then again if youre not really a paranormal fan its likely that you wont enjoy the series   Hmm...paranormal for people who dont like paranormal  Ill have to think about that. You might like the Monstrumologist series by Rick Yancey again the first book is the slowest but the others in the series are very good and Vicious by V.E. Schwab.  Vicious in particular is very fastpaced.,YAlit,cobbg3i,1,t5_2shof

3769955,0,t3_33ko2v,I think its partly because of the Twilight effect and fan girls. We all know Twilight is one of the shittiest series there is but crazy fan girls will rate the books very high. I am allowed to say that because I was one of those crazy fan girls. The entire series currently has a total of . stars Its funny because I recently posted a thread discussion asking if anyone had any favourite book series they recently realized were actually awful and one user said that she used to love the Vampire Academy series but when she went back to read them she realized that they were really trashy yet they all have a rating of  stars or higher.So I think that its that plus nostalgia.

The books are deep and layered with mythology but can be enjoyable without delving into the apendecies. Try starting with the Hobbit. He wrote that first and its what happens before the main story. Also LOTR isnt really considered YA. If you dont feel youve gotten a satisfactory reply try asking rfantasy.,YAlit,cvcgrdg,5,t5_2shof

A love triangle where the MC ends up with someone you didnt want Hmm. I dont know. I really wanted Feyre together with Tamling but I have changed my mind so much. I love Rhysand now so I guess that doesnt count?A popular book genre you rarely reach for Romance. Holy shit I have read so many poor books in the romance section. A popular author you cant get into Amy Plum. I really loved her at one point but my reading has changed and now I really dont like her writing at all. Popular trope youre tired of seeing Kickass heroine who hooks up with many guys and throws down a government. Popular series you have no interest in reading No one really. I usually try books but if they dont match with me I just throw them away. The saying goes The book is always better than the movie but what movieseries do you prefer more than the book? LoTR.One series that you think EVERYONE should pick up Alanna The First Adventure or Nobodys Goddess. Maybe Red Rising as well? I love me some Michael Sullivan as well but that isnt YA.,YAlit,d2zxaan,1,t5_2shof

Tamlin didnt tell her about her needing to fall in love with him to break the curse not totally under his control but still and she never faulted him for it. Ugh. At least it worked out in the end!How on earth am I going to wait a year for the next book to come out?!

9862800,0,t1_dat4jl1,Two elements that cross all genres characters and back story. Make me like the characters. If I dont like the characters I wont finish the book. Antiheroes have become popular in tv shows. Im not interested. Im not asking for a perfect boy scout or a student that gets As and never breaks a rule. The characters can be flawed. I like quirky characters personally. I love the captain of the tv series Firefly. The adults in Sharon Creechs Ruby Holler or Deborah Wiles Love Ruby Lavender had some odd habits that were endearing. Make me care for your characters want to root for them want to know what happens next to them.Back story is the lore of the story. In Star Wars there is lots of back story around the Jedi Knights and even Lukes past that slowly get revealed as you move through the story. In Harry Potter she refers to things that happened in the past as if it was history. Even in a contemporary fiction you can have back story. Elise Broachs Shakespeares Secret and John Greens Fault in Our Stars have backstory. In Fault in Our Stars they refer to previous girlfriends or an author shes loved for years. By including back story the tale seems more real and with more depth. ,YAlit,dat5944,4,t5_2shof
