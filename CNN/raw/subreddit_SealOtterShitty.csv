7169873,0,t3_4dipmw,okay! comments!personally i think shes wonderful! my only comment would be that as a T you can feel free to up her combative stats a bit. My suggestion would be something like keeping most of her bodys stats normal human but making her wings really strong and tough. So for example she would be able to fold her wings in front of her to block attacks of hit someone with her wings or carry heavy things while flying as long as she isnt using her arms to do it like if its strapped to her. Still its up to you!,SealOtterShitty,d1t5be8,2,t5_3c666
