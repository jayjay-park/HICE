1261320,0,t1_cibidsn,And out of the other side of your mouth saying but what I said was true. The Fryes and I hold fairness above all else when we make decisions for the league. We talked for days before launch about what would be the best way to go about doing team selection so to have you surprise calling it out as unfair and complaining about it is really frustrating and it feels like a slap in the face.You can claim that we are just debating semantic differences or that you are just being honest and that edge of the sword sometimes cuts people the wrong way. Thats not the case. There are plenty of people who give us honest constructive feedback that is actually valuable and helpful. We are frustrated because it seems like no matter what happens no matter how fair we try to be and how many people in the league support our decision there has to be some sort of negativity coming from you. ,MaddenBros,cibiinv,3,t5_325aw
