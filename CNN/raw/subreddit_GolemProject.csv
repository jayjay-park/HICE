10436888,0,t3_5p0l1m,Does anyone know when GNT will be able to get on the market? Is it when the brass golem will be available on the mainnet? May ?,GolemProject,dcr3c08,2,t5_3emre
11301676,0,t1_df50zlw,Just the fact that Golem can be used as decentralized rendering service with a network consisting of millions of computers from all around the globe gives small space for competition to get any bigger.,GolemProject,dfd10zy,1,t5_3emre
11322327,0,t1_dffcvw5,No problem!  That is correct and yeah it looks like Etherchain only shows Ether holdings.  EtherScan has a little View Tokens Balance amp Value button that will show you all of the Tokens in your Wallet.  The Wallet is like a grocery basket can store eggs bread milk etc.MyEtherWallet will also show all of your Wallets holdings.  Here is a guide from my blog that goes over it   .  Havent updated in  a while but if you find it helpful I might be inspired to write up some more guides,GolemProject,dffd7gc,3,t5_3emre
11340382,0,t3_61u5q5,Not a problem at all   I fully expect mining activity to form the baseline for golem mining prices the same way that Amazon spot pricing currently has a lower bound equivalent to the cost of mining various altcoins.If someone has something more important to do than Monero mining or whatever theyll have to offer up contracts that pay slightly more than Monero mining would cost.,GolemProject,dfhev4h,4,t5_3emre
11354127,0,t1_dfixho9,Wow you should always be critical in your thinking. This is just a sincere question as I am genuinely interested in how Golem is unfolding and what the practical applications might really be. Also because I cannot understand the whitepaper to the full extent myself I am turning to the community to address these questions and find out whether or not this really is a problem. As I also looked back in the whitepaper I could not get a clear answer on this matter. For your interests the project he is on isJust to indicate this is from my own experience and interests and not just a golem hit piece.,GolemProject,dfiywjm,4,t5_3emre
11356735,0,t3_6218rd,Strictly speaking this is BS. No programming language is required for any arbitrary task. As long as it is Turing complete it will do the job. Your source must have meant library availability and or runtime efficiency. Ie there are high quality code libraries written in python for protein folding so most just use them. There is nothing stopping anyone from implementing the same algorithms in any other programming language.Some tasks might be easier to implement or run more efficiently in a particular languageparadigm or even ecosystem like the JVM world but to claim it required is a step too far Anyways Golem will use Docker containers and eventually users can run whatever they God damn please inside ,GolemProject,dfj9jvi,14,t5_3emre

11751257,0,t3_67chx3,A decentralized platform and token allow easy market valuation of computing power and said power would be able to be traded as a commodity like gold or food.  Centralization would make this very difficult or impossible.,GolemProject,dgs192s,3,t5_3emre
