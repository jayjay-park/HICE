4668326,0,t1_ctik302,I think we would be dominant in a conference like this in football but wed probably be even worse off than we already are in basketball.,WeArePennState,ctizv2p,1,t5_398xw

9692641,0,t3_5dwf6x,Rutgers might be one of the worst Division  teams this year that I have ever seen.  Having said that I think a shutout is very valuable in the eyes of the committee no matter the circumstances usually teams can at least muster a field goal.  Hell even Chattanooga has  against Bama right nonw.  With the Louisville upset and everyone else taking care of business in the top  I dont see us moving backwards but we may get jumped with OU winning over a ranked team today by a wide margin and being undefeated in conference play.  Colorado also won against a ranked team but I dont see them jumping us.,WeArePennState,da7tnyq,17,t5_398xw
9714117,0,t1_daa9eep,Yes.  ways. Both involve winning the big ten.. Win the Big Ten and get selected over Ohio State due to hh win.. Win the Big Ten and get selected WITH Ohio State.Both scenarios are being talked about by a lot of people. Problem is not a soul outside of the committee knows what the committee will do.,WeArePennState,daah4cl,5,t5_398xw
9746157,0,t3_5ep297,Im cautious about this game but my gut says Penn State wins by . I just dont think MSU is going to be able to move the ball. Their passing game is awful and PSU is going to sell out and stop the run as much as possible. I think Barkley feasts and we see McSorely get quite a few yards on the ground for the first time in awhile as well. Bonus bold prediction Sanders takes a kickoff to the house. Hes been close a few times this year its gonna come sooner or later. ,WeArePennState,daefcwy,7,t5_398xw
