5552797,0,t1_cwky4nv,Do you know what the kardashev scale is? gtThe Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilizations level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to utilize. The scale has three designated categories called Type I II and III. A Type I civilization uses only resources available on its home planet Type II harnesses all needed energy from its local star and Type III of its galaxy. The scale is only hypothetical but it puts energy consumption in a cosmic perspective. It was first proposed in  by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev. Various extensions of the scale have been proposed since from a wider range of power levels types  IV and V to the use of metrics other than pure power.It says means that no vision of the future meaning a science fiction universe in a book or a movie can be taken seriously if the civilisation depicted as being of the Type II on the kardashev scale but not being a communist society.,SPACECOMMUNISM,cwldify,2,t5_351pw
