9438825,0,t3_59ytvx,The unfortunate reality of the situation is Phil wont be around for much longer he has a year tops before things get really bad for him financially and I dont see him making a comeback. I believe that ending the podcast before Phil is forced to look for other sources of income is the right move. At the same time I like you and a lot of other people miss the podcast and I wish we could get a monthly podcast or at very least an emergency podcast considering Phils current situation. With the SoK weekly podcast ending and Tevin seemingly not uploading nearly as much I feel like weve lost the big voices of this community. The question is will the community continue if Phil is no longer entertaining us daily with shitty gameplay and I dont know if it can or should.,SonsOfKojima,d9cfrmi,6,t5_3ei5r
