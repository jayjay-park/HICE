691908,0,t1_cgitsk0,I agree with you on almost everything. The damper is a personal choice and at that kind of money it should be thought about quite hard. If youre a good rider without it or only do tracks then maybe its worth it. Otherwise spend the money on good gear and maybe an msf or sportbike class.
