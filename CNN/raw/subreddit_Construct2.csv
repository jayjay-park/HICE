3028624,0,t3_2uu0og,Google play is pretty hard to crack.  Especially for a solo developer with little to no marketing budget.  There are a lot of issues with the Google play store.  One is that there are just so many shovelware titles that it is hard to get noticed.  Also your description is really important.  I assume your game is Hootie Impossibly Tall Forest.  In that case you should add a larger description.  Be careful with it if you name drop than you can get banned if you make a description like Mario Flappy Birds this game is like Candy Crush... you will probably get in trouble from Google.  So make sure it is a unique and relevant description.Another thing that really helps is a game play video.  I hate making gameplay videos but even a shitty one made with windows move maker I think you can still download it from microsoft but I cant remember... will get you more downloads then no video at all.Google Play Store is definitely a lot better for developers with well known apps and experience but it really is rough for newer entries.I hope I havent discouraged you.  You can definitely have better results if you put a lot of work into marketing contacting press talking about the app on twitterreddit etc. and get more experience that way.  You should hangout at rgamedev there are a lot of great discussions over there.  You can take part in weekly screenshot feedback and marketing threads and meet people that can help you.finally there is randroiddev which has much more specific advice for your question.edit oops I missed the fact that you already have a video disregard that part,Construct2,cobwxra,3,t5_2tnr8

3560583,0,t3_2zyusj,You could make an invisible square on the right side and when you touch it you would create another invisible object lets call it object. When you release the finger you destroy this object. but when its on screen create bullets at player.x player.y and make angle towards object.Xobejct.Y. That should fix the problem of multiple fingers.,Construct2,cpy4rc1,1,t5_2tnr8

8785704,0,t1_d73vic1,...as long as you dont try to make it a moddable wide world highquality D graphics thing like Skyrim. You would also encounter trouble when trying to make a Minecraft or a GTANot even close lol! There is Unity or Unreal for these kind of things anyway using a framework like C doesnt make much sense in my honest opinion. I dont plan to move on these anytime soon a large teamwork is required for these usually. A pixel game that isnt nor too big nor too small would be my main focus. At least on this im realistic.Ill see what to do anyway. The fact that is said that after the project becomes consistent enough everything begins to lag scares me a bit but after all i may not encounter these problems at all. Even because as ive written my ideal game doesnt get past the typical SNES sidescroller with not many fancy effects even because i prefer to draw them rather than doing them procedurally and everything will be scaled down to a x resolution therefore very tiny sprites.Regrading different engines i believe some stuff may be more suitable for other engines. For example i really liked GMStudios scripting tools flexibleness which is very handy but the IDE itself is truly terrible full of outdated features and bugs and even the developers there know that needs a total revamp. Im still learning GMs scripting tool anyway because i feel its important if i want to know how to make some tasks in videogames in general.,Construct2,d73vwko,1,t5_2tnr8

9604980,0,t3_5cetc5,Functions are your friend and they are a lot more powerful than most people utilize them for. Early on probably because of the name functions I got stuck thinking they are mostly useful for things like number or array processing like shuffling an array but they can work for most screen elements manipulation just as well.One clue is almost any time you find yourself using copy and paste for multiple lines on an event sheet you should be setting up a function instead. Also I like to set them up anytime the code gets too complex or long. On any complex project you can put the functions in included event sheets along with any global variables otherwise hide them in groups inline but at the top. Much of the rest of your code becomes short sequences or calls to much longer functions. Those calls are where sequencing is determined so functions can appear out of sequence in your code because of that. Again hide them outside of your main code flow because the goal is to reduce that visual clutter.Here is a video not mine that shows passing parameters to control individual sprites just to give you a taste of the possibilities for controlling actual game elements. ,Construct2,d9x0dsw,4,t5_2tnr8
