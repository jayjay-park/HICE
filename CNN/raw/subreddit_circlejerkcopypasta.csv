That said the IB at my school fucking sucked and made it harder to get into university because the credits dont translate very well into UCAS points.

2468315,0,t1_cmfahv0,Theyre trolling and spamming. Since theyre breaking the reddit rules theyll probably get shut down for it.Im not trolling. I actually lived precisely the life Im describing. I cant even imagine how anyone would say its trolling or crazy. I dont even live  of the daily danger a  year old does in Chicago or Detroit. Do you think theyre crazy for having their hard lives that if they describe it...would you pretend one of them actually made it up and mock himher?Would you really?Now whos the troll?,circlejerkcopypasta,cmgs7la,1,t5_2ugsq

3739432,0,t3_336eb3,Hes got a point. Theres a gigantic taboo around pedophilia even though it cant be cured predicted or avoided. If you had shittier luck you could be a pedophile. Its something that the individual has basically no power over and yet its stigmatized to the extreme in our society. Admitting to owning CP is probably on the same tier as admitting to donating to ISIS in terms of social acceptability even though most pedophiles never hurt anyone. No love for pedophiles but maintaining extreme and unexamined taboos over something people cant control is a bad way to run a society. ,circlejerkcopypasta,cqiipmw,1,t5_2ugsq
3740292,0,t1_cqiipmw,Owning CP is hurting someone. Doing so should be stigmatized. I agree  that we should treat this issue smarter therapy first rather than punishment later and maintain some compassion. I am very frustrated because reddit cant get nuance long enough to think that and that doing pedophiley things is still bad.,circlejerkcopypasta,cqim91j,12,t5_2ugsq
