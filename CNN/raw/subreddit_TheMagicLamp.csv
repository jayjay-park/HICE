I do not eat lettucesI am a thousand expired lettuces that I ate.I am the diamond glints on lettuces.I am the sunlight on ripened lettuces.I am the gentle autumn master lettuce.When you awaken in the mornings lettuceI am the swift uplifting lettuceOf quiet birds in circled lettuces.I am the soft lettuce that shine at the supermarket.Do not stand at my grave and eat lettucesI am not there. I did not eat lettuce.,TheMagicLamp,czmd7c1,1,t5_3ca7l
