Bass Hit classic sirendistorted formant lead now part of KPs sound which instantly switches from ths to ths in an angry synth pattern teasing arps here an there the more into the drop you are more details come in then after the agressive drop is done a massive switch happens and now you got a melodic talking lead over some beautiful chords.After the second part of the drop a big breakdown comesVocal noise FX here and there and an epic piano starts to fade in the natural claps alongside and then another completely different arp section no repetition on this one just epicness once its over the very last arp notes loop and fade into the buildup just like the first one but with more things going on a background kick the piano slowly fading out andHere we go again the second drop note changes the first part of the lead is not an octave higher the big snare hit is now followed by a nice vocal chop saying whoa! more note changes more vocal chops and back to the arp section just no more woops here instead more vocals! this time Robs highly altered ones.OutroWhite noise sweep just like the first breakdown the drums keep going the hihats change from rds to half beat and theres a new background vocal chop going alongside a nice piano every th beat slowly fading out and a single note of the breakdown arp here and there ending with a big snare hit and the vocal noise...Rage Valley is awesome!,knifeparty,dges12n,12,t5_2tl0z
