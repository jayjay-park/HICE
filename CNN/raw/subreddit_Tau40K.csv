9941715,0,t1_db3f6ut,Didnt notice the Commander cant join the Riptide  my bad. Revised the list your thoughts? Fire Warriors is  points with BKR  with the turret. Shit editing on my part kind of unclear.,Tau40K,db3fhim,2,t5_2y5lg
9994091,0,t1_daxs99v,Yeah but it gives the buff to the suits so it makes sense to keep them within ,Tau40K,dba9ans,1,t5_2y5lg
10018983,0,t3_5j4m14,For tau I just run  kroot with sniper ammo and  stealth suits. Infiltrate on  units is hilariously good in kill team. ,Tau40K,dbdi2s8,1,t5_2y5lg

10482020,0,t3_5q4czg,Could you post your list? Might be easier to troubleshoot issues that way and develop strategies. Basically high rate of fire template weapons and take out synapse support. Take out synapse and the endless swarm will collapse. ,Tau40K,dcw8u6v,1,t5_2y5lg
10745241,0,t1_ddo9txb,OSC is a stellar antitank option. Piranha with heavier weapons sounds about like the right kind of conventional vehicle but I think heavier armor on its front would be necessary given its primary target.,Tau40K,ddoag7z,1,t5_2y5lg
11698060,0,t1_dglsydh,Breachers in a devilfish is one of the best distraction units in the game. Love the list anyways nice and fluffy and not too powergamey. Good luck! ,Tau40K,dglzs2t,2,t5_2y5lg
