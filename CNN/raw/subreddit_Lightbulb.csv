597894,0,t3_20xozy,This is actually something that a company I used to work for looked into.I wasnt directly involved so the details are sketchy but there are three major reasons why this wouldnt work. As ubragis said it just isnt anywhere economical enough. Wind turbines like a constant breeze to maintain output. Even with constant traffic the wind would be extremely turbulent and wouldnt provide a constant flow of electricity. linked to the previous point Wind turbines dont really start producing useful electricity until you can maintain a wind speed above  or  ms. Anything below this and the output is so low that it cant really overcome the internal working of the turbine. You would never be able to achieve that type of consistent wind speed with this approach. These  reasons are why wind turbines located in urban environments even on tall buildings usually perform very badly.In general the bigger the turbine and the more consistent the breeze the better the performance and payback.Great idea though!,Lightbulb,cg88fvb,3,t5_2skxw

Anything else?Its as if someone proposed changing the alphabet system for English. The letter C is to be eliminated with an S or K being used instead.

1782121,0,t1_ck3rlnj,It makes perfect sense.Netflix costs  per month for a subscription.Netflix pays royalties to the producers of the content the stream.But obviously they dont disclose how much they pay in royalties per view.So lets just say that it averages out to . per episode of a TV show that someone watches.So if you watch  TV show episodes per month then Netflix pays  in royalties for the media you consumed and they profit  per month.If you watch  tv episodes per month then Netflix pays  in royalties for that content and actually loses money on your subscription for that month if you have the  plan.And if a month goes by where you dont watch any Netflix then for that month Netlfix pays  in royalties and your entire  subscription fee is  profit. So it may not be their business model to sell subscriptions and then discourage users from actually viewing any content but the less content you do use the more money they make. So probably somewhere inside Netflix corporate structure there is a department that watches these ratios and strategizes about how to optimize them  which either means selling plans to people who probably wont use them or figuring out ways to slow down people who are consuming too much content. One such strategy is the way that on some devices the next episode will start automatically and on other devices when an episode ends it waits for your to indicate that you are still watching by clicking to start the next episode.,Lightbulb,ck3sgrp,2,t5_2skxw

2180329,0,t3_2k0dik,I had an idea that I think would do this as a sideeffect.  You create an extension that lets you track the price of a product alerting you when it reaches a price but also sharing that threshold with retailers.I see it working as follows from a users perspective. Youre on a website like Amazon and see a product you want  lets say a Wii U for ... You press the Extensions button and that product is added to your list of tracked items.. You can optionally choose a price that youd like to pay for an item lets say .. When the price of the item lowers say to  you get notified.. When the price of the item lowers to less than or equal to your threshold  you get notified in a more loud manner.Deals are done with retailers like Amazon so that information from the extension is shared with them presumably for a fee maybe referrals if you wanted to make money out of this.  They get to see how many people are watching their products and what their thresholds are set at.  Therefore they can clearly see how much certain price drops will make them using a people that go through with it multiplier of lt .So the idea is that customers will have an incentive for not impulsebuying to consider their purchase more as theyre on the lookout for a bargain.  At the same time bargains would be more likely to occur as retailers can reasonably accurately gauge demand increasing the value of waiting for customers.,Lightbulb,clgz0zf,2,t5_2skxw

Plus therere subjects that need an specific class music PE IT....   If you keep students in the same class it wont make a difference in their cooperation. Cooperation comes from colective tasks and the actual educational system isnt much about cooperation but about to work individually.  About bullying parents and teachers should teach them ethics and moral. If they learn to respect other people bullying will stop.   Bullying is a far more deep issue since its also related to the social structure. In places like the USA theres a more defined structure than in Spain personal experience.

Not to mention Target Home Depot Anthem Ashley Madison etc...From a cost perspective even if Tinder covered some of the costs those costs would still be passed on to the end user.  So youd still end up paying some amount to have the badge.  I know you talked in general about the expiration after  months but there is a lot of psychology that goes into a users decision. If I only get tested every  months does that mean Im more or less sketchy than someone else?  Would a monthly test or more recent test then become a signal of a better quality match?  If so then wouldnt more people get tested more frequently?  Even though medically it might not be necessary or even recommended?  Would Tinder then just pay for  tests a year and the user then pays for the rest?  Would people just avoid testing?  Could a person get tested for some frequently like chlamydia and others just once a year like hepatitis.  Would having different badges and different expirations result in information overload?

5193552,0,t1_cvax7dv,I agree that The Hive manner of organizing family life will not prevent all hurts. Sometimes a guy will pine for a woman he met once who never called back. The woman has to make the calls for dates two and three. Sometimes the woman will call and the guy will politely say he is seeing someone else. He might be or he might just not want her. That will sting but it was just one coffee.I already said these people are tired of dating. They have already paid their dues of hurt and disappointment. Children may be affordable in other parts of the world but local conditions vary hugely and they sure arent affordable to the class of people I described. This thread isnt about global population. A few hundred more middle class American children wont be a sin against mankind. Thats a completely different discussion. As for Liberace if having personal style deep into advanced age is your point I am all for it. Yes. When he was in a club he was being PAID. He was a professional. These people are DOING the paying. It is very different.People have a right to something that is theirs alone such as spouse and children. They arent sterile worker bees. Thats another kind of hive. This one is human. You are right wonderful men dont have jobs too. I dont know what to do about that. The Hive can only be useful to some people. Traditional marriage such as in the Hive can benefit from the social positivism and strength and interpersonal guarantees offered by religious engagement. Of course nothing is ever guaranteed! But a common cosmic vision can help a couple stay together other things being equal. It doesnt solve everything but it helps.There is no need to reinvent the wheel. One can find a way to mine the past for what worked then while doing it your way because you live now. And I emphasized that coercion and fanaticism arent whats useful I think the phrase was plain vanilla sincere simple Christianity. And there may be a lot of different Hives. Each with their own character. There may be an Atheist Hive. Fine. All flavors are fine. I repeat the goal is children. And longterm stable married happiness. ,Lightbulb,cvc0m5g,1,t5_2skxw

Its relatively mild compared to what Ive seen with other people but the idea of flying scares me and creates a lot of stress  not necessarily while I am in the air but mainly the months and weeks leading up to a flight... My imagination really screws with me. From  to  I had a job that required frequent air travel... so as you can imagine this played on my nerves often. About six years ago I bought MS Flight Simulator X a few months before I was slated to go on a  hour flight to the Philippine islands. It really helped. I dove into it and learned a lot about aviation. I became more confident I learned a lot about the phases of takeoff landing etc. Suddenly those strange sensations and mechanical noises made sense. I eventually became a flight sim hobbyist.Ive actually always wanted to be a pilot and if by some miracle I ever have the money and time I would still try. Flying doesnt scare me as much as not being in control of things myself.

7837926,0,t1_d3wrcln,gt So youre excluding prepaid phones? What if someone with a prepaid phone tries to activate for a legitimate emergency?When did I say they would be excluded? They are included just like any other regular  call done on a prepaid phone.gt How would the operators be trained? Youve already said a noresponse would procedurally and automatically track the plane. What would happen if the operator makes a mistake and categorizes a real high jacking as a nonemergency? Do we have another  Sep  style attack?How would they be trained is obviously not up to me but once the call is made the plane would tracked. Im sure there are some obvious points that would detail a highjacking. If not someone on the plane would be contacted to check out the situation. Mistakes happen there is no denying that.gt Its mentioned in another comment that this technology already exists for transponders. These are controlled by a limited amount of flight crew that are held responsible for their usemisuse. Maybe this can be expanded to a certain number of cabin crew but you dont want to give this sort of power to the public. These transporters are for pilotprivate use only from what I understand. They can be expanded for when someone uses a  call.gt Also Im not sure if you know this but civilian mobile phone GPS transponders are by law I believe programmed to shut off when traveling above a certain speed mph comes to mind to ensure phones cant be used to guide missiles. How would you override that programming without risking misuse of that safeguard?I was not aware of this mostly because Ive done the usual turn on your GPS on your phone and see where you are at and of course it doesnt refresh nearly as fast or is as accurate but it still works.Also the phone orand its GPS would not be tracked as like you said consumer made devices are probably not suited for that. GPS locking would be on the plane itself. I might not have worded that correctly.gt Regardless this is a clever idea on paper but cant really survive in reality. There is no reason that a highjack number cannot exist even if it is simply to alert ground that there is a potential hijack situation and alert the pilot.,Lightbulb,d3x1tqq,1,t5_2skxw

You dont want the wheels of a vehicle carving up the road surface every time it drives along it.Basically I dont see that theres really anything you can make a tyre out of that will constructively build up a road surface especially without being destructive to the original surface.
