6829764,0,t3_49anv7,I dunno. I still hold that were in a renaissance for cartoons. New productions have been popping up all over the place the past few years and thats bound to produce a wide variety of quality.I attribute WoYs cancellation to the one constant of the cartoon industry corporate idiocy. ,WanderOverYonder,d0qgcw8,12,t5_2ujnf
7155670,0,t1_d1rin49,Why are you defending this point? All shows exist to make money. Welcome to a Western Capitalist society. This point is null amp void.Yes kids like it and thats a problem. They shouldnt be exposed to something so brainless in its morals. The first few seasons of Spongebob were good for example but as time went on the show began losing its standing ground.gtThe only thing you can do about this is show the kids actually good shows so they dont watch this one TTGAnd this is exactly right,WanderOverYonder,d1rj2nq,2,t5_2ujnf
9465793,0,t1_d93j9wt,Right I forgot Beeza was in the finale. That is somewhat of an oversight then. Still if he had become Busted then Beeza and co. wouldnt even be there so something mustve happened in between that allowed them to part ways hopefully safely.,WanderOverYonder,d9futnp,1,t5_2ujnf
