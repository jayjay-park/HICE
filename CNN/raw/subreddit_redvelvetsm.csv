8637716,0,t3_4wndoi,She looks great! Joy too! I know people are worried that shes unhealthy but she has a very petite frame. Not to mention that having an Asian body type means that healthy for her will be very different from a Western person. Just because she was heavier before doesnt mean that shes unhealthy if she loses weight. Its interesting that when a thicker idol loses weight it causes people to worry that theyre unhealthy while the many other idols that have always been tiny dont get a lot of mention. Dont worry guys SM wont let anything bad happen to her!,redvelvetsm,d6lbmkg,1,t5_32rze
