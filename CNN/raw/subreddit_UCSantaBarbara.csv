69663,0,t3_1ut6yd,Heres how you get those crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside breakfast potatoes. Chop potato into cubes. Boil potato cubes for  minutes or so depending on how soft you want them. Drain throw into preheated pan with oil use high heat!. Fry for a while until they start to brown. Throw in your desired seasonings I use some chopped green onion garlic and pepper flakes.. Cook for a while but dont burn the garlic and other additions!The boiling is the key.  Otherwise youll miss that nice internal texture or it will take forever to cook.  Once you boil them they dont need that much time to fry up.Best of luck!,UCSantaBarbara,cemcz2w,1,t5_2shs9

522453,0,t3_203yo9,I am an out of state student and I have good news and bad news. The bad news is you will almost definitively receive no grants and your loan amount is going to be negligible around k. Therefore youll probably look at about k a year and approximately k to obtain a college degree which is wayyyy too much. Some oos students do have the funding and come to party because of sugar daddies and such but that is not all the oos students which brings me to the good news. First is there seems to be a trend at UCSB to get more oos students and one way is to accept more so youre probably in from the financial side most oos students that are smart find a way I cant speak for all them although I know a few that got good scholarships from other sources. In my case I knew exactly what degree I want and made a plan and mapped out the exact classes I needed to take as a result I made a plan where I am only a fulltime student for one year and a parttime student for the next two years on top of Summer School which is cheap and doesnt have oos tuition because I had  credits coming in from college courses in high school and AP tests and only need to pay about k to get my degree which is less than the average private school cost but much higher than public school cost either way the more studying and work you put into your future the easier it becomes to do amazing things like attend the school of your dreams good luck to you.,UCSantaBarbara,cfznpfj,4,t5_2shs9

If you dont think it is realistic to have a life with this person like that then do something amazingly fun before you leave to college then split up.

2236036,0,t3_2kr5h9,gti really would rather major in history or english but I just feel like they are so much more impractical than science math or engineering.They are much less practical than STEM fields. It doesnt mean they arent worthwhile but it does mean that theyre harder to monetize. My sister did her degree in English and shes doing pretty well working in publishing now but it took her about  years doing menial work at an insurance company to get there.As for enjoying science and math No offense but I dont really think you know whether or not you enjoy them. To be perfectly frank what you did in high school amounts to about as much as bingewatching NOVA documentaries on Netflix. The case is only slightly better if you took AP Chem andor Physics. Id recommend that you take general chemistry or freshman physics or bio whatever floats your boat before you make a decision on whether or not you really like them. I started off undergrad as a music majorenglish minor before I took gen chem and decided I liked it much better.If youre already taking one of these and youre struggling with the material for your first midterm I suggest you read what Im about to write. If youre afraid to take them because the classes have a reputation for being hard I suggest reading it. If you just dont really have any interest in STEM subjects then just go register for a major you want and figure it out later.One thing to take into consideration when reading the below Im in the middle of an allnight fellowship application writing session so my explanation is extra longwinded and crotchety. There are a few main reasons we have a huge attrition rate in general chemistry classesFirst most students who think of themselves are reasonably intelligent and probably were never challenged in high school. When they come up against a class which requires them to really study not to just memorize the date of the Battle of Hastings October th  the day before the exam and forget it afterward. STEM subjects are challenging and the classes are heavily cumulative. You cant just forget everything over the summer and expect to come into your next class and be okay. Students often incorrectly call general chemistry a weed out class for this reason but it isnt. We actually go to great lengths to try to help students through it. Most students simply arent used to being challenged.Second most high school science curricula are based more on memorizing formulas and constants than they are about the sort of critical thinking and creative problem solving actually required in science. Its much harder to work through freshman chemistry or physics simply memorizing what equation to use when rather than understanding why you use that equation in that case. It sounds obvious but it honestly just isnt how most people have learned to approach school. Incidentally this is why many people think organic chemistry is so difficult. Its almost impossible to straightup memorize all of those mechanisms.The third reason applies more to lab classes and sophomore or higherlevel courses which is comfort with ambiguity. There have been many articles and even some books written about this but the gist is this Most students are trained to think that there is one right or wrong answer but reality is much more messy than that. All experimental values have uncertainties associated with them and so answers are actually a range of values. Again it sounds simple enough but students often ask what the correct error source to identify in their lab report is when there are a number of sources of error in play and the student needs to try to decide which ones matter the most.  Its sometimes possible to see what the main problem was from the data but often times you can only be moderately sure of the primary problem was.So basically STEM fields are challenging and having been on both sides of it much more demanding than humanities. However I think theyre much more satisfying too.,UCSantaBarbara,clo1y5w,1,t5_2shs9

3439532,0,t3_2zm2lv,Just wanted to repost some relevantinsight from Jonathon Abboud a couple months ago regarding the tuition markups since this is coming upRegarding the Regents  year Tuition Increase PlanIve taken a step back on commenting on this but after a successful UCSB Higher Education Roundtable meeting today I need to share my thoughts. This issue should be on everyones radar if it doesnt affect you personally it will affect your friends family children and the state of California as a whole.. I agree that the UC is essentially playing the students and their parents as a bargaining chip against the state Legislature and Governor for more money. The state has indeed given the UC two  budget increases and two  increases but those effectively cover inflation not allowing the UC to restore funding for faculty to teach smaller classes and for more students more on this in point  and . It is shitty the UC is taking students hostage but really the state is giving the UC system the leftover bread crumbs of the budget and as a result we suffer through decreased class availability less services especially in Student Affairs and less open seats for future students. We made Prop  pass in  and the state is not giving us enough of the pie.. In  the people of California and the state recognized the need for higher education and guaranteed it to the top . of High School students at the UC top  at the CSU and everyone at the CCs. Due to MASSIVE state disinvestment from the UC system The UC has lost a total of  billion over the past  decades the UC and CSU have been unable to meet this part of the covenant made with the tax payers of the state according to Assemblymember Das Williams we have CUT out  potential students from their right to an education and this will be ONE MILLION BY . Let that number sink in. We have less money adjusted for inflation today than we did in  and a much larger population of students to educate.. The UCs tuition increase plan is supposed to go towards A Funding  more students at the UC system B Financial Aid C More faculty to reduce class sizes and number of classes. I think we can all agree these are all good and actually essential. We need to educate more people as the state grows in order to continue having the  economy in the county. We need financial aid to help people who cannot pay. We need smaller classes to learn more effectively and more classes so we can graduate in  years. As a side note many complain about some inefficient or strange use of funds on campus specifically while many are valid it is important to note that Tuition and State dollars do not go towards things like Housing  the cost of housing is wholly  separate from those other funding streams.. Now shifting gears towards what people call administrative bloat and the contradiction of increasing Chancellor pay while also going out for the increase. This is an easy one to get stuck on that doesnt actually solve the problem at hand. Yes the UC spends far too much money on salaries for top level earners. UCOP has lawyers making  while the state has equivalent lawyers making . HOWEVER Cutting these costs is a MINUSCULE amount when we look at the STATE DISINVESTMENT of Higher Education. If we cut administrative costs by lets say  million we wouldnt even put a dent in the money we need to educate Californias students which is  MILLION over FIVE YEARS   MILLION so . This is an easy one to latch on to and the Governor would love for you because it removes the blame the state deserves for not funding the UC system.. Now to lay further blame on the state. Governor Jerry Brown would rather the UC EXPAND CLASS SIZES and GO FULLY ONLINE compromising the QUALITY of the education instead of give it a budget increase. He VETOED a  increase only  months ago. I think everyone needs to remember always that it was the STATE that cut the UC by  BILLION. Yes the UC can be more efficient in how it spends money but there is a clear lack of responsibility from STATE and it has basically succeeded in making the UC the bad person in this situation and itself the good person. The state is NOT THE GOOD PERSON. Please do not be blinded by lofty comments by state politicians against the tuition increase Jerry Brown Gavin Newsom Speaker Atkins  WHERE HAVE THEY BEEN IN INCREASING FUNDING FOR THE UC?????? Politicians will take any opportunity they get to look better without actually solving the problem and theyre doing it now.. Last thing is how critical having a well funded UC is. It allows us to educate far more students which in the past has proven to bring California to prosperity and make it a leader in the WORLD ECONOMY. Further if we fund the UC the issue of students needing to work while going to school or taking out loans becomes nonexistent. Those two issues WOULD NOT EXIST IF THE STATE FULLY FUNDED THE UC SYSTEM. Think about that there would be no student loan crisis if California and other states simply funded their higher education systems fully. Tuition only exists as a backfill for state disinvestment. In Germany the government pays for ALL costs which translates to free tuition.My point is simply we cannot get in bed with the state just because they seem to be our friends by opposing the  year tuition plan.The state is the real enemy to put it bluntly. As much as I respect Jerry Brown he is the one screwing over the UC system. Giving us money only for inflation related costs and not restoring the  billion cut over the past years is STARVING THE BEAST. He is essentially employing the same strategy the  Republican Party used to wipe out government social services. At the end of the day the UC Regents are dealt a hand by the state and the state has dealt some extraordinary shitty hands. I suggest you EMAILCALL GOVERNOR BROWN in support of increased funding for the UC  tuition didnt even exist as a concept until the state started reducing its funding of UC.,UCSantaBarbara,cpkbz9i,3,t5_2shs9

4101251,0,t1_crnohij,gtUCSB is a very careeroriented school. At the risk of shedding bad light on UCSB I have to disagree. UCSB is a researchoriented school but not a careeroriented school. All the benefits you list are available at any equallyrated university.At USC graduates have an openinterview event where upcoming grads can have dozens of interviews with leading industry right on the spot. At Cal Poly they have a program to match you with prospective internships. UCSB has what? A career fair grad fair and some workshops? Even SBCC has more career fairs than UCSB. UCSBs Career Center and entire career aid plan is unfortunately a joke when compared to other leading universities. I say this as a graduate of UCSB and year staff member. What are we good at then? Getting students into graduate school and preparing them for research. We have an unbelievable amount of research on campus that other campuses do not and getting involved in it is a surefire way into graduate school medical school law school etc.Im not going to sugarcoat anything or insist that UCSB is the best at everything and Im certainly not going to pretend that our undergraduate career support and opportunities are satisfactory. And if none of you believe me then see for yourself I think a  employment rate at graduation is pretty sad for a worldclass institution. ,UCSantaBarbara,crnrnkj,7,t5_2shs9

As a mod I agree with uSixthSnail  its fine to talk about difficult issues here on rUCSantaBarbara but we need to do it with an attitude of respect for each other and youre coming off as a troll right now.Instead of treating this as a subreddit of random internet people like rnews or rfunny think of it as an internet equivalent of the UCen or a dorm lounge  a place where a bunch of strangers have a lot in common and we can have conversations with each other in a respectful and friendly way. The sidebar specifically says this is a friendly place where insulting comments are not welcome.If you want to talk about Raytheon make a single self post with a polite explanation of your concern with links and evidence related to UCSB and the UC system and invite polite conversation about the topic. Present yourself as a scholar talking to fellow scholars.People are up for conversations and new ideas here but not if youre argumentative about it and post links with opinions in the titles.Im going to have to start removing posts from you if you keep up with this style.

7176237,0,t1_d1tu01k,SJW  Social Justice WarriorPerhaps some of what you favor is in conflict with other things you favor.  For example if you favor free speech then it can be very challenging to favor all campus policy as some of those policies stifle free speech.  Also being in favor of free speech means that sometimes you need to accept speech that you find unfavorable.  What you might view as anti gay or anti religious could be seen as someone elses legitimate opinion even if most of society finds it abhorrent.  Much of that abhorrent speech can actually have its roots in religious teachings so if youre against that speech you may find yourself in conflict with someones right to believe in religion.IMO people need to support free speech unequivocally or they reveal themselves as not really supporting it.

7181020,0,t1_d1pvha1, Often times professors expect you to have more time to learn the information so youll be going over more information in less time and in greater detail by yourself. No one finishes lab reports because you have to type about a page  a page and a half along with analyzing graphs etc.  I personally wrote a rough draft and a final draft of each report.  Expect to put in at least three hours writing a report a week minimum for an above average grade. I was suggesting consider the overlap but you kinda picked up on it.  Recognize that AL is not going to be a class that you can gloss over for a few days like a true lecture  there will be continuous work and review.  With this new information youve provided I would suggest taking a class in Session A because AL does not become difficult until about the last . weeks harder material.  I cant comment on C during the summer but I think it would be better to be done with all other classes so that youll be taking a final before AL and C get really difficult and youll only have to prepare info for AL and C during the end of Session C.   ,UCSantaBarbara,d1uf2th,1,t5_2shs9

I just bring it up because it sounds like youre taking care of someone which could be costly and honestly if I could get credit for intro bio at the cost a c offers I probably wouldve done that. Intro bio wasnt anything super special and I guess in the end you just have to weigh the pros vs the cons of taking it here vs elsewhere.

9578490,0,t3_5c4yj6,Hi! I know exactly what youre feeling. I felt terrible about being here because it is so hard for me to make friends at times. I currently live at FT so I felt that I was too far from campus to join clubs and participate in school activities.Things have gotten better for the most part. I currently have a job on campus that really helped me make a lot of friends so I would highly recommend doing that. Another thing that has helped make friends is just being friendly and helping people out on their homework. Try forming a study group with the people in your halllecturessections. Or try joining an existing one!! Feeling lonely sucks trust me i know so if you ever need someone to grab lunchdinner with just shoot me a message!!,UCSantaBarbara,d9tqt2l,5,t5_2shs9

11257916,0,t1_df8260x,Yeah anything in the CoE has seen a massive increase in applications. And since the physical facilities have not expanded yet they have to accept a lower percentage. So in that sense its harder because there is more competition. However this is a general problem with all the UCs and Im sure USC so unfortunately you may have issues at anywhere you apply. CS  requires the least amount of physical space no EE labs or anything so its your best bet. Once youre in youre in so if you do get accepted dont worry about the crowding. ,UCSantaBarbara,df82g9x,2,t5_2shs9
11269847,0,t3_60slpm,repost cuz Im an idiot and thought I was special im notHello everyoneI was just accepted as an incoming freshman and had a question or two to ask. I had a lot of trouble making friends in HS and putting myself out there but I finally saw myself get out of my little bubble of seclusion last year and this year and I made a tight knit group of friends aka im an introvert.Also Im Muslim and I wanna at least retain the abstinence from alcohol and drugs throughout my life. Ik you can avoid the party scene if you play your cards right and dont go to Santa CatalinaFT or seek out other people but can SB really work for me? Are there actually rather quiet bookish emotional guys who just want a tight knit group of friends?Ill be honest to you all. Ive been praying for UCI for a while its quiet a commuter school and doesnt have a reputation that SB does. And SC another school i did get into is far more laid back and less in your face than Isla Vista or so ive heard.But the fact that SBs far and away the greatest school I got and I love the location yet just not the party scene attached to it due to my personality and religious beliefs is there any hope for SB being the best fit for me? Its either SB or Riverside or SC so Im really hoping UCSB is a fit for me ,UCSantaBarbara,df9f5bz,0,t5_2shs9

Would I get a boost for being female applying to the physics CCS? I asked a student about how I could go about getting accepted and he advised doing an independent research project.

11457380,0,t1_dfu7gvz,Although that is true if you want to become CPA eligible you may have to take classes that are not major specific to meet the unit requirements. Anyway I wouldnt choose one college over another just because one doesnt have classes on Friday. I just transferred to UCSB in the Fall so the transition is still very fresh in my mind. Both schools are heavily recruited by firms of all sizes. CP has FALL Symposium and UCSB has Meet The Firms. I have a tax internship for BIG in SF this summer and there is a good share of students from both schools.The reason I chose UCSB over Cal Poly is because Business Admin is VIEWED as a very broad major. Although the college is well respected there are many many other BUS ADMIN Grads flooding the job market. Economics and Accounting at UCSB only requires you to take  upper division ECON classes the rest are mostly Accounting classes. I saw someone else say that it is ECON heavy let me assure you it is not. If you have any questions feel free to PM me. As you can tell I am a little biased towards UCSB but will not hate you if you choose CP. Both are good schools and I am sure you will do great wherever you go!,UCSantaBarbara,dfuopdm,2,t5_2shs9

11529852,0,t1_dg2tgxw,My professional goal after school is biological research. I dont want to go to med school. I am more interested in learning interesting and useful information rather than just taking something easy and coasting through. Im choosing biology for a different reason than you. When I was little I really loved animals and wanted to be a zoologist. As Ive gone through high school I took a variety of classes to find what Im interested in. This includes computer science and its kind of fun but I dont like it enough to do for the rest of my life. I took AP Biology and Biotechnology a cc lab class offered through my school and really loved both and wish there was another bio class I could take this year. I discovered that I really enjoy lab work and am leaning towards studying microbiology. From what I know there are many good careers in biology and I believe its something that I could do for the rest of my life. I can admit that I might change my mind and my major but right now I think this is the right place.,UCSantaBarbara,dg2wsnp,1,t5_2shs9
