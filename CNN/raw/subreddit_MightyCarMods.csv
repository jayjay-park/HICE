4745934,0,t1_ctse2jc,I think anyone can understand wanting to meet them they come off as really genuine and kind.  Thats what makes them so special I think they just seem like really good guys.  Im really glad they posted this so that everyone can see though I think it would make a lot of sense for them to do a video about it just so people that follow them on youtube would know and could try to be more respectful.  Anyway this definitely pushed me over the edge and made me hit their donate button today ,MightyCarMods,ctsrpzt,5,t5_2t9ag

6461611,0,t1_cznjf6s,I dont think there are laws limiting the uses of lsx motors. Maybe something emission related but otherwise there isnt a huge market for hatchbacks in the United States to begin with. We did get the w passat wagon though. They dont sell here as well as other regions of the world.,MightyCarMods,czno9ux,1,t5_2t9ag
6581384,0,t3_45srjc,They released the original video of heating the turbo almost  months ago so theyve been sitting on this build ever since! Imagine how much footage or how many build episodes there are!,MightyCarMods,d002hmd,8,t5_2t9ag

Moog may have bumped it while it was hanging from some fishing line? just a guessAlso Lets think about the good times we had.,MightyCarMods,ddstrd6,4,t5_2t9ag
