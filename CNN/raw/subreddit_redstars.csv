7362765,0,t3_4g665g,A much better match but definitely far from the finished product. Im still afraid for us plying against Portland Seattle or Orlando.I didnt see why Comeau got subbed at the end of the match. Guess I was tired finished watching the replay at around midnight and must have missed it. Why did Naughton come in for her and not a starter? Was it just tactical?This is the only reason I can think of for why Dames has Gilliland and Short starting on the opposite side from their traditional position.Orlando is going to be a tough match next weekend. Glad it is at home and not in front of k people in the citrus bowl.Anyone know what tonights attendance was?,redstars,d2f3gvp,6,t5_2y1ru

7581996,0,t1_d34138d,Yeah I guess I was mostly thinking of players with national team credentials but really the roles could be split a bit between someone who is mediafacing and has a larger national profile and someone who is youthdevelopmentcommunityfacing. I was mostly thinking about the former and less the latter because a larger national profile would probably also translate to a larger profile in Chicago. Also the existing team can do a lot of the community stuff.,redstars,d341asw,1,t5_2y1ru
