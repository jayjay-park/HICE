6676786,0,t3_471yfq,Seroquel is not a mood stabilizer it is an antipsychotic.Psychiatrists use it to control mania anxiety and agitation.Maybe its time to look into a standard mood stabilizer.,bipolar2,d09xrop,1,t5_31khp
6717647,0,t3_46gwc0,Yes you can hold a job. Its just very hard depending on what episodes youre going through. Im  and I have Bipolar Depression Bipolar . I was diagnosed last July. I have tried Latuda and Lamictal. Latuda made me dangerously tired like i didnt trust myself to drive tired. But it was weightneutral meaning you dont necessarily gain weight on it. Lamictal made me insanely agitated to the point where I wouldnt leave my house because I didnt want anyone to deal with my shit. I was very sensitive to the sun on it if i sat in the sun the side facing the sun turned BRIGHT red. you couldve drawn a line to show the sun rash.Now I take  mg of Seroquel and was recently put on Topamax for appetite suppressant. I gained  pounds in about  months on the Seroquel. So the Topamax were hoping helps me lose that and not gain more.When Im off my meds I wouldnt say my condition is extremely severe but its bad. I dont get violent but I can get very agitated and have screaming rages yelling at people. I have been suicidal. I have taken off and driven all night to Nashville on a whim. Blown  on my credit card totally maxed it out. Im still working out the dosage for my Seroquel. at  I was content but not happy. Im not sure if i know what healthy happy really is though. My doctor is hoping we can find out if I dose up to . Im not suicidal anymore though. But I can be sad sometimes. He wanted to put me on Lithium but that requires EKGs and shit. I manage a roofing company. I used to work about  hours a week when I was in a manic episode but  of the time im in a depressive episode. So now I work about  hours per week but Im also a student and volunteer. Its hard to leave my bed. I got very lucky with an understanding boss. My job description would include payroll purchase orders ordering materials invoicing paying all the bills company and personal for my boss gathering information for each job including material quantities roof colors etc. And this is for about  jobs a month. I handle thousands of dollars millions a year. I also do tax prep sifting through millions of dollars working through classes for tax write offs.I think holding a job can depend on your episode how severe it is how understanding your workplace is. Its much harder during a depressive episode USUALLY not always!!! with bipolar  youre depressed  of the time and hypomanic . So when youre hypomanic youre totally down to work and the perfect amount of focused and productive. but when youre depressed its hard to leave bed and talk to people. Hard to leave your shell. I work with only one other person in my office my boss and at a desk. I can show up in my PJs if i want. Ill show up  hours late but i show up and my boss is thankful. Hes like a second father and my next door neighbor. Personally I would find it easier to hold a night job. I think a lot of this has to do with sleeping patterns. I stay up late with anxiety then sleep all day or even when Im manic staying up late or not sleeping at all. It threw off my sleeping pattern to the point where Im more awake and productive in the evening.,bipolar2,d0e5vfi,1,t5_31khp
7045288,0,t1_d1eucrq,Irritability can be a sign of mania or hypomania. But only you can decide if you are using it as an excuse.,bipolar2,d1exwby,2,t5_31khp
8035816,0,t1_d4j89ws,Exactly  do what feels right. If dating appeals to you perhaps shift to view dating as a trial run at a relationship both for yourself and the other person. Dont make it into anything weighty or stressful.Consider also dating yourself for a period which is very cliche to say. A diagnosis is merely the identification of the nature of an illness or other problem by examination of the symptoms. What an awesome tool to help find what makes you tick! Wishing you the best!,bipolar2,d4jauk7,3,t5_31khp
8477343,0,t3_4vr0lq,Although I experience it in different ways the most clear I am quick cycling episodes for me are the days I wake up and everything is awesome which I call the no reason happies and the next  days everything feels awful the pit of despair. I also get into manic productive streaks where I do one thing and it leads to a hundred more and I just. cant. stop. Most of the rest of time my motivation is lacking. I have been on lamictal for about  months and its helped reduce irritability and I have had very few manic symptoms. Frankly I miss the mania  But its better than been irritated with everyone most of the time not sure it that came from the depression or mania I dont know much about Depakote but good luck with it and dont give up if its not the right drug. There are many options to explore and even if something is working but you dont feel like yourself you just havent found the right drug yet. It can be a long process but it is definitely worthwhile.,bipolar2,d617kni,2,t5_31khp
8930177,0,t3_52kt15,I dont have bpd but I have recalled moments I thought were memories but were actually dreams. Nothing big. Usually very subtle like a day at work that didnt happen. Or a conversation with a family member that didnt happen. ,bipolar2,d7l9xih,2,t5_31khp
9093621,0,t1_d84v2fs,Masturbation does not help unfortunately... Talked to the fwb and we might keep fucking but we did fight. He thinks I will somehow fall for him narcissist much and got mad because Ive been dating this girl not serious enough to not have a fwb and he still seems to think I will fall for him. I need to get me a new one its just very comfortable with him when its good between us.I hate bipolar disorder.,bipolar2,d84woam,2,t5_31khp

9681177,0,t3_5dm0wn,Im really sorry to hear all of that.  I too struggle with the same feelings.  It feels like I dont have any control over my own life.  I just always remember to keep fighting.  You doing the best is all you can do for yourself and you should be proud of that.  You didnt choose to suffer  it has just happened that way.  The only thing you can do is fight and overcome.  Life is much harder for people like us but that doesnt mean it isnt worth living or fighting for. There are still very happy times and thats always something to remember.  Although things seem to be fallen apart right now  it wont always be that way. I promise. ,bipolar2,da6eqpk,3,t5_31khp
9937307,0,t3_5hq1bl,I support voluntary euthanasia for the terminally ill. If you know life is going to be nothing but pain its reasonable to want a way out.Those of us with mental illness sometimes feel that life will be nothing but pain when in fact thats just our diseases talking. So its reasonable to deny that as an explanation.In terminally ill folks the feeling of wanting to die is a result of their symptoms. If the symptoms cannot be managed and the condition can only get worse they may choose to die. In contrast for depressionbipolaretc the feeling of wanting to die is itself a symptom of a disordered thought process that can be treated. Since its not untreatable its better to treat than to euthanize.,bipolar2,db2uub6,3,t5_31khp
10121347,0,t1_dbqs6xk,Your right. It really is therapeutic. You dont feel so isolated. I should have started doing it years ago.

10184375,0,t3_5lldlw,Research what mental health resources are in your community. I have been fortunate enough to find a program in FL that hinges on my weekly attendance at group therapy. As long as I do this my meds are . for a month. ,bipolar2,dbygeea,2,t5_31khp
10263787,0,t3_5msh4q,There are a number of mood tracking apps for both apple and android. Lots of free ones. You can rate your mood on a scale and take notes by either checking a checklist usually includes took meds took birth control had sex had caffeine had alcohol and more andor by writing notes down. This helped me A TON. I would make my daily entry before bed when I set my alarm for the next day. Its hard to remember how you felt a week ago if youre feeling something different today and seeing it on a chart over time is helpful to both you and your doctor if you see one. My doctor loved that I did this and some apps will even export a PDF you can email or print for your doctors records. Its helpful especially because you set your own scale. Just remember qualifications for each number where the highestlowest points mean that its the most extreme its ever been but also keep in mind what you would consider as qualifications for other numbers like being able to get out of bed and get a few things done or feeling fairly fast but very easily distracted whatever works for you.,bipolar2,dc7gfjs,1,t5_31khp

10656035,0,t3_5saz2w,Welcome to the sub! I think the others have said it all with regards to being afraid about the diagnosis but sometimes half the solution to the problem is defining the problem. And your grammar is not terrible I found you easy to read.,bipolar2,ddf36m5,3,t5_31khp
10671822,0,t3_5sh3pp,Yeah I definitely just kind of feel like my entire self  body and mind  is off at times and its more of a feeling than a thought or opinion about my life and moods. But more specifically Ive definitely had fatigue from depression and excess energy from hypomania. Nausea has been a problem too when Im upset in a depressed or mixed state. But the most physical thing I can think of is onetime I was having anxiety that was so bad that my gums would go numb and start to tingle  kind of like the pins and needles sensation you get when a part of your body goes to sleep. ,bipolar2,ddgpuci,2,t5_31khp
10889493,0,t3_5t0hgu,I have very mild hypomania. The major giveaways that I was bipolar  was the hobby du jour and the varied sleep batteries. Oh and the risktaking behaviour Try not to get too hung up on labels. If being labelled bipolar  gives you access to the treatment you need go with it. Lithium made such a difference to me. I felt like I was a grown up for the first time.Good luck.,bipolar2,de369ii,1,t5_31khp

10941266,0,t3_5w2gyn,I dont cope. Lol. Talking seriously I was very disheartened before using the bipolar subreddits by the notion of the cycle just repeating itself over and over. It still fills my heart with dread but I can only hope that this time round I will not make the same hypomanic mistakes and therefore the depression will be more bearable.  I am ensuring this by best behaviour in terms of meds sleep and minimum alcohol. But also by coming to these subreddits and trying to learn and get encouragement from others. Im drilling the message hard  only time will tell when I get my next hypomania. Wish me success please!,bipolar2,de8ij6c,1,t5_31khp
10953967,0,t3_5w2gyn,I know I am armed with more coping skills more and more each day. I have a bigger support network than ever. I have a highly skilled therapist I can call or text day or night. I have a hospital I can drive myself to with an amazing inpatient unit. I have people Ive met through my NAMI group that I reach out to as well.I also know that as I age the episodes will probably lessen. They may be more intense but they will likely decrease in frequency from what Ive read and heard from others. And every year they seem to be coming out with more and more medications to help us manage. It gives me hope.,bipolar2,de9to1q,1,t5_31khp
11186355,0,t3_5zkm56,Last year when I had this very stressful and very demanding job I had even more trouble sleeping than now. I was always waking up in the middle of night covered in sweat. I wasnt being so very self aware back then it took me months after not being at that job to figure out I was having panic attacks while sleeping. I am not at that job anymore so no more panic attacks in the middle of the night. I still have insomnia.,bipolar2,dezykva,1,t5_31khp

11514501,0,t3_64cslo,Yep in depressive phases like I am now I cant go a day without chocolate a can of drink or a takeaway usually all three.In comparison to my mood improving and manic phases I wont touch any of the above for  months.I think eating junk foodalcoholdrugs go hand in hand with mental illness and hibernation.,bipolar2,dg1652f,2,t5_31khp
11540946,0,t3_64cslo,Wow Im just realizing this. Im one of those leafy green insufferable vegetarian types. I generally prefer bitter over sweet or savory.But when Im on a low depressive state I have a  pack of snickers and Twix on standby. Along with wine and Im even eating grapes now.Im just now putting this all together.Because eventually the day comes that I hate sweets I give them all away and go back to greens and smoothies. So this is another indicator of my lows.,bipolar2,dg4625d,1,t5_31khp
11569982,0,t3_654xag,can vary but typically a couple of months with depressive being more frequent and longerFor me the depression is sudden and obvious the hypomania is less so because I start off thinking Im just not depressedthere probably are but because I am so confused about what is hypomania vs not depression its hard for me to tell Im sure with medication that will get betterThinking that the diagnosis is wrong thinking that you can handle it better on your own thinking the disorder specifically hypomania is a gift thinking medicine makes you someone you are not even if that person is more stable.medication through me into intense hypomania before we got to a dosage that finally stabled me out. Hypomania can have different flavorssometimes feeling extreme peace and connected to God sometimes out of control thoughts sometimes ridiculously happycantstoptalkingspendingallthemoneyetc know that in the end it is a struggle and please try not to romanticize it. I would say even we romanticize it in the midst of mania but when you come back down and see what youve done to your lifetheres nothing romantic about it. ,bipolar2,dg7gol3,9,t5_31khp
