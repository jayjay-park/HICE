6760635,0,t3_48c2iu,I enjoyed FC quite a bit and picked Primal up last week and have been having a blast.  There are some similarities to FC considering it is the same engine but it really feels like an entirely different game.First of all mindless busywork is a pretty stupid thing to say about a game.  To a certain extent most all games could be considered mindless busywork.  I dont feel Primal is any worse in this area than FC was or any other game I can think of.What obviously sets Primal apart from FC the most is the atmosphere you are in the year  BC without any of the technology ie guns and vehicles that existed in previous FC games.  Sometimes Ill just wonder around the wilderness and take in the beautiful sights and sounds of the ancient forest.  It just really feels like you are there. Without guns the combat is obviously different.  Instead of all the hightech weapons from FC you have spears bows clubs and throwable objects the sting bomb being my favorite .  In addition to the weapons on hand you can also consider the tamed animals as additional weapons.  You can tame large cats wolfs bears and a couple of other animals.  All animals have different stats and abilities. The big difference from FC is that instead of throwing bait and hoping that an animal takes the bait and goes on a rampage near your target you can send your pet to specific targets.  The pets are also great as a body guard as most other animals tend to leave you alone once you have your faithful pet by your side and your pet will also jump to your defense when you get attacked.In addition to the tamable pets you can also call an owl which you can send for surveillance use them to mark a target for your pet to attack drop bombs or do dive attacks to take out a specific enemies.  This really adds to combat strategies in my opinion.I was a little skeptical at first based on reading people bashing the game claiming it was just going to be a reskin of FC and should be just DLC for it.  Now that I am playing Primal I see that the people saying this obviously hadnt played it as it totally inaccurate.  I decided to take the chance and dont regret my purchase at all.  To me it really is refreshing change of pace since this period in history isnt often explored in games or the media in general.  I really hope that people come to this with an open mind so that it does well and there will be other similar games coming out.,FCPrimal,d0ilu7c,4,t5_3an9g

6833663,0,t3_499764,As much as I am loving the game in general I must agree with you here.  I have done three of those missions and I am really not enjoying them at all.  It just takes me so much out of the flow of the rest of the game that I have little to no desire to play anymore of those levels.,FCPrimal,d0qwarj,3,t5_3an9g

7062591,0,t1_d1gaa5h,Dang still sounds like I need that phrasebook then... Do you know if theres any way I can buy the phrasebook separately? Already have the game. Or if theres any other source to learn from that someones made unless they copyrighted the language? Maybe if we push them for extra material... Out of curiosity how many entries does the dictionary have? And is the grammarsyntax in a really basic kind of none of our readers will actually be interested in linguisticsstyle or is it a bit more extensive? Sorry for pestering you about this.,FCPrimal,d1gwm6q,2,t5_3an9g
