4134242,0,t1_crr2dpx,I dont see anything wrong with it. Not growing up with football in my roots and great distance to the teams that have long term historical rivalries it makes it very easy for me to wear shirts from other teams I may not support as long as they make me look and feel good. Now for example Id never wear a DC United shirt since Im ingrained in that rivalry and have been physically close to the action. But I own both Milan and Inter shirts with no qualms of wearing either despite being more partial to Milan. Heresy I know but I suppose its just a product of sporting upbringing.,KitSwap,crriwz4,2,t5_2u5nj
