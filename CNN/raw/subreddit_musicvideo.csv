8943620,0,t3_52s85q,Hey all! This is Adam of the Indianapolis based psychedelic folkrock band Joshua Powell amp the Great Train Robbery.  Hope you all enjoy our new official music video for our single Gunfighter Ballad for the st Century from our  album Alyosha.This song parallels the old Western gunfighter ballads of yesteryear with todays controversy over the morality of drone warfare in the U.S. The song tells of a politician who discovers his lover has been spending time with another man and as a course of revenge orders a drone strike on both of them and gets away with it.  This music video tells a similar story but instead of a politician with a drone we tell the tale of a disgruntled husband who finds out his wife has been cheating gets drunk buys a black market pistol and takes matters into his own hands.Hope you enjoy!
