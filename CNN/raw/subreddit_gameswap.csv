1158133,0,t1_chzmuz3,I will not quiet myself because you are uncomfortable with what I have to say or because you are tired of hearing it. I have nothing but the upmost respect for what you and the current mod team have accomplished since I have left. I think you have all done an amazing job and I have said as such many times over. I have not and will not attack the mod team and I challenge you to show me where I have. I feel very strongly however that the course of action in this matter is not being handled well or correctly and will continue to voice my feelings for as long as you continue to engage me andor ignore my request to have the information removed. I will not pretend to know the challenges you face today if you will not pretend to understand the challenges I faced as this community started and grew and then blew up. Regardless of what challenges we have faced there is a correct way to manage the community. You and I assume the rest of the team have decided to handle this incorrectly. You all have chosen to flagrantly disregard Reddit rules as well long standing rgameswap rules by sharing and allowing this information to remain public. I have not shared this with Reddit admins only because of the respect I have for the team that moderates here but that respect is slowly waning. There are good reasons why information like this should not be shared and protecting the community is not strong enough to override them. Mostly because you are not protecting the community in anyway by sharing this information publicly. The only way to protect the community is to encourage safe trading and thorough vetting of partners. From what little information I have no one did either of those two things and it is NIAVE for you to think that sharing this information publicy will change that. If they could not have bothered to be more cautious when trading with a days old account what will sharing this information accomplish? It will not accomplish protecting the community. It will accomplish an environment of misguided witch hunts against guilty and innocent parties. Youre right I cant speak to what information came from what communities in the shared ban list but if you filter by community youll notice that there is no personal information listed by those from rgameswap. I have not defended the shared ban list nor do I now. I have never and will never support publishing personal information for any reason.,gameswap,chzwodf,2,t5_2rbm7

If Im wrong and it keeps rising Im wrong. Youre free to lower your opinions of my stuff too I dont really care.  I personally think its hilarious that Path of Radiance is pegged at around  right now thats extremely inflated and I wouldnt possibly expect anyone to value my copy that highly.
