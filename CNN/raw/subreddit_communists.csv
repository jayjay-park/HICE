7948227,0,t1_d49ga2x,gtJust as the economists are the scientific representatives of the bourgeois class so the Socialists and Communists are the theoreticians of the proletarian class. So long as the proletariat is not yet sufficiently developed to constitute itself as a class and consequently so long as the struggle itself of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie has not yet assumed a political character and the productive forces are not yet sufficiently developed in the bosom of the bourgeoisie itself to enable us to catch a glimpse of the material conditions necessary for the emancipation of the proletariat and for the formation of a new society these theoreticians are merely utopians who to meet the wants of the oppressed classes improvise systems and go in search of a regenerating science. But in the measure that history moves forward and with it the struggle of the proletariat assumes clearer outlines they no longer need to seek science in their minds they have only to take note of what is happening before their eyes and to become its mouthpiece. So long as they look for science and merely make systems so long as they are at the beginning of the struggle they see in poverty nothing but poverty without seeing in it the revolutionary subversive side which will overthrow the old society. From this moment science which is a product of the historical movement has associated itself consciously with it has ceased to be doctrinaire and has become revolutionary. There have been many claims from orthodox Marxists that Marx never gave a plan of how society would be never told us what communism was and never left a blueprint. I believe this is false. What they are looking for is an economic blueprint they ignore that Marx spent his whole life criticising the economic way of explaining human life and of its relation to the utopian and religious way of explaining the next life. His explanation of communism centered on human relations  a free association of producers. Everywhere in his work we can find contrasts between a truly human life and the way we live now. This part of Marx is as much a part of communism as the struggle to be free from capital is and must be.We know that the struggle for communism the means that we use must be the same as the ends we pursue. In other words the struggle for communism must be communist itself. Therefore it follows that since trade unionism and parliamentarianism is not a part of any truly human society it ought not to be attempted to use them as a means towards communism. However there is a distinction to be made between form and content. The forms of trade unions and parliamentarianism in which people become conscious of their struggle and fight it out is not a communist form. The content was only indirectly or implicitly communist because though it was struggle it was only struggle for aims within capital.Marxs support for these struggles was an attempt to link these struggles with the real movement for communism an attempt to get those who struggle to acquire consciousness for themselves of what they are fighting for  only with consciousness of this can the correct form come to light. He did not see these institutions as a means to communism in themselves as others did. The dispute between leftcommunists and those others is not just between how to get to communism it is a dispute over what communism is. Today it is clear that the engines for struggle do not lie inside trade unions and parliamentarianism. History has shown that these forms work against any content of struggle nipping it in the bud before any consciousness of what is truly being fought for arises.Here is how Lenin misquotes MarxgtWe do not say to the world Marx wrote as far back as  and he fulfilled this programme to the letter we do not say to the world cease struggling your whole struggle is senseless. All we do is to provide it with a true slogan of struggle.This political attitude and the political attitude of this generation of Marxists is directly linked with the philosophical attitude. They were materialists meaning that the world existed and we had to make our thoughts conform to it and by thought the materialists mean no more than activity of a single isolated human head. Marx on the other hand writesgtThe materialist doctrine concerning the changing of circumstances and upbringing forgets that circumstances are changed by men and that the educator must himself be educated. This doctrine must therefore divide society into two parts one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or selfchange can be conceived and rationally understood as revolutionary practice.  Theses on FeuerbachThe philosophic standpoint of Lenin is one which divides form and content in Kantian terms intuition and concepts there is the world  the content of experience  and then there is the forms of thought which must be changed to see the world clearly. For Marx however this division of form and content is a feature of an inhuman world for thought to be in line with content is for it to be adapted to this inhuman word the era of the capitalist mode of production. His insight is that only in changing this world which means changing our social relations only in revolutionary practice is our thought one with our social actions. Form and content are only united in the struggle for communism and its resultgtLet us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings. ... I would have been for you the mediator between you and the species and the other person. ... and therefore would become recognised and felt by you yourself as a completion of your own essential nature and as a necessary part of yourself and consequently would know myself to be confirmed both in your thought and your love...If it is to be social revolution instead of merely political then we can not deny that the political system trade union and parliament is part of society too and must be revolutionised in the same way. However since these institutions do not contain any real struggle since they do not serve the interests of the proletariat in any measure certainly not the interest of abolishing the proletariat and since they have become an illusory mode of struggle in the same way in which the state is the illusory community German Ideology and it is a power against society and struggle the practical revolution of these institutions must come from the destruction of these institutions by the real movement.Hopefully these ramblings help to show the continuity of Marxs thought and its continuity into our own time.,communists,d49geqa,7,t5_2scb4

10222188,0,t3_5mdjlw,Engels view on monogamy appear later on where he says paraphrasing that communism will not abolish monogamy but fulfill it.I think he tries to show that the main issue with monogamy is the power difference that exist between the sexes but ultimately monogamy is the next logical step in the evolution of relationships.Excuse any odd phrasing English is not my first language.,communists,dc2qq0w,6,t5_2scb4

10880857,0,t3_5vev7s,I dont know what to think of Foucault. I read three of his books though not recently and was impressed enough at the time with Discipline and Punish especially but have picked up the hint in the time since that his historiography is quote from memory pretty shit. Roy Porter seemed to demonstrate that well enough for his work on asylums though whether lazy history really invalidates the work I dont know. Because I liked his analysis I suppose I wouldnt like to dismiss it completely.Philip Mirowski also critiqued him in a sense for his later readings of Hayek and his crew and again I was left vaguely wondering what to make of it. Making sense of that would take even more work reading Foucaults last writing in particular. A lot of effort for something Im not all that invested in either way. This is why I have trouble buying the quick and easy dismissals people have of the guy I can almost never believe that theyve put in the thought needed to have that certainty. Ill have to read this in full later its huge but from skimming it might fill a gap Ive been wondering about for a while. Thanks.,communists,de2a7al,5,t5_2scb4
