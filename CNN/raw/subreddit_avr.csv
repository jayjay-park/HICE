2990277,0,t1_co7vpf2,thank you  ill play with it after finishing the exams and ordering a few crystals from ebaythank you a lot for the information by the wayif you can help me with a different project i want to put  white watt leds  around the room  and i want to be able to control how much they are turned on so i need PWM so i can make different ways for the room to light and make some light animationswhat do i need to buy it takes around a month for the stuff to arrivei thought about this  power supply ill calculate later how much i need    leds  transistors normal npn?  of arduino pro mini connected together  ??do i need more things? is this way truly inefficient i want the light for decoration so im probably going to be using half of the strength of the ledsthank you so much D,avr,co7xu7f,0,t5_2qm3v
3329360,0,t1_cp7r40v,Thats my goal...so I wont have to keep looking up syntax at least.My next step is to make the code take data from a csv and totally write the library and header. One step at a time.,avr,cp7rvkk,1,t5_2qm3v
4045585,0,t1_crgw0ou,remember for every io port every io pin there are  associated registers DDRx PORTx and PINx. ddr is for data direction does the portpin work as input or output? portx is for data output and pull.up enable. and pinx is mostly for data inputreading....these microcontrollers registers are mapped in some of the first data address I think its called IO registers or Special function registers so basically they are like a data  with a fixed address with the plus that you can access them with special io instructions in assemblerthe header included inside the ltavrio.hgt  that matches your microcontroller handles the adresses and names for most registers and their corresponding bits where the registers names are associated with its corresponding address in data memory and tne bit names are just constant from  to ..that means that you can turn on PB by doing    PORTB |ltltPBbut also    PORTB |ltltPCwhich mostly will work  but its a bad practice and isnt portable like what if you port to a microcontroller that doesnt have a port C? its header wouldnt have a PORTC and corresponding PC definition,avr,crhfdum,1,t5_2qm3v

11766003,0,t3_67vxho,You are using an ARM chip not an AVR chip.edit to be more helpfulThis isnt a very active subreddit and its not the correct one for your microcontroller.  I dont know if there is an active ARM community on reddit so I would try at rAskElectronics relectronics or rECE.  Someone in one of those communities will be able to help you. ,avr,dgtpg8r,3,t5_2qm3v
