5951199,0,t3_3w8phe,From a discussion on MeetupChristoph Martensgt I kind of share the idea of Hawkings arguments. The question will not be whether or not AIs take over the dominant role of evolution. The question is more like if they are accepted as humanequivalent beings before the law or not. If not we might have a big problem.gtgt Do you know the short video Humans Need not Apply? This video started a big discussion in the AI sector because AIs are inevitable and they are the result of our society and economy. We have to change our economy because we are not prepared.gtgt The problem is that preventing this technology isnt possible  because no single country on the planet would freely agree to not get that ridiculous amount of money to compete with others. And my personal bet is that in that situation Africa or Indonesia will be the next Silicon Valley of AIs if the Western world completely would agree to not use AI to extent.,lycheejs,cxzqd87,2,t5_38y40
