2435,0,t3_1u42i8,I recently went away for ten days with family for Christmas. I take a lot of little trips so I usually have a few toiletry bags packed with small versions of my essentials. In this particular bag I saw a small unlabelled plastic bottle with a clear liquid. It was almost full so I just brought it along without bothering to refill it which meant I also neglected to check what it was. I was unpleasantly surprised when I tried to use rosewater and ended up with baby oil.,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ceeprko,2,t5_2vfzu
11005,0,t3_1u8lhg,For me it was realizing I had a closet of basicclassic clothes in blackwhiteneutral colors and nothing else. I started finding accent pieces that I loved  a brightly colored scarf or cardigan some badass boots a crazy vintage necklace  and I mixed them with the basics. Scrolling through Modcloth and similar sites helped me decide what I actually like. In my opinion it should feel way more like developing your own personal style than following trends.This may be cheesy but I remember going to an art museum with a friend of mine. She knew tons about art  I knew basically nothing. She would ask my opinion of paintings and I would be reluctant to answer because I thought my minimal art knowledge meant I didnt have a right to have an opinion. She told me it wasnt anywhere near that complicated and to just look at a painting and see how it made me feel. It sounds simple but this advice changed the way I look at a lot of things including fashion.Best of luck!,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ceforjg,6,t5_2vfzu

I have sensitive skin now anyways and if I let them go too long they will bleed a little. I have to pluck weekly to prevent this.

174598,0,t3_1w30qa,Im going to second the idea to go to a gynecologist and get a swab and or blood test. It sounds like you may have contracted herpes. Herpes isnt necessarily a huge deal except that once you are infected you can pass it on and there isnt a cure. But for many people it is easily managed with lifestyle changes supplements and or medication. The first outbreak is usually the worst. If you are able to take an llysine supplement that may help relieve some if your symptoms. Look into diet changes for herpes chocolate and coffee can worsen symptoms as can oatmeal. I dont remember the other diet recommendations but there is a ton of info online. Definitely get checked out soon. A doctor can also prescribe you medicine to stop the outbreak if it is herpes.

368030,0,t1_cfi8e96,Find an online heart rate calculator Web MD has one only based on age but one based on your resting heart rate is better to find out how fast your heart should be beating when youre exercising to actually be doing the right amount of work! For example Im  and my resting heart rate is  which is actually a bit fast for my age but your heart slows down as you age so your resting heart rate will probably be higher which means when I exercise my heart rate needs to be between  and  beats per minute. If I dont get up into this range Im not working hard enough! You need to get in that range and stay in that range the length of time you stay in your range is the actual amount of time you should count for exercising. So like if you should get  minutes of exercise a day that doesnt mean  minutes total that means  minutes in your target heart rate with time to warm up and cool down. Have you considered running? Its a great way to get your heart rate up and easy to do. You dont have to try to run very fast or far at first just work at your own level. Dont go super easy on yourself but dont try to be an olympic athlete either. One other thing since I noticed you complaining about belly fat. Our bodies build fat around our essential organs in our middles first and then starts building it outwards. When you start to burn that fat your body works in reverse order losing the fat on the outer edges first before moving to the middle. No matter how many stomach exercises you do your belly fat will be the last thing to go. Im telling you this because I dont want you to be discouraged or to be confused by exercises billed to burn belly fat. Theyre all lies. Theres no way to target specific areas of fat. You get your heart rate up start burning calories and the body takes from areas of fat as it sees fit. ,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,cfiwu06,1,t5_2vfzu

So dont worry about that. As for preparations make sure you wear loose clothing yoga pants or sweat pants are perfect and youre probably going to get wax andor baby powder on them so wear a pair you dont mind getting a little dirty. Theyll step out of the room for you to remove your underwear and while they give you a towel to cover your lap they will make themselves right at home down there so its really a false sense of protection. Also they will probably talk to you as if you were getting your nails done. Its awkward at first but youll get used to it. I usually take some ibuprofen before I go so it lessens the pain. And finally I would shower beforehand after all shes got to be up close and personal with your body itd be nice if you were clean for her!That said good luck and enjoy amazing smoothness with no razor burn for a couple weeks depending on your hair!

I was a bridesmaid in both weddings. Do you know how hard it is to twerk in a ballgown? We all basically ended up doing that thing where you stand in a circle holding hands and spin around really fast like Jack and Rose on the goddamn Titanic but with more people and sans shipwreck the result of which actually looked really cool in pictures all the bridesmaids in black floorlength ballgowns and the bride in white in the center. At my sisters wedding semifancy outdoor we did the same thing. Shes a worse dancer than me though but my uncles all stole the show because they all danced like they were channeling the spirit of Michael Jackson  it was amazing to watch.Have you ever seen that Julia Roberts movie My Best Friends Wedding? Theres that part where Julia Roberts tries to embarrass Cameron Diaz by forcing her to go sing karaoke. Cameron Diaz suuuuuuucks at singing but everybody in the bar cheers her on because shes trying and shes having fun. Thats pretty much how it works for wedding dancing as well. I can almost guarantee you wont be the worst dancer there and you probably wont even be the only BAD dancer there. Anyway people tend to focus on the really good dancers unless you are spectacularly bad. Like falling over breaking stuff dressripping bad. Moreover all eyes will be on the bride at almost all times so I genuinely wouldnt even be worried about it. Just dance and wiggle and have a good time with your friend on her special day.If its really that important just invite ME to the wedding and then you definitely wont be the worst dancer there.

1631708,0,t3_2d0eib,a few thingsWhere I go it is the exact same price as a manicure. this can vary by salon but it shouldnt be double the price like ever. You can buy it in store and do it yourself but I found the store versions dont last any longer than regular polish because they dont use the proper UV setting lamp.  Gel isnt fake nails like acrylic its just a harder polish.  It goes on your nails and dries instantly with the curing lamp they use so there is no smudging and whatnot.  I personally have been using gel polish since it came out and will never go back.  I have really long healthy nails and they have not been damaged at all by gel but this is largely due to proper removal by the salon.  My nails are long and do not get in the way of doing anything I find the gel makes them a bit stronger.  It does not chip and for me it lasts a month.  It grows out a lot but it will last  days without any problems.  You can buy a proper gel kit but you need the polish lamp and other stuff which can be a bit pricey like  perhaps?  The salon techs say it is harder to do properly so I just havent bothered. So I would call around and try a different salon!  I pay  for a shellac manicure same as a regular polish one.

1657455,0,t3_2db54u,Heres one I am pretty sure I never told anyone...bonus it contains poop!When I was in grade school I used to go to a home daycare at a neighbors house before and after school. We were not allowed to go upstairs in the house because of some reason or other to do with daycare certification. There was one bathroom downstairs. Occasionally the daycare ladys daughter would go take a shower there and before she showered the daycare lady would make a last call for bathroom. One day she made the last call and I was like oh ok but then about  minutes in I had to poo really bad. She wouldnt let me use the upstairs bathroom though even though I really had to go. So....I ended up pooping myself. And when I finally had access to a bathroom again I was quite horrified and cleaned up best I could....then later that night I overheard my parents debating whether they should be discussing the disgusting pair of underwear in the laundry WHY I didnt just throw them in the trash is a mystery to me. They opted not to discuss it unless it happened again but it was mortifying even for an elementary schooler.tldr Evil daycare lady caused me to poop myself way after the age when that is acceptable.,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,cjo32x2,3,t5_2vfzu

In a year get rid of everything that still has the clothespinsafety pin still on it. This is more long term but a good idea. An alternative is to always put your clean clothes on the left side of your closet and then in a year get rid of all of the clothes that you never wear that have accumulated on the right side.

You can absolutely say a nice thing about the gossipee but leave out any specific sentiments that attempt to shame the speaker.  My main trick I like to use is the blank reply Huh. You can just reply huh or hmm over and over  genuinely just to indicate youre listening and let their sentences hang in the air as they may. I have found this works quite well at causing gossippers to come to their own conclusion they are being petty because they are forced to hear whatever ugly thing they actually just said aloud just hanging there like a comedian whose joke no one is laughing at.

2618285,0,t1_cn0c5yw,Ah. I lived in Davis for a few years but dont know much about Sacramento.Honestly? Its lame and cliche but the best thing is to pick some of your own stuff you want to work on school exercise job whatever and to focus on that. I had decent success with meetup groups in Los Angeles and while the people might be older just getting yourself out of the house and adding some momentum to things can help push you from a rut.If you have a chance to get a job or internship at a larger organization go for it! Meeting people through work is really convenient. And dont be afraid to ask girls to hang out! Seriously! In the event that you do run into someone and the convo is going well mention that youre new  dont have a friend group right now  suggest grabbing coffee. People are generally more amiable to that then youd think. And sure some girls might balk but do you really want to be friends with them? Its easier to make friends if youre more invested in getting to know people than you are in looking cool. But honestly time is the biggest factor.After i finished college I had a few lonely years until things picked up speed and I developed a closer friend group Im  for reference.

However in my experience shopping for clothes was really difficult. They just dont have a mainstream consumer centric culture like we Americans are used to. There were a few ultra high end boutiques with  blouses and then scattered swap meet types places and basically nothing in between. When I was there my socks and underwear started to get worn out and I could never find a Target like place to just get a bunch of solid basics. I think youd be better off doing some online shopping at places like Lands End where the clothes are truly designed for warmth unlike in SoCal where I live where winter stuff looks cute but doesnt actually keep you warm.Good luck!

3039575,0,t3_2uz7u8,. typically heres what i do.  i park as close to the venue as as i can if im driving  so far no issues.  also consider biking if its reasonable quick  min bike ride isnt a big deal.. when i have to walk i am certain to bring a LONG jacket  usually dark in colour and goes to the knee. this is my beater club jacket. so if i lose it or something happens to it no one cares. my reasoning in doing this is essentially to cover up and not draw attention to myself. people are more likely to target the drunk girl in slutty club clothes than they are a woman walking in a long overcoat. . i typically carry a weapon this includes a knife or pepper spray  rape whistles and personal alarms do fuck all. spend the  get yourself some maise. carrying a weapon does not make you invincible and it can be used against you. use it responsibly.. when i walk i try to walk briskly confidently and like a sober person in a rush. people are more likely to be victims if they display themselves as vulnerable aka a drunk girl dressed in a slutty club outfit and stumbiling like a mess.. i would try to avoid walking or if i did have to walk i would walk on a well lit street and busy area. so if you can take  bus straight home then do it even if it takes a little bit longer. if you must take  buses unless the interchange is at a bus station or a well lit  popular area i would just take the first bust then cab the rest of the way. . when in the cab call someone anyone and start having a convo with them even fake one. sometimes cabbies think its open season on drunk girls.. when in doubt walk into a store knock on a house go into an apartment lobby and call a cab. i AM NOT joking if ever you feel like you are being followed or in danger immediately exit the situation call a friend call a cab. dont ignore your inner feeling. a  cab ride is a small price to pay when the alternative is rape or robbery. . find other FEMALES to walk with sometimes when i am out alone i will go to a local pizza shop grab a slice and ill keep my eye out for loners. more often than not ill see another girl sitting alone and ill invite them to my table. usually they are just as grateful and youd be surprised how well it can work out.  . i did not suggest calling mom and dad because we all know mom and dad will come for you. the thing is you have to be independant mom and dad arent going to around for ever. i find it very very sad that as a woman i have to take these steps. its very unfortunate that i cant go out for a simple night on the town and enjoy myself. this truly is a short coming on our society.,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,cod1tqu,9,t5_2vfzu

After using some estrogen cream that he prescribed Ive been feeling much better and several other symptoms have improved as well moodinessmood swings being the main ones.Do you have any other symptoms that you have noticed?

Do not douche because that throws everything off even more. Let your vagina rebalance itself by leaving it alone. That doesnt mean you have to have him pull out for health reasons because everything downstairs can and will balance itself back out but it does mean that if you want downstairs to be smelly less frequently that you may want to give things more time to find balance again before throwing it off. Unless you want things to never ever be smelly which is a tall order since humans are often sometimes smelly anyway you can find some sort of middle ground between him pulling out and him cumming inside.Also ditto to uTwoTonTuTus suggestion of peeing after sex.

First lubrication preferably natural because that stuff is top notch helps IMMENSELY with preventing tearing. And second as you get more turned on the cervix slowly moves a little bit further back allowing for deeper penetration without the pain that sometimes comes from having your cervix struck like a gong.Unless you had a thick hymen intact before having sex putting in tampons should not be any different. The sex makes you stretch out myth is just that  a myth. It takes having regular sex for YEARS with the same size penis or dildo? for your vagina to do any remodeling of its own. And even then it naturally changes only in order to give you more pleasure. Some additional fun facts going pee before and especially after sex will help prevent UTIs. If you havent had one spoiler alert its like the Lord of Light decided to camp out in your urethra. Not fun. If you like giving your guy BJs but hate the taste ask him to introduce a little more fruit fruit juice into his diet. Pineapple is generally suggested as a pleasant lovejuice enhancer.

Watching them for a day or so gets your mind in gear and allows you to envision goals. rxxfitness and rfitness have great sidebars for help! Remember that weight loss is really portion control and exercise. If you have a pedometer of some sort whether band or phone or oldschool belt loop type try cranking out  steps a day. Eat three small major meals and then two snack meals. Reduce your sodium intake as well and youll drop water weight. Enjoying exercise is a major part. Youll hate it if youre not having fun.

Ive never gotten them professionally done but I usually stand about a metre  feet away from a mirror and do one of two things.The first thing you can do is take a brow pencil and fill in your eyebrows. Choose a shape you like experiment with thickness and then you can go close to the mirror and pluck stray hairs that are obviously not in the shape you filled in.The second way is to stand away from the mirror and just outline your brow I do this with a white or cream coloured eyeliner black looks weird and then go closer to the mirror and pluck any hairs outside or on the lines you drew with your pencil.Another user said always shape from below not above and whilst this is kind of true never SHAPE from above you CAN still pluck above. Many ladies have stray hairs above the arch of their brows but dont actually have a high arch this would cause their brows to have a pseudoEiffel Tower shape lol.Anyway theres my advice!

So if it might help someone else Im going to recommend it. I have UTIs almost constantly. Like literally. At the very least cranberry juice is awesome for symptom management might still have the infection but cant feel it at all and Ive had plenty of experiences where Ive been diagnosed with one drank a fuckton of juice and it went away. Maybe it would have gone away anyway no one can know that. I got a kidney infection from a UTI once and it was after taking antibiotics so I wouldnt say that only the people drinking cranberry juice are the ones getting the infections. Its not dangerous medical advice to tell someone that cranberry juice will help them feel better. Its very likely to help with the symptoms at least and if it doesnt work she can do antibiotics and urinary pain relievers. ,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,crugymx,3,t5_2vfzu

You cant rely on people you already know they have their own thing going on and may or may not be there for you. Youll miss your family a lot more than you thought you would. But it is so worth it.

The pain is tolerable especially if you place an icepack on the area andor distract yourself with a game on your phone or something!

4508377,0,t3_3ctude,Its very likely your butt will get wet so I recommend a swimsuit bottom and some athletic or swim shorts. Unless there are waves or youre going with people who will likely splash you a regular athletic shirt and sports bra should be fine. Make sure you wear sunscreen too!Also since its your first time Id recommend wearing a life jacket. Depending on the water and the stability if your kayak every type is different it can really save you in case you tip over. Some states require a life jacket to be present in the kayak at all times by law. Id recommend putting your phone away in a waterproof container and not taking it out while kayaking so you dont risk dropping it. I typically leave my phone in the car to be honest. Bring something to drink and make sure it has a lid that you can close so no cans!. We typically brought granola bars as snacks because you can eat them easily without ever really touching the food but we also go river kayaking where the water is very unsafe to consume. Id still recommend something easy to eat with one hand.Here are the two most important rules of kayaking DONT get close to any fallen trees or anything that you cant easily go under because its easy to get trapped and if there is any current you can get pulled underwater. Also DONT LOSE YOUR PADDLE. If you tip over save the paddle first!!! Other people can catch your kayak easier than the paddle and a kayak without a paddle is useless.

Like the worst gas and constipation pains youve ever felt exponentially worse.  And the pain spreads to my hips back legs random joints as if its that achiness when youre coming down with the flu.

You ought to get a second opinion first and foremost. But definitely investigate other versions of the pill because its very possible that your side effects are due to the specific levels of hormones from the one you tried and you may not experience them with other variations. For example I had off and on bouts of terrible headaches with the traditional  day estrogenprogestin pills but I have not had any issues since I switched to one with a lower dose of hormones.

I am merely trying to find a way for us to both be happy with our sex life again. I am trying to be considerate of his feelings because I know how much he really hates condoms.I didnt make this post because he told me he refuses to use condoms ever under any circumstance. I made it because I know it would make him very unhappy if we needed to go back to using them and I would like to find an alternative if one exists.My husband is really great understanding not pushy.

5456985,0,t1_cw8nlql,I really empathize with what you are experiencing though as a cisfemale I cannot say that I have gone through all of what you are going through. I have however experienced suicidal depression for many years in my past and many of the portions of what you have shared scream of the same type of experience and for that aspect I can tell you that it does get better especially with a good support network and mental health treatment though its possible to find relief without it it goes SOOOOO much faster with. Further Im also quite aware of a variety of transgender issues and want to offer various resources I think might be a good jumping off point for you so that you can stop feeling the way you are currently which you have repeatedly indicated you wish to stop feeling.For what its worth I fully accept you as a female. Some resourcesrTransSpace has some resources a long list of additional subreddits you may find useful for support and even a chat room listed in their sidebarI realize you are in counseling currently but you also indicate that you havent found them to be very helpful. I also have two degrees in psychology did internship and  years doing social services and all of the research Ive read from my professional experience in that realm indicates that the  indicator of a good outcome in therapy is if the client you feels like there is a good connection with the therapist and that therapy is working well. As simple as it is that metric has shown time and time again to be the best predictor of successful outcomes in therapy. Any time that is not present time and money is being wasted on services that arent making a difference or at least not enough of a difference to be worth the time and money being spent on them. My strong suggestion is to find another therapist and keep looking until you find one that you feel good about seeing. Im sure its obvious that not all therapists are the same some are amazingly excellent with some issues but phenomenally terrible with others some are very skilled some halfassed their way through school and internships some will be a great fit and some will be a complete waste of your time not to mention everything else in between all of these options. Just because one or even a few arent working out doesnt mean they are all bad. You have to take the time to interview them find someone that is skilled in the areas you wish to address and dont ever forget that YOU are hiring THEM not the other way around. If they arent providing you with the service for which you have hired them fire them and find someone that can do a better job. If you would like some suggestions on how to find a better therapist feel free to let me know and Ill be glad to give you some suggestions and point you in the direction of some resources to assist as well but I wont do that in this comment without knowing that is what you are seeking.I am deeply sorry to learn that you are having such a difficult time and I truly hope that your post and the replies provided will offer you the resources and tools you are seeking to feel better and assist you to move toward feeling the way you have desired for so long.,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,cw96jij,2,t5_2vfzu

5612775,0,t3_3rza1s,I have wide and flat feet. Some heels and some flat shoes are difficult for me to walk in. I work in retail and I like to look fashionable so sometimes that means I wear heels to work. Here are some of my tips Without heels I walk in long strides. With heels I have to remember to shorten my strides. If I can find wide sizes I will obviously shoes a heel with a wider width. Shoes made of real leather stretch and conform to your foot better than fake leather. Real leather also breathes more so your foot is less sweaty. Sweaty feet  nonstretchy fake leather usually results in blisters all over my foot.  I buy a lot of the gel inserts andor blister bandages to protect the back of my heels and baby toes cut them to size when breaking in a new pair of shoes. Platforms and hidden platform heels are much better than heels without. The platform gives you height but reduces the overall height of the heel for your foot.  Rubbery heels and platforms are much more comfortable than solid plastic metal or wood heels and platforms. The rubberyness has more bounce when you walk. Im very fortunate that chunkier rubbery heels are more in fashion than the pencilthin stilettos of before. Heels with a flared base are also easier to walk in than shoes that come to a tapered skinnier point. Booties and shoes with straps provide more ankle support. My flat feet mean that I have overpronation and will often roll my ankles in heels. Im less likely to roll my ankles in heels that dont slip and slide all over when Im walking. Rounded toe almond toe or boxy roundish toe are much more comfortable than pointy toe heels. I always keep backup shoes at work and change into another shoe as soon as I can feel my feet are about to die. I dont wear heels two days in a row. ,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,cwsths9,24,t5_2vfzu
5621075,0,t3_3s11cx,If youre willing to splurge go to a place like Clinique.  You can schedule a makeover and they can show you how to do everything and explain it to you.If you cant do that the most basic natural look you can get is a foundation that matches a good mascara and an eyelash curler.  I recommend Voluminous Million Lashes Excess by LOreal.  Its phenom.  Ignore contouring.  Its ridiculous.  Decide if you want blush or bronzer both can end up looking cakey.  I prefer bronzer suck in your cheeks and where you collapse is where it goes.  For blush smile and put it on the apples!Tutorials on YouTube are still really great and I watch A LOT of them.  I never got taqught how to use makeup.  High school I was a wreck.  Same with most of my undergrad.  It has taken me a lot of trial and error.  The best thing to do is look at tutorials not for a full look but something specific.  A tutorial on how to apply blush or bronzer.  A tutorial on how to pencil your eyebrows.  And then there are tons of tutorials for eyeshadow if you want to get into that too.  An investment palette is the Naked palette.  Tons of tutorials on it.  A cheaper palette with good pigments is Hard Candy.  And I know theres some other drugstore palettes but basically find tutorials on a palette youre willing to buy.  If you like those tutorials buy that palette.Ive literally stayed up some nights just experimenting and trying things out.  Ive tried out a gazillion mascaras if you have any questions about that I practically buy a new kind every time I go buy a new tube.

5624438,0,t3_3rtruo,I dont wax nowadays but I used to buy those premade cold wax strips and do my legs and armpits so I have a couple of tips.Before using the wax strips rub them while still glued to one another to spread the wax better. Your legs must be clean and dry. You just glue the strip rub it to ensure its well glued and pull it  to me in my legs it barely hurts and I used to do it alone in my armpits its much worse.I cut triangular shapes on the strips while still closed for the pits and pull them downwards opposite to my hair direction. In any body part you have to pull it quickly at once or the hair AND the wax will just stay on the skin and itll hurt a lot. Think about a decapitation lol. Gotta be fast and precise.When you are done very possibly there will be some small patches of wax in the skin. I remove mine with a cotton ball and oil rubbing gently.

5682221,0,t3_3sxbw7,Your experiences sound a lot like mine in high school. The people treating you rudely are just as insecure as you. Some of them are trying to prop up their own self esteem by bringing you down. The rest are subjecting you to a subtle social exclusion in the hopes that the bullies will continue targeting only you and leave them alone. This absolutely sucks and Im sorry you have to deal with it. As you get older you will have more choice in the people you spend time with and will be able to avoid the most obnoxious types.Among my friend group I dont think any of us dated until we were at least  and in college. If youre a more serious studious type the dating scene doesnt really heat up until your early twenties. Youre not undesirable but most of your peers are probably too busy studying and dealing with their own crippling insecurities to go on dates.People youve shared a classroom with for a few years do not have more insight into your personality and worth as a person than the people that raised you and have known you your entire life.

5787200,0,t3_3ucl0a,Ive dealt with so many different types of Canadian winters so I definitely know what youre going through. However I am a winter lover so hopefully some of the things that make me love winter will help you out  If youre lucky enough to be in a city where you get sunlight in the winter e.g. not Vancouver try to enjoy the sunlight whenever you can! Walks in the winter can be amazingly beautiful as long as you avoid slushy areas. Also sunrises are super gorgeous and the great thing is that theyre later in the day! I try and see a sunrise every weekend. Its a nice way to get me up early but not like  am early and you get to see a gorgeous spectacle especially if theres a nice area to view them  which there usually is within a bit of walking distance or a drive depending on where you live. Its hockey season!!! I get so excited for hockey season its incredible. I am most social during the winter because I feel like Im always going out to bars to watch hockey games. If none of your friends are fans or youre not a fan of the hometown team then you can usually find groups that are fans of that team in your city and theyll have meet ups posted. Ive definitely done this before all by myself and let me tell you Im super shy but everybody was super welcoming and just happy to find another fan.Most towns have events that include lights whether it be for Christmas or just general lighting which can be really pretty and a great mood booster. Last year I had SAD pretty badly as I was super busy and living in Vancouver. So my friends and I started a list of cafescheap restaurantsbars we wanted to go to and whenever one of us was feeling down we would go to one. It helped so much to try a new thing for cheap and to get me out of my own head. Personal suggestion  places with board games or books you can read. Theyre amazing.

5882408,0,t3_3vtsd7,I suffered through well over a year of constant pain in my back because of my IUD. My doctor would roll her eyes at me and tell me there was no way in hell the IUD was the problem. I had a long list of symptoms that magically appeared when the IUD did but I was promised the was no correlation. I finally could not take it any more and insisted it be removed. While removing it she conceded it was not in the right place. Lo and behold the stabbing in my back was the IUD stabbing me in the cervix and it was gone the same night as the removal. I was literally not without pain every day of my life for more than a year and I could not sit or stand up straight.It has taken months of yoga and massages to straighten myself back out entirely but please listen to your body. Do not let them tell you what you feel is not what you think. Doc said she did not doubt there was pain but was certain the IUD did not have anything to do with it. She was wrong.

Sometimes when booking the appointment they will ask you if you prefer a male or female masseurs. If not asked then you will usually either get two women or a man and a woman and asked who you would like to give your massage. After that you both are lead to a room and instructed to undress to your level of comfort while they workers leave the room. Get undressed and get under the sheets. One sheet below you and one sheet on top. The workers will knock and ask if you are ready and come in. Then get massages! They should ask if their touch is too strong or light and just let them know. In the USA weve always been on massage tables next to each other.

I am still learning with the whole hair thing though. My hair generally looks average to poor. I also find that good eyebrows make a surprisingly big difference so I try to keep my eyebrows done in the shape that Ive found after much trial and a lot of error suits my face best. As for smell I dont know. I use a coconut hair conditioner which I really like and the smell of that lingers. I have a couple of perfumes that I like too but I usually forget to wear them.

Just send it with your other documents birth certificate etc and boom. Passport in new name. It also means when you marry you are literally Mrs Husbands Last Name the moment you say I do. Technically for our legal system your married as soon as you sign the registrar but swapping rings etc is just added frill. You can confirm you are who is on the certificate say that you agree to the marriage sign and done. Our ceremony was  mins long and that was with our own vows and words when we exchanged rings.

I have medical based degree but Im no doctor so dont take my word for it! A simple blood test can check just check with a doctor. Or eat some iron rich foods. Fresh orange juice is best to aid iron absorption. Or nuts and leafy green veg.

Great chest? Try new necklines necklaces scarves maybe a close fitting blazer... Another trick is to wear a simple black top and a dark jean and have lots of fun with your accessories I use a bright rainbow scarf or a red blazer for such occasions but you can also go crazy with jewelry if thats your thing or some colorful shoes or purse. Find one thing you really love and dont be afraid to spend a little extra on it and put some less distracting things with it so it shines bonus you can skimp on the basics since the eye doesnt go there first.,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,d2d9k20,2,t5_2vfzu

Good commonsense habits like staying out of the sun staying hydrated moisturizing regularly and not yoyo dieting gaining and losing significant amounts of weight over a relatively small amount of time PLUS the passage of time will cause them to fade. I do want to add an important caveat and thats that stretch marks in the grand scheme of things dont matter and they dont make you ugly. Ive had stretch marks since I was very young preteen and thats just how my skin works. Nobody has ever judged me or liked me less because of them.

Also if your having a hard time try Torrid. They cater to women that may be more voluptuous or curvy in the hips or bust area. People say oh thats a plus size store WTF does that mean anyways?

7721372,0,t3_4l0zo1,Ive shaved my head a few times so I get the awkward want to grow my hair out but what the hell do I do right now?? Phase. Head bands can be a life saver. And you can get so many cute ones and bandanas. Blow drying can really help as can a light paste or wax to get your hair staying in the right direction.I know you said you got a cut recently and they said that its a pixie but you should find someone else who can do something nicer to the bangs Im thinking something like Emma Watsons pixie cut. With the right shape and angle you have so much to work with and play with. As it grows out itll start naturally going toward being a side bang. Then you get all sorts of fun styles like braided bangs and pompadoures. I hope that helps some! Hair can be so troubling Im just growing out my bangs and AAAAAAH!

8018799,0,t3_4p1t8q,Lemme break it down for ya. Gel Think of this as extra thick super strong polish. Its done with special polish and every layer is set with a UV light. Lasts a long time and looks shiny the whole time. Only problem is you need to have nice nails for it the gel shows any cracks or peeling and most nail techs wont apply it if your natural nails arent in good condition. Acrylic Fake nails. Its quite a process but I think its the best option for what youre looking for. They start by smoothing out your nails with files and cutting them short then they glue a nail tip on which is super long and scary. They cut the plastic tips to the length you want and then apply the acrylic. Its a powder that they make into a gel with acetone and apply over your nail and the plastic tip. Then they smooth it out and paint your new nail as usual.Id recommend getting gel polish over acrylic it wont be in danger of chipping and you can keep it for like  weeks if you want! You DO have to go back to the salon to get it removed dont try to do it yourself youll damage your natural nails.

8059741,0,t3_4pfqi6,As someone whose had two please consider ANYTHING else. Ive had  separate copper IUDs. I have not had children and am in my thirties.I had the first inserted when I was  and it was horrifying  the pain was so intense I nearly passed out on the table and I felt violated and scared. Im not trying to scare you  but nobody prepared me and Id certainly wished they had. Once it was in I had extremely heavy periods for about a year and then they cooled off to a normalish volume and length. In general once my body settled I totally loved being off hormones and having peace of mind. It lasted for  years and was then knocked halfway out and stayed that way for a couple of months before I figured out why I was in so much discomfort It then had to be removed which was extremely uncomfortable.  I went birth control free for a few years I wasnt dating and then decided Id like to try it again because I wanted to be on something I could control and knew I could rely on. Going into the second insertion I felt like I knew what I was up against I took a lot of ibuprofen I have no idea why in the hell they dont give you something much stronger I asked and it was denied and also opted to have my cervix numbed for the procedure which did help a bit. That said it was just nearly as bad and I almost had an anxiety attack on the table in my doctors gown about having to go through the same thing again.  Sadly my triumph after conquering the second insertion was short lived it apparently didnt go well my body expelled it halfway out the next day and I had to be taken to the ER to have it fully fixed. My advice is this I agree with someone else who suggested that nobodys experience with an IUD is like anybody elses experience with an IUD.  Despite insertions being a particular form of torture I wouldnt wish on anyone I LOVED mine until it became a serious SERIOUS health risk. My little sister recently called and asked my opinion on this as she was considering getting one and I told her to do literally ANYTHING else. IMHO while they provide seemingly worry free protection and a lot of women sing their praises things can AND DO go wrong and I can honestly say some of my scariest health moments have been IUD related and staring down the gun of emergency surgery for a fucking birth control method really doesnt seem worth it.  I wish my health care provider had been more open about the risks and making sure I was fully briefed at .... I think they just thought I was going to run around having fun at college and wanted to get me on something fast even though that was the farthest thing from what was going on. Finding a birth control method that works for you can be extremely difficult. I think what Id like for you to take away from this comment isnt necessarily the horrible experiences I had but just to know that they are present and can happen because so many people gloss over them and assume you wont become a statistic.   If you are certain you want to get one make sure you go to a doctor you trust and not a nurse be sure to ask for cervical numbing and anything stronger than ibuprofen and be very in tune to your body to make sure you know if something is out of line. Also if something feels weird to you at any point do NOT hesitate.... get yourself seen immediately.,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,d4lzoep,0,t5_2vfzu

For myself I alternate between just applying it to the light parts and applying it all over since it is a slightly different tone than my actual tan. Depending on the difference between the colors you might do  on white parts before applying to the darker parts. With Jergens and any selftanner just remember to EXFOLIATE. I usually will super exfoliate once a week in order to start from scratch otherwise it starts to look really patchy and uneven.. You can apply Jergens more than once a day.

That doesnt mean that it wouldnt be honorable or something to feel satisfied just by doing something nice for someone else... But pretty much no one actually does that.A turning point for me was taking a depression inventory with a counselor. After reading my answers he asked me Was there anyone in your life who was really critical of you? The answer was my father and I started very gradually to distance myself from how he had raised me. If you look at my posting history I started this account a few years ago when I finally realized he was mentally ill and my childhood was abusive.

There are a few things I would note tho Incoming gross overshare! The way you take this thing in and out involves bearing down like youre pooping so if you poop you will want to take this thing out first or it will slip lower. Because of this i usually wait to have a BM until I get home for the day.  Youre also going to have a bit of a learning curve taking it out and putting it in where you will get blood all over your bathroom. Not trying to gross you out but it happens. It took me about  periods to really get it down. Even once you learn how to put it in and take it out super smooth you will still get blood on your hands. It just happens. Make sure to keep a pin around in your bathroom to clean out the holes along the top of the cup so it can expand properly. those holes are TINY and it feels like they clog every time i take the cup in and out.I highly recommend if you are going to use a cup to make sure youre also using a period prediction app and to track more than just your bleeding. Youre gonna learn a lot about how your bits work and your bodys idiosyncracies but its so much better i promise.If you have any questions let me know.,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,d5h1cp6,1,t5_2vfzu

8357215,0,t3_4u11hj,I have weird skin that reacts differently to certain ingredients. As an example most shampoos will give me little bumps all over my head kinda like mini pimples. So a few years ago I dropped scented everything and really simplified my toiletries laundry supplies and even my dish detergent. I wash dishes by hand Deodorant wise I switched to a crystal stick and I honestly fucking love it!!!  It took about a week for my skin under my arms to start to change and because I had been using regular deodorant for my entire life I had no idea that the skin under my arms was so soft and blemish free. Within a month I swore I would never use anything but a crystal stick. I have never had problems with odour since the switch even in the grossest sweatiest conditions. Bonus a stick costs  and lasts about a year and a half I used to easily spend that a month. I have found since switching my bodyhouseclothing to scent free products and as much chemical free stuff as possible I now really notice scents on other people. It also made me realize that a lot of people dont smell that great not just from BO but also because they have so many layered scents on them. I can smell peoples laundry detergent on their clothes mix in their perfume deodorant shampoo hand cream etc. and frankly a lot of people just dont smell appealing. ,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,d5m7cp4,1,t5_2vfzu

8400084,0,t3_4uoob9,The solution to both of these problems is to fall into a routine! Have a routine that keeps you busy every single day. The good thing about a routine is that it keeps you busy so you dont have time to wallow in your sadness. The other added bonus is that it puts you in the same places around the same times so that you see the same people and can eventually form relationships with them. I like to work out whenever Im feeling lost or going through a big change in my life its a productive way to spend my time I feel good endorphinslooking goodCONFIDENCE and it doesnt require friends or a group at all. I work a  job so I usually go to the gym after work. There are fitness classes Ive met some friends in and then when I see them around the gym Im able to say hi which can later transform into small conversations which lead to getting their number which leads to happy hour which leads to friendship! You can find other hobbies or activities through meetup.com as well. Weekends are a little harder but not too bad if you start planning the week before. Make plans with a coworker to hit a matinee movie grab a bite to eat hit happy hour etc. If that is too hard for you maybe you can find a side job to do on the weekends for fun that also gives you some extra cash.

They are told when they are very young how it is wrong to push other kids or hit other kids or take things that belong to other kids.

Their purpose is to absorb oilgrease so you can get away without shampooing an extra day but I find theyre also volumizing even if your hair is not particularly oily. Its usually an aerosol powder spray if youve never used any before.So like midday when it starts to fall flat spray some on your roots all around lift up the top sections and spray towards the scalp so dont just get the top layers give it a minute or two to set in then flip your head upside down and tousle your hair around a little. If your hair now looks powdery run a brush through to shake off the excess shampoo powder.Side effect this may make your hair feel dry for the rest of the day.edit I think its totally cool for you to post here and I hope everyone else agrees!

Very very appropriate for work if you go with the professional clog. They also last a long time. My pairs last over  years with daily use. In fact I get bored of the color before they go bad.Dansko makes a lot of other great styles for work but the clog is the most versatile and the most comfortable for me. You might like their Mary Jane styles for a dress if you dont like the clog style.Id encourage you to go to REI or another dealer and try them on in person. Then search online for other colors if you dont want to go with standard black.Edit for anyone that is interested in an old pair I have a size  pro clog with blue swirl leather that Ill be donating if no one wants me to ship them free Im nice like that.

8913398,0,t3_52cayp,Keep searching for a new job  maybe one not in the HR department this time! In the meantime I would definitely suggest seeking counseling from a therapist trained to deal with depressionanxiety. I know it can be really difficult to convince yourself to go to therapy or maybe you think only crazy people go to therapy or youre not bad enough for therapy these were struggles I had when I was debating therapy!  but you just need five seconds of courage to make a phone call to schedule an appointment.I have really bad anxiety too. Going to therapy hasnt cured my anxiety per se but I have learned coping skills so that I know what to do whenever Im in rough situations and I can keep my anxiety under control. If your therapist deems it necessaryuseful you can also be prescribed an antianxiety medicine. So far I have found that with medicine it greatly lessens my anxiety. So instead of my stomach pooling with dread and getting physically ill when I think of something that makes me anxious I can just think about how it makes me nervous and what I can do about it.I hope this all helped and I hope things get better for you at work! x,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,d7j9d9x,9,t5_2vfzu

People went to school or moved or married and I miss what we used to have and I havent been able to find that same closeness with another group again.My ideasI write letters with select people from my previous group that I felt especially understood me. Even though they arent there with you there is something intimate about writing letters with a friend that makes me feel like I can really open up. It has been a solid source of support for me. Adult sports leagues are fun ways to meet people. Even if you arent sporty theres things like kickball that are easy enough and people are usually eager to meet others. Often teams have cookouts of watch the big game on the weekend. If you show up consistently its a good way to get in with a smaller group of people and working toward the goal of winning or having fun build camaraderie.And lastly organized religion can have a lot of social benefits. Im not religious but there are free thinker groups that almost work like a church but instead of a sermon youre essentially listening to TED talks and discussing them. Another awesome way to meet people but then also dive into deeper matters and discussions with them that can make you feel closer faster. I hope youre able to find what youre looking for!

But you must realize that you are not being cold you are setting personal boundaries and preserving your energy. People men and women flock to bright people like moths to a flame. They dont realize they are feeding on your energy but they are and it can be exhausting if you are not getting the same things they are out of the exchange.Do what you must. What you are doing is healthy and a form of self care. There may be some people who take this personally but that is not a problem you are responsible for. That would be them thinking the world revolves around them. I have a female coworker who does this to me. She literally follows me into the restroom shadows my movements etc. I know that it hurts her feelings when I walk away from her but I know I am not doing anything wrong.

9488495,0,t1_d9ilg3c,Well thats responsible parenting. Sorry. That pisses me off. Youre right that youre kinda between a rock and a hard place. However if you were able to get to a Planned Parenthood you could most certainly talk to them about different methods of more reliable birth control. If using your insurance is an impossibility financial help may made available to you depending on the exact circumstances. But in any case it is not a trip wasted. Have you ever had a genealogical gynaecological hello auto correct exam done like a Pap smear or anything? Typically once a woman becomes sexually active she should have a papsmear done once annually the frequency changes depending on where you live but where I am its once a year. Another possibility would be that your gynaecologist offers you a few sample packs of the pill if you decide to go down that road until you hit . My doctor regularly gave me sample packs just because she knew money was tight for me. I had the copper IUD implanted about a year and a half ago after I became pregnant by accident. Before that I had been on the pill for many years. I must say that I much prefer the IUD to the pills as the pills had a less than desired effect on my mood and wellbeing but not every woman reacts this way. The IUD is fantastic. It was definitely unpleasant getting it inserted and my first few periods were really painful but things have mellowed out now and my periods are incredibly regular and quick. And now I can have as much sex with my fianc as I want with very very little chance of pregnancy. Its pretty great!In terms of your BF please talk to him. Communication is insanely important and he may well feel youre upset with him. Everyone deals with stress in their own way but I find it is best to be forthcoming with loved ones when shit hits the fan. Much love!,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,d9inrrf,18,t5_2vfzu
9500700,0,t3_5awdau,This method works the best for me! Like seriously nothing else works as good as this does. When Im feeling irritated or think Im getting a yeast infection I do this and it almost immediately stops. Fill a glass with about oz of room temp water and splash some apple cider vinegar in. Id say about  or  tsp. Dont put a lot in or it will burn. You want the water to slightly smell like acv and have a little discoloration now. Next take a tampon and open it. Push it out halfway and submerge it in the water and acv mixture. You know what to do after that. It might be a little hard to get in because the tampon has expanded from the water but you can do it. Leave it in for as long as you want and is safe and repeat a few times if the itchiness etc. is stubborn. But this is my miracle solution I hope it works for you!!,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,d9k5wmb,7,t5_2vfzu

I imagine what theyre thinking looking around my bathroom while on the toilet and get a bit of anxiety over whether or not my shower curtain is straightened out and if my leagues of half empty shampoos are lined up in the shelves. Or that tiny toothpaste mark I missed in the sink. Or that area right around the faucet that always has grime in it some how.Visitors make me freak out cleaning haha but I always know when I missed a spot. I try to imagine or realize every one has dust bunnies somewhere. The attention to detail I have of my apartment likely is far stronger than that of my visitors. But stillPick up as I go and honestly I pour a glasses of wine and spend a free night cleaning the cracks and corners once a week. I try to keep it at that and look forward to it as more like Me time than cleaning time. That sounds sad as I type it out... I swear it isnt haha!Edit the attention to detail I have for my apartment is far greater than the attention to detail of my apartment my visitors have.

9673715,0,t3_5cwld1,Beauty? The media puts too much focus on this. I know its hard throughout school if youre not as attractive on the outside as your peers but as cliche as it sounds beauty also comes from within. Try not to focus on societies perception of beauty. It differs so much.Boys? Boys will be mean. Boys will be sweet. Boys will make up rumors about how youre a slut or how you wont put out. Best advice? Dont rise to those accusations. If youre well and truly hurt then please speak to a teacher you trust andor your guidance counselor. But try your very best not to let others see that it affects you because that will only spur them on more. A good response is If you want to believe him then believe him. But know that people dont always tell the truth. Also try not to get too invested in a guy that isnt interested in you. Yes it hurts because you really like them. But theres nothing you can do to make them have genuine feelings for you if they dont already have them. No amount of makeup or dieting will change that. And even if they do change their mind once youve dyed your hair or changed yourself in a way that you otherwise wouldnt have why would you want to date somebody who doesnt love you for just being you? Its hard to keep up a facade when you didnt really want to make those changes anyway. Girls? Girls can be just as mean as boys. And the above advice stands. Rise above it. If there are rumors then tell them to believe what they want but it doesnt necessarily make it true. The popular group of girls being nasty to another girl? Dont join in. Even if youre friends with the bullies. Stand up for the victim and call out the bullies. Understandably that can be quite hard especially if youre a nonconfrontational person. So if you cant bring yourself to speak out just dont get involved. Distance yourself from the bullies. Speak to a trusted teachersguidance counselor that girls X Y Z and bullying another kid. Ask them to keep an eye out. It may sound stupid but spread love and kindness. It will take you far. Its pays to be nice. Friends? The same as both the boys and girls section. Additionally friends will come and go. Be honest and truthful with friends. Dont lie. Dont lie to anybody for that matter. It makes it easier in the long run. Plus if you dont lie then you never have to keep up with excuses. Lies find a way of coming out at some point or another. If two or more friends are fighting stay neutral. I was the neutral person in school. And sure friends fell out with me over because I wouldnt take sides but its best to not take sides than to take a side just because. Of course there are exceptions. If one friend has done something explicitly bad and you dont agree with it then deal with it as you wish. But if its a petty fight always be Switzerland. Health? Be it mental or physical look after yourself! Regarding physical health you dont need to be a size . Thats not to say theres anything wrong with being a size  plenty of people are just naturally tiny. The point is is size does not automatically equal in shape. I know super slim people who cant run a mile and I know larger people leaning toward the overweightobese scale that can run . Of course there are slim people who can run for miles and larger people who cant. But the bottom line is is that size doesnt automatically mean you can or cannot do something. Just eat relatively healthy and look after your body. Youre allowed to eat whatever you want but your body does need nutrients that can only be found in fruit and veg. Treat yourself but also be aware of what youre putting in your body.School? It doesnt last forever! Whether you love or hate school it doesnt last forever and you will go on to bigger and better things! It may seem like school is the best or worst time of your life but it isnt permanent. Study hard! Grades arent necessarily everything but I can guarantee you that if you slack off and dont get great grades youll regret it. You may as well buckle down and do the work and do it well. It pays to get things done on time and to even do them at all. Youre not going to look back and say Man I regret working so hard in school. But you will look back and think Man I wish I worked a little harder and pushed my grade up one more level. Family? Hopefully your family are decent. If you generally have a good relationship with your family still know that there will be times when you dont get along. That is perfectly normal. Unless your parents are highly toxic people the chances are is that they are right about  of things. There comes a time in adulthood when you realize that your parents were right about the majority of things you argued with them about. There will come a time when you realize that you were a difficult person to deal with and in fact teenagers arent always right as they first assume. While thats all part of being a teenager let up on your parents a little. Dont be so hard on them all they want is the best for you. Obviously if you have an extremely toxic family then that doesnt apply and in which case I suggest surrounding yourself with great friends. Try to hang out at a friends house whose parents arent toxic. Loving parents are smart theyll figure out that you have it rough at home and wont mind you becoming an additional extra in their household when you just need to get away. Insecurities? Every single person has them. I know its difficult to overcome them but the secret is coming to terms that while youre still insecure about something try not to let it bother you so much. A lot of insecurities are things we cant change. For example I hate my earlobes. Theyre not attached to my headface so they kinda stick out a little. Its something that bothers me every time I look in a mirror but I tell myself that I cant change it without expensive surgery and even then theres no guarantee Ill like them. So while I hate them Ive also learned to live with them. Another thing I hate is that I have a mole right under my nose its not a dark brown or anything it does kinda blend in with my face but its still something always on my mind. But you know what happens when friends and I are talking about insecurities? They all say that they didnt even notice it until I pointed it out! Dont get me wrong there will be rude people who point out things that youre insecure about and that is difficult. But try your very best not to care so much about their opinions. You can still dislike something about yourself but still be okay with it. Just try to find that middle ground.,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,da5hlhe,2,t5_2vfzu
9689424,0,t3_5dsm0g,Have you thought about picking up running and signing up for a K? It helps a ton to have a goal that you are consistently training for and I absolutely LOVE RACES. Theyre just so fun! Everyone is cheering and happy and youre doing your best effort. And you get to see your training pay off! Seriously try signing up for a K in a few months! It doesnt matter what pace or if you stop to walk during training runs it just matters that youre achieving your goal. Running is also incredible for reforming how you view your body. I used to worry about calories food intake and overanalyze weight gain and loss but after consistently running for a few months I had a completely different view of my body. Now I view it as a machine to accomplish goals and food more as fuel. PLUS! The longer the distance you run the less guilt you have getting dessert D I seriously love it though not in the its life changing the minute you start running way but with the consistency of not skipping runs you will look in the mirror and see a new better version of yourself!

10222511,0,t3_5mdmd4,When I used to walk and have to dress professional I bought one of those large but professional purses to carry everything in so I wouldnt wear my nice clothes outside. Think something like those big Coach purses. It was enough I could roll some clothes and shoes inside. But generally I left my work shoes at work.Speaking of shoes winter boots are awesome. Theyre warm and professional looking.For your legs wear tightsleggings under your pants and take them off at work if its too hot. If you have a big purse you can change in a bathroom and put the tights in the purse and no one will know.I didnt bother with undershirts because changing tops messed up my hair. Instead Id just cover my work tops in regular casual zip up sweaters and then wear a professional looking coat on top. Depending on your work place even if its professional you may get away with a casual coat though. People are pretty understanding with winter fashion.If you need professional gloves buy a size up so you can wear liners or those heated warm packs. You can also put heated warm packs in your shoes by the way! Or just wear warm casual gloves and take them out and put them in your purse when you arrive.Because of my hair styles I couldnt wear hats. My head never got cold really anyway but my ears did. I got big fluffy white ear muffs. They actually look stylish while being super warm. Even better they have a headphone jack so I can listen to music or talk on the phone. That plus big scarves did the trick.If youre worried about your pants wrinkling consider making one pair of pants your walking professional pants and keeping the rest at work so you can change pants.,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,dc2s1gl,33,t5_2vfzu

So I would find out what color her dress is going to be first. If she is doing a standard White then yours would be great but if she is doing an off white or blush I would go for somethings else.

10295170,0,t3_5nemgz,i had a mirena insertion performed by Planned Parenthood  years ago and a second one performed by my GP  months ago. ive never been pregnant. the nerves before the procedure are definitely the worst part. they recommend you take some ibuprofen or comparable over the counter pain reliever beforehand and an electric heating pad or hot water bottle is your best friend for the cramps afterward. my GP was able to give me some antianxiety medicine before my most recent procedure but im not sure if PP is qualified to do that.if youve never had a pelvic exam the speculum is kind of weird and uncomfortable. mostly cold when its being inserted and then it feels like a cramp when they open your cervix. the insertion is pretty fast but it feels like kind of a pinchy cramp  probably one of the worstfeeling cramps for most people who havent had children but its only really bad for a second and then it fades within minutes. i think the whole procedure is about  minutes that includes a pelvic exam and whatever std testing you want i believe.Planned Parenthood is the BEST they do this stuff all day long the dr who inserted my first IUD was on  procedures. Ive found them to be so warm and friendly and they really help put you at ease if you tell them youre nervous. theres usually also a nurse or physicians assistant in the room to hold your hand and help distract you or you can ask for that if you feel you need it. youre in good hands!,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,dcb0hto,6,t5_2vfzu

I fucking hate being disappointed like this or feeling painregretblah after trusting someone enough for sex or some similar act of vulnerability then being all alone to deal with those majorly unpleasant feelings. Ive been there. Ive felt dumb and hurt and confused like that. Most of my very closest friends have too based on conversations weve had long after the fact. I wish wed had each other during those times. Its hard to handle it alone. Its hard to be fair with yourself when you dont have a second third or fourth opinion.None of this makes you pathetic or weak. We are all just trying our best to leverage our wants and needs with our logic and values. Sometimes we misjudge. Sometimes we judge perfectly fine but the other person deceived us or veered off course selfishly. Its all fine its all part of being a person. It would be great to have life unfold according to how we see ourselves living but it would make it awfully hard to learn and grow and do those brave s that set us on a new course. Im not saying this shitty dude is actually the blessed gift of a plot point for you but Im trying to say that feeling bad doesnt assign value to you or your choices or the situation. Its just a reaction. It means that wasnt for me. The more this wasnt for mes and this WAS for mes you rack up the easier it get to propel yourself towards more happy places and fewer ugh nope detours. I hope your next stop is a happy place. I hope you can be kind to yourself and do something really nice to thank your mind and body for giving you some honest feedback. I hope you get some time with your best friends to unwind and if you choose talk about and process this experience. I hope tomorrow is better and the next day even better.

10862566,0,t3_5v9iw6,First see a gyno and rule out things like BV and yeast infection.  As for washing no soap on the inner folds just water. I use a detachable shower head to make sure its hit the nooks and crannies. Make sure your toilet paper is not bleached or has any things added to it I use the plain recycled from whole foods. Make sure you wipe front to back and get all urine off. Consider your diet  lots of garlic or onion? It can affect smell. Dehydrated? Also can affect it. Drink lots of water. I use RePHresh gel approved by my doc after my period or if things just feel off. If its two or more days I use a boric acid insert. It sounds crazy or harsh but perfectly harmless and you dont feel a thing. That tends to wipe out ANY smell. I also take femdopholous probiotics made for vaginal health and bromelain supplements pineapple extract since I dont eat much fruit.  You can also eat no sugar yogurt for probiotics.

11094321,0,t3_5yei0w,You should probably make another appointment with your gynecologist after staying on the higher dose for a couple of months. Im just a medical student so take my words with a grain of salt but breakthrough bleeding on the pill is fairly common and could just mean that you need to try another pill. Theyre right about lower doses of estrogen being more likely to cause breakthrough bleeding and sex can kinda knock loose endometrial lining thats already atrophic. Pain in ovaries could be an ovarian cyst though the likelihood of that happening should actually decrease on birth control pills. Did they do an ultrasound when you went in? I will say though that if youre getting migraines you should switch off of estrogen containing birth control if youre also having aura with those migraines. Look around online for the symptoms of aura usually visual disturbances though sometimes can be olfactory or sensory. We tell all patients with migraine with aura that contraception with estrogen is absolutely contraindicated because of an increased risk of stroke.  ,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,depj54o,6,t5_2vfzu

11252129,0,t3_60klij,I would suggest limiting your exposure as much as you possibly can even if you might still have to see them regularly. ...and if at all possible go no contact. No contact was the only thing that helped me after getting abruptly and callously dumped by my exboyfriend. In fact I marked the days I hadnt spoken to him on the calendar as motivation. Good luck OP! Im sending you positive vibes!,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,df7eujh,5,t5_2vfzu
11252640,0,t1_df71q2s,Hmm thats a good question. For me warning sign are small invalidations of my opinion. Like if we order food and I start to eat ketchup with fries and he says Im stupid for eating fries with ketchup and not mayo thats a warning sign. A respectful guy might say oh have you tried fries with mayo? I think you might like it. The way people disagree with you is also really indicative of whether they respect you. If they treat you badly when they think you are wrong they dont respect you as a person. Its okay to disagree but it shouldnt really become personal. How they talk about you is another thing to look out for. Do they only compliment your looks? Do they ever talk about you as a person? How do they describe you to other people? Respecting your relationship status is about the biggest one I can think of. I dont waste my time with guys who are wishy washy and not sure what they want. If he was into you hed know. If he wasnt into you he should respect you enough to tell you and not string you along. I find it difficult to say exactly where to draw the line because as you said playful banter is a fun and normal part of a relationship. I think part of is it trail and error and seeing how people react to those trials and errors. Like for example if teasing goes too far and youre hurt a guy telling you to brush it off does NOT respect your feelings. ,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,df7gxm4,3,t5_2vfzu

But be patient. You will find the solution.As a temporary remedy you could visit a hairdresser and ask what cuts would add the look of volume or fullness...

Security will shuffle you around if youre in middle of the walkway which is terrible if your feet hurt! I wasnt very bright and went with  inch wedges and they werent very comfortable after about  hours.If youre getting in touch with promoters for the parties thats the way to go! Vegas is made for girls so youll always get in on a guest list for free as long as you get in touch with a promoter first. There are usually time restrictions for guest lists though so sometimes it may not work for your timing schedule. Also for pool parties bring a waterproof lanyard case for your phone if you have one. You can put cash inside it and keep your phone protected. Some places will not let you retrieve your items from their storage room once left with them. Youll have fun though! Lots of different people there and youll meet lots of nice ones.

11560091,0,t1_dg65ljn,Its honestly such a ridiculous thing that could easily be fixed by teaching young men to respect women instead of seeing them as meat. As a woman I cant help but have boobs I didnt ask for them and I shouldnt be punished their existence. And the women in my family were also equally to blame. My mother would yell at me if I was wearing a vest top in front of my brothers  my brothers for fuck sake I mean come on to instill in a young woman that all men even those related to her cant control themselves if they see flesh is so beyond what I can comprehend. Im still working out my issues about this too and it sucks because I feel like Im kind of in my prime now in my mid s but I cant wear certain things because of the way Ill be perceived. Thanks for sharing too and I think that you should totally rock a bikini at the beach this summer  Maybe if you feel too uncomfortable you could just get one of those sheer sort of beach dresses? So its not like youre totally covering up and youve still got your bikini on and then if you get more comfy you can take it off.And yeah it is creepy at first Id get shy and redfaced about it now Im better at telling people to leave me alone ha I would love to just be like eww youre gross Im like  years old you creep!!
