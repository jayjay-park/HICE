10055152,0,t3_5jlqfq,I own one of these so lets get personal.  Its a six cylinder that gets the same mileage as the v with none of the power or manly noises.   Its a two wheel drive with an open diff time to buy some sand bags and studded tires so you can say you tried when you spin off into a snowy ditch.It has literally no options no chrome no alloy wheels no bucket seats not even an automatic transmission. The AC is dead. The headlight knob comes off in your hand when you pull it. The shift knob spins around as you use it and the shift pattern is never right side up. It has two gas tanks one leaks one has a dead fuel gauge float and one has a dead fuel pump.  Neither tank can be topped off all the way because the filler necks are cracked and gas will spill onto the ground if you do.Theres a solid chance the tank selector switch is broken.  The seals for the sliding glass back window are shot and you hear constant whistling on the highway while enjoying a freezing draft on the back of your neck. The turn single switch died and the Chinese replacement sounds like flicking a half empty soda can. The headlights are dim as fuck and high beams do nothing. You could be pulled over for a different bulb out every day. The slight smell of hot coolant is ever present.The temp gauge swings wildly between the N and L in the word Normal behind the gauge needle.  You wish it would overheat but that fucking  Autozone thermostat always saves the fucking day. But the heat never works consistently anyway.......The steering box is a suggestion box and the lines on the road are meant for crossing.  You hope to god that  year old airbag never goes off.But you dont trust those  year old rear drum brakes to do a damn thing to save you from it. It hasnt had brand name tires on it in  years.You use walmart brand conventional oil and dont give a fuck.Youre afraid a car wash will expose new patches of rust.The tailgate latch sticks like a bitch. The glove box latch rattles like a bitch.The sliding window latch broke and rattles like a bitch.The triangle window latches work fucking perfectly and you wish any new car or truck came with these little vent windows because they are the only redeeming feature of this trucks interior primarily because the ac is broken and they point directly at your nuts.The rear bumper sits crooked. The bed sits crooked.The frame is crooked. I have to stop but you know I could go on...,RoastMyCar,dbi7lkr,8,t5_3bsmw
