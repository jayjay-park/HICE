2342,0,t1_ceep7wf,ok im starting to get confused. when applying eyeshadow to my outer cornercrease ive always assumes the eyeshadow goes right ON the outer corner meaning it covers part of the eyelid and right ON the crease meaning some of it might go on the eyelid. but thats clearly not whats going on here....should i be applying eyeshadow as far outside as this chick is doing?  i have almondshaped eyes that are evenly set...in case that helps.

Anyway you might check out the recent IntoTheGloss interview with MUA Tom Pecheux who doesnt wear makeup himself which I found interesting and you might too. Otherwise I would say in terms of actually gaining experience with gaining makeup the best way would be to practice most likely on yourself unless you have a willing model at all times. The sidebar should be able to help out theres a beginning makeup guide and I love Lisa Eldridge for her video tutorials.

It makes it harder to see whats going on!First tip is that putting eyeliner in your bottom waterline like that will make your eyes appear smaller. Some people like to put white or nude liners instead Im not a fan of the look but it might work well for you in a pageant situation. Next blush will really really do a lot to warm your face up and give it structure. Hard Candy Milani and WetnWild all do good drugstore blushes. For the first two check out their baked blushes specifically Ive had great luck with them. A lot of people like elfs eyebrow kit I think its around . Worth trying maybe! And I agree with urockette on this one  try a lighter eyeshadow colour! They grey looks a little harsh especially with the eyeliner. Good luck!!,MakeupAddiction,ceglxnr,2,t5_2rww2

53554,0,t3_1uogag,Wow what a bitch. Im sorry she said that to you. Id never treat a client that way. I use erase paste and happen to like it but there was a little truth to her statement you can only do so much with makeup in that maybe you should look into a skincare regime geared towards treating your under eye area. There are tons of products at Sephora that are made by Philosophy Shiseido PTR Ole Henriksen etc. that are specifically for treating circles puffiness dryness....theres tons. Maybe go to a different Sephora and explain youre looking for a skincare routine for your under eyes. I dont have many problems with that area of my face personally other than some puffiness and darkness but I suffer from acne and dry skin so there really was only so much I could do with makeup but it still looked weird. I got one of the clarisonic Mia  things and I love it. My skin feels and looks so much better so my makeup does too.Id see what a nicer SA says and ask for samples of different things to try.

80215,0,t1_ceniggz,Definitely. I also think a lot has to do with finding the right formula for your skin. Its sort of like mascara. Sometimes the formula is more wet or dry and every different shade of oily imaginable.

Check the ingredient label for words ending in cone.After I apply my foundation and concealer I let it set for a minute before I pull part a kleenex tissue making it oneply and carefully press it where I have lines  around my eyes and mouth. Then I set with a powder puff and some translucent face powder using the press and roll method before using my powder brush to brush over the skin removing any excess powder. It sounds like a pain in the ass but it only adds a couple of minutes to my routine. I no longer have trouble with powders settling into my fine lines and I dont have to stop to powder andor blot as frequently throughout the day.There are tutorials on youtube if youre interested I will find one for you.,MakeupAddiction,cenn6ko,1,t5_2rww2

When Im at home I take all my pictures in the same exact spot behind my black out curtains to create a light box effect. Thats  of my pictures. This was done during the holiday season so I was traveling a good amount. This holiday season I went to  different states and  different cities on  planes and  long car rides. I went to my boyfriends parents house for new years so I had to take some pictures in the car a pretty good source of natural light for that  hour drive. Then I flew to my boyfriends in another state and took pictures as best I could in front if his sliding glass door which I think turned out pretty well because the snow diffused the light.

98881,0,t3_1ugvyx,You are a genius. I had the LM palette for Christmas and apart from a deep shimmersmokey look I did on NYE Ive been pondering a good matt look. Never really used mattes before which is one of the reasons I bought the LM. Ive just watched your tutorial and am going to try this so thank you!I also watched your  favourites video and am curious about Naked Basics. Are they allmainly mattes? I may have to purchase. Your eyes looked amazing in that btw. Loving the new camera too!My Reddit hero...,MakeupAddiction,ceporkw,1,t5_2rww2
98938,0,t3_1v8avx,Okay so I may not be the most qualified person to give you advice but I feel like I know at least some what with how much time I spend watching beauty gurus and reading blogs and lusting after highend products. I would recommend playing up your eyes theyre gorgeous. But really what you play up tends to lean toward what you like best. If you like your lips experiment with fun shades. Want to try something bold? Start searching for your perfect red lip. I recommend checking out Milani Best Red  I have similar coloring to you and I love it. With a warm skin typeyellow undertones I would suggest staying away from pinktoned reds. True reds look better in my experience.If you prefer to play up your eyes I would recommend working on getting a smoky eye down. Thats my goto eye look and you can do it with really any color family. Its a good idea to find a solid neutralsnudes palette I love my Sonia Kashuk Eye Couture Eye on Neutrals palette which is relatively cheap for how many shadows you get and for the quality and its at Target. Wet n Wild is another good cheaper but still good brand that has some quality colored shadows if you want to branch out from the neutrals. Basically I would suggest  things . Research  find beauty guru blogs and youtube channels my favorites are temptalia.com and vintageortacky and xsparkage on youtube.. When you want to play something up make sure you arent playing something else up too. Like if you do red lips do more subtle eyes or if you do a darker smoky eye go natural on the lips.. Since youre just starting dont splurge on spendy highend products that you dont know much aboutdont absolutely love. Find reliable drugstore brands I like Milani Wet n Wild NYX Sonia Kashuk which is a little more expensive and branch out from those. I dont have much expertise in the face product area so Ill let someone else talk about those but I hope that helped a bit.,MakeupAddiction,cepp02b,1,t5_2rww2

112133,0,t3_1vdm0q,Personally Id skip the black liner on the waterline.It sounds like you want something relatively lowmaintenance but that can still give you a nice look. I recommend a tinted moisturizer dont cover up those freckles theyre darling! mascara and a tinted easy to wear lip product. Maybe something like the Revlon lip butters or Maybelline Color Whispers. Overall I think you need a bit of color and no more black on the lower lashes.If you want to experiment even more try filling in your brows. You have some pretty naturally full brows and a decent arch going. A little powder or a brow pencil will give you some definition there. It will definitely make a difference in your overall appearance!,MakeupAddiction,cer76ax,7,t5_2rww2

Thats the beauty of makeup. And pencils can help you make it look like hairs more than powder just fills in the space that you already have brows. Your skin is so beautiful!

There are great tutorials for those with hooded eyes on here and on rBeautyDiagrams.Basically your eyeliner wing should follow the natural extension of your lower lashline and your eyelashes curve.

142467,0,t1_ceun0ks,Yeah if you really thought  was a budget you could stick to I think theres some major disconnect going on. I know spending can get away from you and Ive certainly been surprised at how much I spent once I looked at it all added up but the difference between your set limit and your spending is staggering.  extra worth of makeup just doesnt slip by unnoticed and I say this as someone who spends way past the point of VIB Rouge. I use the excel sheet method I keep a list of things Im interested in  once theyve been on the sheet for a week and Ive researched sufficiently then I feel okay about buying them. Items often dont make it past this point or languish for awhile once the pressing need passes. I also keep a list of purchased items so I keep track of what Ive spent. However Ive been looking into setting a budget and I decided now that the Christmas rush is over to just monitor my spending first for a few months. Then once I get an idea of what a normal month looks like for me I can set a realistic budget. I honestly dont think youll be able to just stick to a  budget right away given what happened this month  if you really only want to spend that much you might do better cutting down a little less drastically.,MakeupAddiction,ceuno8i,2,t5_2rww2

144638,0,t1_ceuwgb4,No problem anything to help out a fellow make up lover. You could do that but I would suggest using a cream style instead. Those foundations that come in a cream form like a stick foundation are great for contouring  just use a shade a few darker than yours or however dark you want depending on how deep you want the contour! To highlight I just use a stick concealer that is lighter than my skin down. I find it gives me better control because it is in smaller packaging might I recommend CovergirlOlay stick concealer. Beauty blenders are great for that kind of thing but not necessary. For under your eyes and those kind of places the warmth of your finger should do just fine in warming up the product and allowing it to blend. The CovergirlOlay is extremely creamy and blends well. As for the contouring a small stipple brush would would just fine like the ELF one I mentioned. Its small enough to allow you to control the product. NYX is a great brand!

151180,0,t3_1vskwq,You look very pale and also maybe neutral toned. I also am so pale that I find it hard to get foundation matches which confuses me because I certainly know paler people. Test foundation at your jawline not terribly far from your ear to see if it blends in properly. If you want to stick to standard foundations youll need to go high end. Tarte Nars Shiseido and CoverFX all come to mind as having a good selection of pale shades. Otherwise you can look at Graftobian you can get samples from Camera Ready Cosmetics. Bombshell and the colors near it might be good to try? Also Meow Cosmetics has a mineral foundation that definitely has your shade. Once you have a good foundation realize that itll make you look very different because youre accustomed to having more color. So be sure to use blush and adding a bit of bronzer NYC Sunny as contour helps because then you avoid having large expanses of super light skin when you have no such thing without makeup. I always have to contour my nose a bit because taking the redness away makes it stand out tremendously and makes me look a bit too different from usual. ,MakeupAddiction,cevnfk7,2,t5_2rww2

Usually I just put some hand soap on it rub it in and soak it and squeeze it out several times until no more soap foam comes out of it.,MakeupAddiction,cew9078,5,t5_2rww2

165109,0,t1_cex2kl1,I use Dr. Jart BB cream the black one and a translucent setting powder from Neutrogena comparable to Urban Decay DeSlick setting powder but at a budget price point. So there are powder foundations like Bare Minerals etc etc and then there are tinted setting powders they can also be called finishing powders to kind of complete the look like a last step or for touchups.Not all brands make tinted setting powders some come in one shade that is supposedly translucent and will match any skintone hit or miss imo. Additionally confusing there are some doitall products like MUFEs ProFinish MultiUse Powder Foundation. In summary there are a hell of a lot of different types of powders out there. I encourage you to get samples of a few different types both tinted and universal shades from a couple of different brands and see if they help at all. Sorry if that was a bit of a confusing explanation but hopefully a few things could be cleared up.,MakeupAddiction,cex8lhd,2,t5_2rww2

180410,0,t3_1w4pj1,I LOVE your red hair and freckles! Its so gorgeous. Here are my suggestions Agree with a light coverage foundation to flaunt those freckles. Blend those eyeshadows out gurrl. Blend blend blend. You could probably get away with a shimmery nude or very light pinky color as an eyeshadow. I find that lash stiletto is extremely wet. Im not a fan. To separate your lashes go through with a lash comb and apply this mascara sparingly. Or you can try a thicker brush and thicker formula like benefit bad gal or covergirl lashblast. I personally am really loving Too Faced BTS. I would recommend a light pinky peach sheer lip color. Perhaps the color whispers or lip butter. Id go for a super subtle glow with a light contour as well. Overall it is really good and your eyebrows look good too!,MakeupAddiction,ceyzgnb,1,t5_2rww2

190749,0,t1_cf05lyw,I guess my problem is that there is a difference between being selfindulgent and working through problems. Ive struggled with depression for about  years now and obviously Ive had people tell me to just be happy and Ive been pretty fucking pissed. However my therapist would never say just keep wallowing in your selfpity and sadness in fact my therapist has told me that it is possible to rewire the way you think focusing on the good and accepting confronting and overcoming the bad can be done. Depression is not a death sentence to be unhappy for the rest of your life and its that type of thinking that made me suicidal in the past there is hope and it can be different and you can be happy. For me negative thoughts and insecurity go hand in hand and are a selfperpetuating cycle that just feed into themselves. I think what this girl is going through is similar. Yes she is allowed to be unhappy to struggle in this tension but she cant just give up and say shes never going to be happy or secure or satisfied because that takes away hope. Im not saying just suck it up because these things take time and energy and hurt and work but its a process and a journey and this isnt the end. From her descriptions at the being of her post it really seems like her SO was trying to be encouraging and saying that although you think you dont look your best without makeup I accept you and think you are beautiful even when you dont think you look your best. Unless I totally misgauged that it seems as if he was trying to be supportive it doesnt sound like he was making fun of her. A quote I find applicable Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity. It truly seemed like her SO knew what her insecurities were and was trying to support her and encourage her perhaps he didnt do that perfectly but it was not out of malice. ,MakeupAddiction,cf05zn2,3,t5_2rww2

192613,0,t3_1wb9o8,I would highly suggest trying out a green concealer! The green should do a fairly good job at toning down the red. If youve got a CVS pharmacy near you try to snag Physicians Formula green stick concealer. It was on sale for a dollar and change yesterday when I picked it up! After priming dab some green concealer on your trouble spots and blend it in until the red is significantly reduced. Then dab the spot with your usual concealer. Cover it all up with foundation and see how that works out for you.,MakeupAddiction,cf0dn8q,5,t5_2rww2

193213,0,t1_cf0bm0d,Woop Woop workin it! P to answer your questions no stencil involved just an angled brush steady hand and practice. Im never very happy with my brows. Ive never had them some professionally so Im sure they need a bit of cleaning up. Blending is just about a light hand and patience. Sometimes I have neither and in not really one for the natural look so my blending can turn what was meant to be a daytime look into a much darker affair. All I can say is get a couple of nice fluffy brushes for blending and gradually add darker shades is very easy to clump a load of black eyeshadow on by accident!

205700,0,t1_cf1kkb6,I havent tried Coastal Scents but was just looking at their site and I really like that you can build your own palettes  I might have to do that. Ive been spending a bit too much on high end brands lately sometimes just to try out new shades so it would probably be a good idea to make my own combination of colors to play with before buying for example the NARSissist eye palette that I probably dont need but I really really want. Money wasted on makeup... never. If the product doesnt work for you then theres always makeup exchange or makeup alley. Ive traded away a lot of stuff and gotten really great products that I would have purchased anyway so theres that. I am a messy fool with liquid eyeliner. UD pencils and using eyeshadow as eyeliner works great for me though I think its a matter of stead handedness because the liquid ones seem to get away from me pretty quickly and not clean up as easily vs pencil or brush application. Im really into white eyeliner right now and then doing three shades of pink from Naked upward from the lash line. All of this week Ive been using UD Zephyr as a liner  its a little bit more sparkly than a regular white liner pencil and it fades smooth like butter if you get to it before the mixedwater dries fully.

La RochePosay have a great product called Rosaliac which is the same thing essentially but more moisturising.I actually have more or less the same skin as you and I found the thing that works best for me is airbrush makeup I use Dinair but if airbrushing is too much for you definitely look into the Dior option havent tried it myself though. Or powder foundation  I really love MACs Studio Fix compact. Really easy to carry around with you for touch ups. Powder wont illuminate pores as much as a liquid or cream foundation will.You could also try a setting spray if you want to make your makeup last longer!,MakeupAddiction,cf3zl2f,1,t5_2rww2

She deleted the post so where it used to say her username now it shows as deleted. I dont remember what it was unfortunately. Whats sad is that shes probably reading all of this now. Still new to this website but Ive seen at least one post like this one ever now and then. How do you even know who the moderators are? Sorry if thats a stupid question.

305451,0,t3_1xlirr,Haha a lot of people are asking for under eye circle help today.  Kinda funny...I use Benefits Erase Paste  I bought it in November and use it every day quite often twice a day since I wear makeup to work then come home and take a shower and put makeup on again and I feel like Ive hardly made a dent in it.  A little bit goes a long way.  I also have Tarte Maracuja Creaseless Concealer  I dont like it as much as the Erase Paste though I dont know if I could put a finger on exactly why.  I used it the other day and it worked just as well as the Erase Paste so I dunno.  I guess I just prefer the little pot the Erase Paste comes in over the tube the Tarte concealer comes in.  Anyways both work really well imo but I would definitely suggest asking for samples before you buy them.If youre looking for drugstore brands I cant help you there.  None of the drugstore brands Ive bought have ever worked nearly as well as Erase Paste and Tartes concealer so I dont want to recommend those nor do I have them anymore so I couldnt give you an exact name anyways!.,MakeupAddiction,cfcfe1o,1,t5_2rww2

Even without primer. My only gripe is that its a hair pink at first.Ive also tried Laura Mercier foundation but I forget the exact linecolor i think its moisture supreme?.

Southgate and Kingsway though I always have to ask for samples and they seem to limit me to one thing per visit. Like... fuck guys you see this red shiny card? It means I spend a considerable amount of my disposable income here because makeup is my hobby and if I try a product from a sample and like it Ill probably buy it. I think that theres been a bit of a downturn in quality between store cast members and also the online support staff lately. Super frustrating.

401353,0,t3_1ynghk,Ive never understood the question.  If youre comfortable spending the money on midhigh end makeup and you like what youre purchasing what isnt worth it? That you could get a similar product for less? Personally I dont buy much into the designer brand makeup ie Chanel I dont feel like theres a lot I enjoy from the lines available to me.  Theres noticeable differences in quality everywhere. Even within the same price bracket. Every product will have its own advantages and disadvantages every brand its strengths and weaknesses. The main difference is ingredients and sometimes even thats a very thin line.  Its what youre comfortable paying for and what products make you go I want that. On my face.  So if its a hobby or something you want to get into with whatever term you wanna call it I guess then buy your basics at whatever price range you have set out for yourself and budget for improvements or upgrades or must haves to add in to your collection as you see fit. ,MakeupAddiction,cfmd6pa,0,t5_2rww2

406587,0,t1_cfmwa84,Im not sure what other people do but I like my face products to be the same color as my face but more even. However people who have a lot of redness are probably looking to have a foundation that cancels out the redness and makes their face closer in color to their neck chest or whatever area they want to match it to. I would say if your foundation looks orange on you it probably isnt what youre looking for. In general it seems like if a foundation is too cool toned it will look grey against your skin and if a foundation is too warm it will look orange. It sounds like your foundation is probably too warm toned for you.

408081,0,t3_1yr4cg,this has like half of the things you need right here if you want to go with ELF also depending on whats around you you might find some good deals on makeup at a discount store like christmas tree shop ocean state job lot big lots etc. Coupled with coupons it can make your venture much cheaper to start out with. and a lot of drugstore brands are pretty good quality nowadays and with rewards programs they can have some pretty good deals. I just got a NYX haul from cvs cut down from  to  just because I had extrabucks and coupons. If you research it enough you learn what you do and dont like about specific things you want out of your makeup like price wear finish etc. No you do not have to use the same brand for everything because thats just a marketing ploy lol. Personally I have a few brands I like for specific products. For example I love NYX lip products and their jumbo eye pencils Maybellines color tattoo eyeshadows Physicians formula eyeliner....,MakeupAddiction,cfn2bo9,2,t5_2rww2
408091,0,t3_1yr4cg,Alright lets get started!To begin with you most definitely dont need to stick to one brand to have all your makeup look good. Different brands have different strengths mixing and matching can get you better results than blind brand loyalty sometimes.As far as your brows go you may be plucking them already but plucking and shaping are different. If youre just cleaning up stray hairs thats a great start but does little to give them a good shape if youre not naturally blessed with one and lets face it almost none of us are. You can also achieve a shape by filling them in it doesnt have to be all about the tweezers. Do you see how your one brow goes somewhat straight across and the other has a tiny bit of an arch to it? I would try to match the arch maybe exaggerate it a little more by plucking the lower line of the straight brow about two thirds of the way across and then filling in the top line a little bit higher than it naturally goes. Im explaining this horribly but there are a lot of tutorials available online that will probably do a much better job. Brows go a long way to shape your entire face. And dont get frustrated if you cant get them to match perfectly eyebrows are sisters not twins.You say makeup makes it look like you have a black eye. One way to combat this is to use color correcting concealers. Remember learning about the color wheel in art class? Opposite colors cancel each other out. Put a green concealer over zits to combat redness and an orangey yellow over dark circles or black eyes to cancel out the blue tones. Then you can apply skintoned concealer on top to have much more effective coverage.Lets talk budget! If you need to keep things under a certain dollar amount but still create a full makeup collection palettes are the way to go. As far as eyeshadow goes youre still experimenting so I wouldnt invest in anything too expensive or high end right now because you dont know what youll like! But that doesnt mean you cant have a great collection. Check out something like this Fifty shadow colors ten lip colors and five blushes all for thirty bucks. Kits like this are how I learned to use makeup. Brushes are also cheaper to buy in sets and you dont have to go super expensive yet youre just looking to learn how to use them.Skin. This is my weak area since Im still trying to figure out the concealerfoundationprimer routine that works for me. What I can say is never buy something you havent see andor tried in person. Its a bitch to match skin color sometimes and the saddest feeling in the world is trying on a new product only to realize its too light and you look dead or its too dark and you look like youre a Jersey Shore character. If I were you I would go to a store and ask them to match you. That way youll know your shade and can go ahead and look for cheaper duplicates. Side note are you sure you need hypoallergenic makeup? If youve only had a reaction once when you were twelve its possible that a your skin sensitivity has changed b it was just that brand you had an issue with or c you were using old samples. You can always go to Sephora or similar and do patch tests with their samples on your inner elbow to see if you have a reaction.Lastly practice practice practice! We all started in the same place. Dont be afraid to spend an hour every night trying out crazy lip colors tackling winged liner copying looks off of YouTube tutorials filling in your brows crazy dark just for fun figuring out how to contour without looking orange... The list goes on. Never ever get discouraged if a look doesnt turn out the way you wanted it to. Youre learning and so is every single person here. The best makeup artists will wind up with horrible winged eyeliner some days. Thats just the art of makeup. We dont mess up we make happy little mistakes and from them we learn more. Just have fun with it! Good luck and while Im no expert I love to talk makeup and would be happy to chat more if you ever want to PM me!,MakeupAddiction,cfn2d0p,7,t5_2rww2

I might not rebuy one of the palettes I had because I actually only used it to do my eyebrows Too Faced Matte palette used Chinchilla and Coffee Bean I think are the colors. Might just pick up a Brow Envy set instead. But the main bummer is I had aaaaaallll of my brushes in there facepalm One of them was a  dollar blush brush seriously felt like a kitten T.T  And whereas you had higher end stuff That so super sucks that you lost that Chanel color hopefully they bring it back out for a special event or something so you can grab it again I have midendLowend stuff again like Benefit and NYX so it wont be as expensive to replace the items I use.

462571,0,t1_cfsu4mm,Look at this point its not so much that this got posted but rather how the response has been handled.If you make a mistake and hurt someone unintentionally the best option is to say Im sorry this offended you I didnt mean to. and not Relax chill or Its a joke.. And looking through the comments...well its basically full of its a joke stupid.. and Relax chill.People arent that dumb  they get that its supposed to be a joke because its a meme or whatever with a picture and they know how to read in context. They already realize this wasnt intended to be mean in any way but have chosen to voice their thoughts and let you know that they think its hurtful. People actually are understanding of you. Like I said they clearly get that its supposed to be a joke. Nobody is trying to make a personal attack against you or your character but rather the message alone. Were saying the message is bad in a number of ways  and I dont see why you insist on preferring to be left alone with your opinion and not try to understand perspective beyond being called ugly.I tried to make sure to let you know that I was not attacking you by letting you know that your comments and posts are valuable because they are. Laughter is important  but not at someone elses expense. You are not stupid nor a mean person. None of this is and certainly shouldnt be about you. Its about the message.Its OK to make mistakes like an offensive post but if your response to people is nothing but defensive then I dont know what youre trying to get out of it. And Im not saying its just you  its a lot of people in here who keep making snide remarks towards people who are just trying to tell others that this hurts them. Like one user where the dialogue is basically to meMe I dont like this postThem Well your sense of humor is shitty sorry about that.THAT is a personal attack and a completely snide and unjustified one which I think is really gross. ,MakeupAddiction,cfsufuk,7,t5_2rww2

506711,0,t1_cfxux4e,There are a couple of things you can do to avoid it. First practice practice practice. Mascara takes a lot of getting used to. Second if youre having trouble with them going different directions try combing them out first. You can get an eyelash comb like this one  to help keep them in line. Third dont lay it on too thick! Even the lightest mascara will clump up if you put on too much. Lastly a lot of it has to do with the formula of the mascara. Some mascaras will just clump up no matter how well you apply it. A lot of people really like covergirls clump crusher formula. Its a good cheap go to that will help you get rid of clumps. I hope that helps!,MakeupAddiction,cfxv6kp,15,t5_2rww2

544275,0,t3_20d662,I have certain brushes for certain uses like two angled liner brushes one for dark liner and one for lightbrow bone highlights. I have white tape on the light one to distinguish them.I have one push brush dedicated to darkblack for eyelining.My blending brush is separate altogether and is never used in eyeshadow.I have one brush I use exclusively for my eye crease. While I may use different colors they are all basically darkish so that works for me.For blushcontouring I have a blush brush a light contour brush and a dark contour brush.And so on.It sounds unbelievably complicated but it is not. After you get a set of brushes you sort of naturally use the same one for the same thing over and over and over I just found a way to distinguish and remember what I use for what.I do tend to do almost the same makeup every day I may range from a dusky purple to a darkish nude. The only real difference is in intensity whether it is a day look or something for an event.Of course this wont work for those of you that like to play in all different colors. Im old and know what works best and dont experiment all that much anymore.I do always have a fairly rough towel lying there if I need to wipe excess stuff off of a brush. ,MakeupAddiction,cg252nd,2,t5_2rww2

563492,0,t3_20ks5v,I dont know if its the robe making the contour seem pinkish or if youve blended your blush into it but your skintone seems to lean yellow so all I really have to add is try to find a contouring shade that has a yellow tone to it. As a fellowyellow Lancome has a shade of their Star Bronzer called Sunkiss thats very nice and light and I know the Wet n Wild bronzers are yellow toned. Ticket to Brazil is very nice and very inexpensive at three dollars. However even that is just nitpicking. Im super envious at the fact that you can use Nooner for your eyebrows. Its such a lovely color and all I want in life is to use it for is my eyebrows but my hair is far too dark. Also congrats on the weight loss. Doesnt it feel great?

583175,0,t1_cg6c77l,I appreciate you sharing your perspective. For me while I do view makeup as something of an art and treat my face like a canvas throughout the day I dont get to actually see my makeup. Im able to catch glimpses of course but for the most part makeup affects how I feel. Other people do get to view my makeup but to me thats less the point I understand that for a lot of people who do use makeup for utilitarian purposes thats the entire point but were at rmakeupaddiction and I think its entirely possible that a good amount of us here do makeup more for fun than any other reason Further and Im definitely not trying to attack you here its just easier to respond to specific quotes but that always seems a bit like attacking sorry!  gt Who is to say your feelings are valid?Getting into the business of validating feelings is rather difficult. In most situations feelings probably arent valid but theyre just there. You wouldnt fault someone for being sympathetic to someone with a disability right? You yourself might even fall into that category. But where exactly does that sympathy get you? Unless it compels you to action its just a feeling yet its perfectly valid. Just the fact that someone has those feelings in my opinion makes them valid. I could possibly be missing the point here though because Im not entirely sure what would make feelings invalid. gt We are pleasure driven animals but at some point one has to wonder if it is healthy to enable every impulse. It is not polite to criticise others spending habits but are we encouraging blatant consumerism?Everyone has a different budget and for some people purchasing luxury brands wouldnt make a dent in their disposable income. I do hope that everyone would spend within their means and I would encourage everyone to do so. If someone derives pleasures from purchasing fancy packaging and isnt getting into debt I dont see how that isnt healthy. gt My background on the topic is mostly being a broke student that does art as a hobby.Im a broke student and filmmaking is a hobby of mine. I think there are some similarities to our situation and I personally cant afford buying makeup solely for expensive packaging. However I dont think that just because I cant afford something should preclude someone else from making a choice that would make them happy. It seemed like you were genuinely confused by my train of thought so I hope this helped. If these were entirely rhetorical questions I apologize for my rather longwinded explanation. ,MakeupAddiction,cg6k7rm,3,t5_2rww2

If you pick a foundation that matches your face and not your neck itll create a terrible masklike effect.

624322,0,t3_21a7jn,Benefit Erase Paste. It covers everything really well without settling into lines or looking too heavy. It also has a melon hue to it which helps to counterbalance the darkness. Plus you can use it as a general concealer so you dont have to have an undereye concealer and face concealer.  And the jar lasts forever! Another suggestion I have is a good brightening eye cream. I personally love Benefit Its Potent Eye Cream. It moisturizes helping your makeup set better decreases darkness both immediately and over time so that the circles go away even without makeup and helps to simultaneously reduce puffiness and smooth any sunken areas. I love the stuff! I use it and concealer and actually get compliments on how bright my eyes are! Oh one last thing make sure when you apply it you apply it in a Y shape. Draw a line from each corner inward and then pull it down and blend out. That way you dont have a defined line at the bottom of your eye socket where your concealer ends because that can make everything look more pronounced. Hope this helps!,MakeupAddiction,cgb8ijn,2,t5_2rww2

Japan since the feudal era  so what appears to be independently developed aesthetics... is really not so much.In short I really dont need a fucking reason to criticize beauty standards that are harmful and devaluing of others namely people of color. Im being culture and race specific because thats  the topic of the conversation. Not blaming AsianAsian Americans or anyone elseI dont blame people for internalizing these standards. In fact as I said western hegemony is the culprit of a lot of this. And thats the end of this conversation because Im tired of having  to defend a topic and you google or see on the news every day.

730476,0,t1_cgnaeg4,Me too! So pretty.Overall I think the quality was great though it can vary a little from palette to palette. Bad Girl is super pigmented and blends incredibly I find the quality on par with my Urban Decay eyeshadows. I find it interesting that the matte black in Bad Girl is waaaay better than the matte black in the Ultra Mattes palette. With the matte shades in general I find theyre not as easy to work with as the satinsshimmers etc. but I find that with matte shadows everywhere. The darker matte shades are excellent but a few of the lighter ones are a little chalky and dont show up as well. That said I expected the neon mattes in acid to be chalky and hard to work with but was pleasantly surprised... and they are insanely bright too.,MakeupAddiction,cgnb4ty,2,t5_2rww2

764194,0,t1_cgr3lar,Posted this to someone else a few weeks ago. Very pale neutral skin green eyes and dark warm vivid red hairI typically wear pink purple and neutral eyeshadow which is mainly personal preference but very flattering with my skin and eyes.I look best in coral and pinky lipsticks. Im not sure what undertones these reds have but for example I look much better in MAC russian red than ruby woo. KVD liquid lipstick in outlaw is also a great red tone. Too faced melted lipstick in violet looks amazing with my hair color. I typically wear coral and pink blush too. My hair looks much more natural when I match my eyebrows. My favorite brow powder is from European wax center so Im not sure if thats accessible for you. I use the lighter shade in their Milan brow powder duo. The darker shade of NYX cake powder in auburn is also good. Anastasia dipbrow in auburn is too cool for my hair.,MakeupAddiction,cgr57rh,1,t5_2rww2

769125,0,t1_cgrevwx,Anything can be a single color eyeshadow look if you take a single eyeshadow and apply it to the eye area! Experiment! Go play! Break all the rules! I almost never do two shadow looks because I have hooded lids small eyes and no patience at all. Just none. If youre open to indies Fyrinnae makes a shade called Serendipity that has a beautiful but workappropriate duochrome effect taupe with a coppery shift. You need to wear it with their pixie epoxy for the full effect. People have been having some trouble ordering from them lately so you have to decide whether youre willing to deal with that drama but their products are great if you can manage to actually place an order. Its usually the only eyeshadow I take with me when I travel and the only eyeshadow I can ever see myself possibly using up and repurchasing if that gives you some idea of how good it is. Something thats roughly your skin tone but sparkly is also really good for simple onecolor eye looks. The new nude Maybelline color tattoos are great for that if you can find one theyre LE or the one skin shade from their permanent range if youre very fair. Something like UD Sin could also work if you have a similar complexion to mine. Sometimes when I am feeling sooooo lazy Ill just apply a taupe shade to the outside half of my eyelid and blend it really really well. I wouldnt wear it to a special event or anything but for everyday nomakeup makeup it works alright. ,MakeupAddiction,cgrpd4n,2,t5_2rww2

774073,0,t1_cgruplp,Okay so basically I used an angled brush that I use on my brows its an ecotools one and I got it wet and covered my lips with Nooner from the Naked  palette. I just over drew them slightly at first mostly on the top. Then I put on the lipstick and blotted it. I think a key thing to making your lips look larger is a matte lipstick otherwise you will have a natural shine where your real lip ends making it look clownish. So then I took some Factory amp Nooner and put them on like the corners of the lips amp blended up into my upper lip and down into my lower lip. Just to add some shading and make them look more full. Then I used Strange and got some on my finger and put it in the middle of my lower lip and right on my cupids bow. The hardest part of that is not habitually rubbing your lips together... I think I had to redo it like  times because of that. Then just pout and boom youre Angelina!,MakeupAddiction,cgs9ls1,2,t5_2rww2

Always start at your ear and then go towards your lips. I dont recommend using the fish face method just try to get it on the lower part of your cheek bone instead of under your cheekbone.

787245,0,t3_234jr8,It really bothers me that Sephora has this reputation. I worked for the company for a few years and know a ton of girls who still do at different stores. In general the only people who judge are the women who come in and judge the employees by thinking theyre being judged...if that makes sense lol. I cant tell you how many times I had girls apologize to me for looking bad or coming in with no makeup on or apologizing for asking stupid questions. Its ok...Im the one who went to school for makeup and was professionally trained and spent years amp thousands of dollars learning this craft. I dont expect a teacher or a lawyer or a college student to know what I know about makeup. None of their questions are considered stupid because I most likely asked every single one of them at one point too! Actually thats not true...there are a few stupid questions. Where do you keep your permanent eyeliner? You mean liquid maam? No...permanent. You just apply it once and its permanent never washes off even with soap amp remover. I need to replace my tube. If its permanent...why are you replacing it?Thats what Sephora hires employees for though. To answer your questions and help you. I actually would PREFER if someone walked in without a drop of makeup on their face. I can see what you look like naturally and help you without having you take off your foundation or whatever were talking about. Just has always bothered me because the girls I worked with were the sweetest most helpful women amp girls ever amp yet people thought just because theyre in a shallow business theyre judging everyone. We even used to have women come in and try and insult us before they thought we were going to insult them...thats what it seemed like lol. ,MakeupAddiction,cgtri86,5,t5_2rww2

789034,0,t1_cgtve3j,I use BareMinerals Ready foundation the compact  its more full coverage I think than their loose powder but really only as much as you make it. I buff it on lightly with a kabuki brush since I dont wantneed heavy coverage myself. Currently I am using TooFaced Primed amp Poreless with it which I love and it works well with the powder. To combat my random dry spots after moisturizing my entire face I go back and lightly reapply in the problem spots and let that soak in before putting on primer. Powder vs. BB cream  that depends on what you want out of it! If youre looking to even out your color thats likely not going to happen with just BB cream.

She put a medium yellow based foundation on me that seriously made me look like a fucking Oompa Loompa and she thought it looked fine! No. No. No. No!! I made her take it off. I finally convinced her after  different yellow ones that I am not in any way yellow toned. I mean shit look at my collar bones! I am pale as shit and pink! I want my fucking face to match my neck! Another SA came over and was like are you sure you dont tan in the summer? Meaning my face being darker than my neck. My face is red because of acne scarring and hyperpigmentation not tanning. I do not tan at all! finally! after I convinced her to try a pink based foundation she found one. And then she says oh yeah you really are pink!

841773,0,t1_cgzygg0,Yes! When I had great skin but horrible dark circles from allergies I did this all the time. If your dark circles are moderate to severe like mine are you might find it helpful to use a peachy corrector to counteract the darkness like Benefits Erase Paste Laura Merciers concealers Pixi Skinfood also sell them. After applying corrector you may want to apply a concealer that matches your skin to tone down the peachiness. They key here though is to blend into your actual skin so it looks seamless.,MakeupAddiction,cgzynhc,2,t5_2rww2

845703,0,t3_23tels,I think that this piece is true to a certain degree. The culture we live in prioritizes a certain aesthetic and doesnt tolerate difference very well especially for women who do not conform to beauty standards. I dont think this should be confused with an argument that makeup is bad but rather that depending on fitting a certain mold in order to be treated fairly is ultimately detrimental to all women who compare themselves to unrealistic standards. I think there are plenty of women who wear badass makeup because they like it and it makes them feel confident not because they have such disdain for their natural face that they feel they MUST wear makeup in order to be seen in public. I think its important for women to understand that confidence is the important thing and that they should feel happy and whole in whatever form THEY prefer and not because they have to be airbrushed and perfect to matter. Gender discrimination on the job is a very real problem and women do get judged more often on their appearance. Thats wrong. But having a selfcare ritual or beauty routine isnt to blame its the cultural standard that women should be praised for being pretty instead of smart and capable or that ones selfworth should be based on appealing to the male gaze. ,MakeupAddiction,ch0es9p,6,t5_2rww2

855360,0,t1_ch15rlu,Lip Tars have a learning curve but theyre probably exactly what you want for long wear time and minimal transfer. . Make sure your lips are exfoliated and use some moisturizing balm. Remove excess balm if they feel over saturated just before applying Tar.. Use a lip primer andor lip liner. For a primer theres the clear OCC Lip Tar or there are lip primers from Mac and Nyx. I love the Mac one. There are also lots of clear universal lip pencils or colored ones. Line the edges of your lips to prevent feathering and bleeding and scrub the pencil down onto the lips as well. Gives your color something more to cling to or can help cancel your natural lip color a little if youre using a colored pencil.. Apply a pinprick amount of Tar with a brush everyone always uses too much at first. Scrub that shit into the lip youre laying down a base. Get close to the edges but dont worry about shape too much yet.. BLOT. Press your lips onto the top and bottom of a tissue and then press a clean area of the tissue onto the front of your mouth over closed lips to reach the cupids bow area and edges. This is important. Youll probably have a semi sheer layer of Tar down now.. Apply second layer again a very small amount. Get your color density where you want it shape your lips with the Tar itself on your brush or go back in with your colored lip pencil if you wanna get fussy and perfect.. LIGHTLY BLOT AGAIN. . Give it some time to set. Tars do set after they dry a bit.After that theyre practically bulletproof. Minimal transfer will definitely last through food if youre half mindful about it. They are a little drying but not enough to be painful or irritating. Not for me at least. Its more work that painting on one coat of something more userfriendly but the payoff in wear time and colors not to mention being able to mix them makes it soooo worth it.Sorry for the wall o text its just...big lovely lips deserve worthy products and Lip Tars are so worthy. The trend of everyone writing them off saddens me.,MakeupAddiction,ch1icyo,6,t5_2rww2

It does lack a pump and it is a liquid so it can be messy to get out of the bottle but its a really great product.Im not that acne prone I just have dry sensitive skin so I cant speak for how itll work in regards to your acne sorry. I do know it doesnt bother my sensitive skin and it hasnt caused breakouts for me. If you have oily skin in another thread someone said that it worked well with their skin that leaned more towards oily so it doesnt sound like it matters too much if your skin is oily or dry itll work well. Either way you end up with a healthy moisturized look.There is this review and demo of it done by Wayne Goss and he loves it and says its onpar with more expensive brands.

893521,0,t1_ch5tajx,. For myself personally to be honest trial and error. Swatch stuff before you buy it if you can watch YouTube reviews with swatches look at blog swatches particularly if the persons skin tonecoloring is similar to yours.. I love all blush. I like blush with a little shimmer because then I dont have to use highlighter. Shimmery blush gives you a highlight along with the color. Matte blush does not. However with a matte blush if you add highlight you have more control over where the highlight goes. Shimmery blush is not good for mature skin or otherwise problematic skin as it can accentuate fine lines and wrinkles and large pores. If you tend to get really oily over the course of the day you might not want to use a shimmery blush because it can make you look too luminous I have combination oilynormal skin but I blot so I use pretty much any finish blush. ,MakeupAddiction,ch5uiml,13,t5_2rww2

934637,0,t3_24tdoc,The best advice I can give is to not let the fact you have hooded eyes hold you back. A LOT of looks are on girls with awesome eye shapes but who gives a shit. If it looks good on them it can look good on you.Practice your blending on your hand. Find out what brushes and what sort of strokes work better for you. Keep practising and practising. Youre gonna get discouraged and youre gonna wipe a lot of makeup off and start over but thats not how you get better. Like a year ago I could maybe apply eyeliner and that was about the extent of my makeup. Now almost everyday I try to play with it even if I dont go out. I look at fun stuff I like on MUA or Pinterest and I try my best to do it on myself.And if you do practice a lot find cheap stuff you like. One of my favorite brands is Wet and Wild. If you can learn to play with cheap shitty stuff once you get your hands on the goods youll feel like a bad ass. IE going from shitty dollar store foundation to Kat Von D stuff? Yeah changed my lifeeee.rHoodedEyes exists too! Either way dont let that shit hold you back.  of MUA will preach to you that makeup is about having fun and doing it because you want to do it. That should apply to your technique too. Do you booboo. If you like something go for it. Try new stuff and find out what works and what you like and dont like. ,MakeupAddiction,chaiufl,6,t5_2rww2

976573,0,t1_chf8zwx,Firstly thank you! Thats so sweet. Secondly What I like about Taupe is that its very buildable if you apply with a gentle hand and move upward not downward this causes contour to get that muddy look into your hairline you can build it and gently blend it out and the contour looks very natural. Honestly its easy to over do it and get muddyyou just have to have patience and self control. There have been times and still are times that I get a little heavy handed and it looks like I rubbed dirt on my face once my mom asked if I had a bruise on my face oops.But overall Taupe is a good product and it doesnt really move around at least not for me. Usually I apply my foundation and then set it with a powder so that Taupe glides more smoothly and blends out more easily versus sticking to the foundation if that makes sense. And I always set it with a finishing spray Urban Decay All Nighter is awesome but on a budget I love NYX finishing spraydewy or matte doesnt really make a big difference as far as I can tell.,MakeupAddiction,chfamu3,4,t5_2rww2

But if not just as the other posters said check out the diagrams for reference. Some people also suggest using a white eye pencil to sketch the outline of the brow shape you desire then to pluck everything outside of it. Some find that helpful. The important things I suggest though are stepping away from the close up mirror and looking at your brows from a normal mirror as you pluck as the close up mirror gives you kind of a distorted perception of your brows. Also start with minimal plucking and take breaks sleep on it etc so that you dont go overboard. ,MakeupAddiction,chliios,2,t5_2rww2

If youre unsure about eyeshadow maybe you can use some colourful eyeliner instead I think purple and green would look very pretty on you!. Colourful eyeliner is a little more wearable for an everyday look than eyeshadow in my opinion. Especially if you choose a darker kind of eyeliner. ,MakeupAddiction,chuu97i,5,t5_2rww2

I really like Maybelline Mega Plush because it fans out my lashes nicely and accentuates their length without being over the top or clumping everything a lot.The panda eyes situation could be happening if you have oily lids andor hooded eyes. Primer can help keep your liner from smudging but to keep mascara from smearing after a few hours your best bet is to just keep trying brands until you find one that wont budge for you. Unfortunately I have no firsthand recommendations since I dont experience mascara smudging but Im sure others will recommend things!,MakeupAddiction,chwhe8y,2,t5_2rww2

Same level of drying as the Tar but maaannnn does that color stay put! I dont even need a lip liner since theres no feathering. I have Jeffree hot slightly coral pink and the foiled love version of Adora softer red with a metallic gold sheen very similar to a les metallic OCC Super NSFW. Theyre also  versus the  OCC but it comes in a lip gloss type tube with a doe foot applicator versus a squeeze tube and brush so the KVD is much easier to apply and touch up when needed. Aside from being a little drying you also will have to literally exfoliate the color off your lips.

1194770,0,t3_27srnb,The best advice I can give comes from personal experience. Be patient. For me it took a little less than a year to go from almost no brows to brows that I can make look just the way I want.Dont go buy products and expect them to work magic. I had to spend around  months letting my overtweezed eyebrows grow out then I started experimenting with filling them in. I tried pencils gels powders. once I found products that worked the way I wanted Anastasia brow duo and elf clear mascara I did them every day slowly changing the shape application etc. I learned from my mistakse and my technique gradually evolved. BUT what also evolved was my natural brows. I had to slowly groom them to look good when I filled them in. Now I mostly just maintain them since I am happy with how they look when they are done but they still change a little over time.Its really just a very gradual transition. I think a lot of women get putoff when they cant get them to look perfect right away. It just takes time. Theres no real instant solution unless your brows are really nice naturally. Yours arent even close to as horrible as mine were though. My personal advice would be to let them grow in closer together. They seem a little too far apart to me a big issue I had when I first realized I had tweeted mine to death. Then maybe get them professionally shaped if you dont feel comfortable doing it yourself. Then fill and maintain from there! It shouldnt take you much time at all to get them where you want them.Hope I helped some instead of just rambling.

1203140,0,t1_ci4ved2,In regards to greengold being too much for daytime I think it depends on the way it is applied and how you wear it  for example if it is smokey and blended well then I think it would be perfect for daytime however if you were to go for a more heavy and dark look then itd probably better for eveningnight wear. I know what you mean about eye pencil  some are quite drastic and heavy going and come out far too dark. IMO you can either use a tiny bit of the heavy eye pencil and blend it across the lower lash line to make it a little less heavy and more smokey or another tip I find works well is using black eyeshadow on a slightly damp brush and blending that across the lower lash line. However if you just want a more light eye pencil that isnt as harsh I find that Avon Cosmetics sell good eye pencils! ,MakeupAddiction,ci4yzer,1,t5_2rww2

Your foundation from the chin area seems to balance fairly well with your throat. I agree that the brows could be less severe try a medium ash shade something that doesnt add red in either. Or even using a spoolie to score a little excess product back off the brow can reduce the harshness.  Overall great work!,MakeupAddiction,ci65s8f,1,t5_2rww2

That being said  I never really liked using silicone primers with silicone foundations  just because having both never settled well on my skin which I honestly attributed to dryness... but recently Ive been using a siliconebased primer and a oilwater cream foundation and the results are amazing. ,MakeupAddiction,cig73m7,1,t5_2rww2

I think a makeup artist named Wayne Goss did a few tutorials on male makeup.Also start out with only a little bit of eyeshadow dont go all the way up to the brow. Pat a bit of colour on the lid and blend out with a fluffy brush. Repeat until youre satisfied with the colour.

1352594,0,t3_29kf61,For a while I was wearing Shu Uemura Natural Volume falsies pretty regularly x a week but Ive gotten lazier about it recently.  They give my eyes a nice pop but still look pretty natural on me so I dont feel too weird about wearing them around on the office especially if its a Friday and Ive got plans afterward.  Theyre a little on the pricey side but I can usually get over  uses out of one pair.  I absolutely love them because they dont look too glossy and its not usually immediately noticeable that Im wearing them.  If Im doing a photoshoot or going full on dramatic eyes out in Vegas Shu Uemuras Smoky Layers are a godsend.,MakeupAddiction,cilu7tw,6,t5_2rww2

1356466,0,t3_29mak7,Honestly I dont think it looks too bad. I have dry skin naturally and what works for me is exfoliating regularly and using water based foundations. Silicone foundations tend to cake up more on my skin for whatever reason I do use them still on good skin days. I like things like It Cosmetics CC cream for my dry skin days. I like to prime with Now Hyaluronic Acid Serum one of the top ingredients is Aloe Vera so pretty sure Aloe vera alone would work fine. I also like using a setting spray to fight the cakiness.One other thing that I recently discovered that I love is the Reviva Labs rosewater spray. I spray it before moisturizing most moisturizers just trap moisture they dont provide the moisture so this gives some moisture to trap so to speak then I also set my foundation with it. It makes my skin look amazing and much less drycakey. ETA Smooth operator contains clay which is amazing in a mask but would further dry out my dry skin if worn all day personally. ,MakeupAddiction,cimbnsf,4,t5_2rww2
1356540,0,t3_29m6rb,Hmmm... I definitely think that you should have a couple of concealers in your arsenal even if you didnt have the pigmentation variation.  The kind of concealer which goes under your eyes should be more fluid and thinner I loooove Mac Prolongwear concealer for this and I will rebuy it forever whereas the one you might use around your face should be thicker my favorites is the Amazing Cosmetics one.With regards to the concealer color for undereye I suggest you find a peach or yellow toned concealer as in the MUFE concealer palette to cancel out the dark color before you apply a more fluid concealer that better matches the undertone of the rest of your face over it.  That way you are able to use your undereye concealer elsewhere if you like and dont have to worry about the yellow undertone looking odd with the pink.,MakeupAddiction,cimbzrs,1,t5_2rww2
1356582,0,t3_29may5,I think it looks great good job. Id suggest blending out the eyeshadow more though it looks good in all the pictures except when I look at picture  with your eyes closed the darker color seems to extend partly across your crease and then it isnt really blended out. You could also consider bringing that crease color up higher so its more visible when your eyes are open but thats just a personal preference it probably keeps it more workappropriate with a lower crease too.,MakeupAddiction,cimc6ki,2,t5_2rww2

1362879,0,t3_29ol11,I have oily skin and get crazy shiny. Like look like a plastic doll shiny. However thats all changed recently. I just recently started to use Rimmel Stay Matte Primer which is my HG primer. It mattifies the hell out of my face no problem. I then follow that with my beloved Revlon Colorstay Whipped cream foundation. Now for my entire makeupusing life I have followed foundation with a powder to mattify things. However since using Rimmels Stay Matte Primer I have found that I use powder more out of habit than necessity. Anyway old habits die hard so I just use a little big of Rimmel Stay Matte powder to blend my blush a little and on my nose forehead and chin. Ive seriously never found a combination that works better to keep me from turning into a grease slick. I think I still get a wee bit shiny during the day but nothing compared to before and not in a way that I look bad. I basically just get that dewy look that everybody seems to love so much.

Or you could go with the Ambienet Lighting Palette and spend the rest on NYX. I like Cover Girl but I dont think its a must have. OCC I like in theory but I never use any of my lip tars. Too Faced I love which is why I suggest one of their palettes. Tarte has great products I love their lipsurgence lip tints but if you want lip products I would definitely go with Bite Beauty. These are just the brands I have the most experience with. Nothing beats seeing the products in person so youll want to wait until you can swatch everything to make a decision.

1439762,0,t3_2amsu7,Ive noticed this recently in MTVs Awkward. At the end of season  Ashley Rickards Jenna had some horribly matched concealer on. I noticed a big yellow smudge on her face and thought it was something on my screen until it moved with her. I cant find any screen shots unfortunately but it was very noticeable. Ive also noticed that in the current season  virtually all of the female characters are constantly wearing this mauvey purplish matte lipstick. In the screenshots Ive found it actually looks quite pretty but on the screen it looks horribly unflattering IMO. It looks like a lip color youd put on someone to make them look like a corpse. So bad. On another note Im currently watching Twin Peaks and Im distracted by how GOOD the makeup is. Very early s aesthetic but so well done! EDIT SE spoilers of Awkward but here is what Im talking about with the lipstick. At around the  minute mark you can see it on all four girls in the car. HOWEVER on my phone the lip color looks quite pink and cute. On my TV it looks dreadful. So maybe its the color settings that make it look bad!

1452110,0,t1_ciy6agn,I saw twice from two different people who had almost an elitist attitude about being pale like You dont know real palepeople problems unless youre pale as I am. It irked me because there are varying degrees of paleness. A girl whos on the medium side of pale is still pale and they could still have foundation problems. The problems are real though Im super pale and the lightest shades of drugstore foundations are too dark for me or if they did match I didnt like the formula. Its not a fake lament or a humble brag. Before finding an affordable Korean BB that fit me better I couldnt afford anything more expensive than drugstore foundations so I dealt with it but people would occasionally tell me my foundation doesnt match or its too dark and I knew I was super embarrassed by it but I went through foundation often enough not to be able to buy expensive brands.  Thinking back on it I think the ladies probably thought I couldnt see it and wanted to tell me not knowing there were no lighter shades for me that worked but at the time I felt embarrassed and angry about it. ,MakeupAddiction,ciyaplp,11,t5_2rww2

1458760,0,t3_2auq4c,If you got a really vibrant red lipstick youd have a good sort of rockabilly pinup look going on if you combined it with your winged eyeliner and tattoos. Personally I prefer blue based reds they make my teeth look whiter but the orange reds are more in right now. I think the blue reds look better if youre going for a pinup look but that might just be me. Stilas stay all day liquid lipstick is a bit annoying to learn how to use I do one thin coat by wiping off the doe foot applicator a bit on the inside edge of the tube so I dont waste product dabbing a small bit on the middle of my lips and spreading it out from there then I wait for it to dry then do another thin coat the same way but once youve got it it doesnt need touch ups. Ive got the shade fiery and it lasted  hours and survived tacos and beer. The shade Beso seems to be more popular however on MUA. However it is pretty drying so you need to lipbalm it up after. Or you could look into some of the nyx lipsticks or their liquid lip creams Im sure a quick search for nyx red will pull of various shades people have shown off here. I dont think the lip creams last as long but they arent as drying. I havent tried them myself however I do find their lipsticks much less drying and they dont last nearly as long. ,MakeupAddiction,ciz4pwe,8,t5_2rww2

1485772,0,t3_2b38yy,This used to happen to me too! But I totally fixed it a few months ago. I was getting my makeup done for a film and it started happening as per usual after applying the foundation. The MUA recommended ditching my exfoliating scrubs and using baking soda instead. I keep a little container of baking soda by my sink and every couple of days mix a little bit with water and go to town on my face focusing on my nose.Since doing this I havent had the issue and my pores are way smaller and cleaner. If I forget to do it for longer than a week I can definitely tell the difference. Best part is that if youre in need of an emergency scrub at a friends place or out of town baking soda is everywhere.,MakeupAddiction,cj2ilux,1,t5_2rww2

Its no secret that people who are attractive are treated better than those that arent. Its just the extra plus of being a hotty people think youre hot and are willing to do things for you out of that attraction. It just is the way the world works.  So when people make an effort to look better they do get a benefit from society.  I feel like that always gets left out of the conversation.

It also costs a few more . Its not as popular of a brand but its older and really great and they actually own Mac Cosmetics. Also those powders go on really nicely with a big fluffy brush save the sponge for touchups only. Applying your whole face with the sponge can result in a cakey look.

Hes a gamer and game collector and he goes as far as spending  on a rare game but if I have loads of super cheap drugstore makeup this starts being too much. He says that Im spending too much time and money on makeup yet when I really dont want to wear makeup somedays he says that I should wear makeup and that im super pretty with it on I dont know how I feel about this.... It seems that its not only our bfs or my mum who consider that makeup is some kind if inferior hobby e.g. you can spend more money on art supplies but not on makeup but society in general. Yet societys beauty standards require women to wear makeup. If you ask someone whats a beautiful woman without makeup she would probably wear the makeup no makeup look. I used to wear a bit of makeup at the end of middle school and beginning of high school and then I stopped because I prioritized my sleep in the morning. After that all my friends harassed me about not wearing makeup. Im so confused haha.,MakeupAddiction,cj6lgzv,2,t5_2rww2

1525384,0,t1_cj63k30,So I normally use a cream blush I use Maybelline Dream Bouncy Blush in Coffee Cake since its a really natural color and works well with my skin tone. Its really easy to blend and I feel like its easier to control than a powder brush. Where you apply kinda depends on your face shape but I apply it in this motion and feel like it would work for you as well. I just use my fingers but you could apply it with a foundation brush if you wanted!I definitely recommend finding a neutral colored blush for day to day and although some ladies here may correct me tend to try to limit the brighterdarker makeup to one or two features for just daily use. For instance if I wear a darker lipstick I would definitely have a more simple eye. If I were to wear a bright brush I would probably pass on bright lipstick. If you do get a powder brush you just want to use a decently large fluffy brush to get a nice soft application.Do you prefer a neutral look or would you want to venture out with something dramatic? I saw in another post somebody brought up highlighting uTheKittenButcher is one of my favorite posters and posted this tutorial on highlighting and contour that could come in handy! ,MakeupAddiction,cj7hfkm,2,t5_2rww2

If there arent any contour products on the market for darker skin grrrr then I would recommend experimenting with eye shadow. Ive actually experimented with UD eyeshadow as a contour and it worked out nicely! Inglot has nice sized pans and a wide variety of colors. You could easily make a personalized contour palette at a relatively inexpensive price. I would stick to mattes.

1559796,0,t3_2c1zia,For the bare minimum I recommend that you pick up three good eyeshadow brushes. MAC  is my holy grail brush for laying down eyeshadow. Hakuhodo J is apparently the best accessible blending brush. At  its cheaper than MAC  which is scratchy ugh. Hakuhodo G is supposedly fantastic for detail work. You can get a few more brushes to supplement like angled brush small flat detail synthetic brush but honestly these three are all the eyeshadow brushes you need. I havent done as much research into other brushes because frankly Im terrified of the face brush prices but these are the three eyeshadow ones that Ive seen being consistently recommended. ,MakeupAddiction,cjbskwy,2,t5_2rww2

Ive had my tube of Porefessional for like a year now because I use very little at a time. Whatever you choose make sure you tappat it into your pores to fill them in if you tappat with any siliconebased primer youll see some porefilling action though not as good in my experience as a porefiller.

1578047,0,t3_2ccea9,Looks like your eyebrows are already in great shape. Maintain that arch and emphasize with some brow product. Milani makes a good brow pencil with a spoolie on the end... not sure if youre in the US but its a good drug store brand to start with. Your eyelashes are super long so thats awesome for you. And your skin is really clear! You probably wont have to use foundation!Try experimenting with lip color and eye shadow. Get a neutral eye shadow palette and look up some natural eye makeup tutorials. My first neutral palette was Stilas In the Light and its great I still use it. I would start learning how to do natural looks and then go into the fullface looks. I also think you would look great with some highlighter in the inner corners of your eyes by the tear ducts. It would brighten up your baby blues! ,MakeupAddiction,cje33l7,1,t5_2rww2

1593984,0,t3_2ciq4s,I would research makeup online then try to find that exact product in a store. It will be easier to find detailed information online. In most stores the makeup section is segmented by brand and then product. So all the foundations will be spread out between brands and youll have to do some looking around to find certain products. If you cant tell what finish a foundation is you can get it and return it if you dont like how it looks BUT do your research beforehand on the return policy to make sure. Most foundation doesnt come with a brush. Powders will usually come with some form of application a puff or pad inside the compact. I have seen this  in CVS which does come with a mini brush which might be convenient. Usually makeup brushes are near the makeup but not always in the same aisle. Unless youre in a big store there is a chance there wont be many brushes. If there is a target near you I would recommend going there to get brushes. They have a large selection. But if youre getting powder you probably wont need a separate brush. I would recommend a BB cream to start with because its the most simple just like applying lotion.,MakeupAddiction,cjg3bgp,2,t5_2rww2

1600906,0,t3_2cm0af,Hello! My favorite MLBB lip color is NYXs Matte Lipstick in Spirit Im NC  super duper yellow and my lips are fairly pale. I love this color its almost the exact shade of my lips. My lips are uneven in color I have two prominent pale spots on my lower lip and this lipstick evens it out beautifully because its opaque as hell. I apply a balm before wearing lipstick but even for a matte this doesnt seem to dry me out too much. Its at full opacity in a single swipe too. My only complaint is that the wear time isnt remarkable. Its okay but I definitely have other products that last far longer. But at least it fades evenly and since its such a close match to my lips its barely noticeable anyways.,MakeupAddiction,cjgyord,2,t5_2rww2

1634581,0,t3_2d189i,At a drug store price I really like Boots primers. They have a few so you can make a selection based on your own skin type. I personally have oily skin with bad acne so I use a matte primer. It basically helps keep my foundation in place prevent shine from oil and give me a smoother surface to apply foundation too. For eye primer at a low price NYX milk is decent. I personally think that this is an item to splurge on as a good primer will give even the worst drug store shadows a decent color payoff.  Eye primer helps you get the best color payoff and staying power for shadows and liners. I personally use either BareMinerals eye primer or urban decay primer. As far as concealer goes that really depends on your skin type. I use benefits erase paste under my eyes its hydrating and provides awesome coverage. For my acne spots Ive liked most drug store blemish sticks. They provide a heavy coverage and seem kt stick pretty well. Neutrogena and Almay make some nice blemish sticks for a decent price. ,MakeupAddiction,cjl7csf,2,t5_2rww2
1634717,0,t1_cjl6mwt,I love the concealerhighlighter. Ive tried other concealers and i like theirs best. Studio brushes are good.

The clear lip balm is nice i really like it and it goes well with other lip products. The face primer is pretty good  I use it alone or with concealer and a powder. You could do better ordering online. Wait for the sales.edit I also like the eyebrow kit but I havent tried many others. Mascaras are eh. Lipsticks are also eh. ,MakeupAddiction,cjl7z27,1,t5_2rww2

My tried and true foundation is Macs Pro Longwear Liquid foundation. Its one of the only foundations that stays on my oily skin throughout the day and survives the hug test I think we all know the horror of accidentally leaving a face print on someones shirt. I also have an olive skin tone and the Mac foundation is one of the only foundations that matches my skin tone. Any recommendations on eye and face primer for my oily skin?

Its still my favorite due to convenience with my second favorite being the one at Tempe Marketplace I generally avoid the one at Chandler Village seeing as there is a Nordstrom Rack thereeven though they dont have a large selection of beauty stuff like the one in Burbank Sephora and SiJCP  The Sephora in the Chandler Mall is about average probably a blevel store. The SiJCP is pretty much a joke. Beauty Brands  Great source for clearance although they now do . off  coupons instead of free product coupons so I find myself going there a LOT less. Drugstores  There is a CVS or Walgreens on practically every corner here. They vary by size and selection and I do have a couple of personal favorites.

I have all of the KVD liquid lippies but I still desire mooooar!    They still last forever when mixed with Milk and it actually makes the KVD a little less dry on the lips.  So its actually more comfortable to wear one of them mixed with milk than to wear one not mixed with it IMO.

1658829,0,t1_cjo94uu,I usually set my MUFE foundation with a loose powder that is a shade lighter than my foundation. Be careful to not go too light or you can look ghostly. The reason for doing this is as the day passes from wearing makeup it appears to oxidize and darken from oils in your skin and your environment.  Also in photos itll keep you looking fresh and awake.  You can buy MUFE at Sephora and I would look into loose powders by Clinique or CoverFX which are also at Sephora.,MakeupAddiction,cjo9b4v,1,t5_2rww2

The study also discussed this information in the context of the weak estrogenlike properties of parabens and the influence of estrogen on breast cancer. However the study left several questions unanswered. For example the study did not show that parabens cause cancer or that they are harmful in any way and the study did not look at possible paraben levels in normal tissue....gt FDA is aware that estrogenic activity in the body is associated with certain forms of breast cancer. Although parabens can act similarly to estrogen they have been shown to have much less estrogenic activity than the bodys naturally occurring estrogen. For example a  study Routledge et al. in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology found that the most potent paraben tested in the study butylparaben showed from  to fold less activity than naturally occurring estradiol a form of estrogen. Further parabens are used at very low levels in cosmetics. In a review of the estrogenic activity of parabens Golden et al. in Critical Reviews in Toxicology  the author concluded that based on maximum daily exposure estimates it was implausible that parabens could increase the risk associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals.Source ,MakeupAddiction,cjo9s3t,10,t5_2rww2

ELF Brushes could be a good place to start or the Ecotools starter set would work too. Real Techniques have a great core collection for the face and starter set for the eyes.For foundation theres a few options. Some people prefer a flat foundation brush others a fluffier stippling brush and possibly a beauty blender Keep in mind that there are cheap alternatives for everything though real techniques and ELF are reasonable as is. There are plenty of alternative sponges that are similar to the beautyblender that cost much less like the Quo blending sponge For eyeshadow Id say a eyeshadow base brush and a blending brush are both the bare minimum but there are countless different options of brushes with varying shapes density and sizes. I have the Real Techniques starter set and I love the softness and quality of those brushes. If you do get any of the Naked palettes they come with this really nice brush.

1685899,0,t3_2doynw,In my personal opinion I would recommend MUFA Mat Velvet  instead of the two you are considering. It has done wonders for me in terms of staying power and longevity. I too live in Florida and I am a college student and walk outside a lot. The foundation doesnt budge especially if you use a good primer. I personally use Smashbox primer in light and then Mat Velvet  on top and then I set with powder and it lasts all day long. To finish off I use a setting spray it seems extreme but in  humidity I dont mess around. I also have extremely oily and acne prone skin and it doesnt break me out and it does a good job of keeping your skin matte. This is a full coverage foundation so you wont need a lot to get a flawless finish especially if you use a stiff buffing brush. I have MAC Matchmaster and though it is a good foundation I find myself reaching for the MUFA Mat Velvet  much more than any other foundation in my collection. Also Matchmaster didnt help mattify my skin and it isnt water proof or sweat proof. ,MakeupAddiction,cjro77y,2,t5_2rww2

I like to work in the nyx hd setting powder well into my skin not necessarily using a lot because I knew it looks ghostly but just enough spread and buffed out evenly so that theres no sticky spots on my face. Then I set it all with my UD spray and bring some glow back to my face with my hourglass ambient lighting powder.

1751778,0,t1_cjzynna,Oh yea I would definitely agree that the Stila is longer lasting. Ive not really noticed a color difference then again I guess Ive never really compared them side by side. The main reason Id pick the Maybelline over the Stila one is because I tend to go over the same spot twice to darken it up and with the Stila eyeliner at least for me it acts like it dries up and it wont draw unless its some skin that doesnt already have eyeliner on it. It ends up looking a little patchy. Maybe Im doing something wrong. S,MakeupAddiction,cjzyx7k,3,t5_2rww2

1768065,0,t3_2eqav1,Its not really related in that I know you didnt misplace your stuff but this reminded me of something that happened to me a few years ago. I was  and had moved interstate away from my hometown and it didnt work out. I came home to my parents house for just under a month or so while my real estate agent organised  an apartment for me in a neighbouring town. My much older brother ish? was working on an oilrig and his wife and kids had moved in with my parents at the same time as I did while they closed on a house  sold theirs first and had to leave before the new one was ready. His daughter Jess was  yeah year older than me. I moved out the same week they did but because all my stuff was still interstate I had a duffel of clothes and a box of books I never took from their house in the first place. Move into my cosy little apartment  kitchen bathroom bedroom and a nook big enough for a table. Its tiny and super empty. I get a call from Jess on Saturday night two days after moving in. Have I seen her  hair straightener? She cant find it since moving. I say nope has she checked under the car seats? She seems really pissy with me but whatever. She asks me to check my things because maybe it got caught up. I look at my pile of clothes and my shelf of books and my new toiletries on the bed and say nope. She starts getting really agitated and hangs up on me.I get a call shortly thereafter from her mother who tries to be all reasonable and calm and asks me to check my stuff again and keeps telling me the  hair straightener was . She starts saying no one is going to be mad at me but Jess needs it. I say straight up its not here over and over and eventually get off the phone after nearly an hour of me crying and protesting my innocence and being lectured at and pleaded with. Hair straightener isnt at mums it isnt at Jesss I moved out same days I let her straighten my hair the weekend before so I must have wanted it and yes its a fantastic thing and oh so covetable blah blah blah but it isnt ok to steal and shes going out and needs it blah blah blah I just about tune out.Phone rings again and its my dad hes been on the phone to Jess in the meantime. He sounds really sad and tells me Jess has been online saying Im a thief and scum and has called all the aunts and uncles and my  other siblings and is telling everyone Im a thief and a liar and asking everyone to help her. He tells me this is tearing the family apart and cant I do something. I totally break down and cant function. He asks me to just tell the truth and there wont be any consequences. I say I know nothing. He says that really disappoints him and he doesnt know how to help. He hangs up.Jess rings back and absolutely verbally abuses me. She says shes driving to my town to kick my ass and get her straightener back. She screeches that she cant believe we used to be friends. She says a lot of nasty things and hangs up before I can get a word in. I curl up in the fetal position on my kitchen floor and just wail. I had no idea where this came from. I just wanted to eat some pie and watch Big Love and maybe look into pet birds. It was a quiet Saturday night in and it sounded like I had lost my reputation my family my friend and had everyone thinking I was a thief all out of nowhere plus I was about to get my ass kicked. And I was a pudgy soft baby of an  year old and this girl was HARD. I wanted to call the police. The phone rang again and I picked it up and put it down. It happened twice more and I almost left it off the hook but I wanted to ring my mum and have her calm me down and it rang once more and I picked it up. It was Jesss mum and she said in a super flat monotone really fast and kind of runon  Jess has found her hair straightener and sorry about any trouble and then hung up.I rang my mum and she told me Jess found her hair straightener under the sink in the new house. It wasnt where she would have put it but someone else unpacked it.Worst experience of my life and Ive been homeless left home at  been through the wars really. I think its because I clawed my way to a relationship with my family a strong reputation solid trust etc and not only felt like I had lost all that forever but that it cant have been that strong to start with if it was so easily torn down. Jess never talked to me again. She gave my mum a giant bag of jewellery and makeup to give to me but never actually apologised or contacted me and didnt respond the one time I tried to contact her. I havent had any contact with that brother or any of his family in the  years since actually. Thanks for reading I needed the rant I think. It wasnt as old history as I thought.

1769555,0,t1_ck270am,well thats like their number one go too stuff and it has known carcinogens in it so im like.. what? How often are you using it? Also it COULD just be as simple as needing a really good moisturizer. Most of the time the reason people get so oily is because the skin is crying for some good moisture. Also oil combats oil. I would honestly try one of the beauty to go versions of Josie Marans Argan Oil light. I think you will really see a difference. Its  organic so it cant break you out. I know over at SCA they do know a lot more cheaper alternatives but I would def look for something along those lines and see how that works for a couple weeks.,MakeupAddiction,ck27i2w,1,t5_2rww2
1769679,0,t3_2erb6u,First of all you are amazing. My own fiancee was what started my makeup addiction so I understand exactly what youre trying to do. My mother had always taught me to be very careful about spending money so I would often have the same items like blush for years or use foundation that was way too dark for me because it was a waste to buy a new bottle. My fiancee asked me at one point why I never wore red lipstick and that he would like to see me wear one at some point. I was not a lipstick fan but I got a cheap drugstore red for a date just to show him how bad it looked on me and actually loved it. lolHe got me an ulta gift card for my birthday shortly after that and went with me to give his input and provide feedbackencourage me to spend money on me lol. I ended up getting my first foundation that wasnt too dark among many other things. He is my absolute best friend and has gone shopping with me on many occasions just because he wants me to feel good about myself overall. He doesnt know a thing about makeup  but he can tell what Im drawn to or just suggest things I wouldnt even consider. I think that something similar could work for you. Or possibly getting her a gift card and encouraging her to go with her girl friends as a fun trip.Just for a difference of opinion I was not interested being taught how to do my makeup right off the bat I wanted to play with things on my own first but Im naturally a pretty self conscious person. The  makeover thing at Sephora would probably be pretty fun though.,MakeupAddiction,ck282cb,7,t5_2rww2

I also have a couple sets of Interdesign drawers which I dont really recommend. The acrylic is a lot thinner and will bow under weight and scratches really easily so the acrylic looks pretty cloudy at this point.

The first thing I noticed when looking at your photo is that your eyeliner ends too high it should be brought down to continue out of this dark corner area. Instead of starting to shape the flick from the TOP of the shape draw on the BOTTOM of the flick first extending it from the same line and angle that your bottom lash line makes. This shape is what Im talking about and here is a pictorial. Good luck and looking good for a first post!   ,MakeupAddiction,ck44p4w,3,t5_2rww2

I guess if you rub your eyes it will smudge whereas the benefit wouldnt budge. The Collection  does come in a waterproof formulation mind.  I find the collection  much easier to apply but maybe thats because I have more practise with liquid rather than gels?

I wouldnt call it full coverage by any means but for me it has a beautiful finish and never looks cakeydryoily in the slightest. Like you I have never tried anything else from Almay though.,MakeupAddiction,ck7x0s3,2,t5_2rww2
1815419,0,t3_2fcfse,Okay so Im super lazy and unskilled when it comes to brows. My go to product is Benefit Gimme Brow. It looks like a mini mascara but its brow colored and you just run the spoolie through your brows. It has some fiber stuff in it to bulk up any bare patches. Super easy soft looking and takes like a minute. ,MakeupAddiction,ck7xv16,9,t5_2rww2
1816296,0,t1_ck7sulw,I like Wolfe bodypaints amazing payoff and they last forever.  Just be wary if you choose them because not only do they last but they can sometimes stain for a day lol. Beyond that mehron cakes.  They arent water proof though so with sweat and friction itll come off. ,MakeupAddiction,ck81osd,1,t5_2rww2
1816962,0,t1_ck83tam,Well for some reason the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer in Porcelain came up as a match for both and thats the only product Ive used from the Sephora color iq system. After looking at the other products they recommended I think the yO is better. Like I said I dont know what the numbers and letters mean  that would be a good thing to ask them if you go in to get matched! I think both colors have good matches and bad ones so I think it would be a good starting point. I just wanted to warn you not to take the matching as a definitive  match for all the products theyll recommend. ,MakeupAddiction,ck84l7p,1,t5_2rww2

1835755,0,t3_2fjpho,There are certainly makeup Tips that need to die for example a few days or weeks ago there was a photo tutorial posted about how to cheat and use eyeliner as eyeshadow. The post was something like Sketch it out then blendblur the eyeliner in place of eyeshadow. When actual posters here tried it the consensus I saw was that this tip did not actually work well in practice. I was out all last week so idk if anyone perfected the technique since then. But yah stuff like that and stuff thats bad for your skin Im thinking of using citric acids directly on your face those should really go away...Contouring though? Ehh just seems like backlash to me.

The brands that can withstand my monolids are Bobby Browns gel liner still some smudging but not as bad Clio Kill Black liquid liner thats gentle enough for my sensitive eyes yet stays put all day. Another trick to reduce smudging is to line the bottom part with concealer. Doesnt stop it completely but reduces it. Oh and to stop the undereye concelaer from creasing use an eye primer. Hope this helps! ,MakeupAddiction,ckaqgn4,32,t5_2rww2

I have oily and acne prone skin as well and am also quite pale so I think it might work for you too.  Its a medium coverage but is super buildable so it covers blemishes amazingly.  I also find that it lasts FOREVER and I dont have to blot at all if I set it with powder.  I will say that Im neutral toned so the lightest shade  ivory is too pink.  The second lightest  classic ivory is warm but too dark.  Consequently I do have to mix the shades for a perfect match but thats my only gripe.Im afraid I dont have recommendations for primer or powder because I use mid to high end products for those purposes but I hope this helps!,MakeupAddiction,ckckmh8,2,t5_2rww2

Same goes with the YSL lippies.  I own the rouge pur couture rouge volupte shines and rouge volupte perles.  You def. May need lipliner with those and they do apply very smooth and slick.  A good trick is to get a thin tissue to lightly blot on lips after applying.  Plus YSL lippies tend to stain lips too so that may be a good or bad thing.,MakeupAddiction,ckeijdt,3,t5_2rww2

1913730,0,t3_2ghf70,At least for me powder foundations tend to accentuate my pores and in order to get enough coverage I really have to cake it on I have very red acne and very pale skin.  I also have not yet found a powder foundation that actually matches although I know I could if I went online and did the indie ones.I used bare minerals for a while and I enjoyed the ease of application although the lightest color is too pink for me and everything else is too dark but it also had the unfortunate effect of setting off the bomb sniffers at my internship I worked for a nuclear power plant where every day you went through bomb puffers as well as a metal detector and a radiation detector.So my advice if you have to regularly go through bomb puffers avoid the powdered makeup as this means youll have to wait for a female security person to come which often takes a long time as there just arent many female security people in order to pat you down.Of course just walking across the wrong patches of grass that had been fertilized could also set off the bomb puffers so its certainly not just the makeup.,MakeupAddiction,ckjsii5,3,t5_2rww2
1914551,0,t3_2gitjt,Looking good! Makeup is so much fun and Im so excited for you to discover it! You have beautiful eyes so I would definitely try to draw attention to them any way that you can. To answer your question about the visible skin on your eyelid you might want to look up some videos about tightlining which is where you smudge some eyeliner or dark colored shadow into your lashline to conceal the skin between your lashes an added plus is that it makes your lashes look fuller! If youre using a pencil liner make short strokes as close to your lashline as possible and in between your lashes if you can then use your finger or a smudge brush to blend the pigment together you can make is as cleanlined or as undone as you like  a video will explain more in depth. A softer and in my opinion more foolproof way to achieve a similar effect is to use a dark shadow like Creep in your Naked palette. Use a small angled eyeliner brush pick up some shadow and blend it into your lashline. Youll probably have some shadow fall onto your lower eyelid so dont put your foundationconcealer on your undereye area until after you apply your eyeliner to make clean up easier. Tightlining is a great way to add subtle dimension to your eyes without looking like youre wearing much makeup. I can explain more in depth if youd like but there are lots of good videos on youtube that can show you different ways to achieve it. You can also apply eyeliner to your waterline the skin beneath your lashes before your eye ball if you like a pencil or gel liner is best for this but I still havent found a formula that doesnt eventually deteriorate.Another suggestion I have to brighten your eyes is to use a highlight on your inner corners of your eye  the skin near your tear duct and on your brow bone  just below your eyebrows. A great shadow for this is Virgin in your Naked palette. In my opinion you picked a great palette to begin with its my personal favorite of the Nakeds and you can create a number of versatile looks with it. To highlight my inner corners I usually just pick up some shadow with my fingertip and press it on the area blending slightly above and below the corner. You can use the small pointed end of the brush that came with your palette to highlight your brow bone or use your finger for that as well. As far as clothes go I always say that Id wear a burlap sack as long as my face looks good! In my opinion you instantly look more pulled together when your face looks polished clothes come second to that for me. I often wear a hoodie or a t shirt to work but I always make sure my makeup is done!,MakeupAddiction,ckjw2qg,2,t5_2rww2

1918256,0,t3_2glu4c,To me it simply seems like you need more confidence in yourself you seem to be acting like youre already totally inept but that awesome I eyeliner says otherwise!In the end tutorials cant work for everyone so you should never hold yourself to that standard besides that YouTuber didnt even match her foundation correctly so dont think shes some kind of perfect makeup guru shes just a regular person too who makes the same mistakes as everyone else.Everyone starts small with little steps and adding on new products and techniques  so dont be afraid to take your time. You will get there so theres no need to put pressure on yourself to be perfect straight away. I do want to say though that you need to throw out those lipsticks. Each product has a shelf life shown in a symbol of an open jar on the packaging with a number inside it and this is basically a useby date. You need to replace them regularly and shouldnt be using something that is  years old and you should also sanitise used products to reduce the transmission of bacteria. Shelf life varies from product to product and things like heat moisture frequency of use etc. are also factors that can reduce that shelflife. Many lipsticks are designed to be used in   months certainly not  years.Also it sounds like youre using your fingers a lot which can especially be an issue if youre prone to blemishes so I would recommend investing in some good brushes and cleaning solution so you can better buff and blend into the skin for a more natural result.,MakeupAddiction,ckkc4pz,3,t5_2rww2

1959403,0,t3_2h48yg,I need to rant for a moment about my frustration with my skin. Its still pretty good dont get me wrong but its become more oily so now I have combination skin more sensitive and more reactive. I have a ton of little pimples popping up all the time and I think its CeraVe PM which Ive been using for almost  weeks now thats causing them. Im slowly but surely trying to change my routine to better suit my new skin but its frustrating when you have to do it one product at a time and let it potentially jack up your skin before you can switch again.,MakeupAddiction,ckpb6gj,3,t5_2rww2

Still we cherish the city the morning we hope more than anything for more. Micheal Cunningham The HoursSometimes the best way to feel better is to help someone else.Let us do something while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. Not indeed that we personally are needed. Others would meet the case equally well if not better. To all mankind they were addressed those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place at this moment of time all mankind is us whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it before it is too late!

1986031,0,t3_2hgtvz,When Im tan I believe Im around NC for MAC and about BD for YSL Touche Eclat Foundation. I think if you are a bit tanner than that you should try BD. Is there any way you can go try these on at a department store or Sephora before purchasing? Its the safest way to go about! I recently tried out Diors Star Fluid foundation! It has a pretty nice glowy finish and lightmedium coverage. Its  cheaper than the YSL foundation but honestly  doesnt make a huge difference when you get to that pricepoint LOL. I think the YSL foundation feels lighter and has a bit more glow than the Dior foundation but the Dior foundation gives a tiny bit more coverage and is way longerlasting especially if you have oily skin! Im lighter than NC now and I use the Dior Star in shade  Sand as a perfect match! Hope this helps.,MakeupAddiction,cksimoe,1,t5_2rww2

I try again and am super light with the application and it still looks like the lipstick is going to shrivel up and fall off of my face.I dont get it. Like I said I tried on Lolita and Berlin and loved them. Frankly the only reason I didnt buy Berlin is because I have so many reds already.

2011781,0,t1_ckvan4g,My favorite metallic navy is Portland Blacks Indigo Bridge. Its smooth feels great on the lips and shiny as fuck. Color and sheen wise MBA has an exact dupe with its color Breathless however I find the formula a little drying. The only matte navy I have is OCCs Vain which is a little more green than other navy colors but is still gorgeous. Its not my favorite lip tar formula as it loves to transfer all over the place unless you apply it in very thin layers and build up even more so than other lip tars.

2012290,0,t1_ckvnqrp,Hmmm I could kinda see that but I would think it would only be valid if they could make a connection that people are buying ud specifically because its cruelty free...otherwise I think if theyre owned by a company that does it and theyre still making money off ud so why bother to change it? Also I think sadly people like to just ignore that kind of thing like honestly I do...I still buy from companies that test. I could picture an announcement of that so and so is now cruelty free. Personally I would definitely gravitate more towards that brand but Im not sure a lot of people would even care.Are animals still being actively tested for cosmetics that have been around a whie? I know next to nothing about the issue but Ive heard something like this most products that come out nowadays are made with things that are regulated and also not new at all so theres no real testing needed its already been done This is where my memory of the article or wbatever it was ends so the ends the rest is just me trying to fill in the end point. So even some things that say cruelty free might have ingredients that once were tested. On the other hand those companies that do did? Test arent even actually tested anymore.

2029413,0,t3_2i0wx7,Took a break from latenight studying to play around with something out of my comfort zone! As always CCW! The two things Im aware of looking back at this are  I should have gone over my lash band again with black eyeliner to cover the glue I was too tired to remember and  I should have curled my falsies and my real lashes together so that theyre cohesive and dont look separate but I couldnt get those giant lashes into my eyelash curler so I gave up. xD PRODUCT LISTEYES Clinique  Bottom Lash Mascara in Black House of Lashes  Lashes in Noir Fairy BLK MAC  Paint Pot in Soft Ochre Makeup Geek  Eyeshadows in Beaches and Cream Frappe Creme Brulee Brown Sugar and Mocha Crease Ice Queen Lid Cocoa Bear Bada Bing Corrupt Lower Lashline Marc Jacobs  Gel Definition Mascara in  Blacquer Maybelline  Eye Studio Lasting Drama Gel Eyeliner in Blackest Black NYX  Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk Rimmel  Scandaleyes Waterproof Kohl Eyeliner in Black Urban Decay  Eyeshadow Primer PotionBROWS Anastasia  Dip Brow Pomade in Medium Brown The Balm  Time Balm Concealer in LightMedium Benefit  Gimme Brow in MediumDark Makeup Geek  Eyeshadow in White LiesPROCESSI primed my eyes with Urban Decay  Eyeshadow Primer Potion and then applied MAC  Soft Ochre all over my lid extending up to my browbone. Then I used a large fluffy blending brush to apply Makeup Geek  Beaches and Cream mostly in my crease to make blending easier later. I took a blending brush with a slight tapered point to it Sigma E  Small Tapered Blending Brush and used it to apply Makeup Geek  Frappe above my crease creating that new crease and extending it backwards towards the tail of my brow. Then I applied NYX  Milk underneath that line on my lid and also extending out but under Frappe. I blended it out with a flat shader brush then applied Makeup Geek  Ice Queen on top of the white base. Going back to my crease I further defined it by using a small detailer brush Sigma E  Smudge Brush but I just used it because it has a pretty fineflat point for creating sharper eyeshadow lines to apply Makeup Geek  Brown Sugar right above the white shade creating a more defined line. I then used that same brush with no additional product to flick the brush upward along that line blending it out upward towards the crease to help it blend together. I also used Makeup Geek  Mocha with the same brush to define that line even more blending it upwards slightly. To finish up the eyeshadow I used Makeup Geek  Creme Brulee to blend out the browns in the crease. For my lower lashline I first buffed Makeup Geek  Cocoa Bear all across my bottom lashline from inner corner to outer corner. I then took a flat definer brush to press Makeup Geek  Bada Bing directly into my lashline then blended it out slightly with the previous pencil brush. Finally I used Rimmel  Black Kohl Eyeliner all throughout my waterline as well as for tightlining my upper lashes then set it with Makeup Geek  Corrupt. I also coated my bottom lashes in Clinique  Bottom Lash Mascara. For my winged liner I exaggerated it more and extended it towards the tail of my brows using an angled eyeliner brush and Maybelline  Gel Eyeliner in Blackest Black. Btw this eyeliner is beating out my usual Bobbi Brown one. D I curled my lashes slightly totally not enough it was late and applied Marc Jacobs  Gel Definition Mascara to my upper lashes then glued House of Lashes  Noir Fairy BLK as close as possible to the lashline. And like a fool I totally forgot to go over the glueband with eyeliner again so you can see the glue and I also forgot to curl my false and real lashes together to make them stick.  Lastly I filled in my brows with Anastasia  Dip Brow Pomade in Medium Brown set them with Benefit  Gimme Brow in MediumDark and applied Makeup Geek  White Lies underneath the arch of my brow as an underbrow highlight. I also used whatever white eyeshadow left on that brush to blend it into the brown crease color on my lid. Finally I just badly concealed the top of my brows with The Balm  Time Balm Concealer in LightMedium my brow hairs grow in weirdly . That pretty much wraps it up! CC VERY welcome especially because Ive never done anything like this before but I felt like I needed to experiment outside of my usual gradient eyeshadow looks even though they work so well on hoodedAsian lids.

Smashbox also has a product called Photo Finish Targeted Pore and Line Primer that dries transparent and can be patted into the pitted scars. I really like this one but its no longer available on their site Ive seen it in stores still but Im not sure if its being discontinued.    Ive noticed that a lot of people seem to refer to this as ice pick scarring in case that will help you search online for additional products ,MakeupAddiction,cl0vnm4,9,t5_2rww2
2053824,0,t1_cl0q5s9,Essentially because Mexicans like most indigenous of America have been treated like shit by the invading white settlers their traditions acculturalized and lost all meaning in the hegemony. Same reason why your aboriginals may get offended if you dressed like one of them in their religious garb. They might find it mockery yet another thing stolen by the immigrants who marginalized them on their own land.Its a heated argument in America what the difference between appreciation and appropriation is and where the line is drawn.People get mad when debates break out. But when you spend  years colonizing a place and torturingbutchering than marginalizing its people its bound to happen though white Americans often like to pretend the person offended is being hysterical cause ya know thats easier than knowing your ancestors were homicidal maniacsFrankly if American government just started treating the indigenous humanely there wouldnt be hurt feelings when they see their culture being used by people who are otherwise usually apathetic to their suffering.,MakeupAddiction,cl0vx00,-28,t5_2rww2

I give it a few minutes to sink in then apply primer and do my routine. Thats definitely helped me out a lot but again your skin might be different.Second question  do you use a damp beauty blender? I just saw a few comments about doing so on MUA and HOLY CRAP it looks so much better that way! I use a liquid foundation not sure if the same applies for powdersmousseetc but yeah  slightly damp sponge is fucking win. And finally Id try and look in a mirror thats about arms length away.

2093188,0,t3_2ivkf0,Hello! As always with these comments I am going to preface this with I am only one of many mods and the other mods may come in here and back hand me then put me back in the closet where I live but here is my opinion on this.It probably wont happen. Not because its not a good idea it is but because enforcing it is so complicated and tedious. It is something that would be very helpful though. This is a request that is similar to requests to make rules about no bad photo quality posts some people dont have a lot of options and it would really not be fair to tell them tough cookies because they have a crappy camera my only camera is a whopping  megapixels! or they get up really early in the morning and the sun is rising so their beforeafter have different light. Also its very subjective. What may be very different lighting to one person may not be all that different looking to another.I would say that this kind of thing would really be more of a suggestion PLEASE keep BampA photos similar so we can really compare lightingcamera angle ect. The chances of this becoming a rule and mods removing posts because of the lighting being changed is just not likely as this would also discourage BampAs for a lot of people and encourage people wanting to use photoshop to make the lighting more similar in photos.When you see posts like this though you could ask if they have other photos that have similar lighting they may have them and just didnt post them because they werent as flattering but would be willing to post if requested. Sorry that I come off like a huge Debbie Downer and if there is a huge outcry of others who agree with your it will be something that the mods will have to take into consideration but the logistics of it are pretty gross.SC,MakeupAddiction,cl5w2ao,9,t5_2rww2

2145363,0,t3_2jkayq,Brows are frames for the eyes I think filling them out to a color that is close to your natural shade is a good way to get used to filling out brows without them looking so odd at first. That is of course youd like to experiment with a thicker looking brow. I have no cc for your eyes because they just look like a natural and very flattering look for you and if thats the look you were going for Id give you an A. CC for the rest of the face I think a peachycoral blush would look really nice with your skin and gift you a soft natural glow and minimalsoft contour to the hollows of your cheeks and bringing it to the temples would really take it to the next level if you prefer. Also may I get a product list? D,MakeupAddiction,clcivu5,1,t5_2rww2

But the reason we need to use those large boxes is that the shipping companies dont exactly do a great job of taking care of your makeup orders and they will often stack heavy boxes on top of the deliveries we send out. If we use an envelope that means lots of crushed powders and broken lipsticks!The boxes we use can withstand just about any amount of weight that gets placed on top of them which keeps the product from getting damaged. Unfortunately for smaller orders that means a lot of space for the products to get thrown around so we use the brown recyclable paper to make sure they dont bounce around too much inside the box.

What in the world is a fiber brow product? I have actually never heard of this. O My small amount of tail hairs do actually grow downward in that direction.  I just try to follow the tail when I fill them in. Could this maybe do with the way that I pluck them? I dont pluck from the tail generally but I do pluck from the arch area. I try my best to follow whatever kind of natural brow shape I have but who knows if Im doing this correctly. Here is a picture of my brows before I tried to add any shape to them just plucked the middle. I found that I really didnt like how shapeless it naturally was too caterpillary and messy.

VIBs have to pay the minimum  purchase on products in store. you can buy whatever you want doesnt have to be what they put on you. You can definitely give them an idea of what you want! The artists at my store are amazing and super accommodating. You can bring in pictures as well.If you just want like a smokey eye or learn to contour thats called a mini makeover and its usually just one thing you can get done. This is free and lasts anywhere from  mins depending on what youre getting done. This is a free service but you may have to wait a few mins as it is done on a first come first serve basis. However anyone can get a mini makeover and youre definitely free to walk in and just ask for a smokey eye but generally the point of these mini makeovers is to help teach clients about products and how to apply them its not necessary a oh I really want a smokey eye look todayIm going to walk into sephora today and they can do it for me!.

Its a shame that you came here asking for advice and someone had to go and say something inappropriate.Regardless first of all youre absolutely gorgeous and the look you have going now definitely works for you.  Neutral colors that play up your natural features are your friend but I also know what you mean by feeling like youre in a makeup rut.You definitely have a good pout to rock some bold lips so at least youre not afraid to experiment that way.  If you incorporated some different shadow colors with your neutral smokey look I think that would really pop.  Green would be a fantastic color for you maybe even different shades of blue.Have you tried winged liner?  I know that its everyones goto look but if you tried it with a colored liner that could bring something different to the table.  Or using a colored liner to tightline and on the waterline would subtly add color.I hope this helps in any way and hope you get a chance to post some new looks!,MakeupAddiction,cllq809,1,t5_2rww2

2299423,0,t3_2lllbc,I have a similar box to the second from Sephora. The one you listed is basically what I have but on steroids.Im unsure what skin tone you are but the Smashbox BB Cream only comes in light. Light works for me but overall its a great BB! Im accustomed to the Lancome but I am very satisfied with it. This thing is worth . If you cant wear it a much loved girlfriend will definitely appreciate. The NARS Orgasm blush is incredible. Its also  on its own! Its a very sought after product that many women love. Notably a lot of women say its their goto. The STILA liner has become my daily and the tip is very easy to work with. This baby is like  or something. Personally I love the Sin eyeshadow as well. Ive only heard great things about the Porefessional too. However because I am accustomed to OPI or Butter London polishes I am not the hugest fan of Formula X.These are only the things Ive personally sampled  heard of. I would highly recommend the second option! Its a great variety of products that look good on almost all skin tones. Good luck!,MakeupAddiction,clvxbaw,1,t5_2rww2

And by liquid lipsticks that dry down do you mean like the Maybelline SuperStay  hour one?

2319510,0,t3_2luyx5,Whether or not you want to wear base makeup is up to you. I personally dont wear it every day but I like wearing it if I am wanting a more even base! Tinted moisturizer is what I find best for just evening out my skin without giving full on coverage that takes more work to blend out. If youre looking for a product recommendation my alltime favorite TM is by Laura Mercier which comes in one that is and one that isnt oilfree.Soft pencil eyeliners are really versatile Id recommend them. I have a somewhat similar style to you I usually go simple with a good bit of punk sometimes and smudged liner on the outer  of the upper lashline and outer  of the lower lashline is one of the more simple looks that I wear a lot. Colors other than black olive green brown plum gray navy can be used for a more subtle look. Paired with mascara its an easy way to play up the eyes.As for lip color I find that light peachy glosses are universally flattering. If you want some specific product recommendations post your price range in here and I can comment with some more. I hope this is helpful!,MakeupAddiction,clyelxt,5,t5_2rww2

2320248,0,t1_clyey4d, Ive been using and repurchasing it for a couple years now. Its light coverage if used sparingly and easily buildable to medium. It is a very juicy product though in the moisturizing sense so maybe steer clear if you are very oily. The finish is very dewy and skinlike. Lasting power is soso  hours on dry skin with setting spraypowder it can get up to  hours. Shade selection leans yellow as with all Nars bases. Im about NC now and need to mix Finland and Alaska.It is my favorite everyday base in FallWinter.

2415543,0,t1_cma3dw0,Ive tried both.  I think they are similar in texture but the Rimmel pencil is just slightly drier in consistency and for me that translates to having much greater staying power in the waterline.  I use the nude pencil for the lower waterline and it stays great.  Id really recommend giving it a shot before trying some of the higher price point pencils.  For another option if youre looking for a brownblack for upper tightlining give the NYX Slide On Pencils a look.  I think they are another lower price option that is extremely comparable to the UD  pencils.

2428030,0,t3_2n9hou,You have many vibrant colours happening all at once. I would try isolating the look with only warm or cool colours. A look I love to create myself is putting the orange on the central part of the eye and less in the inside corners. Since orange is so intense it needs to be blended out. So I like to use a light beige to fade from the inner corner out. Also adding a brown to the outside crease will add depth to the look. I do love the overall effect of the many colours. Adding the pink to the under outer lid and the lighter yellow instead of beige to the corner eyelids will add in the multi colour look you created in a different application. Keeping more of the darker products in the crease and less on top of that area will lift the eyes. ,MakeupAddiction,cmbt87p,17,t5_2rww2

2437239,0,t3_2ne3vi,I like to mix western and Korean style makeup. I do bb cream and a subtle gradient lip with young eyebrows... but sometimes I bust out graphic liner or a floating wing. I always have a neutral eye that varies to maybe a purple smoke on extreme days and matte taupe on boring days. I always use a light pearl as my base shade though. Im in love with a coppertaupe burnout at the moment. I always use brown liner I used to wear black but I like how brown blends with my eyes hair and brows. If I do a western lip its a brown cranberry or orange. Non gradient red without shine overpowers my face because I have full brows. The other shades I think are more understated for my complexion. I also feel bright red is a very classic or attention grabbing shade that is way overdone. I might do a matte red at a black tie event where it is called for but that is it.  I never use blush or contour. I dont care. I hate cheek makeup on me. Ill use highlighter on my cupids bow though and on my inner corners.

I will swear by my drugstore mascara.I will say that I did Luuurrrrvvveee the Chanel eyeshadow quads I got from her stash.  They were so buttery.  But I honestly dont care enough about buttery texture eyeshadow to spend Chanel money on them.  Maybe thats what it really comes down to  I love makeup but it really isnt my priority.

2444577,0,t3_2nic9a,Whats usually recommended is using a color corrector first. Since black eyes have more blue tones in them youll want to use a peachy color to counteract it like a warm yellow or orange concealer. Then you can layer a concealer or foundation over it that matches your skin. Always remember to go in small layers and blend  its easier to add than take away! Truthfully it may look a little odd to just have makeup on the one area though. Depending on how well you can blend everything out you may want to put on a layer to cover your whole face.

2489234,0,t3_2o3s56,Here are some examples of patchy lip products that I can remember seeing in the recent past. these are glosses but you can see the difference between how the good one versus the bad one behaves here is another one that shows the difference between better behaved lip products the top two and a patchy lip product the last onePatchiness often isnt consistent across an entire line of lipsticks  there will be some colors that behave better than others. Usually the shades that are trickiest are matte shades that are either very dark or very light  but dark semisheer glosses like Chanel Distinction also have their problems. I generally find that matte formulas are more prone to a patchy appearance than more satiny formulas  but this is by no means across the board true. Also  with careful application you can deal with patchiness in some lip products... It just means that you may have to work a little harder for the desired effect. The best example of this I can think of is my lipstick Smoked Purple from MAC  its a deep dark matte purple shade that is pretty tricky to apply and is quite patchy if you arent careful even with well prepped lips  using a less patchy shade of similar depth it takes me maybe  or so minutes to apply it carefully... Smoked Purple probably takes more around  minutes  learning to use a lip brush well is pretty helpful with patchy formulas.,MakeupAddiction,cmjhbyx,3,t5_2rww2

2503619,0,t1_cml79vk,Ive changed things somewhat mostly because Ive realized I can pretty much put any amount of goo on my face and it just sucks it up. So I put a lot of goo on my face and it sucks it up. Its actually nicer than when it was always scary to moisturizer anything but my eyes because it would cause breakouts. Ive always used eye cream and worn hats and while I was never a sun worshipper I worked outside a lot and did a lot of outside activities and for twenty years I drove at least k a year with no AC  the left side of my face is noticeably more damaged than the right.The biggest issues Ive found with aging and skin are that my neck is aging as well and for some reason that bothers me more than my face my eyelids get crepey if I put too much primer or product on them which complicates blending and my eyes are starting to hood more which coupled with crows feet complicates liner looks like wings. I have great anatomy for puppy dog liner though. That said Ive got fairly good about sunscreen the last few years and about five years ago discovered the Oil Cleaning Method and I use just drugstore stuff but Im pretty consistent with it. I dont use other cleaners or toners etc. Just oil chemical exfoliant and moisturizers.  I dont have the budget or the inclination to get into anything more intense or expensive than that. I have fair skin and decent genes. I have started using the exfoliating pads that rskincareaddiction raves about St Ives and the Olay resurfacing elixir as chemical exfoliation a couple of times a week and did notice a small improvement without anything coming off in chunks. Ive posted my mug here before both bare and made up but I dont tend to very often because of poor photo conditions in this house.

2527791,0,t1_cmohyey,The interesting thing when it comes to pin ups is that s were quite subdued when it comes to eye makeup with hardly any eyeshadow usually none outside the cinema and  no eyeliner but you get tons of pin up of artwork with a lot of contrast in the face that looks like winged eyeliner but its actually not. They compensated for lack of eyeliner and eyeshadow by having these neat and somewhat perfected brows it doesnt get quite as graphic as in the s with luscious thick lashes. They really went to town with mascara so it looks like they tightlined  considering that they used cake mascara  you can imagine that they really got into the very roots of the lashes. Couple that with several layers of mascara to build up thickness and you get an effect that looks quite a bit like eyeliner without actually using any.I am really perplexed about where the idea of red lips  black winged liquid liner being a classic pin upss look came from. This combination is really really popular these days and it is referenced as a classic but... there is no era where that combination was widely popular. The first mass media reference that uses this that I can think of is CryBaby and they are referencing greaser subculture that is in no way related to s or pin up.s was pretty much eyelinerless and the lip shape of choice was quite unique high in the outer corners and rather overdrawn a hunters bow but they did use every kind of red under the sun. Red lips were the thing of the era.s eyeliner was quite subdued and only started building in intensity and wing in the very end of the s when the pin up era was dying and while this era has the lip shape that we associate with classic pin up the lipstick shade of choice is pink. Towards the end of the s we do have some winged liner and thicker liner in play it is still pencil though but the lipstick shades are getting ever more pink and nude. s was also very eyeshadow happy pastels everywhere which you never see in the classic pinup images.Liquid eyeliner gets invented in the s and this lovely dramatic cat eye is everywhere but it is paired with less bright lip shades. Early s has a good reference for this sort of a look that we like to think of as something from  decades earlier than that  Brigitte Bardot. She didnt use quite bright red but these sort of dark pink and brickyorangey shades but her eyeliner is absolutely iconic.EDIT I think its bizarre that those meanies are now downvoting you.

2546249,0,t3_2otzwt,Im  and I swear by BB Cream its the only thing that looks natural on me! But it has to be an Asian brand one. They have healing properties my faves are made by Lioele  Beyond The Solution BB Cream and  Dollish Veil Vita in Gorgeous Purple. Love love love them can be worn with or without powder no primer needed and looks so freakin natural! Ive mentioned this before in another thread but Ill say again that many North American BB Creams are not much more than tinted moisturizer. Asian BB Creams contain healing properties and look lovely! Its awesome. Times when I DO need something with a wee bit more coverage I love Vichy Dermablend and the Translucent White loose powder. I also swear by Revlons Colorstay foundation for oilynormal skin...I have drycombo skin but after I wash my face and moisturize I immediately put the foundation on and it looks pretty amazing  There really isnt such a thing as big girl make up I dont think I think its more big girl brands like MAC Este Lauder Chanel that kind of thing...but I cant really say that either because all girls of all ages find their faves in nearly every brand! For example Ill happily shell out  or more for an awesome eyeshadow palette make up brushes or a delicious perfume. But the BB Creams mascara eyeliners blushes are everything to SUPER inexpensive drugstore brands to the higher end drugstore ones. I order my BB Cream from South Korea. It all depends on what you need to focus on the most. Im pretty fortunate like you not having acne issues even when I was young. I dont wear lipstick often only gloss or balm. My best feature is my eyes so I invest more in those...but its funny cause Ill use high end shadow and a favorite . mascara and . liner and you cant tell.

2569906,0,t3_2p6v18,Actual usage works well for reviews... that being said I have used all of these extensively but am kind of crappy about writing reviews.Original  it works. Thats really the best thing you can say about any makeup right? It goes on with little color for most skintones blends in well dries well. Helps eye shadows appear more pigmented but not as much as a white base helps shadow adhere and limits fade and creasing.Eden  kind of drying. I felt like it worked as well as the original in all ways EXCEPT fading. I felt like things faded a bit quicker with eden but still slower than without a primer. Honestly didnt see much use in this product over original unless you have oily lids it might help.Sin  I like sparkly primers as I love all things sparkly. Creases a bit easier than original but not horribly. Can be used as a base color which I really liked. Nice over original if you like shimmery looks if not avoid it.antiaging  this is the one Im about to pan right now actually. It is oilier Its not really oily Im jut not sure how to say it than original. Good for older andor dry skin. May have creasing issues if you dont let it dry which takes the longest out of all of the primers. It would be terrible for someone with oily lids. I cant say anything about antiaging properties but it is a bit moisturizing which helps a lot of older skin.

2584719,0,t1_cmvy1d7,This product took me a little bit of warming up to. I enjoy it overall. It can be worn alone if youre not using foundation just to mattify your skin. The tube will last you a loooong time. My tube is about  months old at this point after daily use because thats how much product you DONT need in order to cover your whole face. So what you do is squeeze a peasized amount on to your finger tips and then rub your finger tips together to warm it up. Then press it into the places that you need the product the most. Work quickly or in sections because it dries quickly. I also think it works great to prime my eyelids because my shadows crease all the time. My skin is pretty oily at times. I use half a peasized amount and press it onto my lids and apply my shadows normally... And it works wonders. I think its a great product and its absolutely worth the money because it will last a long time. It also doesnt contain any fatty alcohols or linalool which can break me out.

Might be worth a shot though! I would love to be able to sort the posts by category. Suggested tags off the top of my head Haul Swatches CCW FOTD PSA Question maybe call this Ask MUA? Reviews Tutorials Request maybe for someone to request a swatchcomparisontutorial.... maybe a Funny or Humor category to share that kind of makeup related stuff?

2599694,0,t1_cmxwan8,Youd buff or stipple instead of drag the brush. Dragging the brush makes foundation streak and no one likes that.

What made me spend more money this year was buying a flash shipping subscription from Sephora.In a normal year I spend closer to  on makeupskincarefragrance. I usually talk myself out of buying most of the things I want and only get the things I convince myself Ill definitely use a lot.

2626226,0,t1_cn1dhr9,I never made a comparison to systemic racism or discrimination it has already been thoroughly expressed in this thread. What had not been discussed is why pale white girls feel the need to do this crap which is because they feel diminished in their day to day lives. Explanations help everyone understand each other better.  Understanding why pale white girls want to feel accepted helps people see that the statements trying to relate comes from misguided compassion and empathy not hostility which helps us all work toward a better middle ground for everyone especially nonwhite women and men of all races. The best course of action is education of why these actions are neither compassionate nor empathetic not hostility toward someone just trying their best to be kind.

2674298,0,t3_2qmsea,Ive also heard great things about the Becca primer and I would suggest using a foundation that is longwearing. Also touching up with translucent powder during the day is a great way to control oil without ruining your face. I would also look into a setting spray which I find the most success with if I apply both before and after my face makeup.

2681867,0,t3_2qqu40,Honestly its really difficult to tell because of the lighting and how far away the pictures are taken. From what I can tell I think the brows are a little bit heavy and close together. I would create a little bit more space in between your brows and use a spooly to brush some of the product through so they dont appear as heavy. On picture  it looks like your contour is starting too high unless thats just shadows... again its difficult to tell from the lighting. You want it to be lower to define your cheek bones.Next time I would post some pictures from straight on in natural light it will make it easier to give CC.  ,MakeupAddiction,cn8n2dn,12,t5_2rww2

2699638,0,t3_2qyff1,Happy new year! From this pic it looks like youre doing fine with the Dipbrow although it looks like the color might be slightly warm for you. Cant tell for sure from these pics though so I would try to get more opinions about that in person if you can. I really like the idea of the orange and blue together although I would try to keep the orange more symmetrical on both eyes it looks like you might have applied more of it on your left eye. Im not sure how well the Mica primer is working the colors look a little unevenpatchy and it looks like it might have been hard to blend the edges of the colors together.

Honestly I find my Makeup Geek LOreal Infallibles and CS shadows to be the best in a collection with several high end palettes. Im buying indie MUG and CS stuff for the most part from now on. I just dont the the quality is justified for the price on a lot of high end palettes.

2728698,0,t3_2r948r,When it comes to doing bruises start right from the moment of impact. What caused the bruise? Did the person get hit with something bluntforce trauma were they struck with a fist are they clumsy as hell and did they run into an object like a countertop? Or maybe its a hickey and will have little speckles of petichiae across it from blood vessels bursting.Think about force and what parts of the bruise would have taken the biggest impact those areas will have the deepest degree of immediate bruising. Both the object that caused the impact and where on the body it is will affect this here is a crappy instagram picture of a bruise I did on a friend a couple years ago it was Halloween and I got bored. Then think about the age of the bruise how recent was this injury? As a bruise fades it starts out redblue with a yellow centre and deepens to purple then fades to green and yellow as the blood is broken down by the body. Be careful not to overblend and make sure you have a variety of sponges for blending coarser and finer sponges plus some qtips for detail work as well.

2756781,0,t3_2rnbjg,I am requesting some serious eyebrow help i have very sparse hairs NO it is not from over plucking or over waxing or over anything. This is them after not being waxed for way over  months. I have to get them waxed amp tinted so that they even show up at all. My beautician constantly tells me that i am a prime candidate for semipermanent eyebrows but i dont want that to be my ONLY option. Although i definitely would consider it. Some days i fill them in and i get so many compliments amp then i post on rMUA and am told they look badfaketoo harsh etc. I am just unsure firstly what shape i should be aiming for i love a very clean arched eyebrow but i am also really loving straighter eyebrows also amp secondly how i could fill them in to make them more natural. I tend to use Dip brow and some brow powdersgels too. Also could my eyebrows be anymore far apart? I also have wonky eyes.. hooded eyes and oilyacne prone skin. A huge forhead and a big crooked nose THANK YOU BEAUTY GOD SIGH but lets just focus on my brows for now!! Thank you ,MakeupAddiction,cnhfnq2,6,t5_2rww2
2757341,0,t1_cnhhej5,Im interested by your comment because you seem to be pretty rational about it and there are other subs about overweight people that are way worse.  Im not trying to get mad at your or accuse you of being hateful or anything.  However it just seems strange to dress it up as helping fat people when in reality its more just entertainment for the readers.  Its odd that a group of redditors would take on the task of sharing stories about fat people in order to help them realize the error of their ways.  If anything it seems like THATS a delusion in itself in order to justify gossiping about people.   Surely if you actually want to help overweight people there are better ways.  Reading that sub would probably just make an overweight person more insecure about how people perceive them and make them realize the judgments that people make before even meeting them.  But I dont know really because I just read only a couple posts so if you disagree I understand.,MakeupAddiction,cnhhyg3,3,t5_2rww2

A shot straight on was showing too much of the bottom of my nose. This way the picture is taken up by mostly lip and so its more focus on the color.Another tiny secondary reason is because my left front tooth is very slightly crooked and this hides it hahaha!

2789182,0,t1_cnl3u9c,A LOT of practice. Until you really get it its a difficult product to use. I have a dual ended brush I use one end is firm and angled while the other is like a small crease brush and I use the angled end for application and the soft end to soften the edges. What really was the hardest for me was finding the right shape. As you can see they grow in oddly and my features arent symmetrical. So after I spent so much time trying to make them match I tried just focusing on them as individuals. Then it just started to work. Brow wiz is fantastic for getting a more natural look or for a less pricey option try out the NYX brow kit. Its got  powders a wax a mini spoolie and mini angled brush. That kit is actually what really helped me.,MakeupAddiction,cnl4c8h,4,t5_2rww2

2796488,0,t3_2s1scw,I think something that will add a lot of dimension to your face is blush! Something that was already mentioned was that your foundation is a bit pink. Your skin looks like it has some olive tones so Id look for something with that. I believe Este Lauder has some good fairolive tones but it is high end. And just one tip with Dipbrow it helps a lot to use a very clean angled brush and to wipe the excess of on the cap before application. Youre doing great! ,MakeupAddiction,cnly85v,2,t5_2rww2

Its so hard for me not to buy things always especially when things are new. Then I got educated and addicted to skincare. I cant stop I dont necessarily need to stop but I need to find a way to chill out a bit. Anyone who works at sephora have any tips on how to not blow your money when you get off your shift?!

Signs of that include finding that makeup doesnt sit properly flakiness shiny forehead or other patches dryness worsening of skin problems. I honestly did exfoliants every day for months with good results...until I found that was just too much with only a few symptoms one of which was makeup. Now I do it only once max twice a week and my skin looks much better both withwithout makeup. Another thing is  is your cleanser pH skin neutral  or lower? If not it might strip your skin of oils and make it a pretty crappy canvas not to mention promote aging. ,MakeupAddiction,cnqpyld,2,t5_2rww2

2850870,0,t3_2slgmd,I think some insurances cover a allergin test. Maybe you could go tell them before hand what the problem is so they can test accordingly and get tested to see what it is. That way it might be easier to find a lipstick that will work for you? I googled hypoallergenic Lipstick and this looks like a good start to finding something that might work. Kind of expensive but that might be the trade off so you can wear lipstick.  ,MakeupAddiction,cns56ge,1,t5_2rww2
2852028,0,t3_2srqlx,Theres several ways to prevent this. . When you use a brush or sponge or anything only make the direction of the strokes got down.  No circles or anything.  .  Im assuming youre using the sponge right and just dabbing it over the skin and not dragging it? . Use a primer like Smashbox  only a tiny amount. When you put it on use your fingers  again going in a downward direction.  Use a damp sponge over top  think coats at a time..  The best thing I do on clients to prevent this along with the other tricks is use a setting spray. Not to be clich but fix is great for making everything settle and look like glowing skin.  Urban decay  model in a bottle.  NYXs and ELF make alright ones also. Hope this helped ?? Good luck ! ,MakeupAddiction,cns9xve,2,t5_2rww2
2852788,0,t3_2ss4vb,Lovely face! Im distracted a bit by your foundation it seems too yellow and matte which has an aging effect and just doesnt look right although it may only be visible in stark lighting. If I were you Id play up the youthfulness of your face make it a bit glowier highlighter? pinker lips and apply darker colors at the outer corners of the eye to create a sort of horizontal line that counters the verticality of the face. I put it in the place where theres a natural darkening of the eyelid. I have a similar face shape and eyeshadows can easily look too heavy! In fact you could look really natural and good forgoing the eyeshadow and just using liner or mascara.I wrote a bunch of text cause I got excited. Sorry if its too much!

I didnt used to think they could be that much better than midrange but Im now hooked on my Givenchy YSL Guerlain and Tom Ford.  Hourglass Mineral Veil primer  it took more than one of these samples before I could finally bite the bullet and shell out  for a base product that would need to be repurchased regularly but Im so glad I did. I ran out once and tried to go without  never again. YSL Babydoll mascara  this actually hooked both me and my mom since I ended up with  samples somehow. It gives a nice subtler effect so its a good everyday product for her and nice for me when Im going for a more toneddown overall lookand on the bad side Lancome Hypnose mascara  I ended up throwing this sample out so that Id never accidentally try it again it was truly THAT bad.

If you have an Inglot near you you can go in and swatch the shadows whereas you cant do that with MUG.  I have the MUG Ultimate palette and I love it but I wish it came with more transition shades.  If youre customizing your MUG palette you wont have my issues.  I was in the market for a cooltoned palette and since nothing out there caught my attention I turned to Inglot and Ive really been enjoying my  pan palette.  It cost about  U.S. with taxes made it while in NYC my MUG palette cost closer to  with shipping and exchange as Im in Canada.   Both have great quality however you get more product in an Inglot pan than MUG.  The price difference is barely  U.S.   Another point I prefer the sturdier packaging of the Inglot palettes to my MUG z palette.Hope this helped!

2943459,0,t1_co2lg7e,I used it for the first time two nights ago after thinking Wow Ive had this palette for months and Ive yet to touch this shade. If youre interested this is how I used it...I was practicing some girls night out makeup. I did a gold glittery shade Loreal Infallibe in Eternal Sunshine and Half Baked from the Naked palette on the lid used Naked as a transition shade and Gunmetal over Naked as a transition shade as well. Then a dark blue eyeshadow for the outer crease and V for a smoky effect. I never thought Id use Gunmetal but it really does make a nice blending shade. I think silver instead of gold for the lid would look good as well.,MakeupAddiction,co2onj7,4,t5_2rww2

2967183,0,t3_2u59dp,. Some people only have a camera phone to take photos of their makeup with. Theyre pretty crappy at capturing makeup properly in general particularly in natural light..

Ones who get paid thousands for a shot. Suddenly theyre just bad at taking photos in your mind?. Sure its irritating when people use photoshop to smooth their blemishes yeah. But the point of the sidebar explanation is to say that we can colour correct and make things look in the image as it looks in your mirror. Why post a pic of dull pink shadow when irl youre looking at a hot pink pigment on your lids in the mirror?. Sometimes things look photoshopped when they arent.

2971815,0,t3_2u72ef,I picked this up today too! Dont understand why I can buy the March issue in January but there we go.My thoughts nice cardboard outer packaging but the tube itself is a bit cheaplooking. Im curious to see what the fullsize tube looks like.I have short straight greasy lashes which refuse to hold a curl for more than a couple of hours. My biggest problem with mascaras is that  of them smudge leaving a black mark under my eye after a few hours and I do not have time to constantly scrub that shit off and reapply my under eye concealer. For reference the only mascara Ive found which doesnt do this is the Max Factor  Calorie one nonwaterproof but sadly it doesnt hold a curl so Im in the market for something which can do both.First impressions on the Roller Lash the formula is slightly dry quite black and the brush doesnt look like itll pick up too much product but this might be deceptive  I did end up loading up too much in my first coat and having to break my lashes up with a lash comb. The separation was pretty poor even on my second attempt when I was careful to not apply too much. It isnt clumpy but a couple of tiny black flakes have appeared under my left eye so especially if flakiness is generally a problem for you that might be an issue.The lengthening power is pretty good but not the best Ive ever seen though thats not really what I want most from a mascara. I always curl my lashes before applying so I dont know how much of this is really the mascara but right now the curl level is good. Usually my lashes will be straight as an arrow within a couple hours of application so well see how it holds up. Ill edit this in a few hours if anyone is interested in an update!,MakeupAddiction,co5wsm0,12,t5_2rww2

KVDs vampira is not representative of my brand and I would not keep on an employee who felt that KVDs vampira was appropriate to wear when acting in the aforementioned professional capacity as a representative of my business. its not a judgement call on the employee or a hark to respectability politics but its about making sure the employee knows that their cosmetic choices grooming and personal appearance all have to play second fiddle to professionalism when acting on the clock. this isnt a double standard or sexist expectation. same goes for men.

3012904,0,t3_2uo8ow,I havent read through all of the comments here yet but a really good route might be to spend about  on a makeup mirror  on a brush set and get her the Naked on the Run kit by Urban Decay.Many of the people on this sub agree that Urban Decay is good quality makeup and they make the extremely popular Naked palette series. In the Naked on the Run set you get blush bronzer and highlighter all face products  basic neutral eyeshadow colors eyeliner mascara and a natural pink lip gloss. It retails for . Each product in this kit is pretty universally accepted as good quality and I think this would make an excellent starter kit. It also takes a lot of the guesswork out of this for you. Heres a link If you wanted you could add on a light tinted moisturizer or BB cream which doesnt have to be matched exactly because its more sheer. Itll also let her freckles show through! I really like the Physicians Formula Organic Wear Tinted Moisturizer. Its very sheer you can find it at the drugstore and isnt too matte or too greasy for my normal skin.

3050618,0,t1_coe6lrd,These are a really interesting formula.  Straight away on your lips they arent completely matte but in a few minutes they dry down to a more matte finish.  They are really creamy so completely different feeling than the KVD Sephora and Limecrime type liquid matte lipsticks.  They feel more like a Mac Cremesheen or Satin finish so they have some slip.  Upside is they are really comfortable to wear downside they dont last as long  hours.  But they wear really well so even when they start to fade they dont look like a complete hot mess.  You can easily go over them with the tube without having to completely reapply.  I have three colors Nude Pink Razzberry and Crushed Plum.  Crushed Plum is probably the least matte out of the three.  ,MakeupAddiction,coe70u2,1,t5_2rww2

3064651,0,t1_cofmqup,Well admittedly I dont know the context of the seal beating. I never looked into it because I dont play WoW and I just dont care that much. Is it for food in the game? Are they enemies? I guess Id understand it in that sense. Otherwise I just dont like senseless violence against animals especially if it is graphic is it in this case? Obviously it would depend on the age of my non existent child anyway. Ive played games like Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption myself and the animal killing in those games makes sense to me because its for food or because theyre attacking you. I guess I cant say too much anyway because I dont have a child and I really dont know what kind of parent Ill be. for reference Im  and a full time student so Im cluelessJust to be clear I dont hate or want to demonize WoW or its players. Its just a game and unless they stated that they condone or encourage players to beat seals in real life I have no reason to. Im sure other games have worse things in them as well. Some parents wouldnt let their like maybe  year old kids play GTA for what I think are obvious reasons. But some would. Its just do I really want my child to see those things? If I had a kind that really really wanted to get into WoW and maybe had friends that play Id probably let himher.

I think the flower cosmetics lip chubby in mauve over would be a good brown leaning mlbb for you and doesnt really settle much. Their  velvet lip color petal kiss is also an option its a creamy matte  in a dusty rose kind of color but can settle into lines. If you want more creamy and high end the urban decay revolution lips in naked or native would also look great on you imo. Also didnt experience patchiness or settling into lines. For a berry in a creamy finish revlon colorburst lip butter in berry smoothie would look awesome on you too. Very hydrating. ,MakeupAddiction,cog4tqc,2,t5_2rww2

3083277,0,t3_2vg55d,I ended up placing an order with them when they opened shipping to Australia to see if any of the fuss was even partly founded. The handwritten note was kinda cute but then I noticed that my name was written on in a different and somewhat messy handwriting so I had a little chuckle at that. I only bought some Lippie Stix because Im not interested in eyeshadow singles or their uncustomisable palettes. The colour range is good and its nice that they offer some more unconventional colours that said its very much a case of you get what you pay for. Some shades perform well but the quality is really quite variable even with colours that share the same finish.  I really liked Lumiere and Brills but Pitch looked like Id smeared wet sewage onto my lips so very appealing. The lippiestix also smell a bit funky not completely offputting but some of them actually taste really unpleasant Im not... eating my lipsticks its just the residue that slips off into my mouth I swear!That aside Im so overly sick of people talking about how shady they are.  Holy shit people theyre just a well funded new business that had a successful albeit somewhat aggressive marketing technique it worked right?  So many people are talking about them.

I think a lot of people simply do not have a cleansing routine that actually gets all of their makeup off and that residual product buildup on their faces is what causes the breakouts. Or conversely they go way too harshscrubbywhatever on their routine and scourge their skin into unhealthiness. Everyone has to figure out the right routine for them but I realized a while back my normal routine wasnt cutting it when one morning I used a makeup wipe on my unmadeup face just to refresh it and it came off fully flesh toned from all the foundation Id thought Id gotten off the night before.

People do use highlight type makeup under their eyes.Power brows arent really a thing although its fairly common for people to use eyebrow mascara to color them to match the hair color if its dyed.

3197766,0,t1_cotbpdu,I clean my brushes one at the time so no soaking or any of that. But I take the brush by the handle run just the bristles under the sink put a dot of baby shampoo or ELF brush cleaner on my hand and swirl the brush around on my hand. Then I keep swirling the brush on my hand while under the running water at an angle so the water doesnt hit the ferrule and it is juuust hitting the bristles and my hand and I wait for the water to run clear then move on to the next brush. One of the biggest things to make sure of is not to ever turn the brush bristleside up while its wet. This is to prevent the water from running down the ferrule which could cause the glue to loosen bristle fallout and could start to cause mold growth if water gets trapped. I dry my brushes by laying them on a towel on my sink and I put a rolled up towel on one end which is the end the handles would lay so that my brushes can dry at an angle at an angle and I dont have to worry about hanging them up or anything to dry. Ive had some of the same brushes for years and Ive kept them all in great shape this way. I really hope this helped! ,MakeupAddiction,cotg54k,4,t5_2rww2

I do some amateur modeling and when I do my makeup for the camera the power brow is AMAZING and really works for the type of pictures we take.However whenever I do my makeup to go out with my boyfriend he always looks at me funny when I ask how my brows look hes my consistency check when I do my makeup LOL and he ALWAYS says they are too thick in the middle. Ive started doing the power brow and then softening the inside edges a bit to make them look a bit more natural. I definitely agree with you that sometimes tho the technique for the brow is On Point the look doesnt quite match the features of the wearer and something much softer would look more natural and flattering. Good point Ill definitely be thinking of this next time I give my CC.,MakeupAddiction,cowuzss,2,t5_2rww2

For foundation I would go with Nars Sheer Glow and invest in a good pressed powder compact or oil blotting sheets to blot away any oils that seep through. I preferred my beauty blender for Sheer glow because my skin microexfoliates with a brush. But I do think a flat buffer brush would work perfectly fine.

Your very edgy hair style competes for attention with the eyes lips and blush. A much more neutral look with a lip that picks up a little of the pink from your hair would help people see you and not just your makeup. I like the brows  they are strong and edgy like your hair style but I would like to see you with a much simpler and lighter eye much less blush and a nude pink lip.

3282327,0,t1_cp1lpre,Tinted. Lip. Balm. Im on a nolipstick regime because I over exfoliated my lips and now theyre all cracked and dry and I dont want to irritate the open wounds with makeup. I completely empathise with feeling so frustrated with it picking out my lipstick in the morning was one of my favourite parts of the day. So I treated myself to a new tinted lip balm specifically Burts Bees in Red Dahlia. I love it its so moisturising and smooth but it also adds a nice vampy tint to my lips without getting into the splits and cracks and irritating them. Benefit Clinique and Dr Paw Paw are a few more brands with some good reviews on their tinted balms and if youre looking for something to help them heal up the ladies over at rSkincareAddiction recommended any product containing lanolin. You can buy the stuff straight its normally marketed to breastfeeding mothers as a nipple cream but its a heavy duty bigguns moisturiser that supposedly works wonders on dry lips.

Does exactly what it says and just looks soo flirty and feminine and whispy and pretty on my lashes LOreal telescopic. This really lengthens and I achieve falsielike lashes if I use this after using voluminous at the base of my lashes LOreal butterfly. This is probably my favourite stand alone. Ugh this or voluminous I love both. This gives volume and length and the shape of the wand really helps give the whispy look to your outer lashes. Can you tell I love LOreal?

3312389,0,t3_2y3ax9,I have super thinsparse brows and naturally black hair but for some reason because of how thin my hairs are they look a lot less black and sometimes I can get away with using a pencil meant for much lighter haired folks.  I personally prefer super thin pencils that let me draw in hairlike strokes and then I brush them out with a thin spoolie ABH Brow Wiz amp NYX Micro Brow are my two fave pencil types.  For the tail part which is almost nonexistent for me I draw a solid but not too hard line and let the spoolie do the work of making it look more natural.  Sometimes I have to add a little more product in case it blended all away and then brush again to my liking.  When I have time I also use my pencils in conjunction with a brow pomade or mousse like dip brow and the Tarte mousse and always always brush it out.  If Im really feeling like I want thicker looking brows I occasionally add brow powder Brow Bar ToGo on top of the other products and brush.  Im also a big fan of the MUFE brow gels and NYXs version.  Basically no matter which method I go with I always use a thin spoolie to brush it out so that it doesnt look super fake.  I know it sounds like I use every type of product but I have left out wax.  I have a wax pencil but I never use it anymore now that I use gels and dip brow for the more liquidy part.   I used to use the ELF kit that came with wax as well but I never figured out how to use it so I stopped.  When I have little time to get ready and just need to get brows on I just use one of my pencils and start drawing about .cm from the inner part of my brow... brush it outwards through to the tail and then brush the inner part of my brow with leftover product to get a more natural look.  Then Im pretty much done and I dont normally have to touch them up. ,MakeupAddiction,cp5u9bf,1,t5_2rww2

I would do it just so that other buyers can beware but if not you can always write a review on the product page telling buyers about that specific seller. I refuse to buy beauty products from third party sellers on amazon.  Theres way too much risk when it comes to makeup and fragrances. If youre unfortunate to never have owned the product you can easily be ripped off because you would never know the difference. It kind of pisses me off that Amazon has such poor quality control when it comes to third party sellers on their site. You read so many reviews from people about buying knockoffs on their site. Does Amazon have any type of banning system when it comes to shady third party sellers?On a side note I bought a Benefit set at Sephora this past Christmas that had three of their full sized lip balms and three of their deluxe sample sized tints for . I couldnt figure out from reviews if people were using it more as a lip tint or a blush so I went the lip route and was terribly disappointed.

And THEN as I was getting in his stretch my friends fianc ran out of the church after me and proposed to me right there on the spot.

3382551,0,t1_cpcd0ej,Thank you so so much for all the advice!! I really appreciate it and it is all so helpful. I think the eyeliner did end up a little bit thick on the outer corners and Ill keep that in mind for the future. I get such a nice clean line in the beginning and then it gets a little thick on accident at the ends because I cant see as well when Im doing that part haha. I am currently looking for a better blush! Thats just the one I have for now and it works reasonably well. I found that I could not get a good picture of the blush though. It showed up just fine in person but in pictures no matter the lighting I could not get it to show up. Ive gotten some recommendations though and there are a few blushes Im going to swatch soon to see if theyll work so that is definitely something Im keeping in mind. Thanks for the lip color advice!! Ill try to find a peachier color and play around with the blush too once I get a better one. Bronzer will be next on my list and thak you so much for the recommendation! Ill swatch that one when I go to Sephora next. Again thank you so much for all the advice! ,MakeupAddiction,cpdu4ra,2,t5_2rww2

I know some people only go high end if a product is like a super unique color they cant find at a lower price point or super revolutionary applicationformula method so I totally get it! On me Mac lipsticks always end up drying out and flaking or chipping after a few hours. The audacious lippies on me wear down evenly so after a few hours the full effect might not be around but I have something that looks like a stain or a sheer of the original color rather than something patchy.

Its a nicely dry formula the total opposite of Maybelline. The regular version separated my lashes held the curl I had created and gave good volume. The waterproof version made my lashes clumpy after about a week or two.  I think wand is shaped slightly differently for each type of formula but the difference isnt major as theyre both rubbery wands with a mix of short and long bristles. I didnt use the flower shaped tip at all.

3500789,0,t3_30d2g3,In the UK Boots No  Stay Perfect Lip Lacquer is really good for staying power. I moisturise lightly before I use it and then theres two parts to the actual lip colour  the pigmented lacquer and a clear sticky gloss. Its important to initially seal the lacquer with the clear gloss even if you dont want glossy lips later because I find that when I dont it becomes prone to wear. The gloss wears off pretty quickly and youre left with a matte lip that doesnt budge.I wore it to my friends wedding at the weekend and it was still fully intact after two meals including some relatively oily foods like pastries and several drinks water hard cider champagne. I put it on at .pm before the ceremony and it was still there when I went to remove it at pm after the reception and party.It has a limited range with only about six or eight shades in redbrownpinks but Sweet Pink is a nice strong coolish red despite the name. In the bottle it has a faint shimmer but thats not at all evident once its on my lips  it looks flat and matte as can be.,MakeupAddiction,cprbcdq,1,t5_2rww2

While that might be what many of your clients are looking for Id be willing to bet there are plenty of others who want more subtle looks. Im sure you already know this from your work as a MUA but make sure you consult with each client first to get an idea of what they really want.  Dont treat clients with kid gloves. Thats something Ive heard the trans community on this and other makeuprelated subs say a lot  peoples attempts to be extra super nice usually come off as condescending and arent always helpful. Be polite of course just not patronizing.Congrats on the job!

3535670,0,t1_cput9sq,Cameo has a slight pink tone to it as well and may help with neutralizing your foundation while still looking super natural. Id say its pink enough to even out slightly yellow foundation as I use it to even out a yellowish concealer. So you could totally go for it if your foundation is just a tad bit off! If its really yellow Id suggest the other powders with more pink. But be careful not too get too rosy haha. ,MakeupAddiction,cpvafls,2,t5_2rww2

3557348,0,t3_30uqda,Sephoras applicationinterview process has changed in the past year or so. In the past you would go through  interviews just to go through the management hierarchy and if youre a personality fit youre hired. Now you have .the prescreen over the phone interview .the group interview .the one on one interview with the store director store manager . And lastly your artistry interview with the Color Specialist where you show your skills on a model. The great part about the artistry interview is its not about you having to be a professional makeup artist they arent worried about technique or terms its all about interacting with your client and communicating and completing a look eyelip or complexion effectively in whatever timeframe they give you. Sephora is all about personality!! MACs interview process is a little shorter and theyre a little bit more particular about the amount of skill or at least what the finished product looks like rather than personality being a huge factor. You must show them that you can turn a daytime look into a nighttime look all the while showing that you can sell sell sell! Alas its not as scary as it all seems.

I have two bunny rabbits who look like they rolled in a Naked palette. My interest is face and body paint I used to paint professionally until illhealth forced me to stop so I tend to contribute more to facepaint posts simply because thats what I can help with. Originally I joined MUA to get better at normal makeup and its been very useful Ive picked up a lot. I do not have any reddit modding experience even though I mod a sub  I found preexisting communities related to the sub I took over and decided to participate there rather than pushing a new sub with the same idea.

For me makeup is a creative outlet I once pondered a career in it but have chosen a different path Its FUN for me to experiment with makeup and see myself improve and share with others what Ive done because I think people might actually be interested! I find it offensive that im finding anything negative about my post aside from encouraged CCW? Im in no way NOT posting to get recognition for my looks and I find it degrading and quite shallow for someone to point that out in a sense its bullying.If you look back at my previous posts I believe youll find that I have progressed with my makeup skills and have tried out a number of different looks. I post on reddit because I feel like Ive found a makeup community that is a supportive creative network to be involved in. I genuinely LOVED this makeup look so sorry if I did something wrong here?

I prefer to dot foundation on my face first but you could dot the foundation onto the sponge then onto your face if you want. Use a pattingbumping motion to apply and blend your foundation.

Ive never regretted it though I did my research and heard tons of horror stories about blurringfadingturning blue and greenetc. I did ask my tattoo artist about the blurring issue and she was like well were doing a soft fill anyway you dont even HAVE fine hairlines that are going to get blurred anyway. Its all under my natural eyebrow hairs so even then a little blurriness would be pretty well concealed. She also mentioned that she used specialized permanent makeup inks not regular tattoo ink. She also used a dark brown shade not black so there was little chance of it getting ashy over time.

In support of your wishlist though my first KA scupting powder lasted me over a year with near daily use.

3602824,0,t1_cq2xj38,An extremely large portion of people carry Staphylococcus aureus on their skin without ever knowing it or ever developing a serious staph infection requiring treatment. This number also includes MRSA  though much fewer people actually carry this organism since its much less prevalent outside of hospital settings  my general understanding is that hospital workers are much more likely to carry MRSA than someone who does not work in a hospital.Staphylococcus aureus is somewhat of an opportunistic pathogen meaning that it doesnt always behave as one  but when conditions present themselves it can establish an infection which can end up pretty nasty this is another reason why you see more staph infections in hospital settings or in elementary schools  the sick the elderly and the very young are generally much more vulnerable.

None of those are going to give you makeup only though so be prepared for hairskin items. Wantable has a fully makeup box so thats an option if you arent open to other items. Ipsy is nice but a lot of the makeup you get are neutral colors and the quality can be hit or miss. For  dollars its not that bad though.

I bought it because I wanted a base starter kit and Ill go through and replace it with higher quality brushes as I go. The stippling brush really changed my foundation. Also it sounds like you need to change your choice in foundation. If youre at all dry those mattifying foundations are going to cake and look not so good on your skin. Those long last makeups are really more for combination normaloily to oily skin. All the foundations Ive tried that have staying power all those with dry skin complained in the comments that it looked flakey and cakey thats sorta how I know those foundations are perfect for me lol my oily skin evens it out and makes me dewy rather than cakey,MakeupAddiction,cq60rad,3,t5_2rww2

I can get the same results even if she were using the product it was applied by professionals and it probably took way more time to get looking just right than Id have in a typical morning.

3709423,1,t1_cqf0oe4,My point is simply that whats Professional is solely Professional because the people in power say it is and thats a standard that is biased towards the people in power who until very recently have been White and Male. Thus the question of Professional fucking sucks for anyone not White and Male. If we collectively lost our minds tomorrow and decided that being naked was Professional that would suddenly be the Norm that made you look like you had enough money to make money. Basically what we have right now is a society where being Very Womanly means coming across as unserious and unintelligent. What does that say about how society perceives Woman? Saying I cant change that isnt strictly true. We can have these conversations. We can use them to expand our understandings. We can take these expanded understandings out into the world. It does no one any good to say that diversity is a Good Thing but restrictive Professional Codes that enforce a White Male Norm just cant be changed. ,MakeupAddiction,cqf3lm0,0,t5_2rww2

Went out again today with no eyeliner and once again forgot about it after a couple of minutes of worrying.So yea definitely a gradual process thatll happen when youre ready.

3802304,0,t3_33tzpv,I have tried almost everything out there. Every time I find something thick and pigmented enough it ends up creasing. Someone recently mentioned on this sub using MAC Paint Pots for this so I tried it. It works for me!Right after I put on primer I dab Painterly under my eyes and apply foundation over it. It covers dark circles and keeps my makeup from creasing. Painterly is close to my skin tone but there are other skin tone shades.Edit I do also like Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer. I prefer MAC Painterly because it keeps the area more matte which keeps my mascara from smudging under my eye at the end of the day. If you tend to have a heavy hand with concealer the Nars concealers will crease a bit on you. Fortunately they are quite pigmented. However Nars concealers are truly gorgeous.

3823603,1,t3_347v1r,Ill go ahead and paste my rant about Ultarave about Sephora that I posted earlier.gtThe first time I went to Ulta I was new to makeup and didnt really know a whole lot. No one said hi to me how are you doing anything. I was looking at the Melted lipsticks by Too Faced and I couldnt find anyone to help me. I had to walk to the front cash register and ask for someone to help me and was told that someone would be with me soon. So I returned to the lipsticks and eventually a woman came up to me and asked me if I needed help because I looked confused. That was that.gtThe second time I went in about a week ago deciding to give it another chance because I was going to look for NYXs Taupe just to see if maybe it was in stock. No one looked at me when I came in so I had to wander around until I found the NYX display. Then the blush display was only numbered no names and I was so lost. I had to literally chase someone down to help me and ended up leaving with an UD eyeshadow instead for contour that I could have just gotten at Sephora. When I went to check out and the woman asked if I wanted a card I told her no that I usually shop at Sephora. She then proceeded to not look at me and when she handed me my bag and said thank you she looked at the woman behind me the entire time and refused to refer to me. I felt like a piece of dog shit on the bottom of her shoe it was genuinely horrible.gtThe sales associates that Ive always finally gotten to help me have always been wonderful but getting help and all of that fun stuff is always a pain in the ass. When I walk into Sephora they smile at me and ask me how Im doing and if I need any help. I literally spent upwards of half an hour a few days ago just chatting with the girl at the register because it was slow and she had nothing to do. Maybe its because Im Rouge but the man that works at the store is constantly handing me free samples of things that I just look at and he gives me point perks for free even without asking for it.gtI know Ive rambled but no one in my family seems to care when I complain about my dumb makeup so it just feels good to type it out.         ,MakeupAddiction,cqs4fxc,-1,t5_2rww2

Check out the Anastasia Brow Wiz its my holy grail eyebrow pencil. Eye primer will revamp any drugstore eyeshadow you have check out Too Faced Shadow Insurance or Urban Decay Primer Potion. Concealer isnt AS important as foundation but nice concealer will usually have a wider color range and last longer than drugstore. Nice eyeshadow is totally worth it! The pigmentation is totally different my favorite is Urban Decay. Contouring just seems to look more natural and be easier to blend with better products in my experience YMMV. Midtohigh end eyeliners seem to last longer with a few drugstore exceptions I like Stila for both pencil and liquid. And lastly Ive found that drugstore and nice mascaras work basically the same so I wouldnt necessarily splurge on this. If you did want to splurge Id go for Benefits Theyre Real otherwise just buy Covergirl Lash Blast seriously that stuff is amazing!.Lastly its important to consider investing in your skin as opposed to makeup. Check out rskincareaddiction for your issues with redness you may find that you dont need to splurge on base products if your skin already looks flawless!,MakeupAddiction,cqtv5vc,1,t5_2rww2

3842104,0,t3_34ftja,I was subscribed to glossybox for a little over a year their customer service kind of sucks. But that being said I did always receive my box even if it was a bit late. If you are curious about the issues I had here you go. I received an eyeshadow that was broken emailed customer service and was assured that a new one would be sent to me asap. I never received it and didnt press the issue more because it was just a black eyeshadow and I didnt really care about getting it. The other time I had just moved and the post office refused to deliver my glossybox because my name wasnt on the mailbox yet... Contacted the post office to resolve the issue and then contacted glossybox to see if they could resend the box once they received it since it had been returned. Instead they sent me out a new box right away which was awesome but they sent it to my old address. That address wasnt even on my profile anymore so I dont even know where they got it from. So basically their CS is somewhat incompetent and I wouldnt expect much from them. Also had a problem with a discount code not working they resolved the issue but they were quite rude throughout the process. ,MakeupAddiction,cqu8fbm,3,t5_2rww2
3843052,0,t1_cqu1259,I know I wish primers werent so necessary. Another thing that it could be is your moisturizer making it separate. Make sure your moisturizer has really absorbed into your face maybe for atleast  mins before you put on your primer. My foundation would pill up and get all weird and smeared when I wouldnt let my moisturizer absorb.

3894502,0,t1_cqz9z4r,Im an NW and I recently splurged on it. I use a synthetic RT brush to apply it. Its a lovely luxury product and would be great for beginners its almost impossible to overdo very buildable. Personally I love the smell and packaging its my first Chanel product but I would advise trying to get it duty free as it worked out to be the same price as a Mac bronzer that way. I use it to layer under powder bronzer and it gives a lovely glow. Jaclyn hill has an in depth video on how to use it for cream contouring  personally its too orange for that but it gives a good overview on it,MakeupAddiction,cr07h0h,1,t5_2rww2
3895037,0,t1_cqznv8m,I agree with you wholeheartedly on Essie. Theyve come out with some of polishes recently but the vast majority of their polish is watery garbage that is too sheer and chips if you look at it wrong or too thick and gloopy its not even worth wasting thinner on. Their glitters are good Ill give them that and you cant fuck up glitter too much that applying with a sponge wont fix but Ill only buy Essie on sale and only for watermarbling. There are plenty of other salon brands that are worth the money OPI China Glaze ORLY why Essie is a top brand will forever confuse me.

3909852,0,t3_35718i,Im in marching band and honestly I never wear much makeup during marching season. Id end up sweating it all off. At least for band camp Id suggest not wearing face makeup except for maybe some concealer. Even with setting spray I think youd sweat it off during the hottest days in the afternoon I had sweat dripping into my eyes it was so bad. But for other times depending on what instrument you play make sure you keep foundation away from your mouthchin area. Or try it once just to see. But Ive found that even when wearing something light like BB cream if I play my instrument trombone the mouthpiece leaves a mark that doesnt go away it looks like you have a mustache. No one told me that would happen haha. So yeah if you have a brass mouthpiece pay attention to that. While marching with a brass instrument because of the horn angle and condensation and whatnot I have water coming out of my mouthpiece anyway and getting on my face so I could never wear makeup really. Its pretty common to finish playing and look over and see all the brass players wiping their mouths haha. What can I say marching band is pretty sexy haha.

3925089,0,t3_35ctic,I have one deep crease under my eye that my concealer loves to hang out in so I developed a technique to prevent creasing. I start by applying an eyeshadow primer I use the urban decay antiaging one under my eyes and then I apply my concealer in the usual under eye area then I blend the concealer out and up to my lower lash line with a fluffy brush or BB. This gets the concealer under my eye but avoid applying too much product where the crease is.  I then leave the concealer alone for a minute or two this lets the concealer move around and usually it will crease where there is too much product after its creased I will use my BB or brush to blend out the creasing so there isnt too much product where the creasing is. After this I set the concealer with either a powder foundation or a setting powder. I do this with a flat brush or a beauty blender. This turned into a wall of text. Im not sure if this was well explained maybe a pictorial would be more helpful. ,MakeupAddiction,cr3p2jj,2,t5_2rww2

3978294,0,t3_35yv6g,I think the most important aspect of aging up with make up is contouring. You are really beautiful and your bone structure is strong contouring could bring that all to life in ways that would surprise you. My nose is wider than yours so I always sweep some matte bronzer down the sides of my nose to slim that bad boy down. I press a business card to my cheekbones to get a nice clean line that I blend upwards. I also apply it to my temples into my hairline my jawline under my chin and usually down onto my neck to make it look uniform. I recommend Park Avenue Princess Amazonian clay matte bronzer by Tarte its  at Sephora and I like an angled brush for that.

4018841,0,t3_36ibhx,I have dark circles too and Im Indian as well. Honestly I think your best bet is to buy a color corrector AND a skin colored concealer. Bobbi brown color correctors are  at sephora and you can get color matched there. They have a good formula and a nice color range to get the exact corrector you need. And the maybelline fit me concealers are supposed to be a great dupe for the NARS Radiant creamy concealers and are way cheaper though there is less of a shade range but for normal indian skin you can find one that will work there. The Maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealers are also supposed to be very good. Ive found that concealers alone unless they are SUPER thick and pigmented will allow grey to show through.Bottom line corrector AND concealer in conjunction will help the most. ,MakeupAddiction,credmrt,3,t5_2rww2

What are you using right now?For drugstore NYCs liquid liner is amazing! Its a brush liner though which I find difficult but how black it is and how well it sets is worth the trouble. Also you could try Stilas stay all day liners which are great. If you really want to use a pencil I like Jordanas easyliner and their gel liner. Also revlons colorstay.

You could try using more concealing foundation on those areas of your face where the freckles arent then blend in OR you could use a lighter hand when applying your foundation.

4060640,0,t1_crj48ch,Ill give you some recommendations based on different price points. Blush is my favorite kind of makeup product so sorry if this is crazy long.     Drugstore The Sleek blushes are pigmented have a nice color selection and great wear time. Milani blushes are a beautiful product in quality and aesthetically. If you can get your hands on them the Max Factor Creme Puff Blushes are some of my favorite blush formulas for an everyday look. They are easy to use and dont fade all day. Stilazzi Blushes are also fabulous and the price is even better. They have a huge color range are good quality and are only  a piece.      MidRange NARS is heralded for their blush for a reason. They are intensely pigmented and have a huge flattering color range. Illamasqua makes some incredible products. The texture of the powder blushes is absolutely lovely and the pigmentation is ridiculous. Sunday Riley makes my favorite blush of all time which is Blushing. It is the most wearable and natural looking blush Ive ever come across and it goes with everything.      HighEnd Surratt blushes are just fantastic and one of the best newer products on the market. The formula and texture of the powder is unique and unmatched in its smoothness. The shades are pigmented and long wearing. Tom Ford makes some killer blushes if you like ones that arent completely matte. The whole product just feels luxe from the compact to the logo imprint on the powder.    Luxury My favorite blush product of the moment is the Le Metier de Beaute Cheeky Chic Kaleidoscope. The kaleidoscopes are one of the coolest products I own and the quality on them is a stand out. The products are perfectly pigmentednot hard to work with and not needing to be built up or blended out and create a beautiful wardrobe of blushes to travel with. Sisley also makes one of my favorite formulas for a stiffer blush. I love them for lighter days when I want to look like Ive got a slight natural flush going on. They can be built up to a higher pigmentation as well and have lasted through a overnight plane ride for me.   ,MakeupAddiction,crj55mv,26,t5_2rww2

4080039,0,t1_crlaciz,I can see your logic behind this argument but I dont think its applicable in this situation.The style of multiple bindis is a Hindu bridal tradition. This is a fact not an opinion.The white models wearing this style of bindi as presented in the post are not Hindu brides. I think we can all agree that this is a fact.Googles definition of cultural appropriation says that it is the adoption of elements of ones culture by members of a different cultural group especially if the adoption is of an oppressed peoples cultural elements by members of the dominant culture. This is another fact not anyones personal opinion.The white models dominant culture are adopting elements of Hindu culture different amp oppressed cultural group. Uethiosbird gave an example of oppression of Hindu people by white people dotbusters in the above wiki article. Again these are all facts. The dissenting opinion of one or a few Indian friends does not suddenly make all these facts invalid. Maybe that one Indian friend personally chose to not be offended but the fact that this is a clear case of cultural appropriation is still true. Cultural appropriation is racist whether it is intentional or not.This is more than individual opinion vs. opinion. I think that is the flaw in this argument.,MakeupAddiction,crlcm4n,4,t5_2rww2

I especially remember there was a post on Tarte foundations because there were a bunch of shades from light to medium and it didnt reach the darker end of the spectrum. The thread was created for darker people complaining that they had a hard time finding foundation shades because many companies such as Tarte dont make shades dark enough for them.

4103810,0,t1_cro1rle,Yeah its definitely a tad too dark investing in a white foundation is never a bad thing! Stargazer has some MAC Make Up Forever and Lifes Entropy not sure about your undertone though since I cant see much of your necks coloring.   But Im guessing your undertone might be a bit more pinkish or neutral  to figure out I bought LOreal True Match in W N and C and just tried to make them all work. Sometimes Im N and sometimes Im W mixed with C but in the end Ive concluded Im a neutral not too pink and not too yellow.However having that said  love your eyebrows and eyelashes wanted to say whiskers lel,MakeupAddiction,cro2579,3,t5_2rww2
4104208,0,t3_37n2xh,Lipstick for sure. Im not super into tints or balms because I find they wear down quickly and Im having to constantly reapply them  but there are some sheerer types of lip products that do stick a little bit better. Im a big fan of Diors Fluid Sticks  they can be applied in a thin layer for bright tints or applied in a thicker layer for something thats basically full on opaque. I also really enjoy the Asianinspired gel type of lipstick formulas out there  they feel nice and balmy but theyre still sheer and easy to wear compared to lipsticks aside from in the darker shades  examples of these would be Chantecailles Lip Chics Surratts Lipsliques Innisfree Creammellow Lipsticks Sonia Kashuk Shine Luxe Lipsticks MAC Huggable LE but many colors still available CK One Shine Lipsticks and Lancomes Shine Lover lipsticks though these are a slightly thinner texture. Another option would be lip stains  but Im not really into these are I find them drying and uncomfortable but they can look really natural and lovely. I also find keeping myself really well hydrated helps keep a little more color in my lips... but its really not enough. ,MakeupAddiction,cro3rv3,2,t5_2rww2

4261950,0,t3_39s6pa,I think ultimately it depends on how in depth you want to be with it. For me I focus mainly on face and eyes. I dont do any of the contouring because its just too much work in my opinion and for me too much in general. MWhat was mentioned above was correct. Youll want to do moisturizer primer foundation then powder. I find that powder doesnt work well for me so I skip it. As for the eyes brushes are so important and really do make a difference. Youll want to get primer for your eyes as well so your eyeshadow doesnt crease. As for brushes I really love my Mac  and  for blending and crease work. I also found that a flat kabuki brush works fairly well for when applying liquid foundation but its really a pick what works best for you. Hopefully Sephora is helpful. Good luck!,MakeupAddiction,cs61gpi,2,t5_2rww2

4355070,0,t3_3av5hw,RAVE Im seriously not a huge fan of Urban Decay generally but this weekend I impulse purchased their Ultimate Ozone Primer Pencil kinda on a whim  it was  bucks and I liked the textured on my hand so I figured why not? Its definitely not the same as their clear lip liner only bigger  it has kinda a tacky but moisturizing texture sorta reminds me of things like the MAC huggables in terms of tackiness only the UD pencil is less emollient. It definitely works great as a primer under the lipsticks Ive tried it with Guerlain Kiss Kiss a few Dior Fluid Sticks MAC Huggable and a Guerlain Rouge G  but I also noticed that they recommended it as a primer for blemishes before concealing. And oh man this stuff DEFINITELY helped me look almost human this weekend  I had a recovering breakout on my chin that had gotten to the dryflaky point where concealer begins making things worse but I also had a weekend coming up where I had to be photographed. This stuff really helps glue the flaky bits in place so the concealer and lay down smoothly on top of it and stays in place. My skin still looked presentable after three hours of dancing outside in  humidity at a wedding it also helped my lipstick stay on through the meal which is awesome with emollient lipsticks that I love. I now have one explicitly for priming for concealer and another for my lips. RANT Wet N Wilds foundation colors are pretty inconsistent. Ive purchased Coveralls in fair now that are yellow and others that are pink. Its incredibly frustrating given that the yellower one works well for me with a little white whereas the pink doesnt work at all. ,MakeupAddiction,csgjs5c,12,t5_2rww2

Car accidents motorcycle accidents and X year old patient unresponsive is not breathing CPR in progress definitely top the list. It is not for everybody. There is a lot of gore and you hear a lot of last breaths. That being said it is by far the most rewarding thing Ive ever done in my life. If you got through the previous statement saying yeah I think I could handle that then visit your closest firehall immediately and start filling out your application. Firefighter fitness sucks. Working out everyday sucks in general but you gotta do it. I took the firefighter bootcamp course  weeks every day as opposed to a semester long class once or twice a week as one of three girls. Im a small person lbs at  so I really really had to bust my ass to catch up to all the guys I was working with. BUT I graduated at the top of my class in fitness skills and testing.

4397380,0,t1_cslbdb2,A couple of things  oh my god that sounds absolutely horrific and awful I cannot imagine what tissue paper rotting inside your nose would even be like  as to why not actually blow your nose because of the foundation rubbing off. If you look in the picture you can see where OPs current use of tissues is rubbing off her makeup which she finds undesirable I think the reason uscrambledeggsbacon is suggesting the more absorbent the tissue the better is because you roll up the tissue push it shallowly into your nostril and hold it there for a bit to try and absorb the mucus. Not having allergies myself I cannot speak to the runniness of an allergic nose but I know I use a very similar technique to the one described above when Im sick roll tissue put slightly in nose blow gently remove and dab at nose w clean part of tissue and it works very nicely.

Another good one if you can find them are LA Colors they have a brush duo that is like a shader brush and small blending brush theyre dirt cheap and it is worth it for the blending brush alone it is so good. I have two of these sets they were like . at a dollar store the shader brushes shed a tiny bit but after wash them they were wonderful and the blending brushes had no shedding are incredibly soft and hold their shape well it feels comparable to like some Goss and Hakuhodo brushes it is seriously bananas.,MakeupAddiction,csltigy,3,t5_2rww2

4433660,0,t3_3bu0uo,You should check out Temptalias posts about the colors youre interested in that are labeled blush on Sephora.com  she shows them all on the face as blush. Also here  is a post I did with swatches of my collection of MUFE Artist Shadows. Unfortunately it is very pictureheavy but the last  photos or so are of my blush shades and I have them swatched both heavily to see color and blended out to see how they look as blush. I dont use them as blush really so unfortunately I cant give a good review as to staying power but they blend out nicely the few times I have used them. I would just make sure to start out lightly because theyre super pigmented. I like using a duofiber brush to keep them light. Hope that helps some!,MakeupAddiction,cspjtww,3,t5_2rww2
4434359,0,t3_3brhyq,I went through a huge Chanel makeup kick and at one point had enough to do a fullface several times over.  Much of it is pretty average and expensive but there were some standouts.  I do love their packaging which always looks sleek and classy.FAVORITES   Le Volume de Chanel mascara is probably my alltime HG. Perfection Lumiere Velvet foundation. Base Lumiere illuminating primer. the lipsticks in general are very nice the blushes are pretty and smell nice Sublimage skin cream.  This stuff was heaven.  My Chanel MA was kind enough to give me a bag of sample tubes which lasted me a good while but I couldnt justify the price tag.  Smells AMAZING.NOT SO FAVORITES   Soleil Tan de Chanel.  Smells good but it wasnt my favorite bronzer.  Oxidized weird on me and got patchy. Les Beiges powder.  Formula was nice but the shade range was awful. Every foundation other than Lumiere Velvet. Nail polishes.  God these are so expensive and overrated.edit formatting,MakeupAddiction,cspmzcx,2,t5_2rww2

Make Up For Ever eyshadow  Rosewood also seems pretty close but its pricy and I havent been able to really compare them side to side myself.

4486832,0,t3_3cjq6o,Your brows seem pretty clean and well shaped and overall youre doing a good job.My suggestion would be to ditch the double vamp eyelip combo until your abilities get a little stronger. Its a hard combo to pull off and really requires a clean application and just the right colors. I really would suggest working with browns more right now as they are a little more forgiving and blend a little easier.That being said I do like the colors on you. The total black eyes are a little harsh though. Try toning down the bottom lash line or eliminating completely and try bringing your shadow downward more onto your lid closer to your lashline. Add a warm shade like a brown to your crease to keep the black from looking so harsh and to get a nicer transition. Blend blend blend. If you dont already have grab a few basic eye brushes to help soften the look and improve your application. There is a clear line where your shadow starts but we are trying to create a more gradient effect.Good luck!,MakeupAddiction,csw87y6,26,t5_2rww2

4492536,0,t3_3cmgyr,I feel like one of the best ways to begin experimenting with makeup is to start by choosing some aspect of your face to highlight. Do you have a particular reason for wanting to try to use makeup? For some its about making problem areas less noticeable so that they can accentuate their natural beauty. For others its about making a statement and experimenting with different colors and styles. But pretty much everyone wears makeup because its makes them feel awesomerockinhawt... The list goes on. So if you are trying to make problem areas less noticeable then I would start experimenting with foundation andor concealer. My personal favorite is revlon color stay. NOTE I also recommend investing in a few brushes!! Its amazing how the right applicators can change the way the makeup lays on your face. I like the brushes from real techniques. They are too expensive and mine have lasted for years.If you want to keep things subtle for a more natural look then an eyeliner that is similar to your eyelash color is a smart option with some clear mascara. It will make your lashes look fuller and accentuate your eyes without giving you the dragtrans look you seem to want to avoid. Other makeup products that take a bit of getting used to imo are contour and highlighting powderscreams. Look up male contouring pictures to see where on your face you should try to apply the lowlights. It is a pain to get used to but once you get a feel for your facial proportions and the makeup having a subtle contour really helps to bring out your faces natural shape and definition. My personal favorite company for contour cream is BECCA which isnt found in drugstores and ironically my favorite highlighting cream is made by elf which is DEFINITELY sold in drugstores.I hope that this helps!! This subreddit has so many great tutorials in how to properly apply a wide variety of makeup products and Im sure that with enough browsing you will find one or two things to try out. Be sure to post some pictures of your progress!! ,MakeupAddiction,cswxzvj,2,t5_2rww2

Maybe its purples that are more bluebased that are kind of crappy to work with. If you want great purples the Dior is nice and MUFEs purple Artist Shadows are consistently incredible. I have at least six of the purples and theyre terrific. Id stay away from Hourglass Modernist palette with the purples though. I was so excited about it that I preordered it online and had my fianc ship it to me while I was studying abroad in France...and I hated it so much that I returned the palette as soon as I got home.

Powders usually last longer and are recommended for oily skin but I really fell in love with my cream highlighter as well and since only my t zone gets oily it wears very well.

The finish is smooth and lightweight but gives great mediumfull coverage with minimal amounts of product.  The tube looks small but a little goes along way.  I wouldnt consider it a true matte but it isnt really luminous either.  I apply with my fingers over a moisturizing primer and it looks great and wears all day especially with a setting spray.  I will set with a tiny bit of hydrating translucent powder by Terry Hyaluronic.  One word of warning though...the shades are a bit off from normal MAC numbering.

It is very subtle but when I put it up around my hairline in the corners and blend it down slightly I feel like it adds a great dimension to my face.

But when I went to the one in downtown Montreal I couldnt believe how poor the service was. I saw sales staff hanging around chatting with each other while clients were looking for help. I saw them openly mocking clients makeup and dress. I finally got someones attention to ask about the ABH contour palette which was new at the time and she kept insisting over and over that the darker complexion version which was all they had in stock would be perfect for me. Im so white its sad. I was so happy to return to my old standby. ,MakeupAddiction,ct8f1ul,1,t5_2rww2

4600281,0,t3_3e0k39,The blue and the brown need to be blended more into each other and the brown is coming up too close to your eyebrow.  I see you used a transition color and thats a great start to blending!  What I would do is use a couple of brown shadows and a couple of blue shadows to make the gradient more smooth  Place a transition color in the crease then put Chaos on your lid up to the crease and start blending it into the transition color.  Then add in a midtone brown to start deepening up the crease.  Then once thats nicely blended use a dark brown just below the midtone brown.  Then Id probably add in a more midtone blue to get Chaos to transition smoothly into the browns  something like Gonzo in the Electric Palette is perfect for this.  Then blend blend blend like crazy until its a smooth transition and then if Chaos is looking a little dulled pack a bit more on the mobile lid close to the lashline and blend it upwards into Gonzo.,MakeupAddiction,ctagdec,8,t5_2rww2

I have decent skin and aside from the occasional outbreak usually stemming from good old Shark Week I dont really have a lot of colour variation.Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream  This is a glorified tinted moisturizer.  It offers light coverage and a pleasant dewy finish.  There are not a lot of colour choices but because the coverage is so light I found it to be very forgiving shadewise.  I used this for about a year and then purchased what turned out to be a bad batch or something.  I had been thinking about trying other options so I took this as an opportunity to try something new.Marcelle BB Cream  This is a Canadian brand that can be found at any Shoppers Drug Mart Rexall Superstore and Im sure lots of other places.  The sales associate who pointed it out to me said that it was much closer to a true BB Cream than most others to be found in Canada.  It has a much thicker consistency than Dream Fresh.  I would say the coverage would be light to medium depending on how much you build it up.  Like Dream Fresh there are not a lot of colour choices.

4656913,0,t1_cthbxsh,I think it has something to do with being in the beauty industry. I could relate to a lot of the stuff you wrote on your post but Ive never worked at ulta. I went to beauty school instead and I was constantly dismissed. I would do my best and work hard because I really really wanted to be good at this and get out of school knowing my shit you know? You are supposed to do a certain number of haircuts and treatments and colors and things like that in order to graduate but I was always behind because I was usually asked by the schools manager to work in dispense mixing the stuff for the other girls. Most girls who worked there were slow or lazy or would mix things wrong or what have you cause they didnt want to be there. Meanwhile I would work as fast and efficiently as I could. So I got stuck there weekend after weekend when we had the most clients while the other girls were getting their credits. I finally got the courage to tell the manager that I was falling behind and that some people havent even had a chance to work in dispense and that I didnt find that fair. She just told me to be part of the team. Mind you when her favorite student was asked by a teacher to work there he threw a tantrum and the manager said it was ok for him to refuse. So he graduated without spending a single day in dispense while I spent all my weekends there. So yeah for some reason most people like to mistreat or dismiss those who actually do their jobs well and are willing to comply.,MakeupAddiction,cthk906,3,t5_2rww2

4845349,0,t3_3h7mz6,Since you have hooded eyes its really nice to see that your brows naturally slope upwards. It really opens up the eye space as opposed to having an arched brow that would have to put it bluntly an unflattering appearance. The shape you have naturally is a good one to stick with Id suggest though cleaning up the under side of the brow and probably going to a professional for the upper part since things can go wrong when you do it yourself. You would want to keep in mind the parallel lines your eyebrow creates at its thickest points and remove anything that does not fall into that space. Here is an example of what I think would look stunning on you By cleaning up those areas it really gives you a more awake look which is a struggle sometimes with this eye shape. Also I included a edit of what they would look like shaped and filled in with a shadow. It gives a great definition to the brows without over powering the face which can happen when you arent yet skilled with a brow pencil. ,MakeupAddiction,cu5ajla,3,t5_2rww2

4933753,0,t3_3if4e7,I am very pale skinned and believe myself to be cool toned.  I recently found a foundation that works well on my drier pale skin loreals true match lumi in light ivory.  I want to start contouring my face more because now with my foundation on my face is just flat and pale and dimensionless almost lifeless looking but at least my complexion and blending looks good!!.  I read here that NYXs taupe blush is good for contouring on pale skin but is it okay to mix a liquid foundation with powders?  I prefer liquids as I tried powders before and they made my skin look dry.  Also should I try using a pink blush to add color to my skin?  I never really know how to use blush correctly and I feel like it just adds redness back into my skin that I was trying to get rid of.

4934777,0,t3_3id794,Normally I have  minutes. But in ten I would just do concealer brows and blush. My brows take me the longest out of my whole routine unless I do eyeliner because I just fuss too much over the smallest details. I usually skip mascara too. ,MakeupAddiction,cugkggp,1,t5_2rww2
4935331,0,t3_3iftvi,The vast majority of mascaras contain wax or are waxbased so thats not really the issue. The oil from your eyelids breaks down the mascara causing it to smudge.I recommend tubing mascara. It coats your eyelashes in little polymer tubes that dont budge until you remove with warm water. I personally dont like building them up because I find they actually make my lashes really clumpy and my lashes never clump but since its mascara the most personal of all the makeup items your results may vary. My favorite is Clinique Lash Power. I also enjoyed Blincs mascara but I wasnt fond of the price tag. From the drugstore LOreal has their Double Extend Beauty Tubes.Word of warning because tubing mascaras are removed with warm water it loosens the tubes and you can slide them right off they are NOT sobproof. If your eyes water a bit its fine but if something sad happens ex. that five minutes from Pixars Up then the tubes will slide off. Fortunately they come off in tubes and dont smudge off but still. Dont cry rivers in tubing mascara youll look ridiculous afterward.,MakeupAddiction,cugmz2g,1,t5_2rww2

Its not mentioned on the packaging. I found this scrub a bit rough for me but youll have to suck it and see Actually I wouldnt reccomend putting this anywhere near your mouth. It tastes disgusting. Mario Badescu Seaweed Cleansing Lotion  The free sample train that puts these in my bag is unstoppable Its an unremarkable product. Smells bad too. Lancome Advanced Gnefique Youth Activating Concentrate  No one needs this. Right? Say yes Clarins Super Restorative Total Eye Concentrate  This lasted ever Still not convinced eye creams are necessary. This didnt burn my eyes! Eclos Rejuvenating Antioxidant Mask  Moisturizing masks are lost on me I use them as regular moisturizers on especially dry areas. This was closer to the one by Origins that I prefer than GlamGlow ThirstyMud. Although I dont think Id purchase full size of any of them.Makeup Revlon Colorburst Lip Butter in Strawberry Shortcake  I dont like the formula. Its tacky and gummy after an hour. I missed the bandwagon on these and am glad I didnt buy all the shades I wanted. This was a cool toned pink that made me look as if I had ice cream cake frosting on my lips. Essence Lash amp Brow Gel Mascara  I told myself I could do better than that and have moved on to Ulta brand brow gel a surprise gem. The Essence one can be flaky. Chapstick Spearmint  Id never used Chapstick brand before this. Very waxy. No buenoHaircare Nexxus Color Assure Glossing Tonic  This is the best on wet andor dry hair to make it soft and shiny. I have three backups. Its my secret weapon for hair. Carols Daughter Monoi Repairing Hairmask  This was reccomended to me by the baddest female I know. I dont have curly hair but it turns my wavy hair into silk. To me it smells a little bit like root beer. Aquamer Shampoo  Used at hotel. Im so sorry sorry this one is boring.Perfume Versace Woman  I cant believe nobody told me about this. It smells like raspberries yet its mature.Body Weleda Skin Food  My favorite for when I want dry skin to leave my body Its a bit greasy and smelly though.

I feel stuck on repeat Antica Farmacista Coriander Lotus and Cucumber Soap  Definitely an unnecessary luxury It smells good and doesnt leave the squeaky clean feel. Neutrogena Beach Defense Sunscreen  I will use this for as long as its made. It has the best scent.Other La Fresh Makeup Remover Wipes X  Used during vacation. These worked fine.

4990915,0,t3_3j9xx1,Your moisturizer or sunscreen shouldnt be an issue provided you let them dryabsorb completely before you start applying your makeup. There isnt really a set time but your skin shouldnt have that tacky freshlymoisturized feeling anymore.Too much primer could cause this issue. I use about a peasized drop to cover my entire face. I havent used Smashbox in particular for a while but Ive used a variety of silicone primers and I havent run into too many issues with separation.Finally does your skin tend to get oily? Sebum will break up foundation and cause it to separate throughout the day as well.

If LA Splash is in any way advertising or marketing this collection as a Disney or Disney princess collection then Disney definitely has a case. If any of these articles are sponsored by LA Splash Disney definitely has a case as that constitutes advertisting.

5015322,0,t1_cuqiabk,How many you need depends on what colors you wear regularly. If you want to minimize what you need to buy I would get a clear lipliner to start the Milani one is my favorite!. Then if you wear a lot of bright colors get a liner for each general family of the brights you wear. I for example wear a lot of hot pink and red. So I bought a red and a hot pink liner. The main question to ask yourself when deciding whether you need a liner in that color family rather than a clearlip colored liner is how important is precision when applying this lip color? Brights need to be very precise because its obvious when you dont have a crisp line lining with a matchingish liner means that you dont have to get as close to the lip lines outer edge with your lipstick. Thats a huge help.  Nudes generally dont need that kind of crisp line though if you like that just get a nudepinky brown liner too! You dont have to spend a lot on liners. Milani makes great liners and Essence does too. Im all about using my red essence lip pencil with my Guerlain Rouge G! tldr Get a clear liner for the most versatility and a liner for each bright color family you wear often fuschias reds etc.. Most people probably need  liners at most and thats if they wear liner often. ,MakeupAddiction,cuqjbf1,7,t5_2rww2

I have infinite more control and I can slowly spread the product without losing intensity in coverage. I love using brushes for eyeshadow. However I wear bold lips a lot. One of my favorite balances to a deep bold lip is taking NYXs jumbo eye pencil in french fry and scribbling all over my lid and lower lash line then blending the edges with my fingers. Tightline mascara and done. It gives some subtle shimmery depth without overtaking the lips. Plus its so damn easy. Scribble scrub and go. ,MakeupAddiction,curo7je,3,t5_2rww2

I mean I understand that they want to reach out to as large audience as possible and I cant fault them for that but I dunno.. especially Tatcha should promote themselves through an older segment IMO  how many of Jaclyn Hills subscribers can afford a  mist spray which btw is worth every cent or a  beauty routine again totally worth the splurge though when she targets the teenearly s segment?,MakeupAddiction,cuzmoge,1,t5_2rww2

5120533,0,t3_3l4dt3,Hii! I have gone to Imats NYC for the past  years! Never been to LA because I live on the East Coast and it can get expensive. My first  years I did one day Sunday this past year I did both days. If youre a casual shopper one day is enough. Each day has its perks though. Saturdays its a fresh start and you should be able to get MOST of your wish list Jaclyn Hill palette at morphe sold out in hours.  Lines will be long. I waited in the morphe line for  hrs! So whichever day you go definitely bring friends so they can wait in different lines and youll have a better chance at getting everything you want. SUNDAY is just as packed but because it is the last day a lot of companies do last day sales and give you deals close to closing. Other than shopping the speakers are excellent the special effects contests are amazing and you meet soo many makeup enthusiasts like yourself. LA I think is a larger convention although I NYC is still huge. Also LA has brands that NYC doesnt like Naimes Too Faced etc. Hope this helps. ,MakeupAddiction,cv37t22,3,t5_2rww2

So everyones preference is different its usually wise to go for lighter softer colors on the eyes so they dont become dark and shadowed. And you can do a thin liner or a smokey one to bring back some sultriness. If youre skin is on the driernormal side you can ask her to use a hint of a radiance primer before your foundation to add a subtle glow.Every MUA is different so youll have to ask her about the lip color touch ups I personally only give a complimentary touch up to the brides.

5200562,0,t1_cvcnvx2,well Im asian so I tend to gravitate towards asian youtubers they really like that fast natural make up their tutorials dont really have elaborate eye make up or heavy contouring. From head to toe so youngs beauty room are the two i watch the most they tend to have a lot of more natural looks. another youtuber that i really like is kathleen lights. basically just scroll through their videos and see what looks interesting to you. i havent tried bare minerals tinted moisturizer so i cant tell you what kind of coverage you need but foundation should be more about evening out your skin tone and let the concealer do the actual covering part everyone loves the nars creamy concealer mac has good selection of concealers too. You should really ask for foundation samples and go home to see if you really like it i like urban decay naked skin mufe ultra hd foundation and mac pro longwear they all have pretty good coverage. I really like nyx cream blushes they arent expensive and theyre really pigmented. stila convertible color are great too. If you like doing neutral eyeshadow then invest in a palette that has good quality like urban decay naked   basics or the lorac palettes they will last you forever and are so worth it. what do you use for your eyebrow? i heard make up forever aqua brow is great since its made for swimmers abh dipbrow is the one everyone is raving about too since they have good color selections. just do your make up a lot its all about trial and error and finding out what works for you.,MakeupAddiction,cvcv03o,2,t5_2rww2

5277897,0,t1_cvmasuf,Thanks! And from the palette I used Nudie as a transition then Chocolate Cookie and a little bit of Sexpresso to deepen the crease and outer corner. Then I used Strapless to add some warmth. I used a mix of Risque and Strapless on my lower lashline and blended it out with Honey Butter. And I forgot to include this in my product list but then I used a flat brush to pat MAC All That Glitters on my lid and inner corner. I used a little of the Champagne Pop on my browbone to highlight.

I like MAC paint pots.Also focus more of your efforts into your outer corner which is basically where youll be seeing all of your work. Hoodies can get away with smoky eyes not looking so overwhelming and racoony so thats a plus My fave gurus to watch for hooded lid tutorials are LustreLux and Alissa Ashley!

The pigmentation is very poor.  I even tried their mineral shadows and these were fallout city and no better than wet n wild.  I tried their brightening undereye concealer pen in  and really liked it.  That is literally the only item that I used up and wished I had another one.  Everything else Ive thrown away.I had a mineral blush and it was pretty.  It looked like the Balms hot mama.   It worked o.k. no real complaints but not mind blowing.

I made sure to shake it very well before using it.   The color ended up looking too red and dark on me so I exchanged it for a lighter shade and that still looked like crap on me.    I think if you have near perfect skin or very little to cover you might be able to pull it off.  I tried it with and without primer silicone and nonsilicone based but my skin just couldnt mesh with it.  I think it has to do with my combooily skin and because I have so much hyperpigmentation and deep scarring to cover up that I cant get this foundation to work on me.  ,MakeupAddiction,cvqeqm7,3,t5_2rww2

5322114,0,t1_cvrbv1l,I ended up going with Chrysalis which isnt neutral at all but between Innerstellar and my Naked  dupe Ill have enough neutrals to get by for the time being.  I dont have another clinical rotation until summer and I wont start a grown up job for another year so now is my time to play with color.  I also just found out that Chrysalis is being discontinued and I wanted to get it off Amazon before the prices go up.  Id probably never forgive myself if I let the deal pass and missed out on it completely.

5322181,0,t1_cvrd5oh,I just added an update.  Its not neutral AT ALL but Im going with the Kat von D Chrysalis and possibly saving up for the Kat von D Shade and Light Eye palette over the next few months.  I picked Chrysalis because its got all colors I know I would use and it would just be super fun to go with my Innerstellar.  I probably couldnt wear it to work when I start my grown up job after grad school but Ill use the shit out of it over the next year.  I also found out that its recently discontinued and I had to get it off Amazon before the prices go up because Id probably regret it forever if I missed my chance at getting it.I dont have any more money to spend for now but Ill keep doing my research and see about my perfect neutrals.  Everyone suggests the Lorac palettes but they just dont inspire me at all for some reason but Ive been super inspired by the Kat von D palettes and the Naked palettes.  The quality on the Naked  wasnt worth it when my dupe gives me the same level of inspiration for  of the same quality but the Kat von Da palettes are cool enough inspiring enough and quality enough that I think theyre the right choice for me.,MakeupAddiction,cvryyek,1,t5_2rww2

The product obviously wasnt so limited that it became unavailable BUT was successful enough to bring it back for a holiday palette. That says something because they probably would not have wasted time continuing Champagne Pop through the season. Even if it didnt yield the desired numbers from its launch theres got to be decent enough projection for it to be carried through.Many products associated with beauty gurus are in fact limited and do go away which is why so many people jump on these colloborations but it would be silly to think that something hyped so much by JaclynBeccaSephora would actually become unavailable very quickly. ,MakeupAddiction,cvy6nx9,2,t5_2rww2

I grabbed a couple headbands from CVS and I pulled some ivy off the building nextdoor. I fused it all together with hot glue and put on my partners and my makeup. The only thing that went horribly wrong was the black lipstick. You can see the struggle. I even set it with powder and it smudges like crazy. Next time Im using KVD ELL in Witches.

5493575,0,t3_3qbyb8,I think this is great but I have a bit of CC! I support strong eyesstrong lips but something about the dark graybrown eyes with that shade of red though both flatter you individually looks a little oldernot so fresh? I feel like this would be a good time to go for a more purple lip. I feel like that particular red youre wearing would fare better with lighter or different eye makeup. Eyebrow shape I think you could do a bit more featheringsoftening around the inner corners. I also think the tails could be a little longer and not so vertical. As it is currently they are a bit too geometric Eyebrow color Not  sure maybe others can chime in to disagree but I think the brown of your brows is more suitable to a naturalbrown haircolor. They look too warm though they arent THAT warm against the Snow White coolblack hair you have. Id suggest actually using a black brow pomade and if it feels too dramatic you might get a dark cool gray eyeshadow to do the lighter parts and only use pomade in the darkest areas. Eyeshadow I think this could look even cooler and more sculpted if you used more light tones on the inner corner and inner part of the lid. As it is it almost looks like you only had one bronze shade over the whole lid. Lighter tones in key places will make it look more multidimensional. Doesnt have to be a halo eye but even just a bit on the inside.Overall I love the way you emphasized your features and I think with a few small tweaks this would look even more finished.,MakeupAddiction,cwdutef,10,t5_2rww2

5509048,0,t3_3qjqik,Youve seen A Nightmare Before Christmas right? Well its kinda like that. JacksJacks worlds holiday is Halloween and they have their traditions and way of living and its great and they understand them and theyre good at them. Jack goes out exploring and sees Christmas and its really different and beautiful and inspires something inside of him so Jack decides he wants Christmas. He gets everyone geared up for Christmas only...they dont quite get the customs and traditions and ways of doing things. They also lock away Santa in order to replace him with Jack. They dont get the presents or decorations or traditions right because they dont know the context and havent bothered to learn about them and instead make Christmas into something terrifying which it shouldnt be.  Cultural appropriation is like that taking from another culture that you have no real connection to and ultimately probably dont really understand howwhy they do what youre borrowing. Its decontextualizing traditions that may be very closely held to cultures and for many cultures traditions or other actions that other cultures have tried to stomp out of them in the past. Its very often to the detriment to the culture in which it belongs to which individuals members of those cultures may not be bothered by it but to others it cheapensdilutesexploits their culture.   No one is saying you cant do a calavera but I think you should think long and hard about why you want to do one and maybe read up on what the Day of the Dead means to Mexicans and other people who celebrate it. Also Im very sure you could find some other form of Catholic imagery to do your own beautiful creative spin on. Catholicism has plenty of beautiful imagery and I know people on this sub have it in them to do something amazing and new and creative with it.    ,MakeupAddiction,cwftxog,15,t5_2rww2

Im not sure what you mean by good makeup brush? depending on the purpose of the brush and how well you think shed care for itthem I think Tom Ford brushes are excellent in quality and very giftable if she isnt the type of fuss over her tools then a small set of synthetic brushes like Make Up For Evers travel holiday set would be pretty nice theyre great quality and very easy to care for.For face mask maybe get her a bundle of cute little masks and make up a little basket for DIY spa days together? I do this for my mum on her birthday and she loves them getting a bunch of them together can be pretty cheap I use Mamonde masks because theyre the most accessible but if youre in the US andor in a major city youll have more options check out rAsianBeauty for general product suggestions.Does she like perfume? a nice bottle of atelier perfume would be great on my last vacation I picked up a bottle from Givenchy Atelier and I love it for myself caveat atelier perfumes can be very costly.

5577826,0,t3_3riugr,Get viseart. I do not have the stila but I have had other palettes of theirs they do make good shadows but no where near the quality for viseart  not even close. Stila is hit or miss on different shades and I find that even their nicer shades can be a bit chalky. Viseart is super pigmented and blends amazingly well. They can feel dry if youve not used them before but just tap your brush to them and blend they are dry you should very quickly realize that you dont need the butteryness that other shadows need to blend.,MakeupAddiction,cwohcd5,11,t5_2rww2

I remember it concealing pores really well and creating a smoother texture but it made my foundation look really dry. I noticed it also made my foundation drag on my skin during application. Looking back now I think its because I was using a water based foundation over this silicone primer..

I initially had bought the W In the Buff dupe of the Naked  so I could practice and follow along with tutorials without spending  on a palette. I liked my W so much that when I got birthday money I bought the Naked . It swatches beautifully but on my eyes they werent significantly more pigmented or blendable then my W dupe. The only significant difference in quality was the packaging and Im not going to pay a  difference just for packaging. I returned my Naked  and bought the Kat von D Monarch to go with my Kat von D Innerstellar palette. Those palettes should be hyped more then they are because they were absolutely worth every stinking penny Urban Decay not so much. ,MakeupAddiction,cwvdkia,10,t5_2rww2

5695618,0,t3_3t3ql4,This is why makeup is great.  If you wanted to take part in this lip trend you could try overdrawing your lips first with liner and then going over it.  Urban Decay has a liner I believe its called Zero?  Could be wrong.. that is essentially clear but acts as a barrier to prevent bleeding.  I like to line the lips.  Fill in with liquid lipstick. Then touch up anywhere that doesnt look the right shape and looks crooked with concealer or foundation on a small synthetic brush.  Also if you want to go bold you can get a bunch of colors and paint a lipstick rainbow on your forehead and maybe some colored liners to draw a unicorn flying over it on your forehead.  It is your face so whatever look makes you happy I think you should go for.  ,MakeupAddiction,cx33gwe,2,t5_2rww2
5695859,0,t1_cx349pl,I dont want to offend anyone here who is really devoted to their sigma brushes but I honestly dont feel like they are really in the same league as Cozzette. Even if they were the same quality and sigmas synthetic hair brushes have come a long way since I tried them I think youd be better off spending the extra  on something else.  The Cozzette set doesnt have the duofiber brush the big black one with white tips but I dont think missing that one style brush is anything essential since a similar effect can be achieved with other brushes in the Cozzette set.  She will find herself adding to her brush collection based on her style and needs over time so getting her a brush set at this point is more about giving a good solid foundation of shapes and textures rather than covering every style. For instance I have about  brushes at this point and I personally cant remember the last time I reached for one of my duofiber brushes...but Im sure there are some makeup artists who use them all the time.  Its all going to come down to personal preference and I think both sets are pretty well rounded.  I personally have had much better experiences with Cozzette than with Sigma overall but I dont know if I have ever tried that particular line of synthetics from Sigma so keep that in mind.  Just my opinions   Hope that helps!,MakeupAddiction,cx34jkd,6,t5_2rww2

For tightlining I gently pull my top eyelid up to make it easier to apply from underneath the lashes.  Personally I find it easiest to apply with a pencil or gel eyeliner because they set more quickly so it doesnt transfersmudge when you blink and its easier to get in between the lashes.

5744177,0,t1_cx8pguk,To be honest it took me until college Im a sophomore to start reinventing and wearing what I want. It becomes a lot easier because  youre more anonymousits just so many more people than high school and not everybody knows everyone elses business.  People genuinely dont care! They dont have the time to gossip about lipstick they have a paper to write damn it!  When they do care its usually to ask where you got it and how much they love it on you. People are way more accepting.So it does get waaaaayyy easier to branch out I was happy to realize that.However I wish I wore lipstick a little more in high school! Its fun its expressive and it says I did this on purpose because I wanted to. To  me in high school it felt like everything had to be casual and if you put in any effort you were trying to hard. But theres something cool to be said about doing something on purpose. You wanted to so you did it. You should! Definitely wear it around the house at first that helped me a ton. It got me used to seeing it on my face. Even so I say just do it Id rather regret the fashion choices I did take and laugh about them with my future daughters than not take them at all.Sorry for the novel! Lipstick is close to my heart and I remember feeling exactly like this.,MakeupAddiction,cx94deo,5,t5_2rww2
5746091,0,t1_cx9cfd7,I used the Colourpop super shock shadow in Hustle as a sort of base. The Colourpop shadows are a little damp so I find that they help a lot with the staying power of powder shadows.I used a mix of Kawabunga and Ripper from the Balmsai palette all over the lid. Kawabunga is a light olivegreen gold and Ripper is a darker matte brown. I mixed the two to make the olive tones a little darker. I almost used a single Coastal Scents shadow in Kiwi Green but it was a little vibrant for my taste. ,MakeupAddiction,cx9cx81,5,t5_2rww2

I think the black lines coming from your eyes might be a little more striking if they were done with a black liquid liner and ended in points and I sort of wish the blue heart on your lips also came down to the a sharper point past your lips.Your eyebrows taper to a point and your inner eyes taper to a point so my eyes are kind of wanting the other lines and shapes to also taper to that sharp point.Also where did you get those silver deer heads on your wall in pic ?,MakeupAddiction,cx9hbco,2,t5_2rww2

They also do one for sensitive skin but they were out in the shop so I got the regular one. It works just about as well need slightly more product and stings my eyes a bit but its still a hundred times better than the oil based Boots own brand remover I was using before. I also just like to use it to clean my face at the end of the day even if I havent been wearing make up as its gentle and doesnt dry out my skin as much as using normal soap or heavier cleansers.Edit forgot to say Ive got dry skin with plenty of dry patches this time of year.

Same with perfumes  I only use one.The Lorac Pro formula is amazing but expect a lot of kickback if youre not super gentle with the shadows. I have both  and  I go for  a little more often because I prefer coolneutral shades. If youre into the Pro Matte palette there are a lot of similar shades in the Pro  palette.I hope that helps!

However like a couple of other people have said the Showstopper palette is great!  I think its very underrated.  The blush looks scary but its very pretty IRL.

5820435,0,t1_cxig4tf,Yeah. The fallout is something to behold. Whenever I use this palette I always have to remember to do eyes before my foundation so I can just wipe it all away. That being said....I bought it for the rose gold and Amber and both of those colors deliver. I use cobalt as a liner and the graphite as a base for Amberrose gold to give it a different look and like it for both of those. I cant speak much for the green but cobalt rose gold graphite and Amber all made it worth it. Overall I definitely dont regret buying it. Added some good color to my collection. but!

Now Im waiting for one of the pending payments to clear so I can get my  money back along with  business days for a new card.Im pretty sure it may have been a breach on gerard?  Not sure.

Interesting since the Colourpop ultramattes are a third of the price of KVD.    The Cover Girl one is a really tiny amount of product but its also the hardest to remove!

5850275,0,t3_3vd4ut,Hey there! Unfortunately BB creams are usually pretty sheer and somewhat dewy at least not matte. Id look for a full coverage liquid foundation. I tend to prefer sheerer coverage so I dont have a specific recommendation product wise for you but I can give you my process for finding a foundation.First I go to the sephora website if you dont have a website for your country you can skip this step! I just find it helps a bit. I go to the makeup tab under the search bar and in the drop down menu I go to foundations. On the left hand side I check all the filters of things I want which for you would be Full Coverage Matte finish and Liquid formulation. I look at the highest rated the best sellers and read all the claims so I have a good idea of at least  that may have what I want.Then I come to reddit and research those foundations individually as well as typing in things like best full coverage foundation. MakeupAlley is a good site for reviews too. Bonus points for finding a YouTuber with similar skin and checking out their favorite foundations. Sharon Farrell seems to like matte medium to full coverage foundations. She might be a good match!By this point I usually have  I think will be a good match. Then I try to get to the nearest beauty countersephoraultadepartment store and grab some samples. It takes a stupid amount of time but I can usually avoid spending money on something I really dislike. Ive heard good things about the Becca Ever Matte foundation the KVD LockIt foundation the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra but I havent personally tried them myself. Hope you find something you love!,MakeupAddiction,cxmhzqf,1,t5_2rww2

I expected much more pigmentation and less of a powdery product for  bucks I didnt swatch it before I bought it and I honestly wouldnt recommend it as a highlighter to anyone but I do use it on some clients with paler skin I guess who want a subtle type glow.

It could just be the angle but it seems a little low. And maybe its just me but the random end to the liner in the corner of your eye throws the look off a bit.

Foundations are dumped from the tubebottlepot onto a mixing tray and then applied to your face with a clean brush all of the application employees carry a pouch of brushes. The same goes for liquid concealers. Lipsticks are applied with a lip brush thats loaded from the bullet or product tube. Blushes are applied directly from the pan with a brush. Eyeshadows are applied directly from the pan with a brush. Mascaras are applied using a disposable wand but the tubes are always contaminated by some individual who takes it upon themselves to use the applicator that comes with the product and then reinsert after use for the next unlucky person.,MakeupAddiction,cxsn4p5,1,t5_2rww2

5942211,0,t3_3wrsv2,Really its pretty hard to cover it up once the damage is doneyou pretty much dont want ANY makeup product in that open wound. However! If you have a couple of hours then slap on a hydrocolloid bandage the stuff meant for blisters! on the spot. Thatll draw out the gunk and flatten the cyst. This works the best if you sleep with the bandage on overnight.Again you dont want makeup in an open sore so put some liquid bandage over it! Its going to sting like hell at first but itll protect it from any further irritation. Then you can conceal as usual. Personally the concealer that Ive found to work best over the liquid bandage is Smashbox  Hour concealer. The stuff dries fast and its hard to work with if you arent quick enough to blend it but itll pretty much look like theres nothing there after you finish the rest of your routine! In this case its best to use the concealer first before foundationit pretty much wont budge once its dry,MakeupAddiction,cxyjy44,22,t5_2rww2

6019088,0,t3_3xw3u0,Yeah my mom never wore makeup but she wanted me to be a well adjusted teenager so she bought me some really basic stuff in grade ish.  She didnt want me to be the kid who wasnt ALLOWED to wear makeup so she bought me some and said have fun.  I wore it maybe  times throughout the entirety of high school.  After grade  I saw someone in a seventeen magazine with ORANGE eyeshadow and I was like OMG I WANT THAT!  I lusted over orange eyeshadow obsessively until I found mac in another city I lived in a crap town with no good stores.  I was happy with my orange for a while.  Then I wanted red.  I settled for a red blush that I applied wet.  Through my red and orange years it was those colors and mascara.  Then I went to school and discovered student loans.  I was .  aaaaand I was living in a town with a mac freestanding store.  oh dear.  oh dear oh dear.  I went from owning maybe  eyeshadows to owning NINTEY SIX mac eyeshadows only  of which are even vaguely normal colors within the span of two years.  plus pigments primers bases shadesticks liners mascaras GLITTER and anything else that was OMGCOLORS.I used to think girls who wore cake to high school every day were silly.  Now I just see that they were silly because they had no clue what they were doing.  I still do not wear foundation because it drives me batshit crazy.  I never will.  And I happily leave the house without makeup.  But when I do leave the house with makeup on you better believe people are going to notice  I aint going to all that effort if you cant tell Ive done it.  And its funny I usually forget that Im wearing it and when people comment on it Im like uh? what are you talking about?  I love makeup now.  but Im not a slave to it.  And I dont look down on women who wear makeup every day but I do feel terribly for women who feel that they NEED to.  Im no bombshell but I wish women could just feel comfortable enough in themselves to realise that makeup is fun not a necessity.,MakeupAddiction,cy8mlo3,2,t5_2rww2

6077183,0,t1_cyf3wyb,Yeah Ive never thought of Avon as being pyramid schemey. Most of my moms makeup is Avon shes bought it from a lady my dad works with for probably over  years. It was my first makeup too! The lady does orders x per month and my mom probably orders x per year and she has never once asked or mentioned anything about becoming an Avon rep etc to my mom. My aunt sold it for a while too but kind of accidentally? Her Avon lady moved away and she looked online to see if she could buy the products I think nowadays you can buy online but at the time you couldnt and its only a year membership fee and you get a decent discount so my Aunt signed up to be a rep with the intention of only buying for herself. Didnt sell anything to anyone for probably  or  years until she mentioned it to a woman she worked with who had also recently lost her avon lady. So at that point my aunt had maybe  or  people in her office buying from her  people that she signed up as reps or whatever and was still making enough money from her buyers to cover the costs of the stuff she wanted. So yeah Ive never seen it as scamy but thats the extent of my experience with it. I guess if you use the system perfectly it is a MLM thing but you can still make dece money from it but not recruiting. If you are trying to make your entire income yeah I dont see that working out too too well.,MakeupAddiction,cyg7bqb,1,t5_2rww2

If youre blending foundation all over your face and it doesnt match your neck theres going to be a stark contrast between your chinjawline and your neck.

The effect is from cinammon not mint. It is really more of an experience too much so to wear as a lip balm on a regular basis. The few times I have tried it it actually burned for the first few minutes then the tingling set in. I actually ended up wiping it off my lips after about . hours lips still buzzing.

6208211,0,t3_40l5kf,These are all completely personal preference questions. As someone already mentioned what is worth the money to some isnt to others and you have to figure out for yourself what that is. At one point in time I had all three. I only kept the first one because the colors in  didnt quite work for my skin and there wasnt enough variety for me in . I have also found that Urban Decay shadows in general have a ton of glittery fallout even from the shimmer nonglitter shades and than can become a pain to work with when youre used to shadows that perform better. Do you have access to a Sephora or Ulta? It can be difficult for people to look at a photo and determine the best palette because of lighting and other factors. It would be best if you could go to one of those stores and swatch the palettes yourself and see what flatters your skin. If youre still unsure ask a sales associate. In my personal experience I used the most shades in the original naked but I certainly didnt use all of them. As my makeup collection has grown and I have shadows that I know and love Naked has become my least used I have  palettes. I have four Viseart palettes which are my favorite and most used and also use my MUFE shadows handpicked as well as a few from MAC and MUG also handpicked. I agree with another person here who said to make your own palette with shades you will love from MAC or MUG I recommend MUG because of how much cheaper they are. Ive also heard good things about the Costal Scents Hot Pots but have never tried them personally. If you pick your own shades you know you will love and use every color. ,MakeupAddiction,cyvb1ww,1,t5_2rww2

Here is another resource for setting sprays and such that would also be helpful for you if the ELF one doesnt work out.Edited to add Also I mentioned using a face primer. Here is a masterlist of primers that might help you make a decision should you choose to get one. Also I notice you said you get dry around the nose  so is that where your products are sticking to? Try putting some eyeshadow primer around that area and see if that helps  I use this trick to create a more even base around my nose where my base products tend to break up or look patchy.,MakeupAddiction,cyxiu25,1,t5_2rww2

I would probably go again in another month or so. They save the syringe at my plastic surgeons office so whatever you dont use can be used at your next appointment. If you wanted to do it its definitely not permanent so if you hated it it I believe it would  metabolize by  year. I thought they would last a little longer upwards of a year but it is what it is lol.

6231460,0,t1_cyxml35,I was also on the fence about the chocolate palettes. I kept seeing them everywhere  it was like everyone I saw on here had one  and I just didnt see what made it special. I also kept seeing it on MUE and thought well it cant be that great if a lot of people are selling it.I was so wrong. Okay this palette is gorgeous. Straight up gorgeous to look at. I have fair coloring with frecklespink undertones and blue eyes and I thought oh its just another brownbased palette whatever I have some of those already. I will admit that I never really looked closely at it but the second I did I knew I was in the wrong. Theres a good balance of matteshimmer shades and a variety of colors shades of brown a cool burntorangey color a greengold some sexy burgundies a baby pink and a fantastic gold that I use all the time. The swatches I saw online looked buttery and soooooo nice so I decided to haunt MUE until I found one. I got it in the mail yesterday and I LOVE IT. It actually smells like chocolate not like fake chocolate but real nowIneedalunchtreat chocolate. Its even prettier in person. I really feel this palette has rounded out my neutral collection and given me some other colors I wouldnt have thought to buy by themselves. Now I dont think I would run out and buy the chocolate palette for  retail. I know at ULTA youd get the points but I couldnt make myself do it. MUE was an excellent way to get it for what I felt was a reasonable price. So my advice is to swatch it in person if you can and check out MUE. Ive gotten several beautiful things there and I have no regrets or negative things to say. ,MakeupAddiction,cyxy67w,4,t5_2rww2

Im pretty sure cool bone is cool toned and if thats not cool enough for you the neutral tone to Becca might not work.

You can find some great natural but with more oomph options and if you practice a couple of times you should be set for the big day.  I used Ardell  Demis but Eyelure makes some whispier options some even have brown lashes mixed in with the regular black!  Mine stayed on great all day and I CRIED.  I let the lash glue Duo whiteclear get tacky before putting each lash on and I used nifty plastic tweezers made by Ardell to do the adjustments.  I am not a falsie pro I didnt touch them until the summer before the wedding and even then I just practiced a couple of times and Im super happy with how they worked out.,MakeupAddiction,czdeh9y,3,t5_2rww2

6384452,0,t3_431pxe,getting any sort of makeup done at Sephora. I know tons of people have had great experience with it but anytime someone in there touches my face it goes horribly wrong.The last time I went in I was reluctant because of my bad experience but decided to give it another shot. There were different girls there this time I thought itd be alright. I really wanted to try out a new liquid liner and mascara never used high end ones. The employee I was dealing with seemed pretty nice sat me down and immediately pointed out how pale I was. Fair enough I am pale but not sure how much that has to do with eyelinermascara suggestions. She walked off then came back with what looked like the darkest bronzer Ive ever seen and proceeded to pile it on my face. At this point another employee walked by took a second look at me and also pointed out how pale I was. I made it clear I was only here for some eye makeup suggestion and Im cool with how pale I am. Not really looking to be super bronzed. That went completely ignored and the second employee started piling this vibrant pink blush on. I took a look in the mirror and I looked like a clown. I kind of awkwardly said thanks Ill consider the recommendations etc. and left. Had to walk through the mall with my head held down until I could find a bathroom.Most awkward confusing experience Ive had. ,MakeupAddiction,czfce3b,7,t5_2rww2
6384535,0,t1_czetece,I have it I dont have a ton to compare it to but Ive heard the vice palettes have a big problem with fallout? I always tap off my excess from my brush before using really any eyeshadow and I havent noticed a fallout problem with this one at all. That also means that while yes the colors can be really bold you CAN tap off enough to make them more subtle. If you pat them on or do an arm swatch with your finger crazy bright colors. If you sweep them on and only do one layer you wont be anywhere uncomfortable for you probably.The colors actually arent that impressive without a primer or nyx milkblack bean but Im really enjoying them with them I never just wear shadow over bare skin anyway. Roadstripe is magic really uneventful on its own but it turns stuff crazy colors when you layer it on top of other stuff which is rad. Hot Pants is so pretty and smooth and pigmented omg I was not expecting to have such a clear favorite but its delightful. The blues are really pretty swatched but Im still trying to figure out how to wear them. Mildew is super nice its a classic for a reason I guess. The purples to me feel like really good basic purples... which might explain why I basically already had dupes of them. But if you dont already have a deep and a light purple in your collection then these are as good as any. Gash is really vital to my psychological state right now because Ive been feeling like a rebellious teenager lately and that means red eyeshadow goddamnit and since its more of a rust than a bright red its not actually unwearable... on the weekends but still. Depending on your skin tone Anonymous or... that other one Laced? Can be very good bases or transition shades which really help make the palette usable on its own.It has another friggin copy of Smog for some reason though. Smog is great but why why is it in everything?Also the huge mirror is greatttttt. Between that and the included brush and the range of colors included enough for a complete neutralish shimmery nakedesque look with Smog Twice Baked and Midnight Cowboy along with a ton of colors of course make it actually really nice for travel. Like it looks disorganized who put this thing together? but basically every color does come with a lighter and darker shade so building a complete look isnt that hard. If you dont use primer or nyx jumbo pencils in whatever color I really wouldnt recommend the palette. It doesnt show up nearly as well without them and Temptalia gave a lot of colors pretty low ratings because of it. But if you do use that stuff then yeah super fun shadows have been wearing some of the colors to work like one color  smog or twice baked and the requisite mattes to make it work and no ones been like WOAH THERE YOU CANT WEAR THIS AROUND MY KIDS so. Approval thus far from judgemental parents yay.,MakeupAddiction,czfcqd7,3,t5_2rww2

6385944,0,t3_433xjq,You should be setting primer with a skintone matte shade ALLOVER before applying any matte color. When I try to apply a matte crease or lid shade over primer it clings and gets patchy. Matte shades are FAR less forgiving than shimmer shades because they have no reflective particles that hide patchiness.The WnW Fergie is realllly clingy so you will get creasing because the initial shadow will apply patchy as fuck if youre doing matte looks. If you really get all up in there with a matte skintone shade first without worrying about how much youre packing on as you do have to get quite a bit on there the subsequent shades will apply smoother and last longer.I will say I agree wtih others that the Fergie primer is a bit too finicky for use with mattes every day. I dont do allmatte looks enough to require a different primer but if you do them frequently you might look into TFSI.,MakeupAddiction,czfijac,3,t5_2rww2

6417178,0,t1_czistc3,I find for me its not the most flattering to do the typical light lid dark crease look. I usually look best when Im using colors that are similar in depth that vary just a little bit. For example Ill use a satin or shimmer taupebronze on the lid and then a matte neutral brown thats only a half a shade darker in my crease and then a chocolate brown smudged on my lashline. Its a less intense look than the bright shimmery lid and dark dark matte crease thats popular right now and you could do it with any color family. I think it creates a very flattering wash of color and it allows me to play with shadow and shape in a much more subtle way. I think its worth a shot if you love eyeshadow. ,MakeupAddiction,czj2gui,8,t5_2rww2

6420973,0,t3_43mdew,Uh... what makes you think they are omitting ingredients? The FDA requires that all ingredients be listed and I highly doubt they would break the law by omitting ingredients.Talc is good at absorbing oil. Mica is often added to powder products to add sparkle i.e. instead of a matte finish a face powder with mica in it will generally have more of a satin finish. Silica is good at filling in minor texture issues but often causes flashback. There arent really any risks except that your skin might be sensitive to something but thats a risk with anything you put on your face.I dont know too much about that brand. I have enjoyed their bath and body products but never tried their cosmetics. But I mean... if you like it then repurchase it.,MakeupAddiction,czjgr9v,6,t5_2rww2

6426050,0,t1_czjy6nw,Thanks! Thats what I meant with the balm  I definitely dont put it on right prior to application sorry if that was not clear. My routine is usually lip scrub before bed then balm over night. Sometimes brushing my teeth dries out my lips in the morning so I put some balm on while doing makeup just like you said then remove the excess. I take out the wand take off a lot of the excess onto the top of tube at least  times then apply a thin layer to my top lip first as it at least defines my cupid bow better that way. I dont do double layers so it is quite a thin layer.Which colour are you using?

6490085,0,t1_czqjfgo,Any professional MUA who refuses to do something completely reasonable like winged liner ought to be ashamed...But anyway! If you want my two cents heres what I would have suggested to do based on your second photo Your face makeup looks a lot more natural here which youve made clear that thats what youre going for. However because these are your engagement photos I would have gone just a tad heavier on the blush to make it slightly more noticeable. Additionally I would add more concealerunder eye corrector because of the bit of under eye darkness you have going on there. Id also suggest using a clear brow gel as I can see you have longer eyebrow hair like I do so some of the stray hairs tend to point downward if they arent trimmed or held in place with the gel. As for your eyes I think youd benefit from using a lash curler before your mascara or use subtle fake lashes because your lashes are very much straight also something I can relate to but they seem to have nice length which I am jealous of! Id also switch to a matte eyeliner rather than a shinier one because I can see it flashing back in your photo. Oh and I think youd look stunning with a darker nude lip maybe something slightly lighter than KVD Lolita I have a similar skin color to you and my HG nude lip is Marc Jacobs Sheer Gel Lipstick in Roleplay combined with MJs Primrose lipliner!Hope that gave you some ideas if you plan on taking any more photos!,MakeupAddiction,czqmg2l,16,t5_2rww2

They give their products out to people who review and use lots and lots of makeup products and in turn those people talk about those products. It gets peoples attention. So yes it is a marketing strategy. In some way it also influences positive reviews from those who receive the productsvacations. However most of the people who go on these trips are friends not only with other beauty bloggers who do beauty for a living but also with people within the company. Its a vacation with friends and a pretty smart way of introducing their new products.

6565475,0,t1_czxy7yh,I currently use Maybelllne Fit Me concealer in  Sand on my eye bags which are the purplebluish that stubble can often take. After applying the concealer and patting it down with a finger patience and a light touch is the key I press it with Fit Me Matte Poreless Powder Let it set cover with foundation as normal. I have also done this with some eyebrow stubble because I am IMPATIENT and have no time for plucking so I just take a tiny razor and shape my eyes quickly and it seems to counter that pretty well.There are some color correcting products you might want to look into but I myself have never used them. I think Wet n Wild has a fourtoned color corrector palette with yellow green purple and white. Never tried it but WnW is a good cheap brand with pretty good quality.I had no idea they made razors especially for sensitive skin! I use the same thing my dad uses just because its easier to buy the same thing for the household. Usually Im okay the first few swipes but I swear the razors dull fast and start hurting within a few uses. ,MakeupAddiction,czyfajc,2,t5_2rww2
6567242,0,t1_czx3g0a,I really like the palette although some of the colours really dont make sense to me. Here are swatches I did just for you! These are all just one swatch obviously not as packed as swatches others have done I really like Nubuck Taupe Regal and Bark. Nubuck is a fantastic base colour for the eyelids when doing a more neutral eye. Taupe is really nice and shimmery while not too warm. Bark works really well for my eyebrows and Regal is just really cool because its somewhere in between brown and purple. Noir  The black is very good high pigmentation and all its what you want from black.I dont really use shimmery dark colours a lot which is why Concer and Mineral Earth havent really been touched. Moss was destroyed when I dropped it but I thought it was a bit too green. Now for the colours that I dont like and I think they shouldnt exist in the first place because who uses them? Toast Honeycomb and Cappuchino. What? They are so pointless. You can see in the other swatches I posted that even when packed on theyre still really close to a white persons skincolour. I dont like them. The only one you can kind of see is Toast and its an odd colour very warm. Overall its a great palette I really like it. Its really cheap you can get it for  Euro   USD which is a great price for the quality you get.,MakeupAddiction,czylvav,2,t5_2rww2

Theres a higher chance of the highend palette being something you can enjoy better quality shadow better packaging etc... plus if you dont end up liking it returns are typically straightforward i.e. Sephora will take it back. If you get a dupe you dont like and cant return it... then youve lost money you cant get back on a product you dont enjoy. And thats just frustrating. Im interested where you said the shadow didnt look the same on your face as it does in tutorials... can you specify how? What effects are you trying to create?,MakeupAddiction,d01reba,7,t5_2rww2

Though it definitely can be a bummer for those of us who are just generally into makeup. But...

6690478,0,t1_d0b19cs,I recommend RCMA from Beautylish. They do payment plan so you pay  of it up front or however much upfront it changes to because the last two payments will cap out at .The palettes by RCMA are super pigmented and are cream which are arguably the best foundations to use for lots of clients because of its high pigmentation upwards of  for RCMA compared to  or less in other foundations staying power noncomedogenic properties and portability  variety of shades which allow for contour highlight concealing etc. I personally when I have the money  get funded enough would buy all of the economy ones but the smallpalette thats like  is perfect to get at least  full faces of foundation. Its fantastic for me as a burgeoning makeup artist who graduated out of college and want to be a HS teacher but I wont be going to get my masters for another two years but I like doing makeup as a side job. ,MakeupAddiction,d0bcrbz,4,t5_2rww2

6744904,0,t3_47xwmj,When I first started doing my makeup I went to one of the kiosks in Macys and getting a legitimate makeover with higher end items is what really peaked my interest in how I could look verses how I look now. Now dont get me wrong I love a good drug store deal and drug store makeup was all I used until the past few years so there is definitely no hate towards it. In fact one can find some of the best designer dupes at Target or Walmart. Also I love a natural face. I sport mine about half the time so I dont feel like I need makeup its just a major hobby  BUT I will say that getting a makeover by a professional is fantastic for tricks and tips and that a designer foundation would probably be best for your girlfriends skin type. Like I said previously I only just recently started to wear higher end makeup and told myself that I would never buy these two things from Sephora because well drug store eyeliner and foundation. I used to use LOreal True Match foundation or Maybelline Fit Me Matte  Poreless so those are pretty good foundations but I did buy Kat Von Ds LockIt Tattoo Foundation and it has done wonders for me. Its definitely my holy grail. I have minimal acne that rages out in spurts but a combination of oily patches and dry patches so one could say that my skin is a mess. It has amazing coverage a little goes a long way and is long lasting. The other two are better if you dont need as much coverage but I will say that since I have oily skin the foundation would turn orange on me after awhile. So a thing to note. Sorry to take up so much space but I try to tell people about this product whenever I can just because of the magic it has done for my complexion overall makeup look and confidence.

6784875,0,t1_d0kwzaj,Hi! The process that I had done is called featherstroke or microblading. The artist uses an exacto knife type blade to make small hairlike incisions on your brows. Each stroke is placed naturally where a hair would be. I personally dont know any men that have had it done or many women for that matter but the ultimate goal is for it to look natural. Thus I dont think I would classify it as specifically feminine. ,MakeupAddiction,d0lcofy,1,t5_2rww2

6807307,0,t1_d0nq5bm,HelloI really loved the eye makeup its blended very nicely.My critique would be the foundation I think its too dark for your skin and also too cool. Maybe its your summer shade and your still using it? Judging from the neck you have warm yellow undertones like me. This mismatch can especially be seen around the chin area. Maybe you used the bronzer there to contour? It looks a little ashy. I have the same problem with many bronzerscontour kits on my skin they look ashy or muddy. I think you need a bronzercontour powder that leans more towards redorange than brown and is also lighter. I have the feeling that your right eyebrow is broader than the left one. But it could also come from the picture. Also just a personal preference I would fill them out a little bit more to make the little bald patches disappear. ,MakeupAddiction,d0nwk3x,1,t5_2rww2

I then use Benefit Rollerlash follow up with Too Faced Better than Sex and finish with Benefit Theyre Real. Sometimes if I want a glossy look Ill going over the front and back of the dried lashes with a glossy black liquid liner.

All the ones I have seem to have shaky mechanisms and it doesnt detract a lot but the wobbliness is mildly annoying. Also a new lipstick doesnt retract all the way into the tube so the rim of the cap catches on it more than Id like.Not a huge fan of The Balms packaging in general. Benefits is borderline. Too Faced is just... no.I also occasionally wish MAC lipstick bullets would come in the colour of the lipstick they contain but then again I kind of like the uniform look.

6900924,0,t3_4a8otg,This is kinda weird but your undereye circles match your lipstick its high fashion as heck i love it D. Not a fan of the eye makeup though. The liner is too saturated which throws off the pastel look. Like the other poster said trying bringing the eyeshadow up.

6902935,0,t3_4aaocf,ABH Dipbrow has more of a learning curve. Ive seen some pretty unnatural looking brows created from using it. However I prefer it greatly in terms of bang for your buck. Ive had the same dipbrow for over a year now and Im not even half way through it. It dries out but Ive been adding drops of Maracuja Oil as needed to keep it soft and spreadable. You just have to be gentle and apply it little by little. If you are going to go with Dipbrow for the future my absolute favorite brush to use with it is It Cosmetics Brushes for Ulta  BrowLiner brush. Ive been using it and washing it and really loving it for over a year now. Its great for gel liner too but perfect for brows.Also for reference I use brow products to fill in sparse brows not for creating brows. ,MakeupAddiction,d0yrlt6,16,t5_2rww2

I definitely dont need to highlight when I put it on though but it doesnt look as shimmery as one would think at least on me.

6989176,0,t1_d18izib,These are all my personal favourites but since makeup is so personal others definitely might not agree! I am a massive fan of affordable makeup so this might be a long list hahaRimmels Kate lipsticks are my favourite of all time but sometimes the shade range isnt the best for certain skin tones. I like     and  the best. These all last a really long time on me especially   and . I also find these dont feather on me whereas Urban Decay lipsticks aways do even if I wear a liner.Rimmels The Only One are also amazing if you want something with a lot of moisture and a finish that isnt matte. Once they have dried a bit I find they are very long lasting. Again with the colour range though not the best for every single person.I also really love my Loreal lipstick in Blakes Red. This one lasts agesssss on my lips and is incredibly comfortable. Some people hate the smell but I actually really like it. This and Rimmels  are my most complimented lipsticks.All three of these lipstick ranges I mentioned are superior to my MAC and my Urban Decay ones that I own in my opinion. Except for MAC Twig I would happily keep these three lines over my high end lipsticks. Maybellines Lash Sensational mascara is the best mascara Ive ever used high end or not. Ive repurchased this which is always a good sign. As a whole Ive never been impressed with a high end mascara except for Benefits tinted primer.As for bronzers I love my Butter Bronzer from Physicians Formula. The colour is great it blends well and it doesnt have sparkles only a very very slight sheen. I also use my Collection pressed powder in Warm Bronze frequently as its really blendable and natural looking. I have a sample of Benefit Hoola and while its nice I definitely prefer the other two to Hoola. I will say Ive never bought a high end eyeliner or liquid foundation though as I am perfectly satisfied with the ones I own from Rimmel Bourjois etc. I have the Bare Minerals powder foundation and its alright but I like liquid better for my dry skin. My Rimmel Scandaleyes liners are my favourite because of how creamy and long lasting they are. The Maybelline gel liner is the best Ive tried for pot liners though. Its really black creamy long lasting and pigmented.I absolutely love my Bourjois Healthy Mix Serum as well. It gives me the most naturally flawless skin. Like I said though I dont have a high end one to compare this to.As a whole I really really love Rimmel products. If the shades work for your skin tone they have some amazing products. I love the Match Perfection foundation the Wake Me Up foundation the Radiance BB Cream the Wake Me Up concealer the Wake Me Up mascara the Stay Matte powder the Exaggerate Lip Liners the Magnifeyes cream shadowliner sticks the Natural Bronzer and the lipsticks and liner mentioned above. These are some of my most used and loved products. However they really fall short at most mascaras and eyeshadows. Their pot liner and felt tip liner are also rubbish. I also havent tried everything from them but Ive heard great things about the Match Perfection concealer and the Lasting Perfection foundation.I will say that my Tarte blushes are my most reached for and definitely my favourite in my collection so this is one area I will usually spend extra on. I also prefer my high end eyeshadow palettes over my affordable ones. I love my Hangover Rx primer more than anything and prefer my beauty blender to my RT sponge. So there are definitely instances where I like spending a bit more.Dear god that was a long comment. Haha Im clearly passionate about my high streetdrugstore makeup!,MakeupAddiction,d18kc6b,11,t5_2rww2

But I do very thin layers with a brush and usually do two coats to get that really deep color. I honestly do not mind this process. If I eat and drink the color will fade mostly in the middle but its very gradual. The feel isnt anything I cant deal withCP for example is very dryingthere is some transfer for KVD LL but I can trade thet for comfort where as the CP usually no transfer no fade but my lips are dried out at the end of the day. Just my two cents  ,MakeupAddiction,d1b15d6,2,t5_2rww2
7012337,0,t1_d1b6uw4,It might not even need a heavy duty cover up unless you feel you need one.

I thought it was before I had it and dont get me wrong it really is a beautiful palette and very pigmented. That being said I feel like a lot of the looks from this palette are pretty similar. I mean its literally all based on warm tones. I love a good warm eye but I do feel like I cant get a lot of variation from the palette. Theres probably like  dark brown shades that literally all look the same on the eye.Granted I will say that the shimmery pink shade on the second row to the left is BEAUTIFUL and I would buy that single shadow again and again.

A few times a year they have  coupons that include prestige brands meaning UD Too Faced etc that platinum members get.  To reach platinum status you have to spend .  Im not sure if people who arent platinum ever receive the prestige coupon...Sephora has Beauty Insider VIB and VIB Rouge.   times a year they have sales in the spring BI and VIB get  off and VIB Rouge gets  and in the fall I believe its  for everyone.  I have ulta platinum and sephora VIB Rouge so I only know what I get.  If anything its worth it to at least sign up for the rewards program to get some of the coupons.  And my recommendation is to buy everything from Ulta vs Sephora unless of course there is something you want from Sephora that Ulta doesnt carry.  Ultas rewards program is far superior. ,MakeupAddiction,d1l2kxg,1,t5_2rww2

7150606,0,t1_d1qx37f,Yes! I saw a video where someone color corrected their under eye area with red lipstick in a big triangle that went down near the mouth. I dont know how they get their foundation to cover it even. Magic sorcery or a ring light maybe,MakeupAddiction,d1qy9yd,35,t5_2rww2
7151774,0,t1_d1qvbbc,Yeah there really is a lack of creativity in Asian beauty bloggers which is unfortunate since it gives off the impression that thats all you can really do. I know for a long time I thought that was the only kind of look I could do with monolids since it was the only one Id ever see online. Even smoky eyes and things like that were just color variations of that general idea.I really like experimenting with color and eyeshadow placement but it does broadcast my gyopo status in Korea pretty loudly.

7157488,0,t3_4diih9,Mascara. So many people even on this subreddit have tried to convince me that drugstore mascara is comparable but I just havent found one that compares. I use Buxom Lash. Every time Ive tried to save by using something else  Maybelline Loreal Covergirl NYX Rimmel  its been nowhere near as good. Loreal Voluminous is close as far as shape of the brush and consistency but it clumps way more and it smears under my eyes.

7160858,0,t1_d1ryvld,I am gonna pass some info to you that ustefani gave to me since I had  Drunk elephant items in my cart for this Sephora sale. Dermstore.com has Drunk Elephant and you can get  off and also  from ebates. The code is justu. I have basically tried everything except their SPF moisturizer. The Glycolic serum works miracles. It erased all the texture from my face and improved any fine lines I was starting to get also it made my face soft as shit. The day serum made my complexion super even and lightened some discolorations I had it also boosts your sunscreen effectiveness by an obscene amount so future sun damage is less likely to happen. I found the Pekee bar a little bit too drying for my super dry skin but I use it from time to time when I have a lot of crap on my face. I would pass on the eye serum. I love the texture...it really soaks in and doesnt irritate my eyes whatsoever. Its really lightweight and its good for daytime but honestly for the price I did not notice any difference at all besides it moisturizing my under eye and if youre going to pay  for a skincare product it better do something. All in all I HIGHLY recommend the Drunk Elephant line. Its seriously awesome and improved my skin a shit ton. If you can get it for  off then I say go for it. I believe its free shipping as well. I second what ubloodmoons said Stephanie Nicole knows her shit although she doesnt like the Glycolic night serum but thats personal preference,MakeupAddiction,d1s4ci8,5,t5_2rww2

7164191,0,t1_d1rnyl1,I find the whole cool warm to be needlessly vague and inaccurate for a lot of people who dont fall into typical makeup rules.You look like you have peach undertones so warm pink sounds crazy no? but yes your skin looks peachy. Sometimes this is called neutral. edit to clarify You may find the pink foundations work best but that theyre off somehow but warm lipsticks and blushes like peachy and muted warm reds and warm corals suit you best. ,MakeupAddiction,d1si0ej,2,t5_2rww2

7170356,0,t3_4dpffe,I bought the palette and Im disappointed to say I dont reach for it as much as I thought I would primarily because I already have so many shades similar to the ones in the palette with that being said I do have to say jelly is such a beautiful color that buying the whole palette just for that one color almost seems justified. If youre still on the fence about the palette there are dupes for both peanut brittle and jellybut I would recommend purchasing the palette because the cost of the palette is about the same price youd pay for the dupes.Dupe for jelly MACs Stars N Rockets Dupe for peanut brittle  Kat Von Ds Harpsichord ,MakeupAddiction,d1t7ai8,5,t5_2rww2

I think Sephora sells Tonymoly masks but for an absurd price.My favorites are Etude House masks I always get the snail ones and the honey ones. Hyaluronic acid is good too and tea tree and green tea ones I get for when I have breakouts. I also like Naexy masks and there are these cute animal ones by SNP and The Face Shop. I love Etude Houses Play  pencils they have a HUGE range and any color can be used on eyebrow lip or eye. I have a pretty pearlescent peach one that I use for the inner corners of my eyes it is  and  is my perfect brow shade. You should look at some websites like jolse.com or etudehouse.com and browse products for ideas of what you might be interested in.My skincare routine is entirely Korean well Asian I guess some of the masks I use are Chinese or Japanese depending on the day but most of my makeup is Western stuff.If you visit rasianbeauty I think you can find a LOT of ideas of things to get there are lots of haul posts so you can see what types of things are available and what they look like. ,MakeupAddiction,d1ui1he,1,t5_2rww2

7188870,0,t1_d1v88cp,Maybe Im crazy and never noticed but I notice more this wont make me look ashy unlike stuff that works for paler skintones kinda blanket statement stuff like that. I DO notice that gurus will say something like this would look better on darker skintones or this makes me look orange and would probably work for someone else I could swear Tati even said this recently about a bronzer? I dunno... But I dont think those are the statements youre looking for? Unless thats as deep as this addressing should go which I do notice. Most of the time theyre buying products for their skintones. Why would you discuss what it would look like on someone who isnt going to buy that shade in the first place? And I think if its not a contour or bronzer or highlighter whatever its really hard to assume what some products may look like on others. Biggest product culprit Ive noticed lately is lipsticks. It seems like a tossup until someone tries a color family on their own face and finds out what works for them personally. And again Im not watching people that dont look like me cause Im looking to buy their shade of products just performance. Maybe were going to have to agree to disagree haha I just dont think they absolutely need to talk about other skintones. Sure it might help when other youtubers mention it... butttt that advice doesnt always work out either. Like some powders mentioned by Wayne Goss specifically? Nope still give me a white cast no matter how little I apply. I think Lisa Elridge is in another category than some of the gurus. Like... theres MUAs and then theres gurus. And theres former MUAs. And MUAs that just work with certain peoplelookswhatever. I cant expect someone to address what theyre honestly not familiar with or not comfortable with if it isnt really their job or at least who theyre marketing their videos towards. This can go either way of course. I think a lot of products Jackie Aina for instance would never work on paler skin and its okay that she doesnt say this cause common sense is a thing. But maybe I put too much faith in people lol! But I like to draw. I like to draw women and portraits. Id hope nobody expected me to discuss illustrating other things I just dont.. do? Thats not what I put myself out there for. Its nice to be knowledgeable and wellrounded in other aspects but I just dont believe thats their goal and I dont believe someone should hold them accountable for addressing topics they arent involved with in daily life.Edit for the lipstick thing I mean yeah you can say if youre warm toned you do this if youre cool etc. but those are just... color theory rules that I think can be learned in a different video or whatever. Id rather see how well it lasted if it was too drying if its creamy etc. than always being told well if youre this do this cause.. Theyre trying out shades for themselves rather than me. How good a product performs I think is the focus in most typical guru videos and for tutorials Im looking for techniques. Heaven help me if I think its a smart idea to buy the same colors someone with a different skin tone uses. Usually someone will say this is too warmcooletc. for me and thats enough addressing of the subject Id think? I feel like Im rambling and repeating myself ha.,MakeupAddiction,d1vba89,3,t5_2rww2

They do get money out of it anyway plus the added hype if something limited edition gets sold out in minutes earning them cult status so from their perspective I think its only a win.

7223551,0,t3_4ecrsc,First thank you for posting this really interesting question. Second I agree with all of our fellow intelligent MUAs. As long as youre going to invite him to sit in on your next practice session maybe get him even more involved. Explain to him again that men can now equally choose with women to wear makeup and maybe show him some of the cool guys here on MUA or on YouTube. Put some minimal natural makeup on him and after the inevitable initial silliness wears off ask him how he feels and how he thinks he looks. I bet hell be surprised at his newfound confidence! More than that he might consider wearing makeup for the actual big day for pictures. Im going to be cosplaying costume playing with my boyfriend at a convention this summer and Ive convinced him to wear makeup for pictures too. Matte powders will keep reflective shiny oil and sweat to a minimum so that he doesnt look ill or pale in photos really subtle contour will bring out his manly bone structure and primer will minimize the look of his crater pores but maybe thats too individual. Maybe that will make Feminist Fiance feel better?Another way to explain makeup to him is as artistic expression. Im far from a girlygirl but playing with colors and combinations on my face lets me express how I feel or even change my mood. You can perhaps suggest that your coworker wants to have shiny eye shadow because Feminist Fiance makes her feel shiny on the inside she wants lashes because he makes her feel flirty coy a little shy and like batting her lashes she wants wings because he makes her heart flutter she wants a little lipstick because she loves kissing him ect.,MakeupAddiction,d1z9i0q,1,t5_2rww2

I did have one that was a bit runny when I first opened it but I swirled the applicator around in the tube and pumped it in and out a few times basically mixed it up and it turned into the same creamy texture as my other ones. To me they apply like a liquid lipstick but they wear more like a bullet lipstick takes longer to fully dry down. But I dont find them to be runny at all. ,MakeupAddiction,d284jj8,3,t5_2rww2

7342329,0,t3_4fx7ae,Make sure you moisturize with a moisturizer specifically for oily skin Clinique makes really nice moisturizers in my opinion. Also using primer is super important I have oily skin too and Smashbox Photo Finish primer works really great to keep it under control. For pores NYX pore filler works really well and its a primer as well! A good primer will assure your makeup lasts all day and minimize oiliness.Im not sure about drugstore foundation but more higher end foundations have ones specifically for any skin type.For dry spots which I get really badly sometimes what I do is after washing my face with cleanser every night I will wash it again with coconut oil and I wont wash it all the way off and when I pat my face dry there is still a thin film of the coconut oil left. You would think it would add to the oiliness or cause you to break out but it doesnt it really works wonders for dry spots or dry skin! Just make sure the next morning you wash it all off with cleanser before you apply makeup.,MakeupAddiction,d2crtp0,2,t5_2rww2

Its mauve but very natural on me looks like a more polished version of my bare lips. It pulls purple grey on warm skin but looks very natural on cool skin. Bare with Me is supposed to be a soft warm pink but on me it pulls peach and works as a peachy nude. It doesnt wash me out though because it has a lot of pink mixed in with the peach so its still very wearable. I really enjoy this one. I dont have Truffle but it has brown undertones mixed with the mauve so Id avoid it. Anything with brown in it pulls straight poop brown on me and sucks all of the color out of my face so I avoid those.

7372175,0,t3_4gbgki,I am so sorry your local Ulta staff sucks  I work at Ulta so I will give you a little inside scoop on the return policy. Basically if you return it within sixty days and it is less than half used you are totally and completely within rights of returning it. If you have the receipt or used your rewards card you get it back in the exact form you paid in. HOWEVER unfortunately our computer system is not perfect and sometimes transactions wont show up even though you used your rewards card! This is equally frustrating for the customer and the employee because they cant do anything to fix the situation. But if this happens in the future and you are unable to find your receipt you can call Ulta customer service and they will email you or the store manager a copy of the receipt!! I have actually had to call Ulta customer service myself once and it was a snap. No long wait time at all and the people were very friendly and helpful. But besides that you should totally return those products. Just try to be nice to the employees and they are more likely to be nice to you.

But it really depends on what you personally want and how those different items make you feel. For myself I know Im never going to wear a magenta baby pink or purple I dont feel comfortable wearing them. You dont always need one of every color.,MakeupAddiction,d2grcx1,7,t5_2rww2

7381343,0,t1_d2gubj1,Oh no Im  on board with you. I would say we probably got maybe  or  of the palettes in stock? And like five of each of the lipstick shades. Its more than weve gotten before on limited edition stuff so Ill give them that. The same thing happened with all the Minnie Mouse Sephora Collection stuff. The quality is largely sub par and everyone lost their shit and had to have all of it just because it was Minnie Mouse. Companies have figured out you stick something gimmicky together make it LE and people will eat it up. See the peach palette. That was an absolute shit show across the board. I think my store got in maybe eight or nine total if that. Take one away to tester and we sold out in probably two days. I thought someone was gonna take our heads off when we told them it was gone and not coming back because the brand literally has none left.

If I had to pin it down Id say there are two main things that I would adjust. First they go a teeny bit too far in to the inside. Space them out just a smidge. Second the fact that they are one width from inside to outside isnt flattering. A little thicker on the inside going to a taper after your arch would look a lot better in my opinion. ,MakeupAddiction,d2ttt6h,2,t5_2rww2

7497875,0,t3_4i25bp,TLDR My face looks a bit older than yours so I use Olay serum.  I know women in their s who swear by it too. Wash face once a day serum twice a day green color corrector plus a lightweight makeup try a mineralbased sunscreen like CeraVe. Dont be afraid to use some products only on part of your face.  For what its worth heres what I do  Me  dry cheeks and lip corners oily nose amp chin. Pale with blue undertones dark hair very light eyes tendency towards redness from windsuneating the wrong things.  Allergic to many makeup ingredients and to chemical sunscreens. A little bit of acne if I eat too much wheat.PM Wash face with First Aid Beauty Cleanser.  This seems gentle enough that it doesnt make my face red. Smooth on Olay Regenerist Serum which has been a godsend in terms of evening out fine lines shrinking pores and generally making me look more awake. If my face is dry I use some Andalou Naturals Rose Cream over the serum which really is more like a lightweight gel moisturizer.  If its REALLY dry Ill put on some CeraVe night cream on the dry spots. AM Splash face with cool water pat dry.  I dont wash more than once a day because it dries out my skin. Olay serum again. Over that I wear CeraVe Invisible Zinc sunscreen.  Its a barrier sunscreen the zinc and not chemical so Im not allergic to it! The sunscreen feels like it takes a bit to settle on my faceso I wait five minutes or so and then put on Urban Decays Naked Skin makeup. If Im really red Ill use something like the Smashbox Color Corrector in green or the almostaseffective NYX corrector before the Naked Skin.  That makeup was a gamechanger for me. It feels light while still giving the coverage I need and kind of evening out my skin tone. I totally recommend it as a step up from drugstore makeup if youre thinking about it because it doesnt irritate my sensitive skin stays in place and looks good!  Hope that some of this is helpful. ,MakeupAddiction,d2ugwz6,2,t5_2rww2

7509660,0,t3_4i6s3z,Sorry in advance for this block of text! I was on Accutane a year and a half ago. First off make sure you consider everything else before going on it because it seriously messes you up. Everything is dry. Your lips nose skin. It gets worse before it gets better too. For the first two months my acne was actually worse. I didnt even bother wearing face makeup those two months because it was irritating and didnt sit well even with moisturizer and primer and anything else I tried to hydrate my skin. My lips were a mess and my nose was so dry I slept with vaseline stuffed up in it.After it started actually getting better my MUFE HD foundation wasnt cutting it. It didnt sit right. So I got a few MAC samples and none of those really worked with my skin either. I tried Tarte because someone told me that was great for dry skin but since Im super pale I never found that great shade match.Long story short I ended up with YSLs ysl teint touche eclat foundation which was a lot of . It worked perfectly for me though. It stayed on without getting weird patchy spots for the majority of my day and it didnt leave me skin feeling extra drytinglypainful ect. As for removing the makeup that was a challenge. I found that most of my makeup removers were too harsh so I moved on to baby oil with cotton balls. I washed with CeraVe sp? and used their moisturizer religiously. Still caused dryness though. Theres like zero chance of escaping that.I was on Accutane for eight months majority of those months were spent on the same dose. They up it every month but they factor your weight in as well. I was around  at that point and maxed out pretty quickly. I got off it and maintained with Trention cream which worked well until my GP switched my BC pills. Its not as bad as it was before Accutane though. So downfalls of Accutane Dryness monthly labs monthly questionaires about dangers of the drug gets worse before it gets better and for me at least made me puke every time I drank alcoholPros Works pretty damn well but the results are never guaranteed perfect  Con within a proHope this helps! ,MakeupAddiction,d2vt70h,1,t5_2rww2

I just thin you have slight redness on your cheeks which is normal and easily correctable with green.

7555152,0,t3_4isztn,I dont have any Sephora brushes so I cant personally vouch for quality but I hear they are on par with MAC in terms of quality. Genuinely good brushes do cost a lot. I started with ELF brushes which were super cheap when I was starting out and then graduated to Morphe which someone else mentioned. I like the Morphe brushes but they arent that amazing tbh. Theyre decent midrange brushes but after a while they do start to fall apart. Also if you are going to buy Morphe dont buy the kits with like  or  brushes because the quality really suffers I bought my mom one of those and I felt really bad because they were kinda atrocious. I have one of the  brush kits and its was decent for the price Hautelook has Morphe on sale pretty often.ELF is super cheap so I wouldnt suggest buying them anything from ELF because all their products are under ten dollars so they can probably buy them by themselves and ELF has quite a few duds which makes sense at that price point.The Star Wars line was nothing revolutionary tbh it wouldnt necessary recommend anything from it.Liquid lipsticks are kinda the hype right now almost every brand sells them. Personally I would recommend either the Kat Von D ones or the Anastasia ones. The Kylie lip kits are super popular but a youre gonna have trouble getting your hands on them and b people have a lot of mixed feelings about their quality and their hype and the Kardashians.For the one with the Urban palette consider one of the Tartelette palettes a Shade and Light quad these are new mini palettes of the Shade and Light eye a Naked palette or the MUFE Artist shadows vol  I know someone suggested the Gwen Stefani UD palette but unless your daughter is very palefair think Gwens skin tone a lot of the neutrals might look the same on her which is a complaint a lot of people had about it.For the daughter with the Kat Von D palette maybe the new Sephora Minnie Mouse palette UD Spectrum or MUFE artist shadows vol  or Good luck this is super nice of you I wish my dad took an interest in these things,MakeupAddiction,d30zgmw,17,t5_2rww2

7580142,0,t3_4j3xg3,Just wanted to add I am  and started wearing makeup about a year and a half ago. I was one of the last girls in school to wear makeup and I always thought I was just ugly I didnt realize that other girls in school were wearing makeup.My mom actually suggested that she could take me to the mall to buy makeup as soon as thirteen. I always saw my older sister putting on makeup and I hated it she took forever to get ready and always looked at herself in mirrors I felt it was narcissistic. So naturally I hated makeup. When I got a bit older I understood the appeal and that she wasnt narcissistic at all she was just checking her makeup or she was feeling confident. Makeup is one of my very favorite things now. I feel its an artistic outlet for me and also lets me define who I am. I have suffered I hate that word with depression and I know that on a really shitty day doing my makeup will help me feel more like myself. I also have bad anxiety and I constantly worry about how other people see me. Wearing makeup helps me feel confident with how I present myself to the world.I dont think  is too young at all if anything its the perfect age for learning how to do your makeup. Its old enough so she wont do anything too embarrassing but its also an opportune time so she goes in to the adult world feeling confident with the image she puts out of herself.If you need help putting together a beginner kit for her let me know! I also have some good Youtube channel recommendations if she wants any. Im sorry if any of this was typed up weird its almost  am here and Im exhausted!,MakeupAddiction,d33tq55,7,t5_2rww2

7584216,0,t1_d348p7b,Same situation in terms of Sephora and flash shipping. Im looking for some pretty heavy coverage foundation since my strategy at this point is to either mix with moisturizer in order to make it lighter or to just use it in lieue of concealer in some areas because I figure its better to tone down a heavy foundation than not have one thats strong enough. I have been using Lancomes Teinte Idol foundation for the past five years and not only do I still have a ton but it seemed to still work which is why even though it was old I didnt feel like getting rid of it. Its the shade  Ivoire if that helps. I dont know my skin tone detailsnumber unfortunately since the Sephora is about an hour and a half away so for me its always been about matching colors manually. That said I have no idea how foundation really works. I got it when I was a fresh teen and a sales assistant did all the matching for me so I dont know the mechanics of matching it at this point. Oh one other note Ive observed that the foundation matches me better in the spring is too light in the summer and too orange in the winter so obviously my skin color is changing more than I notice.,MakeupAddiction,d34ae29,1,t5_2rww2

7591113,0,t3_4j3xg3,Im in my s. Honestly many of the girls were wearing makeup in th and th grade and I was sneaking a few things from my mothers stash by th. Christmas when I was in th grade my mother gave me blush mascara and a lip gloss for Christmas. I was . My mother doesnt wear much makeup...her mother always did a bit for work and church and I always had a bit of an affection for it starting with Halloween and also getting to use a bit of lipstick when my grandma was getting ready for church.Anyway I bring up my age just so it doesnt seem like a generational gap thing. I definitely think its an age appropriate interest. I think it took guts to ask...I had a lot of trouble asking my mother who had been a good parental figure who was very supportive and loving about shaving my legs! Or...I had been having my period for a year before my mom got me tampons prior to a vacation. It was like Wait these were an option this whole time?!Its hard to be dependent on someone else for your personal care and grooming needs. I cant imagine how hard it would be having discussions like that with someone youve only known a few months.Anyway I think makeup can be a great method for selfexpression. You wash it off at the end of the day. And while many people dont feel its necessary there are quite a few professional environments where it does end up being encouraged. If she wants to experiment now she will probably pick up some knowledge and skills that she can use later if she has to.I think it would be good for it to part of a way to budget her allowancepocket moneypay from summer job. I dont think makeup should be seen as a necessity necessarily although I generally dont go out without makeup because I hate a missed opportunity to play with my face.If you want to draw the line at certain types of looks I suppose that would be fair. But its weird. My mom never wanted me wearing strong lip colors when I was a teen but compliments the hell out of me wearing red lipstick now. ,MakeupAddiction,d352log,1,t5_2rww2

7619847,0,t3_4jon9e,If youre wearing foundation then yes people will notice that you are wearing makeup. Unless theyre really oblivious to what makeup looks like. I am a guy too and I wear makeup to cover my acne and redness. Trust me people notice when I wear it but I dont exactly use sheer foundation.As for application I find a BB can give the most natural or flawless finish depending on how much foundation you use.As for being embarrassed I completely understand. However most people are mature adults and they wont really say anything to make you feel uncomfortable for being a guy wanting makeup.  And to cover scars completely youre probably gonna have to use concealor which is pretty heavy so it wont be undetectable.  Although this is also totally dependent on how dark the scars are. Lighter scars can be hidden with a lightly tinted loose powder this is what I used to do when my skin was clear which can be undetectable if it matches your skin tone well.,MakeupAddiction,d38c56t,8,t5_2rww2

Its not very high coverage though if youre concerned about acne.    For reference I wear shade  and Im NCish.  The shade selection is quite small and rather confusing but it seems to cater very well to EasternSouthern Asian skin tones.   I usually add concealer in spots I need it when I use it.  Beccas Aqua Luminous foundation seems to be primarly yellow undertoned shades so you may want to check that out too.  Youd probably fit in one of their first  shades.

7672003,0,t3_4kduyn,Essential shades vary from person to person. Personally I think the essentials are a good red that matches your undertone a nude or a my lips but better color a pink and a vampy lip color I prefer dark purples as my vampy lip shades but others prefer dark reds or even black dark brown or blue. Its all about whatever you like.If youre looking for a good everyday shade and you already like your lips natural colors Id suggest looking into something like the Revlon Lip Butters. They have a nice wash of color that wont drown out your natural lip color. The nudes in that range are really nice imo. Also perhaps look at some of the new mood balms a bunch of brands have them I have the Pixi one and the ELF one but Lipstick Queen has two Hello Sailor and Frog Prince and Im sure other brands have them as well they react to your skins natural PH level and turn a nice shade of pink that usually isnt too bright. ,MakeupAddiction,d3e9g2r,3,t5_2rww2

7710779,0,t1_d3idg4l,I watched some one maybe MakeupGeek talk about how shes over colour corrector because youre just adding more layers and then you have to pile on more foundation to cover the colour corrector and I thought theres whats wrong with this trend  people dont understand the technique  theyre just jumping on the trend. If you colour correct its because you have something to correct. You dont need foundation to cover up the colour of the corrector because there is no colour. The corrector cancels out whatever its correcting and both become neutralized allowing you to use less foundation andor concealor on top. Colour correctors dont add  they just neutralize when used effectively. Frick  that was like Dr Suesss Colour Correcting Conundrum there or something.,MakeupAddiction,d3inwrr,22,t5_2rww2

When I first got Magic Wand and Littlestitious magic wand definitely felt like a more true nude with just a tad less pink in it and I thought for sure that this one was going to be the same as exposed. Nope! Exposed has significantly less pink in it than both the ColourPOP colors so depending on your skin tone one may be a better nude for you than the other. Overall all three colors are absolutely beautiful and Im definitely going to get A LOT of use out of all three. Formula Ive heard a lot of reviews saying the formula for the Kylie lip kits vary from color to color so this comparison  is only for the shade exposed. I put this color on around  this morning to test how long it would wear. At  it still had not budged! Absolutely no transfer at all! I ended up taking it off so I could lip swatch the other two products. This formula definitely has some serious staying power! It was also really flexible on the lips and comfortable to wear all day I didnt experience any crumbling. When it comes to the ColourPOP products I do find them to be flexible and comfortable to wear. I also find myself having to reapply every  hours or so Im an avid lip licker haha and do experience some crumbling after eating. For the  price tag however this doesnt really bother me. To show the staying power I included a picture of when I tried to wipe off the swatches. I wiped pretty hard about three times back and forth with a microfiber cloth and you can see how exposed held on compared to the others I was pretty surprised by this and thought the picture would help show what great staying power this color has! ,MakeupAddiction,d3pl32v,12,t5_2rww2

7776113,0,t1_d3q29az,I find that theyre overly critical of bad ingredients such as alcohol and fragrance . Their reviews can be kind of like This contains alcohol so  star. I mean its nice of them to let me know about a potentially irritating ingredient but I would prefer their rating system be more about the performance of the product.Also they have their own skincare line. I dont feel like theyre too biased i.e. they dont have any reviews that are advertising their own products over a reviewed product but its something to keep in mind you know?Overall I think their reviews are pretty good but I always look for multiple reviews on the performance of a product.,MakeupAddiction,d3q2x6d,7,t5_2rww2
7776291,0,t3_4ltsqu,I know that since Coty has the Extra Coverage part in its name it implies that it will add some color to your makeup. But the translucent implies that it wont change it an entire shade. However most online color previews show it as a more yellow toned powder. But compared to the Laura Mercier its clearly more pink toned. If you want the Coty Translucent Extra Coverage as a substitute for the Laura Mercier I wouldnt recommend it because of the color difference. I always wondered why my foundation seemed really off. Turns out it was the Coty powder. Also is it just me or does Coty only offer the three shades Naturally Neutral Honey Beige and Translucent Extra Coverage. Ive seen online pictures of other shades besides those three. But it doesnt seem to be available anywhere. Maybe the other shades were discontinued? ,MakeupAddiction,d3q3nc5,5,t5_2rww2

Origins A Perfect World  fifth sixth seventh? jar  this is my default AM moisturizer if theres not something Im testing and at this point I dont test as much skincare as I used to. Hydrating enough for my drier areas cheeks under eyes without leaving me greasy. It could sink in a little faster perhaps.

7782778,0,t1_d3ooi3p,I use the mascara up all they way and just dont throw it out. Ive tried cleaning the wand and just dipping it into the new tube but then that wand gets hard and crunchy without the tube around it being exposed to air. This means you have to wash it every time you want to put mascara on how annoying! So if youve got a tube thats almost done just let it dry out with the cap off. Then next time dip it in the new formula. Im sure theres a bit of mixing of formulas going on but I cant think of another way to do this method. So I essentially always have an old tube  where the mascara has dried up that houses the brush that I like in this case my Telescopic Shocking Extensions and I just dip it into the Loreal Miss Manga Black Angel to build my lashes. After Im done I put the Telescopic wand back in the Telescopic container. I wish I could find empty mascara tubes somewhere ,MakeupAddiction,d3qu56p,2,t5_2rww2

7786452,0,t3_4lys95,I use an oil cleanser that I need to get rid of.  Once or twice is good to get the makeup off and soften the hairs but too many times without switching will leave a residue.  I alternate or follow with either whatever baby shampoo is on hand or Dr. Bronner.Spot cleaning is face wipes or micellar water on a paper towel.  I have MUE brush spray but dont like the oily residue.  Edit Dr. Bronner as well.as other castile soaps does indeed lather even in very small amounts.  If youre in the US you may be able to find testers in a local food store like Whole Food Trader Joes MOMs Sprouts etc.  Put a few drops in your hand and go to the bathroom to wash like normal if you want to see before buying.

I dont like the fact that its parent company isnt cruelty free but its just difficult as a college student to ration out money sometimes for pricier buys like Too Faced and the like. Sloth I generally avoid contouring mostly because I dont think Ive quite gotten the hang of it and blush because I have a rosy complexion and even with full coverage foundation that doesnt go away.

There is zero oil control though like most stick foundations it is formulated for dry to very dry skin. If you are oily dont bother try their liquid. If you are combo get a matte primer and some good powder if you want to try this.Something Ive seen a lot with not just this foundation but with sticks in general especially with people who have only used liquids... You HAVE to set them. It doesnt matter if you have dry skin or you didnt have to set your previous foundation. Especially if you didnt sheer it out. If you dont set a stick foundation its going to transfer and move and be a sticky mess. People dont set commit user error then blame the product because out doesnt perform like a liquid people also tend to use too much but that happens with liquids too.,MakeupAddiction,d3uhtqv,1,t5_2rww2

I saw it on HSN once and they just swirled the brush around the entire palette mixing all the colors together and then applied it.

A lot have said that the lighter models will get more intricate work and creativity but that usually when ts their turn in the chair the MUAs kit doesnt have colors to work on them so they either do very minimal work or go super contrasty and bold different from the other makeup looks. Some have to bring their own makeup with them and some do their own makeup. Like at shows.

Though I can tell you right now Angels definitely doesnt do much for acne cuz Ive been having some acne chill on my right cheek for a while is definitely not going away as fast as I want it to despite using Angels twice a day.

7910039,0,t3_4nmp0m,Im not sure oh what exactly you can get your hands on there cause Im US based so Ill give a few options. Dermablend makes excellent covers for scarring or tattoos even. If they have one light enough I suggest them. The body one or the pot kind. KVD lock it foundation for sure comes in light shades and works well too for cover. Bliss makes a spray called Hide and glow seek thats a tinted body spray. You can use this alone depending on how full coverage you need or on top of something else. And lastly you can use coverfx drops. They are full on pigmented drops meant to mix into things for coverage more drops mean more color but they also can be used alone as concealer. Be sure to set anything with powder and setting spray if you plan to swim. ,MakeupAddiction,d455vy3,2,t5_2rww2

7919567,0,t3_4nopc0,Makeup when you dont feel well is such a double edged sword! It makes you feel centered and normal but it can also suck all your energy away for the day. Choosing between killer makeup and the energy to run an errand is infuriating. I have a chronic illness that makes me easily wiped out some days and its partially why Ive simplified my routine so much. I dont have a ton of makeup suggestions but a broad one. Apply makeup for fun and without a deadline when you can get tired after one eye and its fine to see what you prefer on yourself. Then do one or two things in the morning.  No one makeup item is necessary. Foundation eyebrows eye makeup can all be skipped if you dont have time or effort for them. I would try all the suggestions here and then distill it down to a low maintenance routine you regularly change up. Hope this helps!Edit seconding the bare minerals love stuff is super gentle! ,MakeupAddiction,d468ftz,2,t5_2rww2

It just kinda puts a smoothing texture on my lip but I dont find it too necessary. Its only  though so if you want to go ahead and try it. Liquid matte lipsticks can feel drying sometimes though I normally dont mind that much but the colourpop ones are horribly dry. I would really recommend Ofra ABH Lime Crime the Balm and Dose of Colors for liquid lipsticks I find them to be the least drying ones. Also Kat Von D but I have yet to try hers. My favorite ones are probably ABH and dose of colors. ,MakeupAddiction,d46mq7k,2,t5_2rww2

There is also the Viseart Neutral Matte and Tartlette matte palette that are popular.I think you could pick out some choice shimmer shades for a pop of color on the lid.

These are all in your price range theBalm on the higher end. Sleek is a bit hitandmiss ive found their palettes tend to have some nice colours mixed in with crappy ones and Ive not tried NYX yet. So just make sure you have a look at the Sleek testers before choosing a palette to make sure the one youre picking has more hits than misses Ive never used ChiChis eyeshadows but Ive swatched them in store and was pretty impressed I will probably end up buying some. Full price theyre about . They also have a really big extravaganza palette with something like  eye shadows half a dozen blusheshighlighters and two or three bronzers for like . Ive only seen that palette in Myer though not Target. Oh Terry White Chemists have theBalm too. At least my local one does! theBalm  love. I would love their Nude Dude palette but at  Im holding out til Christmas. I just bought their Balm Jovi makeup palette  eye shadows  blushes and  lip colours which was  from Target.As I said in a comment below Ive just ordered some Zoeva palettes off BeautyBay. Their spectrum range have  colours each and are around  while their regular palettes have  colours and are around . I have heard they can take about  weeks to ship to Australia because theyre coming from the UK and based on my experience while living in the UK  weeks is pretty standard for postage from the UK to Australia.

You have to be careful with palettes because the shadows can sometimes be worse quality from single shadows so I would take the get more bang from your buck comments with a grain of salt and do research beforehand. For example the Naked Basics is  but buying  single shadows would be . Yeah youll get more shadows for less but theres always the possibility you dont like the palette or dont use some of the colors. The possibility you DO is equally high but it is your choice in the end.

Doesnt have the super darkrich like ABH Modern Romance but for the cost  on Ultas site it covers a lot of the shades. Could specifically get singles of the darker reds even buy Buon Fresco from ABHs palette  they sell it as a single in pan form since it seems it may be a little more unique if you really like it. Ratings on Ultas site for that palette are also very good but idk if it compares to ABHs and LCs quality or it is subjective in terms of it is pretty great for a  palette. Potentially you could test it at an Ulta idk if they have testers for it though. Also it looks super washed out and nothing like the Venus palette on Ultas site  legit thought there was maybe a vol.  and vol.  since it doesnt look true to shade at all. But the first link looks pretty solid in comparisons.If you wanted darker reds and possibly Buon Fresco in with them potentially you could depot the palette and have it all in one place and a bit more curated.

Its important to ask where these insecurities arise. I dont think its a sign of weakness to be insecure about having a lot of acne or small eyes or whatever when our culture literally pushes an idealized version of femininity onto us everyday. Some people me included find solace in making ourselves closer to that ideal. Others choose to reject it completely. Both can be done via makeup no makeup makeup and neon feathers on my nose the biggest part of my face are examples. A lot of women feel pressured to wear makeup. I dont begrudge anyone for it we resist patriarchy in different ways.

8049163,0,t3_4pf45k,Im also wondering if I should get this palette. I have the feeling that more of the newer palettes that will be coming out in the next year or two will be cooler toned and will have more jewel tones eg serpetina moon dust and the cool toned palette KVD has been hinting at. I am warm toned and have a muted coloring. What looks best on me is warm neutrals. So Im thinking of getting this palette because I think that in the next year or two  the other newer palettes will not be for me. I also have the tartelette tease palette and the Tarte in bloom palette and the shadows in both work perfectly for my skincoloring  so Im a fan of this brand. However Im concerned about the glitter fallout and how well the shadows last. Its in store in July. So Ill swatch it out then. Then well see.,MakeupAddiction,d4ksv0e,2,t5_2rww2

8051260,0,t3_4pf8yg,You need to get some samples from Sephora get the shade they match you with and one shade lighter and go home put them on your jawline where it meets your neck. Go out in the sunlight and if in the sun it looks like it melts into your skin then it is the right color. This is really the only way to do it. Those lights at MAC and Sephora are terrible. All the color matching I had done was terrible. I always ended up with the wrong undertone and with foundation that was too dark.

8070336,0,t3_4pqb09,Better Than Sex is pretty good but its a heavy formula. Try a waterproof formula like Tartes Lights Camera Splashes. Its what I use and if I curl my lashes beforehand it really helps.

8070573,0,t3_4pq7zk,This was great entertainment hahaSo watching this a few things Id avoid using a knife the way she is. Even with the little palette knifes some zpalettes come with it is super easy to hit your shadow. Tbh I dont know that Ive really seen a Chocolate Bar come out fully intact BUT I also havent seen someone destroy one so much!So looking at one of my Chocolate Bar SemiSweet in honor of the one from the video  RIP it actually had one of the tabs sticking out which was alarming. So the way the board with the pans sits in the metal tin is it has some plastic tabs that hold under the lip of the metal casing. I lifted it up a little to look under and there is some glue so heating up the tin can help but she was doing it on the corners and it is really in the middle.Im not sure why she went at it with a knife from the start trying to get the board with the pans on it out  maybe the fake nails?? Like I was able to stick my thumb nail in and spread the tin out and see some of the tabs. The knife is just unnecessary hazard. Just from playing around with it a little if you take the lid off itll make getting the board out easier  you can spread the tin kind of like prying it apart on either side?? If that makes sense??. You may want to do this with someone to make it a little easier one person holding the tin the other getting the board out.As for getting the pans out after you get the board they are on out heating and removing is solid. She just seemed to be over the whole thing and wasnt trying to salvage the rest  with patience this palette could probably come out pretty nicely. And a palette knife will make it easier  she said her knife made it easier and ??????? no avoid a kitchen knife. I could see maybe a pear knife the really small kitchen type maybe working out.Also an alternative I noticed suggested on that video a MakeupByTiffanyD video showed depotting NARS shadows with floss. The packaging looks similar so I think it could be a better option.,MakeupAddiction,d4n7j41,2,t5_2rww2

8111389,0,t3_4q9fg4,All. the. time... and I HAVE to wear full face for work because I work in the industry. I usually do ok but sabotage still happens usually with liquid wing liner or mascara. The other day I was putting on my mascara and for whatever reason my hand went wonky and I brushed the top of my lid under my eyebrow with all of my eyeshadow already done. It was a light nude... I tried to fix it and it was just... tragic. I fixed it the best I could and had to go to work and hope I blended it enough to pass. Sometimes when I do my wing corners my skin will pull weird for whatever reason. I am very gentle but I have deepset eyes so unfortunately this is unavoidable sometimes... and then I get REALLY FREAKING WEIRD wing shapes that I must try to salvage. And then of course since I have allergies there are times Ill get my whole face done leave for work and get a runny nose in the car. Then I spend the rest of the dabbing and blending and praying things dont get blotchy right under the nose. Ahhh the joys of makeup. ,MakeupAddiction,d4rskgb,2,t5_2rww2

Of course everything they do is marketing though. Theyre a company and their end goal is to make money. Youre right about MAC not coming out with anything innovative lately but thats hardly the fault of Lauder. Part of the reason why MAC releases SO many collections is probably to try and make up that money that it doesnt get that Lauders other huge brands like Este Lauder and Clinique do in fragrance sales and skincare. I dont think Ive ever met a single person that wears MAC perfume or used MAC skincare. As far as the nostalgia thing I dont get it.

8127098,0,t1_d4tcbgv,Whats your skin like and what coverage are you looking for? I have both foundations and love both but for different reasons.  My skin is pretty normal right now though I was dry for awhile and both worked well for me.  The MJ gives a really full coverage lasts forever and feels weightless.  The downsides are it is messy to use and awful for travel has a big learning curve for application is very easy to overdo and can look cakey if not applied right. It was a matte finish though tended to get a bit oily after a full  hour day.  The Armani is a lighter coverage a bit more luminous than the MJ and was a more traditional foundation texture therefore a lot easier to apply and work with.  Both are good but I consider them very different.  Also the Armani is pricey. ,MakeupAddiction,d4tk5bb,2,t5_2rww2

I got it because it was cheap and I was out I needed something on the fly and it turned out to the best foundation I have ever used Cover Girl Ready Set Gorgeous! It sets nicely it lasts all day with a good primer and setting spray it doesnt sink into pores or wrinkles it blends like a pro and it is incredibly buildable. The color is spot on can never match high end colors why are they all so yellow??? and doesnt get orangey late in the day and never has looked cakey. I just cannot say enough about this foundation its everything I want and more. Of course they will probably discontinue it soon because I love it.

8201017,0,t3_4rn3k1,Ive decided to pass on it. I already have a full size of Dandelion and I also have a holiday kit from  has majority of the same products. Bc there is a quality difference in those I was tempted to get Cheekathon despite repeats but then I saw that a lot werent like the singles. The main ones I initially wanted were Dallas and Hoola maybe Rockateur. Hoola Ive decided to pass on I dont use bronzer a whole lot and already have enough for my needs plus the holiday kit is usable. Rockateur Idk if I really want it so Im holding off. But Im about to buy Dallas with a Groupon voucher. That was the main one I wanted I dont even have it in my holiday kit and Im more likely to use it as a single tbh.The pricing of the palette makes it super tempting but for me I either have the singles or smaller pan sizes of similar quality in the holiday set. I also kind of realised I was using the deal to justify getting the whole palette when in reality I really just want Dallas.The lacking quality is disappointing but tbh it still is a pretty solid deal. If you dont have singles and arent trying to replace them it still looks like a pretty solid palette for the money. But you could also get the singles of what you really want.,MakeupAddiction,d52oir2,1,t5_2rww2

8215499,0,t3_4ruus8,Hey! I love the color palette youve got going on in this look. This is a beautiful autumnal look the berry tones in the lips and the eyes are incredibly complementary to your coloring and the halo eye that youve got going on is so beautiful. A blending on that eye. Big fan of the white on the lower lashline as well! It allows this look to still be somewhat casual whereas if you swiped it out for a black on that waterline itd be far more dramatic. I love that! Your eyebrows are also absolutely beautiful.A few things for cc. This isnt necessarily about your makeup but Im having a really hard time seeing your full face of makeup with the angles that youve taken the photos with. I crept your posting history and you seem to have taken many photos with your face showing from the front so keep that up! Its pretty hard to see the final look from a  highupabove angle.As for your makeup the only real thing that I could suggest is trying to add a bit more coverage to the center of your face I dont think you NEED it at all you have beautiful skin but it appears to me that your forehead and chinjaw area are one tone and the strip along your cheeks and nose are showing a bit more red. Im not sure if its a blending issue or what but it sort of distracts me from the overall beauty of the look.,MakeupAddiction,d54hqb4,6,t5_2rww2

Anyways what Im wearing is Dior Airflash Foundation in  linen Marc Jacobs Flesh and Fantasy blush UD Naked Skin concealer in light warm mixed with the medium light under my eyes Laura Mercier setting powder under the eyes Laura Gellar Gilded Honey highlighterAlright so the review is on the blush! I think its absolutely STUNNING! I love it! It went on so easy and blended so well its just the perfect peachy nude!  The arm swatch shows the shades separately swatched then what it looks like blended all together on the right.  I only have applied it blended together as I think thats what youre meant to do.  I did NOT test for longevity yet sorry utemptalia  Ill get back to you on that lol but so far so good! I think it works well for my light skin with oliveyellow undertones Im currently between NCNC maybe closer to NC but I think it may be too dark for those who are NCNW  or lighter.The blush itself is much larger than I expected as well!

Only tell the salesperson you want a match or theyll try to talk you into products you dont need. Ask for a sample of the foundation to take home with you youre allowed up to three I suggest go for different finishescoverages.

And the weird cutoff on the top and bottom of what should be a normal message screen means he didnt screenshot the photo from his phone either he sent it to himself from an outside source.

Her video still felt more genuine to me and less scripted than Jeffrees.Also Im a huge supporter of medical marijuana as well as recreational marijuana. Im fully aware of the health and pain relief benefits and didnt mention marijuana in my comment at all. My point was Jeffrees hypocrisy in defending himself against Kats comment. Insinuating that she might no longer be sober and calling out her hard drug use is way more defamatory than referring to his Snapchat outbursts as tweakerish.And I think its important to note that Jeffree has drug and alcohol references in many of his songs so even if its true that hes never had a sip of alcohol in his life he has plenty of lyrics that suggest that he has as well references to pills cocaine and heroine.Edit Formatting on mobile,MakeupAddiction,d5mztzu,4,t5_2rww2

It took forever to set and you definitely had to use the goss method primer powder then liquid foundation to get it to hold up and wait a while before the next step. And then a solid setting spray was a must. Its also better for dry skin but gives a lovely dewy look. There are definitely much better reeasier foundations out there.  But dang it made me look good.I will say that their bb creamtinted moisturizer complexion rescue or something like that? is way better way easier and definitely my holy grail. I had used the Laura Mercier foundation in between and I love that too but its very heavy. Its fuller coverage than I need. ,MakeupAddiction,d5pxbco,1,t5_2rww2

I hate to rant on like a pale princess that I know this sub hates or try to compete with you on how I must be paler than you but I find this is the only bronzer that is not too dark or two orange for my pale skin because its so easy to have a light hand and you can build it up if you want. I use a big ecotools soft domed bronzer brush and have never had any issues with it not showing up and I have it in the shade light. I threw away the little sponge that came with it though because it doesnt show up on skin well with that.,MakeupAddiction,d5q7hm5,1,t5_2rww2

8391837,0,t3_4uk9hi,Your skin is so clear that you dont really need foundation. I hated foundation and I dont wear it at all now even BB creams unless theres a special event. What I would do is just use concealer. I really like the Makeup Forever color corrector because it isnt cakey at all. NYX is cakey so I wouldnt recommend that.Try picking up a yellow concealer from Sephora their yellow gel concealer and then you can either get a skin toned concealer NARS is great to go over that or even see if you can just dot a bit of foundation over it. If you want you can ask a Laura Mercier counter for a sample of their translucent powder which they usually have in a mini container. This you can use to dust over the area where you applied the concealer to set that area  prevent smudging. I found that it takes some time to get used to makeup on the face so just start off minimally. Also stay away from the makeup artists at Sephora. They tend to cake on makeup. While that may be ok for them and others for many of us that dont like a lot of it it makes it more uncomfortable to start makeup.Try looking at JKissas tutorials where she applies concealer just to the inner area of her eyes you dont need the full triangle like many bloggers will do.Btw while many people do like MAC I found that its a bad place to start if you want minimal makeup first. Their products can cake up or clog pores fairly easily and their reps will try to make you feel like you need every one of their products. You dont. Also try to get concealers that are in a tube and more liquidy since this is closer to under the eyes. The creamier ones in the pots are for face spot concealing and cake up.,MakeupAddiction,d5qizcv,5,t5_2rww2

8499041,0,t3_4w394f,Hello all  Has anyone got a dupe for NYX round lipstick in Haute Melon? Love the color but the formula somehow manages to be greasystreaky and clump up.The next two closest dupes on Temptalia are a Tom Ford one which is a bit above my budget right now or a UD Revolution lipstick which is being discontinued.Im flexible on the finish so long as it has no glitter in it but I would prefer a bullet not a liquid to matte lipstick. So far Vegas Volt seems like it might be a decent match if not a little too pink but I was hoping for some other opinions. Thanks in advance! ,MakeupAddiction,d63xjud,2,t5_2rww2

8584832,0,t3_4xe7di,My feedback would be to have a lighter hand when placing eyeliner on the lower eyelideye area. If you get too thick it can make your eye seemed closed off and smaller. I would try to just apply in the waterline here you would want to use a pencilkohl liner vs a liquid liner and then maybe blend it out. I have also liked using a dark brown in my waterline when I do a winged eye since it still gives me some definition on my eye but isnt quite as dark which bring the attention back to those schweet wings.

8604354,0,t3_4xnznz,Nowhere near a physician yet? but I do work as a clinical tech in a nationallyranked NICU and I figured Id offer my input! Most of the RNs NNPs and MDs I see regularly keep it pretty lowkey. Personally I feel like I wear too much compared to them sometimes and my basics are foundation concealer setting powder blush clear brow gel and mascara  primer gotta keep the face on for  hour shifts!. I have seen nurses from other units that go much more all out so far as to apply falsies to finish off their look. Ive worn eyeshadow here and there but always make it a point to keep it practical and approachable. I think it may really depend on your setting and your patient demographic too.My main concern with my day to day makeup since Ive started this job has always been longevity though. When Im running around interacting with parents measuring out breastmilk drawing labs changing diapers etc. the last thing on my mind is touching up my makeup!,MakeupAddiction,d6h5007,9,t5_2rww2

8608645,0,t3_4xpl8g,After the first procedure they fade significantly. In fact mine turned a funny medium grey color. She used mud pie and a touch of toffee and it still faded out A LOT. I wouldnt recommend anymore harsh scrubbing because that is likely to damage your already roughed up skin.It will also cause the color to bleed and fuzz out more leaving you with a bigger issue.My brows looked great initially  really crisp hair like strokes and then it went to shit. Fuzzy lines and bled out. All that despite not allowing water to touch them.Check into tattoo fade creams. Ive also read Vaseline will pull color out but be sure to  ask the professionals about that.But I would definitely ask around the qualified artists what kind of effect it will have first. You dont want to cause any bleeding of color while you try correct the mistakes of the last procedure.Overall Ive learned that too many microbladers are claiming they are professional but in reality have little practical experience.The pictures they post are usually the before and immediate after never showing the  weeks out or longer when it bleeds and looks crummy.,MakeupAddiction,d6hocy8,7,t5_2rww2

I shied away from moisturizer because I thought it would make me even more oily. Well one of the Sephora employees did a colormatch for me so I could look at some new foundations and she said You have the driest skin of anyone Ive ever met. At first I was really offended. But then it made me completely approach skincare differently. I started using a more gentle cleanser Purity started using a serum Caudile S.O.S. Hydration Serum and a moisturizer Hey Honey Day and Night Cream. Now I have the best skin Ive had in my entire life. I can actually wear BB cream this summer instead of a full face of foundation because the texture of my skin has finally improved.

8717671,0,t1_d6vc7nk,I also REALLY like this set from Ecotools its absurdly good for the price. I have quite a few higherend brushes and Im a bit of a snob for certain shapes of brushes BUT I love these Ecotools ones. From IT Cosmetics I recommend you get the Blending Crease Brush as I think it looks like a great higherquality blending brush option. I would skip their allover brushes as youre likely to get equal efficacy from the allover shadow brush on the Ecotools set I linked. For my purposes Ive found that the best value is in getting high endmidrange brushes for the ones that are mediumdensity then the SUPER fluffy ones and the super dense ones can be cheaper as they rely less heavily on craftsmanship and bristle quality. I personally think neither Sephora nor Ulta sells the best eyeshadow brushes overall if you can stand it right now I might spend your points on something else and in a few months pick up JUST A FEW brushes from MAC andor Hakuhodo as those are some of the best valueformoney payoff. They are more expensive than certain brands but right in line with price of other midrange options and they make some great blending brushes in my experience.,MakeupAddiction,d6vcjl5,2,t5_2rww2

8779547,0,t3_50dbwz,Its hard to tell purely from ingredients lists as all foundationsconcealers generally contain both water and silicone and you cant ALWAYS judge proportions based on the position of ingredients. However from the description of the issue I think UD Naked Skin must have a higher water content and be slightly more waterywaterbased than the MAC Pro Longwear. I use the MAC PL foundation and its deifnitely siliconebased with the classic slick soft formula that remains tacky for a while. Im guessing the UD Naked is rather lightweight and blends in quickly?If you are  putting anything waterbased or overall watery over a silicone base you are going to have issues. Silicone is hydrophobic so it repels water and causes pilling streaking ballingup etc. You can put waterbased UNDER siliconebased stuff but not vice versa in general.You can try using your concealer FIRST not ideal Im sure you probably use your products in this order for a good reason and waiting for it to sink in before going in with foundation. Or you can leave that area bare and just use concealer alone if thats enough coverage.Otherwise the MAC Pro Longwear Concealer works amazingly with the PL foundation but...yeah I understand not wanting to buy additional products. I just dont know if you can make the UD and the PL work on top of each other  in the manner youre attempting.,MakeupAddiction,d7343a6,4,t5_2rww2

8808873,0,t3_50nywv,My vision is only impaired in one eye so I wear glasses mostly for depth perception then actual vision because my brain naturally accommodates to my eye with normal vision. Im required to wear glasses for driving but outside of that I can get away with nothing so for me wearing glasses is more of a fashion choice then for vision. That said I love wearing my glasses because I feel like the frames balance out bold lipsticks well and add an element of edginess to my look that still looks very pulled together. I. Like bold makeup so I wear my glasses about  of the time for work because they tone down my eye makeup which allows me to get away with bolder makeup at work without it standing out in a way that might make me appear unprofessional. ,MakeupAddiction,d76pfx9,1,t5_2rww2

Maybe a fruit acid to start. If you have a Sephora near you you can get some samples. You can try something like this for example. Congrats and good luck.

Edit Or now that Im looking at it Lorac Chroma looks like a softer plummier version of Berry Pop and I like it better itt not quite as bright.

8838918,0,t3_5187p9,An easier way to do eyeliner is to use gel liner and plot dots on your eye and connect them dot to dot at a time to create that eyeliner line! Gel liner is pretty sturdy so it would not transfer nearly as much as pencil or liquid. To prevent the shaky hands try getting close to a mirror and putting your elbow on a counter to steady yourself. I do agree that your eyebrow shape is very nice and I think your eye shape is absolutely adorable.

8849288,0,t3_51extg,My high school makeup was pretty bad. I got into the makeup game kind of late at  and growing up I didnt have any female relatives around my age and my mom used very minimal makeup so I just never learned proper techniques or application.  I used the cheapest and lightest foundation I could find from the drugstore which was completely the wrong shade and the wrong formula for my dry skin. Dry patches were accentuated everywhere. No blush because I hated my rosy face so I wanted to be as pale as possible. No concealer just used that same awful foundation under my eyes and applied the whole thing with those cheap sponges you have to break off in the pack. If I used eye shadow it was just to swipe a color all over my lid with those sponge applicators. I didnt understand how to do eyeliner on the top lid so I just ran a black or grey eyeliner pencil on my bottom lash line. And no mascara because I didnt like the way it felt. No lipstick either. Here is a before and after for comparison.  to Im the one with the longer and lighter hair in the first photo. That was my last day of high school. I am much happier with my face these days.

8856960,0,t3_51jc2r,Hi I definitely think the SPF is the issue here and that you would be better off finding an SPF free alternative for going outdays you will be photographed. Whats your skin type? I was going to suggest Double Wear but it may not be ideal if youre dry. The Estee Lauder counter will color match you and give you a ten day sample regardless which I recommend you try out! I loved the coverage and the fact that it is totally transferproof but it was hard for me to work with on my dry skin.Edit also a lot of setting powders will also cause flashback so that is something to keep in mind. Anything containing silica will give you the same effect so I definitely advise just finding a new foundation for going outphotos and sticking to Revlon for everyday wear since youre mainly happy with it.,MakeupAddiction,d7chcdo,1,t5_2rww2

My skin is pretty normal now and I still wear it from time to time and still love it.  It is very thick.  It tends to apply best with fingers something about their warmth helps melt the foundation.  It didnt work as well with a blush or a Beauty Blender IMO.  A little goes a long way.  It isnt super heavy but it isnt lightweight either so keep that in mind.  It does last a long time and wear well.  Tried it successfully! in light rain but I dont know about anything heavier yet.

We also have Sephoras in few cities and three in Stockholm.For brands the main Swedish brand I would recommend is Isadora. They have great lip liners and lipsticks especially their matte lipsticks. Also Viva La Diva is the Swedish equivalent of Wet n Wild though slightly more pricey and they have a range of lots of stuff but their lipsticks are superb. Emma S has nice skincare and is available at both hlns and Kicks. ,MakeupAddiction,d7hn1tq,2,t5_2rww2

I had combo skin for a long long time and my recommendation is to use different primers or foundations for different areas. For example I got oily around the Tzone and then normal to dry skin everywhere else. For my tzone I used a mattifying primer or a matte foundation while on the rest of my face I used natural satin or dewy finish foundations or hydrating and illuminating primers to avoid cakeyness.,MakeupAddiction,d7immos,2,t5_2rww2

Its also waterproof so I use it on days when I know Im going to be sweating so I dont have to worry about sweating it off.

8937304,0,t1_d7m2ujb,Oh no its okay. I understand your frustration. I recently discovered Im likely nuetral olive thanks to an awesome MUAer and it explains so much.... Like how Im not warm or cool toned when it comes to foundation but nuetral foundations dont necessarily always match. Why I can wear warm and cool colors but some shades make me look completely ill. Maybe post inrOliveMUA and ask?ampnbspYou could be nuetral leaning warm which is why you can wear cool and warm lipsticks. The Tarte foundation is just so peachy if you match it then one would think youre at least a little warm leaning but I wont pretend to know since idk what your skin looks like. Many foundations assume youre golden or yellow so maybe youre just a warm peachy undertone which is harder to find. Unless youre cool toned and pinky enough that it looks close enough for you to not be sure.ampnbspYeah tons of foundation pull super yellow on me.

But instead of using it as a wash off mask just put a thin layer on before bed and leave it on. By the time you wake up in the morning your dry patches will be gone and it hasnt broken me out at all.

Ive definitely heard of people reverse lining where they run the liner RIGHT outside the lips but for me thats just not a good idea. I wear full coverage base so that would end up creating streakypatchy areas of coverage and usually my problems with lipstick are related to fading not bleeding.If you have a big issue with bleeding I think lining the outside of the lips then going over it with powder will work well. If your issues are like mine and more related to the longevity of the color on your actual lipskin use it allover lips.The one I use is Urban Decay Ozone and it doesnt leave any white cast.,MakeupAddiction,d87ox19,3,t5_2rww2

Do you have access to Selenas make up artist and can confirm if she used highlight or not? who cares if she uses it in her video?point   you dont know if she is a Selena fan or not.

The shadows would look like a muddled mess on my eyes and you couldnt really distinguish the colors.Aside from that the size of the big palettes were so impractical to me. I had to force myself to use them before I gave them away because theyre so large. Its like doing you eye shadow out of a large hardcover book. Theyre gorgeous to look at but I just never used mine because of those reasons.Price wise its a pretty good value.

If you have a good foundation it wont sweat off your face as much but just get dewy and then go back to the way it was before once you cool down. For your pores maybe try Porefessional by Benefit or Pores No More by IT Cosmetics? Ive heard good things about both but I dont struggle with pores so I couldnt answer anything for those with large pores. I personally dont care if a guy is interested in or wears makeup and if a girl is put off by you wearing makeup or expressing interest in makeup I dont think thats someone that you would want in the first place. Honestly I know a lot of guys who wear face makeup to cover scarring or acne or because they just like it and I didnt even know until they had told me. ,MakeupAddiction,d8itpwq,1,t5_2rww2

I love their tinted moisturizers for most of my clients but on those that need or want a heavier coverage I use them as a primer with their time balm foundation andor concealer on top for a completely covered look which is seldom done. The nude tude and dude palettes are great buys for under  each at cosmoprof and I adore the instain blushes for their lasting power and color range. I honestly dont splurge on lipsticks and will melt whatever pretty colors I find while shopping I like together onto a metal tray to suit the occasion.Im primarily a nail tech and because of the discount I get on the balm products they make up the bulk of my kit.

I also suggest a professional brow waxshaping.  it really will give your face some definition and make the look seem professional and polished.  your brows seem quite unkempt.

You just confirmed what I replied to olebiscuitbarrel in the below comments.     Aside from the fact that growing up with two completely different beauty ideals can lead to insecurities much easier I never said that stepping into US soil could erase all culture. But once one does live in the States or anywhere else than Asia society changes and so does your own views about this world. You either have a problem with how your former society views skin colors and beauty ideals or you dont. When those women go buy lighter base make up they pursue a beauty ideal that is desireable to them. They dont need you saving them from their miserable culture because they actually live and ARE the culture! Stop thinking white supremecy stop thinking everyone cares what you think would look good on them. OPs post is good and justified because OP is part of the culture. Shop clerks and people saying  its ingrained in their minds that being dark skinned is bad or ugly are not okay because newsflash there are people whore aware of all the roots of that beauty ideal and still find that beauty ideal beautifu for other reasons.,MakeupAddiction,d8qkcu4,2,t5_2rww2

9363370,0,t3_58q7pk,Use green for redness orangepeach for darkness. Some times the orange colour correctors are very pigmented so youll have to use a tiny amount or blend the edges a bit. If orange doesnt work try a peach one Bobbi brown has a great one . Once you apply the corrector you apply your foundation or concealer over I personally prefer ones with more coverage so the corrector doesnt show. Hope that helps ,MakeupAddiction,d92vhdt,1,t5_2rww2
9366074,0,t3_58szxu,Since I switched over to single shadows Im extremely picky about palettes. Unless I like every single shade and do not own dupes its a nogo. The only premade palettes I own are UD Naked Basics  ABH Modern Renaissance and ABH Mario because it was a gift. All of my other shadows are singles and I can easily dupe all of the TF palettes the Tarte palettes etc. ,MakeupAddiction,d937tna,2,t5_2rww2
9368232,0,t3_58vayj,Really super cute look! I love the shade of blush you used it really goes well with your skin tone. I think it would suit the look better if you went with a tinted lip color thats a bit more glossy rather than an opaque matte and if you did puppy liner instead of an upward wing. Otherwise though awesome job. Your outfit is adorable! Love the earrings too.Edit As for freckle spacing I think it would look best if you concentrated them on the bridge of the nose and gradually had the freckles dissipate outwards instead of evenly placing them across the nose and cheeks.

Where Im from they have the paints at any bookstore alongside with markers and pencils crayons. The serious body art stuff is kept at the makeupbody art shop. Use more water to dilute to color and after applying it to the skin with the wet brush use a fluffy brush to blend it all into the skin! this is an important step and will take a little to master but this works wonders. The color will not crackle or peel and with the blending you should be able to control the opaqueness.

9423674,0,t3_59qdw9,Personally with cheaper palettes that are patchy or dont have the high color payoff I have always found wetting my brush will help pack on the color or make it look more intense. Wetting the powder a little seems to maybe pick up for and transfer more of the pigment to your skin. When you are blending these colors as a transition shade or something like that the only thing you can really do is keep applying product to the brush and filling in the patchy spots. It is definitely a little bit more work to get them to show up like they do in the pans but its mostly doable from my experience. I grew up with Clinique handmedown eyeshadows from my mom that were insanely lowpigmented and powdery. ,MakeupAddiction,d9aikn3,5,t5_2rww2

What color are your circles? Bluish? Purplish? Reddish? What color they lean will help you figure out what corrector works best. Blue circles are best covered with something orangey purple with peachy and reddish with yellow leaning corrector. I like Sephora collection gel serum concealer in the melon peach and yellow shades. Bye bye under eye from IT cosmetics is a nice correcting concealer that is skin toned but with a bit of a peachy hue so that it works as a concealer and corrector in one.

However theres also the fact that the products I do have from him which I purchased BEFORE everything truly exploded arent that great anyway. For me at least. His liquid lipsticks I have Doll Parts Gemini amp Redrum are just okay. Theyre not crazy spectacular I have better liquid lipsticks in my arsenal. I have to admit though that Redrum is pretty good its kinda a bitch to deal with but once I apply it it looks good on me. However thats not enough to get me to purchase anything from his brand anymore especially after everything thats been happening.  LimeCrime is pretty shady. The things I read about them just make me not want to support them. Plus the recent controversy about the superfoils just  nope nope nope. Morphe. This is more personal than ethical I guess?? I just cant stand how they amp a lot of YT are. Of course this is more towards the YT who promote them like MannyMUA whos just so far up their butt I cant than the company itself but meh.  Kylie Cosmetics because w o w um hell no to supporting a brand that just slaps on Kylies name on Colourpop liquid lipsticks amp then ups the price. Plus I just cant stand Kylie or her fans.  I know this isnt a brand itself but in general collaborations are just a no go for me most of the time. The Mario ABH palette is holy moly amazing amp I adore it but thats pretty much the only one that comes to mind that I enjoy amp is absolutely worth the price. But other than that if a company puts out a collaboration with a YouTuberBeauty Influencer I just tend bleh at it amp dont buy. I feel like too many of the brands that do collabs just take short cuts amp then slap the name of an influencer on it without care that the quality of the product may actually be horrible because if its a popular influencer with a huge following they know they can get people to buy the products especially if they say its LE. ,MakeupAddiction,d9iupnf,-1,t5_2rww2

9508175,0,t3_5b1ed4,I was a Sephora employee for  years as long as you have a receipt Sephora typically doesnt raise an eyebrow at any return you make. If you consistently return product without a receipt depending on the circumstances they might look into what you might be returningwhywhen for example we had a woman consistently returning perfume bottles of various perfumes she would buy from usonlineanother department store and initially we didnt think anything of it we figured she wasnt finding something she was fond of. As time continued on I handled one of her last returns with us and went to the back to talk to my Operations manager about the return we need manager approval for certain types of refunds like if you wanted it back on a credit card in special circumstances and etc. I inspected to see how much was left it felt pretty full I was just looking while I was being talked to and I saw that the bottle had been pried open on the top and cracked. It was almost like she opened the top with a screwdriver for whatever reason so I sprayed it and it didnt smell even remotely close to what the actual fragrance smells like. Seems like she was picking up expensive fragrances from various brands taking them home and filling them with some other cheaper fragrances keeping the ones she purchased from us but returning the bottles filled with another fragrance. So we did the return for her but we noted it for future returns. We wouldnt ever openly deny someones legitimacy as there are perfectly logical reasons why someone would make frequent returns like being picky which is fine or having sensitive skin. Its completely circumstance based. tldr as long as youre being honest Sephora will happily work with you and wouldnt mind at all. Their goal is do serve you as the client so whatever it takes to satisfy your needs they will deliver. Ive always been of the mindset that I AM the client no matter what my request or return is I should be treated with respect and being serviced like they appreciate my business even if I am making a return. If anybody treats you negatively if you do return something at Sephora make sure to say something to management. They take client satisfaction very seriously. ,MakeupAddiction,d9l32ku,15,t5_2rww2

9529239,0,t3_5bddyo,Honestly I dont see the big deal in just mentioning it. I used to work in Sephora and my managers always instructed us that we needed to see the email or card that comes in the mail. Sephora workers are people too and I can promise they arent just excluding the discount to ruin your day. Mistakes happen. I know the rouge program needs some updates and in a perfect world it would be great if the discount was taken automatically but even online you have to actually enter the code. Also a rouge card doesnt automatically mean you are a rouge many people qualify get the card and then dont necessarily requalify the next year but use the same card. In the same token not all rouges have a rouge card I saw plenty that just had normal BI cards for whatever reason. Its not a perfect system but Im sure it takes more time to get back and get a receipt adjusted than it does to just mention it in the first place.,MakeupAddiction,d9noha1,9,t5_2rww2

9559683,0,t3_5buoe1,Well generally if you just search by key words like wedding Im sure youll find plenty of info on this subreddit. I think makeup is a lot about trial and error especially when it comes to foundations and primers. Everybody has different skin types and what works for them might not work for you. Do your research not necessary for wedding looks but also look for good reviews on products in general. I would buy in Sephora its easier to return products there so if something does not work for you. you can exchange for something which does. Also you can create mood boards or inspo boards just save whatever photo with makeup you like no matter if its editorial or not you can find tons of inspiration on Pinterest. Look for people with similar skin tone. That way you can actually see which style you like more and trying to recreate looks from the pics you like will help to determine what shades will or wont work for you. Also I would invest in a good skin care if you dont have it down already. Good luck and have fun  ,MakeupAddiction,d9rfe1h,3,t5_2rww2

9577674,0,t3_5c4l4c,Although I havent tried the KVD Lock It Powder yet I have extremely oily skin and I LOVE the LM Translucent Setting Powder.I apply a little with my velour puff and press it all over my skin. Otherwise if you add too much your face will look powdery and a bit dry. Because of that Im not very turned on with the idea of baking with it considering how much powder it requires.However the LM Translucent Powder does keep my oils at bay for a few hours longer and additionally BLURRS my pores like no other. Honestly the LM powder is such a crucial step in making my face look nice when using oilfree makeup. Otherwise whatever foundation I wear it sinks into my pores sooner than later and makes them look very visible. The LM Powder prevents that. I dont use much product either so the tub will easily last me awhile too. With said reasons I dont plan on purchasing any other setting powder because of how well it wears on me.If you have oilycombo skin I definitely recommend it!,MakeupAddiction,d9tn6nw,2,t5_2rww2

Oils are good  coconut if it doesnt break you out I love e oil avacados oil etc. Always make sure you lotionoil up within two minutes after washing your face. Hard candy concealer is my current preferred for my eyes. I do have to work with it a lot to make sure it isnt creasing like crazy kinda does anyway tbh but it covers very well. You might want to try color correcting. And if your eyes are like mine you might just have to accept its gonna be slightly visible. Ive had people compliment me on my pink eyeshadow before so if you use eyeshadows you may be able to play it up! Haha.

For instance I personally wear nail polish all the time and am not picky about the origin of ingredients in my makeup products as long as they are healthy for my skin. I would frankly ask her what she is and isnt comfortable with in terms of makeup and Im sure shell really appreciate it. Your gift idea is a very thoughtful one!Edit if she DOES prefer to avoid makeup with pork or other animalderived ingredients you can check out Lush bath amp body products and brands like Kat Von D Too Faced Anastasia Beverly Hills Cover Fx Tarte and Urban Decay for makeup  they each have some or all vegan products and they are GREAT makeup brands.

9638091,0,t1_da0otd7,I bought en taupe cocoa blend and the metallic palettes the other day and was so excited for them. Im still testing them so I cant give a very comprehensive review yet but here you goId say en taupe is worth it because the  colours are pretty unique. I personally dont have anything like it and apart from maybe the cream highlight shade I couldnt dupe anything. The shadows are all really pretty and equally pigmented and they blend well. My only main concern would be longevity  I dont know if its that theyd last better with another primer but Ive tried application with my essence natural base primer with my makeup revolution highlighting primer and trying to layer it with a cream shadow underneath and in each of those instances the shadows creased really quickly and my eyelids felt kind of greasy. Its possible that I just had a naturally greasy eye lid day lol  my eyelids tend to get greasy anyway and that has happened to me randomly as well I just thought was strange that it happened on all three occasions when Ive worn those shadows. I havent had the longevity problem with cocoa blend. The colours are all so pretty and work well together. However I have to say as someone who really loves warm shadows I could have duped almost all the colours with my existing collection. The swatches and looking at them online made them look a bit more unique than they actually are. But its so pretty and the quality is good! So if you want the palette go for it  its very good value for money.Also if people would like I can totally post swatches later and expand on my reviews!,MakeupAddiction,da13dco,8,t5_2rww2

While anyone can wear anything I always like to see people in colors that are juuuust right.My one piece of CC is that the nude lips pull a bit orange when viewed as a whole with your skin and eyeshadow. I think Id like to see a more true beige nude mouth or even a cooler pinky beige.

9688229,0,t1_da790nk,Just because its not organic doesnt detract from the fact shes aging gracefully.I consider my skin pretty nice right now. I havent had cystic acne for years. And part of that is the pharmaceuticals Im pumping into my body right now to do so and the chemicals I pile on my face to help my skin do what it wont on its own. The fact its not  organically being created by my own body doesnt take from the fact this is the current state of my body.I get what youre saying. Its not like she has amazing genes and a dynamite skin care routine. Theres other factors at play and those should be talked about just as openly. I just dont like the idea that cosmetic procedures detract from the aging process.Yes  Shes using fillers and botox. Thats totally cool. I dont think it adds an asterisk to her aging gracefully at all. A lot of women utilize those same methods and end up looking a bit plastic. Some women dont use those methods at all and look a bit more haggard in the eyes brow and mouth. Regardless of how we choose to go down the path of aging michelle is definitely doing it in a way that looks better than  of people. If anyone had asserted shes aging naturally then Id be like lol wut. But since nobody was discussing her methods for aging gracefully just that she was what you said seemed like an unnecessary put down. Like yeah shes beautiful but shes had work done. Who cares how she achieved it. What shes achieved is super enviable regardless.She also has benefited from the professional makeup and hair artists and stylists and trainers who have also aided her in becoming a goddess. None of that detracts from the factsLike many wealthy women in the public eye michelle has made looking good a priority. And the woman looks fantastic. And I am jealous because I will never have a team to goddess transform me like shit has. But god almighty do I congratulate her on the makeover. We havent had a first lady like that since Jackie and in my opinion michelle surpasses her but thats subjective,MakeupAddiction,da7a2m8,31,t5_2rww2

TonyMolys TonyTint in  I think its  is an awesome stain that really has a shitton of color when you layer it on carefully. Ive had complete strangers just say your lips are really red! To me when I wear it. Which... good thing? Bad thing?I like the color and texture of Birchboxs LOC lipstick in Wildest Dreams. Plus its a very compact little tube. Stilas liquid lip in Beso and Colourpops ultra Matte in Creeper are very similar but I think Stila wears a little better and stains a lot less. But its hard to beat Colourpops price. For reds with a bit of a twist I am in love with Colourpops Ultra Metallic in Kween. Its just such a lovely shiny mildly rusty burgundyred. Super flattering and not over the top. I grabbed an extra during their recent promo I love it so much. The only drawback is that even though its actually quite longwearing on me it feels like a lot on my lips after I eat.

So when I went back a couple of days later they were able to pull it up and exchanged it for me. You can try emailing them or live chatting with them to be sure. And even if it is store policy theres no need for her to be rude. She can just nicely explain that there was not much she can do because its store policy.Also did you happen to have the box with you?

9758251,0,t3_5ewzt1,Hello  Im on the spectrum too. I used to have similar issues but likely not as strong as you. I spent a lot of time practicing and just getting used to having stuff near my face. I started out with just concealer and worked my way up. I would often put on makeup in private and then take it off just to get used to putting it on. I also stimmed by humming when I applied it  perhaps you have some gestures that could help you to relax? Also black eyeshadow on an angled brush makes a great eyeliner that is a lot easier and more comfortable than conventional liner. If you have black or brown eyelashes you could also try putting the mascara on just the ends of your top eyelashes so that the wand isnt too close to your eyes.That being said you should not feel that you have to wear makeup  makeup is always optional. A lot of people dont wear makeup and people are still as funny about wearing makeup as they are about people who go without. I get shit from people because I like wearing a full face of makeup and some people assume that I have poor self confidence or are vain. If you do want to wear a light amount try going with a tinted moisturiser some concealer a light powder perhaps something for your brows and perhaps something for your eyes. Putting eyeshadow near your eyelashes will make them look fuller and maybe you could start out with that instead of mascara. You dont have to do this all at once and I would suggest just trying it out in private until you get used to it. ,MakeupAddiction,dafx8g7,10,t5_2rww2

9759037,0,t3_5exnax,I mean very high end Chanel come with sponge applicators. Not actual brushes. Some shadows tend to go on pretty well with sponge and sponges pick up product better than a brush would. What sucks it that I doubt those applicators are durable for multiple use so youd have to keep switching them out plus they dont blend shadows out well. I might need to pick some up though bc Im tired of having to use my hands to pack on shadows. ,MakeupAddiction,dag0q27,23,t5_2rww2

I feel like youve put all that work into the eyes and because the lip is just so dark it washes them out. Especially as your lips are so full its a whole lot of black on there.  Id love to see the same eyes but with a lighter lip. Not a light colour another dark lip but just something that isnt black. A dark pink or purple maybe a good deep brown. Or possibly an ombre lip so you still have your black but not quite so much of it. ,MakeupAddiction,dahd2g0,2,t5_2rww2

Overall not bad. Its not greatly pigmented though.  ,MakeupAddiction,daoqdmi,1,t5_2rww2

I had to order it online directly from e.l.f. though  it wasnt something Target carried and they usually have a decent selection of e.l.f. products.

I guess its kind of like when guys shave every morning it just feels like the day has started. When I started getting into make up I wore it every single time I left the house and even when I was at home with roommates because I was self conscious about my acne scars. I am so glad I have gotten to the point where I dont feel the need to do that anymore and just wear make up when I want to. There really arent any rules when it comes to when you wear make up. Sometimes Im lazy and just throw on a BB cream and mascara or go bare face! other times I want to do my make up because I find it fun and it relaxes me. If I am just running errands or something one of my favorite looks to do is a light coverage foundation mascara and a bold lip!,MakeupAddiction,daxjk4z,3,t5_2rww2

Full coverage lasts quite longi do get a bit oily after  hours but it doesnt cause the makeup to look bad and cakey like with other foundations the double wear. Clinique doesnt accentuate my texture and on colder days I can even go without powder if im out for like  hours.

9945927,0,t1_db3vip6,Translucent to absorb oil coloured to get more coverage but this can look cakey. Setting powder basically makes your foundation last longer and absorbs a bit of oil. Foundation wont move your powder around but I have found that certain powders will move my foundation around because its like the powder layer holds onto the oil my face produces leaving my foundation layer to slip around. Ive noticed it mostly with RCMA and my face isnt particularly oily. Using a setting spray helped minimise this but Im still not a big fan. Id recommend doing only half first to see if youd prefer the more natural look or the longer lasting side first. ,MakeupAddiction,db3z9kr,2,t5_2rww2

9953827,0,t3_5ftljd,Everyone is talking about all of Jeffrees problems which I understand but honestly I view him and his makeup line as completely separate entities. Its kind of the same way a view Donald Trump with Miss USA sure he isnt the best person but the organization he owns does some fantastic things.   A large part of Jeffrees persona and character is this transcendent bitchy Barbie doll mannequin. He has been this person since his MySpace days because everyone loves a good villain. He is Regina George because as much as we hate to admit it we all sort of love a Regina George type character in a movie. Unfortunately that sort of elitism doesnt translate well into real life and comes across as crass. Every time I buy something from Jeffree Star Cosmetics I feel like for lack of better terms a bad bitch a Queen Supreme. That feeling is an awesome one that succeeds in part due to Jeffrees convoluted sense of self. I convince myself that although Jeffree owns the brand and makes money from it chances are a large portion of that money also goes to paying the product developers the packaging team or some one else in the chain. ,MakeupAddiction,db50bum,1,t5_2rww2

Theyre based in Australia but I dont remember shipping to the US to be terribly painful.Also a review no one asked forIts a pretty thin formula which isnt drying. I think darker colors like the shade potala palace do better with a lip liner underneath but you can layer your way to victory it layers well however I didnt need one with the shade forbidden city which is a more classic red cor.

10023331,0,t1_dbdzqc2,If its what youre looking for whats holding you back? If you think you are going to get good use out of it I dont see why you would regret this purchase. The shadows are of good quality both shimmers and matte. Its probably my one palette where I prefer the shimmers to their mattes tbh. The shimmers are definitely warm neutral they pull off bronzerose gold on me where as their mattes have more of a red undertone which I dont usually prefer in my neutrals  I like my neutrals brown. There is only one shimmer shade that is a bit difficult to work with imo but otherwise their shimmers are fantastic I enjoy pairing it with my ABH MR. There are  shimmers  satinish  mattes with transitionliddarker shades to play with. Overall a solid palette.If you think you arent going to get use out of the mattes since you were specifically looking for shimmers maybe consider singles?,MakeupAddiction,dbe2gfg,1,t5_2rww2

One of the most valuable things I learned on those subs is the importance of using a moisturizer PLUS an occlusive product. For instance a standard facial lotion and then Cerave Vanicream or even Vaseline or Aquaphor. These products stop all of the moisture from evaporating from your skin and really lock in any moisture that you have added. ,MakeupAddiction,dbfbhku,3,t5_2rww2

10044696,0,t3_5jk2fz,I actually really like their current packaging. It feels nice and heavy but this new packaging looks so much more fitting for their matte products. Maybe they should use these frosted tubes for the matte ones and the regular shiny ones for the satins so its easy to tell them apart.

10059372,0,t1_dbir4st,Im on the same page as you! I bought this because I wanted Moonchild so bad but the shipping costs from ABHs website to Canada are a joke  not to mention the conversion rate. That would make the palette wayyyy more expensive for us north of the border.  I think because Moonchild doesnt tend to have that super white base the shades would work better as highlighters. Ive actually heard that Moonchild is more sheer than the KVD Alchemist palette which actually works in its favour for this type of highlighter when considering darker skin tones. So ...basically...I still want the ABH one. I hate myself sometimes lol ,MakeupAddiction,dbire0u,2,t5_2rww2

I havent swatched the Cover FX drops but the NYX one obviously had high coverage and dried to a slightly powdery finish similar to the Nars All Day Luminous Weightless Foundation.

Alyssa more peach toned than swatches.  Clueless leaves a super grey purple line around my lips even after I tried mixing it up more in the container. And Frick and Frack was practically brown.  I found applying small amounts by dabbing the color on with a finger worked to get a less brown color out of Frick and Frack and more of the brick payoff the swatches led me to believe.  Dabbing or only applying very little helped with clueless being less grey blue too.  I did a lot of swatch googling before getting any of these and I still had color choices that were vastly different on me.   ,MakeupAddiction,dbvavt3,2,t5_2rww2

I took my pencil brush again and added Mud to the outer corners and blended that out. . I went in with a Bare Minerals flat brush the number rubbed off on the brush otherwise I would tell you and packed on Pigeon all of my lid and then went back and intensified the color a bit by swatching it on my finger. . Its a little hard to see but I used an angled Elf brush and put Mustard Jam and Mud all on my lower lash line. .

Repeat with the remover and soap until all the spots are gone.

I dont wear makeup often at all but Id like to be able to do it well and in a reasonable amount of time on the rare occasions that I do want to look nice. Anyway the one problem Im really finding is that Im getting a super cakey slightly flaky effect with very obvious pores on the bottom of my forehead between my brows on the end of my nose and the tops of my cheeks under my eyes. I always moisturize first. Ive tried NYX Angel and ELF Poreless primers and neither have seemed to help. I dont need a whole lot of coverage and just stick to a BB creme versus a full coverage foundation and even with ELF NYX or Covergirl BB creme I still get the same problem. Unfortunately Im also very fair skinned and get a lot of redness in the same areas and putting concealer over it makes it worse. Ive tried applying with my fingers a flat foundation brush and stippling with a bigger brush. Cant seem to get that smooth flawless finish that the rest of my face has.

10258171,0,t3_5mvzgf,Disclaimer I am not a doctor and I recommend speaking to an eye doctor or other similarly certified medical professional regardless. I have a very similar problem. What Ive found is that the mascara in the eyes once built up in the inner corners can be gently cleanedwashed away. In my experience its not the mascara thats irritating its more so an eyelash issue which can be solved with a quick flush. I dont think what youre doing will cause damage in the long run as long as youre gentle. However please ask a doctor or someone else about it! Again I dont have anything close to an MD yet so please consult with a doctor. You only have one pair of eyes. As for cleansing I personally use a cotton pad soaked in eye makeup remover to remove mascara. What I do is I gently gently press the pad over the eye and let the remover soak the mascara before moving onto the next area. I repeat as necessary more stubborn i.e. waterproof formulas might take a longer soak time andor a different remover. ,MakeupAddiction,dc6tj8o,2,t5_2rww2

10263876,0,t3_5mwudh,Love the concealer hate the foundation. The concealer is medium coverage and very creamy which I like. I have combo skin but sometimes concealers can feel a little bit dry on me. This one doesnt do that. It also blends out really easily and reacts well to powder. I cannot get the foundation to work which is a shame because the coverage and finish are really nice. No matter what primer I use it always creases in my smile lines and makes me look at least  years older than I am. It also transfers like CRAZY even with setting powder and setting spray. I eventually had to stop wearing this because my pale boyfriend Im african american looked like an oompa loompa after any relatively intense makeout. It disturbed us both lol. ,MakeupAddiction,dc7gsmi,1,t5_2rww2

10272136,0,t3_5n1ta6,I have terrible undereye bags! And Im no pro at covering or fixing this yet still trying. I dont have enough specifics which Im quite sorry for. Ill give ya what I got! Maybe others can fill in.But  you can find little roller balls for puffiness or undereye bags from many brands. I have one from elf but I doubt thats the best if youre willing to spend more than whatever . Just Google undereye ball roller ball or something. Sometimes called undereye massagers! The only besides Ive tried is a Mary Kay one that my mom didnt use and I liked it but Im sure you can find something easier to find and better.  I googled it quick and see several things Ive seen in Walmart. Perhaps someone else has tried more of these out and can give a presentation specific instruction but this is one thing I do.  there are also basic undereye creams that can HELP. Again good skincare brands often have these. Sadly havent tried enough to give you a specific recommendation. Basically this problem starts being fixed before makeup...Just skincareAnd  just get some good concealer if you want coverage. I let my boyfriend borrow my concealer all the time for small coverups and pimples redness WHATEVER. Just use a DAMP blending sponge brand Beauty Blender to blend I find thats the easiest way to teach my bf easy blending to look less noticeable! Good luck! However Ive been informed time and again...They wont ever be totally fixed. Do you have allergies or anything? That can mean permanent undereye bags and it stinks but its realistic Dont worry about it! Id say worry most about it feeling good which starts with skincare.  ,MakeupAddiction,dc8eig8,2,t5_2rww2

10332304,0,t3_5nyc7x,My all time favorite brand for complexion products is Bobbi Brown. I used to have the same issue with my forehead looking grey as well as my under eyes. I was wearing a color that was too light I finally found my perfect match in her skin foundation formula I used both the stick and liquid. What I found for my NC skin tone is that a goldenyellow undertone is an excellent match. If you think your makeup looks grey or ashy its more than likely due to wearing a color that is too light andor the wrong undertone. To combat the ashiness on my forehead I apply very little product along my hairline. And to address the dark circles I recommend you do not go too light with your undereye concealer I recommend wearing a corrector first and then applying a concealer that is a just a hint lighter than your skin tone. ,MakeupAddiction,dcf82xb,8,t5_2rww2

I will say that the  drop  drops  drops thing they recommend isnt accurate.

MR was a miss for me it was just too powdery and the colors werent as pigmented in that palette on my skintone as it was for others. the biggest fail for me was the permanent that glow kit its like they went against all of what was working for them and made this glittery powdery mess that just wasnt good for anyone. i absolutely abhor their liquid lipsticks  i bought a ton when they first were released and they were a gloopy paint smelling balled up transfer crazy mess  ive been told the reformulation helped but i just cant be bothered bc it was that damn disappointing. but their lipglosses more than makeup for it theyre amazing i cant speak more highly of themI definitely love their shadows and i love mixing their eyebrow powder with the gel. dip brown pomade is good but depending on what type of month im having can break my out. i do like the brown enhancer but much like the brow whiz i dont think theres enough product in there.but its definitely a brand that caters to some of my staples and i will continue to reup,MakeupAddiction,dckoqo5,6,t5_2rww2

10424597,0,t1_dcp9fc8,I actually had a problem once where a company sent me two of something when I ordered one. They then sent me a very rude email threatening to charge my card for double the amount of the one item plus shipping if I didnt send the extra item back within  business days. Its pretty difficult for me to get to the post office on weekdays as I keep odd work hours that start before the post office opens and end after it closes. The only say I can go is Saturdays and that would have been past the  days and they wouldnt budge. I did some research and I found out that they can technically charge for an item they sent even by error if they offer to pay return shipping and you dont agree to return it at that point. Im guessing this law is different in places but it just surprised me that so could be charged for something I didnt order.,MakeupAddiction,dcpp3pi,4,t5_2rww2

10426856,0,t3_5p8uz2,Your eyeliner is very flattering and I also like the shaping of your brows. My only cc is to use a lighter color for your brows. Your hair color looks to be a mediumdark brown not black and its recommended that your brows should be  shades lighter than your hair color if youre a brunette  shades darker if youre blonde. If your brow hair is naturally black you can keep the color but just use a lighter hand so it doesnt come out as pigmented. Hope that makes sense!,MakeupAddiction,dcpyb8n,5,t5_2rww2

Im a big fan of the bronze eyeshadow though I do question how you brought it down below her lashes since its not visible in the pic. I think you did a really good job on the brows  the thickness adds youth but you didnt go overboard  and all I would really CC is doing just a little bit more blending in the fronts theres a barely visible line on the right one. The lip color seems very fitting though I can see how a CC might be to slight over? line them with a darker pencil before filling them in with a color  I think what you have looks fine though.

10431952,0,t3_5pe8so,Well Im certainly not an expert on this so I just copy and pasted this from a book regarding eye brushes!Good brushes will make your eye makeup application swifter and smoother and are a great investment. Here are the brushes I find the most useful and which are used in the book.. A blusher brush is used to give one sweep of color over your lids or your cheeks.. A wide eye shadow brush is great for blending color over the entire lid area. Since it is a firm brush it should not send flaky eye shadows all over your face.. A large eye shadow brush is used to blend or dust eye shadow over larger areas of the lid.. A synthetic concealer brush is better your fingertips are good too for cream or gel shadows as the hairs remain flat when they are wet or greasy.. A mini blender brush is tapered and firm which lets you place delicate amounts of eye shadow into small areas such as under the eye or in the corners.. A small eye shadow brush is used for pressing and blending a highlighter color on top of other shadows. It is also good for blending one color in a specific area.That being said I think you might be better off applying the colour higher up around your eye on the outer end as with your curent hairstyle theres a lot of black which I find is overshadowing your eyes. Only one way to find out!Another slight issue at least from the photos Im not quite sure if youre applying too much blush by which I mean all over your face. If youre naturally that red though just ignore this part! ,MakeupAddiction,dcqj4sw,1,t5_2rww2

10682769,0,t1_ddhay2k,I have liquid lipsticks from about  different brands in various price ranges and I really dont think any of them leave your lips moist.  Its just the nature of the beast and you trade wear time for moisture.  Some are a little worse than others and that seems to be based on body chemistry.  KVD and JS are both on the better end in my experience.  NYC Soft Matte Lip Creams and Colourpop Ultra Satins are on the better end of the spectrum but I also dont really consider them a true liquid lip since they dont really dry down and neither lasts as long as traditional liquid lipsticks.  I would recommend a good routine for exfoliation and moisturizing and lip liners worn underneath can sometimes help but also it may be that the formula just isnt for you.  As a liquid lip alternative I like pencils like the NARS velvet matte lip pencils and products like that which last longer than bullet lipsticks but arent as drying as liquids.,MakeupAddiction,ddhuhus,7,t5_2rww2

10832936,0,t3_5uv5ke,Fellow straight dude in the south as well. You can tightline the top lid where it touches the bottom lid when you close your eyes like uDreaswi said. You can also take a matte eye shadow and apply it along the base of your lashes.This would allow you more choice in colors and its easier to blend but it wouldnt last as long. You could also go with mascara just applying it to the base with a sidetoside motion. You could also and Im being serious here put on a strong eyeliner then take it off with a makeup remover that doesnt completely remove it. When you get the hang of how to do it it looks subtle and completely natural but you can tell a difference.Bonus you can use a nude color on the wetline bottom lid to open up your eyes a bit as well.,MakeupAddiction,ddxcaez,33,t5_2rww2

10844359,0,t1_ddxzs49,Youve gotten some great advice here already but in addition to practice practice practice bit the biggest thing that helped me was taking a picture of my eyeshadow every day so I could figure out what I did rightwrong mostly wrong to start out and start to parse out exactly what worked for me. I am a visual learner and a lot of times with tutorials etc I didnt understand how to translate things for my eye shapecolor needs. Therefore the picture project. It allows me to take a step back and see on my own face how things work.That tactic has been slow going but long term it seems to be going ok.

10851245,0,t3_5v3d8l,My arsenal of foundations in use from lightest to heaviest all with buildable coverage are Glossiers Skin Tint Medium MILK Sunshine Skin Tint Light or Sand in Summer and then Mac Face and Body N. I have lightmedium skin depending on the brand with yellowolive undertones but Im fairly pale. I dont know if you can tell but I prefer liquids. Ive heard a lot of people tell me that since I have oily skin I need to stay with sticks or powders but boy are they wrong since I look like a flakey cake if I do surprise not all skin types are created equal. My skin is actually combination I get little dry patches on my nose and upper cheeks and oil production on my forehead and cheeks but what I found was that my skin was producing even more oil since I was spending so much time applying heavy makeup then stripping it off with harsh skin care products... when I switched to products made for me and finally threw away all the luxe brands that werent working and stopped wearing my full beat I saw that my skin wasnt nearly as oily or as dry as before my makeup sat better and I needed less bonus! no breakouts at least for me. As for Glossier I was really skeptical about it for a long time but I cannot stop talking about it! Ive lent my little tint to several friends with different skin types and they all looked lovely and dewy after. The question is how you define dewy... I live somewhere with a serious nomakeup lean lots of surfer girls and lots of sunshine so we always look a little dewy anyway. I really like that Glossier makes me look a little like a mermaid but for some people that can be perceived as an oily look you can always set it if you want. On my dry patches it doesnt cling or create flakes in general it doesnt crease and my skin can breathe underneath it unlike the MAC foundations one spot per use...  Ive found my glossier has pretty good longevity through the day even with no primer and Ive already bought four more for my arsenal.,MakeupAddiction,ddz89aq,5,t5_2rww2

10854667,0,t3_5v5t67,Yeah it doesnt look very good to me including the application but I still appreciate a truthful picture where it hasnt been packed on in ten staggered layers no one would realistically do or put over a separate lip colour to look misleadingly opaque. I think I might still be interested if it gets decent reviews. Something about the sheer lavender tone on it reminds me of OPI Significant Other Color which I like and while I prefer products that work well alone I might consider layering something like that over another colour if I think its worth it. Just to give a subtle difference to other opaque non shimmer colours I own. ,MakeupAddiction,ddzkyq9,32,t5_2rww2

Did you look in the sidebar or use the search function to check for similar posts before you wrote this one?If youre not sure if a question has been asked a lot you can search for it or also make a comment on the twiceweekly Simple Questions stickied thread which is posted Sundays and Wednesdays and people will be happy to help you out!The correct answer is what ucpslendxxdrg said. The whole NCNW is in Macs colour system. The easiest way to remember is NW  Not Warm and NC  Not Cold. The lower numbers are lighter colours and the higher numbers are darker. To find a foundation match you can experiment with different colours or go into a MAC store and ask for help or get colour matched at Sephora. Remember that lighting can make a big difference in appearance so do check out your foundation under different light sources to see if its really a match or just looked like it under Sephoras harsh fluorescents.Undertones can be finicky. Theres a spectrum from warm to cool and you could be anywhere on it. A quick google will tell you lots of ways to find your undertone anything from the colour of your veins to whether silver or gold jewelry suits you better.,MakeupAddiction,de6dt06,5,t5_2rww2

In any case its nice to know that they are still wearable even if theyre uncomfortable. From how you talk about LC though I think Ill be taking the dive and buying from them real soon. DIIRC ABH reformulated their LLs some time last year. Any chance you know if the ABH ones youve tried are the older formula?  And have you tried anything from Lonely Planet or Ofra?

My only CC is to maybe not over line your lips as it does look rather uneven and you can definitely see where you lined it on your skin compared to your lips and that the shade you used to fill your brows in looks a tad bit light compared to the brow hairs making it look kind of smudged and blurry?

People want to do what they want to do and if you dont like it then dont do it. Sure they might clearly be fake but since when had that stopped us from having glittery eyelids or brick red lips that we definitely dont come by naturally?I am coming from a perspective of my childhood freckles being neutral. Neither made fun of nor lauded. They were there theyre gone now so I have no emotional context fostering bitterness towards any current trends. But even if I did... being mocked for freckles  years ago... we all know that things youre mocked for as a kid arent actually things that are bad. As a possibly illuminating parallel I was called a nerd a lot but being interested in and driven by a subject in school isnt a thing that I as an adult have any self consciousness about when I see other adults being praised for it. Im not like man I used to be vilified for being good at school therefore these people havent earned their smartness by being mocked for it for years.,MakeupAddiction,delu0ra,57,t5_2rww2

11086915,0,t3_5ybj6g,As much as Ive been loving all the Modern Renaissance looks Im just not ready to splurge on yet another palette. So I wanted to try making some looks using palettes I already own that is single palette looks. I compared what palettes were already in my collection and if they could on their own generate a look similar to some beautiful MR ones Ive seen. In each eyeshadow description Ive bolded the eyeshadow name in the palette I used and in parenthesis and italics is the dupe within the MR. So if you see a look you like and already own MR just follow the italics. If you own one of the five palettes Ive used just follow the bold. But keep in mind some colors had to be mixed to create something even similar let alone an actual dupe for the shadows in MR. Using TooFaced Chocolate Bar palette as an example Cherry Cordial alone doesnt make MRs Red Ochre but a good  mix of Cherry Cordial and Strawberry Bon Bon makes it a little closer. Additionally Salted Caramel and Burnt Orange probably swatch quite differently but would probably end up looking similar once applied and blended out. Again these are not dupes simply the best I could do with what I have and if youve been coveting the MR like me hopefully this quenches your thirst. lt So to rmakeuprehabTooFaced Chocolate

In a quest to make the formula work for me I tried everything. Chapstick exfoliation you name it. Finally I pulled out a sample of the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer Oil and applied it to my lips. I let it soak for about a minute and the liquid lipstick applied like a dream and set beautifully. I really havent worn their liquid lipsticks without it since. A friend of mine uses another primer oil and she said it works the same. So maybe before trying to find a dupe find a cheap primer oil or see if you can get a sample from Sephora!

11149471,0,t1_dety3m6,Sorry for the delayed response! I think the ones Id most recommend are shades that are unique colors but that perform better than counterparts from other brands. So for example Wait for It is a super bright coral shade that is still vibrant when its blended out and is neither impossible to blend out or patchy when its blended out. I love Paper Tiger if youre into a true vibrant mustard thats not too brown. I think Team Captain also performs really well and is still so richly pigmented even when blended. I like Bel Air because it doesnt pull too cool on meit functions closer to a neutral on my skin tone.The shimmers are a really beautiful formula but I was a bit let down that the duochromes like Come and Get it and Sideline arent as duochromey as Id thought they would be. Sideline is supposed to have like an eggplant shade in there somewhere and its veryyyyy subtle. Theyre still super beautiful and I find that they apply well but the mattes truly are standouts because the formula is a lot better than most mattes that I own whereas the shimmers arent particularly better or worse than anything else.  ,MakeupAddiction,devs3z7,2,t5_2rww2

Theyre opaque and really glossy at first but dries down to a cream finish after a while. I really recommend a lipliner with them because they do bleed.

Sadly I saw a couple black spots which I found out were mold and youre not supposed to keep it so long.

Maybe bullying isnt the answer but I still think they need to realize that they can have their complaints and those complaints can be valid but they shouldnt be used to erase a broader issue that has racial ties. This whole were equally oppressed!!! POV doesnt foster any sense of solidarity it just emphasizes a blindness to or an unwillingness to accept a real problem. Yes cosmetic companies are to blame but they focus on producing whats most profitable. If their customers refuse to buy their products because theyre not inclusive enough they might change their ways. But that would require pale princesses to understand that there IS a difference between too few pale shades and too few dark shades.,MakeupAddiction,dfcsv8o,2,t5_2rww2

11370820,0,t3_6279n1,A great way to get started is to read the Holy Grail lists of products that are on the sidebar of the rmakeupaddiction page and bring it with to your local walgreenstargetdrug storeUltaSephora. They give you a sense of products to look for in the low to high budget realms that way you dont go enter a store and waste your time trying to figure out whats good and whats not Not all makeup is created equal! I totally get your more simplistic preference. Since youre just getting started Im going to assume you dont want to spend too much while your just experimenting. What I would recommend is getting yourself a great Mascara Covergirls Collossal Covergirls Clump Crusher Blush Milani at Walgreens makes some great shades and a tinted lip gloss in a berry shade. NYX is a great brand overall if youre wanting to explore and experiment without wasting your money.  the NEXT most important thing I recommend is SPEND higher on BRUSHES. your makeup is worthless if it doesnt have a good way to apply itself. So go a little spendier on a blush brush and eyeshadow brushes. ,MakeupAddiction,dfkv0c4,2,t5_2rww2

The shimmery white was a little hard when I first swatched it wasnt pigmented but then the hard top layer disappeared and now its as good as the others.

The only downside to it is that it really isnt suitable for oily skin you would have to retouch a bit during the day.

11479647,0,t1_dfx0yeh,I found a BH cosmetics palette at TJ Maxx. No matter how much I tried to get it to work even over several different primers UDPP ELF MAC Paint pots... Etc. The eyeshadows that I applied amp barely blended became a muddy mess by midday at latest. I trashed all the shadows and turned that into a magnetic palette. At least I had some way of salvaging it.         The other purchase was an order from the website. I tried their liquid foundation and it was completely off in shade and just didnt work. Basically I could find foundation at the dollar store that would be similar in quality.          In that order I also bought  color corrector palette and the Studio Pro Matte Finish Pressed Powder. All of it was useless junk. The correctors did nothing. I might as well have used colorless creams on my face. The powder was a chalky mess. Again similar to that bought from the Dollar Store or makeup for children.      And Im not picky. I use plenty of drugstore products along with similarly priced online makeup.    Id say its overrated and people hype it up to be as good as say Coastal Scents. I have a magnetic palette practically filled with Coastal Scents hot pots and they work just as well as MUG or MAC eyeshadows. BH cosmetics doesnt even perform as well as the worst eyeshadows that I currently own. ,MakeupAddiction,dfx7qjy,2,t5_2rww2

Also spraying a setting spray straight to a sponge is counterproductive since the purpose is to mesh the layers together and I find it gets cakey if I do it that way. I find that with my setting spray it gives me a natural finish even after powder.If you spray directly to your brushessponges theyll get cakey faster and youre more likely to get hard pan.

I dont like not being able to just touch my face and feel softness. But I like you felt like I had to use something. Ive been getting interested in skincare moreso now as well and I think youre so right about focusing on just being HAPPY and doing things because you ENJOY them not because you feel like you have to or because your face requires it. ,MakeupAddiction,dgw0z0i,5,t5_2rww2
11786901,0,t1_dgw2qdr,I agree with both of your least favourites! I love the Too Faced Chocolate Soleil Bronzer and Born This Way foundation and Benefit mascaras are great but Im not impressed with either brand as a whole.,MakeupAddiction,dgw31v6,6,t5_2rww2

11787538,0,t1_dgw595t,Lol I think MAC at Ulta fits better than MAC at Sephora tbh especially with the price point of MAC products. I also genuinely think that MAC will expand their consumer demographics by being at Ulta more so than at Sephora. Overall I think they made the right decision. Btw did that Kat Von D Lock It foundation match you?,MakeupAddiction,dgw5nkg,2,t5_2rww2

11791755,0,t1_dgw54a7,Thanks! I was wondering if anyone could do lip swatches ,MakeupAddiction,dgwmvlb,1,t5_2rww2
11791833,0,t1_dgweghu,I dont love the other primers but the Glitter Glue is amazing. You can get really intense glitter pigment or if you use the right shimmer shade it looks just like those perfect dewywet looks that have been trending recently. I really love it. ,MakeupAddiction,dgwn71s,2,t5_2rww2

11793935,0,t1_dgwv2kh,I made it actually! But they sell chain septum rings on etsy. You can also def make it using a short curved barbell with small balls and hang a nice chain off the barbell using jump rings. Idk if that made sense lmao,MakeupAddiction,dgwvrxd,1,t5_2rww2
11794388,0,t1_dgwx1yd,Hope it works well for you! Dont forget to patch test different oils if youre trying out ones you havent used on your skin before.. especially castor oil it doesnt agree with some people! I find that even if I get a few zits here and there my skin just feels so much less irritated softer and responds to foundation better while oil cleansing. And also if one kind of oil makes you break out try a few different kinds before you give up! Hope you have luck with it and love it as much as I do!,MakeupAddiction,dgwxmj2,2,t5_2rww2
11798949,0,t1_dgxetxx,Thats what Im leaning towards! I love my MAC but I can get a lip kit for like  more than one tube of MAC,MakeupAddiction,dgxg9i8,1,t5_2rww2
11800341,0,t1_dgxj3pn,Usually theyre overstock discontinued items previous packaging styles and occasionally things that are technically fine but dont meet the high quality standards to sell in the usual stores. For example if a palletcasebox was dropped in the warehouse so the packages were dented or the labels were irregularly coloredmisaligned the brand would call it defective or less than perfect and sell it to MarshallsTJMaxx. They dont sell other stores returns or hazardous defects.Source former Marshalls employee,MakeupAddiction,dgxly9l,17,t5_2rww2

11809274,0,t1_dgxgx42,could you do a tutorial for how you do your fake freckles? I love them! ,MakeupAddiction,dgymes7,5,t5_2rww2
11809312,1,t1_dgym68r,You deadass!?? Damn Ive never tried gel based! Do you use the moisturiser and then foundation or do you use a primer first? But yeah I have definitely noticed that if I wash my face TOO well my skin overcompensated in oil so I have a very gentle skin routine now. ,MakeupAddiction,dgymkcn,2,t5_2rww2
11810081,0,t1_dgyoi20,I do the same thing wipe with miscellar water then jump in the shower and make sure its all off.  I also have super light brows and it gives me way more confidence without makeup!,MakeupAddiction,dgyppat,2,t5_2rww2
