Actually not to bad but who can DD a  Plymouth. Chrysler LeBaron? Pretty much a tangle of seatbelts every time you go in and out. Coupe De Ville? Once youre in it its great but low roofline and large amount of legroom means crawling in and out of the back seat like a gorilla.Mini Cooper? Cramped at best. Camaro? Nope and riding in it as an adult I ended up putting my feet on the passenger side seat and sitting across the back.rd gen camaro? Yeah another nopeIntegra? Its basically a  seaterEclipse? Thats not a back seat thats a place for me to throw some groceriesPorsche ? Thats not a back seat agreed thats a spot for me to toss my purse.

Think about it like youre talking about a cars personality. Some cars look mean aggressive etc and others look happy think NA Miata. Kinda the same deal every car sits a specific way in relation to the wheels which results in that specific cars stance.gtgenerally used to describe low sitting cars?Again different answers depending on the person but from what Ive seenheard the people who arent into the whole stance scene see anything thats excessively low as being stanced while I and many friends see being low with no or little camber as just being slammed and a car thats low with visible negative camber as being stanced.,Stance,d3ksvv4,1,t5_2sd8l

9424450,0,t1_d9ahojf,Thank you!!Its a little of both mid engine car with  weight dist. that feels like a go kart is part of its magic. I mean if you get a chance drive one it feels like nothing else youve driven. The weight of the engine just leans into the rear wheels just making it dig and grip. Even at moderate speeds one can feel it just press down and want to rip. That being said the heavy rear also makes it susceptible to snap oversteer making it super dangerous. On the engine side the sgte I have the second gen version of the engine out of . gens is a toyota turbo engine with the top end made by yamaha meaning it revs quite high like the celicas zzge engine and the nd and rd gen are quite good at making high horsepower without crazy internal mods.I know most about the nd gen which is what I have .  hp out of the box and you can get  with just a boost controller and boost gauge. I have an upgraded turbo injectors intercooler pipes etc. so once I get a standalone ecu cant flash the older obd  ecus I should be at around whp.Gen s have hp stock and Ive seen them to up to hp with bolt ons and tunegen s are  stock swapped from the jdm toyota caldina and are apparently harder to get power out of requireing more work but are much more stable. Friend of mine has one running about  with just a water to air intercooler.aftermarket size you mean like other ones around?
