1369979,0,t3_29rczf,I was thinking about attempting to speed run Cave Story.  But I have no idea how one would go about defeating Ballos like so.  Ive only beaten him on Normal so far.  Try youtube..? ,cavestory,cio0jz2,3,t5_2smq4

5230001,0,t1_cvfx5p3,First phase I fully charged my Spur to MAX level. As soon as his hitbox activated I released the charged shot immediately changed to Blade and went ham on him.  Second phase I charge up my Spur again. Rinse and repeat as phase  but this time I user Super Missiles.  Third Phase I aligned myself to the left side of where the Ballos eyes would pop up. As soon as he started moving I released my Spur shot while aiming up changed the weapon to Blade and starting whacking the rest while moving along with his movement. As he was climbing to the top I intentionally took a damage while still equipping the Blade switch to Super Missiles and spam the rest of the eyes down while boosting upwards.  Final Phase I took the damage from floor spikes to boost into Ballos left eye while charging my Spur to MAX one last time. As soon as his eyes opened I unleashed the charge shot and finished him off with the Super Missiles.  GG,cavestory,cvgemxz,1,t5_2smq4

8831737,0,t1_d79g5s6,Thanks! I heard a lot of conflicting reports and I didnt know whether to buy CS as I wanted to buy it just for the CSD soundtrack. Some said it was a Humble Bundle limited edition others said it was in the normal Steam release.,cavestory,d79g94v,1,t5_2smq4
