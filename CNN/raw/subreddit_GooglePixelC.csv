6389008,0,t3_435pny,Unfortunately I think your check will not reveal much. The real issue iswill be whether the kernel and WiFi hardware technically support it but its very likely that the option to connect to Miracast will show up in the Android settings regardless of that capability after the mod as its just a change on the Android settings level.Source am Android app and OS dev,GooglePixelC,czfv40o,2,t5_3ajvz

6978582,0,t3_4az9qz,I got it to show up on one of my USB ports on my laptop. Im not sure exactly what fixed it but I did the following Updated my BIOS Changed the diver file as indicated here I dont think this did anything because it didnt work before Copied the DLL files from the Google USB Driver to the System folder and overwrote the old files I backed up the old files just in case. Put the word OLD in front of the nameFiles were in the folder usbdriveramd WdfCoInstaller.dll winusbcoinstaller.dll and WUDFUpdate.dllI think it was the last step that finally fixed it.,GooglePixelC,d17czol,1,t5_3ajvz

8433147,0,t3_4uxgue,If you want something that you wont be upset about losing on a vacation I might recommend the Teclast X Plus II.  Its not nearly as nice as the Pixel C but its about  the price.  It has the same exact screen from an iPad LG IPS . x an Intel Atom Z GB of DDR  RAM GB of EMMC NAND accepts up to GB SD cards and dual boots Android . and Windows .  I have one that I take on trips with me when I am worried about my Pixel C being loststolendamaged.  Obviously it is not nearly as nice as a Pixel C and has some issues with Wifi performance and no anti fingerprint coating but for the money its pretty amazing.  Make no mistake its a cheap Chinese tablet.  It comes with a lot of Chinese bloat installed and its probably never going to get updated to MarshmallowNougat.  That being said it will definitely play movies with no issue and can store a hell of a lot more of them for a lot less money.Im not trying to discourage you from buying a Pixel C.  I absolutely love mine and I think it is the best Android tablet available by a large margin.  I just think the Teclast is worth taking a look at as well.  If you want to pay a little extra you can get the Teclast X Plus version  which has identical specs and no wifi issues  ,GooglePixelC,d5vom2s,1,t5_3ajvz
8504549,0,t3_4vygyi,Is there a desktop level webbrowser installed?  I know that sounds like a vaguely ridiculous question but theres another desktoptype overlay that you can install on the PixelC from the Play Store and it includes a windowed desktop web browser.  The interface is not very good but dammit does that web browser scratch an itch!  Thanks in advance,GooglePixelC,d64mfoi,1,t5_3ajvz

9736763,0,t1_dacf4p8,OK...interesting behavior depending on how a note is started.  Im not an app expert by any means so there may be a way around this I dont seeknow.  Not sure WHY it does this....Test  Open Gmail on Pixel C WITH the physical keyboard.  Misspelled words are underlined red and selecting them gives me a list of alternative spelling options and words.Test  Open Gmail on Pixel C WITHOUT the physical keyboard.  Misspelled words are underlined black and selecting them gives me the three option list of alternative words....i.e.  No real spelling check.Also if I go BACK into a draft note started WITHOUT the physical keyboard but now WITH the physical keyboard I still do NOT get the spell check.,GooglePixelC,dad9oj3,1,t5_3ajvz

10577393,0,t3_5redl5,I wanted one of these but given the problems and bugs surrounding them at launch and Googles very short year update promise by the time everything got straightened out I felt as though the pricevalue proposition wasnt good enough. Its sad but if you care about updates you basically have to buy Google products right when they launch or at heavy discounts for them to be worth it in such a short product support cycle. ,GooglePixelC,dd6z4qe,4,t5_3ajvz
11805041,0,t3_5p0ej4,Ive got the same problem here... Serial number starts with  so must be a  model. Started to be unresponsive for  seconds then I couldnt unlock it because of that and now the touch screen is just dead. Can work only with a mouse and keyboard. Returning for a replacement. Hope the new one wont have the same problem,GooglePixelC,dgy54qe,1,t5_3ajvz
