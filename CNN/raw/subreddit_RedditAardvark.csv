1387097,0,t3_29x27s,DayTimeLantern here I think I would be a good Elder because I have been an Elder in a previous clan. I am very active and incomparison to where my village stood when I joined it has vastly improved. Granted I am not the best player within the clan I have improved quickly and I am looking to carry that on.Thanks DayTimeLantern.,RedditAardvark,ciq5kn5,2,t5_32co0

3090139,0,t3_2viavu,Ign pHiRules have been examined Ill have my lawyer look over the finer details then get back to youQuick question though  if we are having a hero being upgraded  wouldnt that disqualify a lot of members unless we gem them? I like to work on one hero at a time . So I will always have at least one hero for war. Of course this will be a moot point if a new update comes out and we can use heroes. ,RedditAardvark,coiahw1,4,t5_32co0
