Most jokes seemed to land well my fav was the girls dont like to be tied down.  I thought that was a great joke you could tell audiences got that one in waves too.You have a delivery similar to Jimmy Carr.  Is he one of your fav comedians?,standupfeedback,cvbxbn1,2,t5_39oh0

A quick glance is a lot less obvious than an entire hand action to remove your phone from your pocket bringing it up to your face looking and moving it back.All of your comedy is trying to shock people into laughter. Nothing is really actually funny.Try and stand strong. Stop wobbling about and flailing your arms about.I am not criticising your weight I used to be very large but large people have a habit of constantly pulling their tops down. You do it too. If you want to be up on stage you will need to whittle that out.You just disappear off stage. You didnt give the audience time to laugh for your closer. You just told it then fucked off. End nice and strong give them a moment to take it in. Give a nice leaving message. Give the host a signal normally docking or moving the mic stand and weight for him to come to the stage.,standupfeedback,czpv8ci,2,t5_39oh0
