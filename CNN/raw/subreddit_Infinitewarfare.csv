The IW that we have today are the ones that pieced together what was left of MW with SH. There first solo game from start to scratch was GHOSTS and it is shite. So the IW we have today has a  track record of releasing terrible game.This is why I have very little hope for Infinite Warfare. Especially considering it is likely going to be floaty space nonsense which doesnt appeal to me at all. I want boots on the ground. All we can wish for is that they havent tampered with MWR too much and that it plays just as it did back in the day but with gorgeous visuals. I have some hope since there was news of the original IW lead MP dev joining then for a short period before leaving again. I assume this was to oversee and help with the MWR.,Infinitewarfare,d2n47me,4,t5_3ecvx

If we really want to talk about imbalance all Treyarch games had that ONE gun that dominated the rest always an SMG on top of that at least IW had the decency to give us options when it comes to which OP gun to use. Also sledgehammer helped with multiplayer development for the past few cods. Im sure they had their hands in the balance department. ASM was fine from launch but they somehow screwed that up too while still not even properly dealing with the BAL.

It is made by Infinity Ward the CoD Dev with the most controversial track record in FPS Dev History and with ATVIs funding which will surely mean another Supply DropPW Fiasco.  Been a CoD fan for  years and in the last  of those years I have been burnt incredibly badly by getting my hopes too high AW and Ghosts. Plus the incredibly shady tactic of slapping MWR onto IW so I cant buy it separately..Thats why Im getting frustrated seeing people blindly open their arms to IW. Im not saying you shouldnt look forward to it but you should at least look at it with a raised eyebrow before you hand over your money for it.

8140853,0,t3_4qdseo,Hello everyone. With the gameplay weve probably seen multiplayer gameplay of Battlefield  and how certain actions can lead to the destruction of the environment and the weather changing automatically COD has a lot to work on if it needs to survive but heres the ideaSince Infinite warfare is all space related whos to keep Infinity Ward from making maps in space? Keeping that in mind it would be amazing that during a multiplayer map one that is setup on a spaceship in space as the players are busy shooting each other that in the mid of the game the ship one which the players are fighting on moves into an asteroid field!?! By this the players will have two choices Rather to retreat into the ship or to use the asteroids to their advantage! This would present a whole to twist to the game and provide new and alternative ways to flank or attack enemies.Another scenario which could be added to such a map is the ship going into a NEBULA! Imagine trying to shoot your enemies through a thick brown gas! It would make it difficult for the players to see and shoot each other and would be a bad day for a sniper. Think of this as the fog we saw in battlefield  multiplayer gameplay.Another thing that could be added in multiplayer is an abandoned base setup in a desert planet. As the players are fighting the map could go through a devastating sandstorm! This would be like the nebula as stated above. Do note that these environmental changes will not harm the players but will only change the atmosphere of the game.I think these sort of environmental changes will really spice up the multiplayer gameplay and lead to new and more exciting ways of taking down ones opponent. Sure IW isnt Battlefield and isnt BOTG but maybe these features will help. Hope you all agree and hope Infinity Ward adds these things into the game,Infinitewarfare,d4v5hck,1,t5_3ecvx

Shooting in that game was very easy and shooting at someone boosting was not hard at all. It promoted randomness lag comp and lacked strategy because you were able to boost across the map in seconds.If you followed the competitive scene at all youd know FaZe was able to win tournaments in AW because of their slaying ability now in BO they havent even been to a finals due to the change in game and having to actually be strategical.

Its hitdetection was the best that the COD series has ever had and one thing to keep in mind is that those new devs were on a shorter timeline. This Infinity Ward is has had a full  years to work together more than any other developer before them. Im intrigued with Sledgehammers entrant next year and Ive kind of lost faith in Treyarch but I was never a huge fan of the BO series anyways but Infinity Wards games have always given me something that I can go back and play again and again.

What bothers me is that fact that despite knowing absolutely nothing about the rig characters other than how they work gameplaywise some people are just assuming that theyre all male and that theyre being oppressed. From what weve seen so far it seems that the devs have come up with a great system that lets anyone of any race or gender or whatever play as whatever character they want to and still be able to immerse themselves as the character because there are no restrictions as to who each rig character really is. These people complaining however are ignoring all of that and just making problems when there is absolutely no need for them to exist. ,Infinitewarfare,d7cdl6l,1,t5_3ecvx

The new FOV parameter in BO is based on resolution. So if your desktop resolution is x you have  aspect ratio. This is important because most games scale the FOV by expanding the horizontal degrees and keeping the vertical degrees fixed. FOV  is equal to . horizontal degrees at  resolution.

They are way too close quarters.Colour scheme seems dull.And so far ive had below average connection most games.This is just my opinion i do not expect you or even others to agree.But this is why I will not be purchasing the game just hoping they release MWR separately.Just to add BO grew old quickly for me so im personally biased against futuristic settingmovement Edit Just adding a few more pointsI dont like specialist didnt like them in BO they create unfair gunfights.

9305079,0,t1_d8vgan3,Id like to explain a few things about burst vs auto fire and why the Epic variant seems like a purely negative variant. Switching the fire mode to full auto will increase the time it takes for the gun to kill. Take the MSBS in Ghosts if you put full auto on it it loses its  shot kill ability and becomes a  shot kill at close range. Not to mention that the two perks the RKT variant has will barely provide a benefit. The increased accuracy is basically useless because the burst variants already have barely any recoil to begin with. The increased ammo perk is also fairly redundant because as an energy weapon it regenerates ammo at a decent rate although it might help with the full auto nature. A damage increasing variant with the Heavy Hitter perk would been better as an Epic variant ,Infinitewarfare,d8vhido,1,t5_3ecvx

9309375,0,t1_d8vysxi,The thing Im concerned about is how they can go about reworking snipers. BO sniping was way OP but it did have a super high population during its cycle and even during ghosts cycle the population was thriving so Id argue sniping didnt actually kill the game. To counter your point about catering to a certain demographic would you buy a game if they made your favourite weapon class useless? And would you buy a game if a weapon you detested was viable to use?For me the answers are no and yes and Id argue thats the same for almost everyone. People who hate quickscopers are going to buy the game theyre too passionate about COD not to but people who exclusively quickscope wont because thats what they enjoy in the game and theyll feel scorned by a game theyve been relatively loyal to. So it begs the question what can a developer possibly do about quickscoping? They can A Remove Snipers completely possibly losing a chunk of their populationB Nerf them into oblivion a la Black Ops  so only the best of the best can actually use them and do decent SprattyC Leave them how they are angering a few people but probably not losing any sales or playersI think they should leave them be with the low TTK of the game and the ridiculously long boltaction time snipers arent as OP as people are making them out to be but I am insanely biased towards snipers like the people are against so take my opinion with a grain of salt. ,Infinitewarfare,d8w14ur,1,t5_3ecvx

9329268,0,t1_d8yjk2c,Well bo had absolutely no aim assist on the SVG and locus but I personality had little problems with sniping in BO  example but that has a lot do to with the fact that Ive been sniping since COD.  Btw the snipers in bo have better stats so if they do change it to bo with no aim assist then they have to speed up the scope in time the rate of fire and the damage or else no one will ever pick one up. At that point they might as well just not put them in the game.

Activision is the publisher and Treyarch would mean the development studio which is a whole other company.I would imagine that there are some roles in the development studio who do care about revenue.  At least the CFO and the people in their department and also the CEO.Different roles would care about different things.  Software developers probably care that the code does what its supposed to do and is efficient.  Community Managers care that the community is happy.  Etc.So I dont think anyone can really make a statement like an entire development studio doesnt care about how much money they make.What sort of games do you make?

It is very similar to BO and I see how that can be a let down for many people. But for me I see it as new maps new guns and new metas. Im ready to learn a new COD.

It felt as if everyone dies too quick in the game and most guns have aim assist and all. I enjoy battlefield because I play every class except the LMGs never a fan of those weapons. Sniping in battlefield is absolutely fun and can get you mad at times because you have to how do I say it aim it correct to get a  shot kill on the enemy it took me a couple days to get that because it was mostly taking me  bullets to kill  guy and sometimes i still end up dying by the guy Im shooting at.  Just feel as if CoD is losing there touch adding all these plasma guns air thrusters etc. If CoD didnt have those I wouldnt mind if the surrounding was futuristic some proper specialist weapons lethals ,Infinitewarfare,d97x24i,3,t5_3ecvx

9415953,0,t3_59jgeo,This started happening to me as soon as I got a new router. I Googled and found many suggestions including what you tried resetting the controller. Idk about you but I have two controllers and  one controller seems to do it and not the other? I was having my best game on the beta just melting people but then my controller started doing the thing and I was so mad it ruined the whole thing and my mom came in with chicken tendies and I just threw them to the floor I didnt even care. I immediately checked if it was my phones Bluetooth... It wasnt on. Even turned off its WiFi. Not sure what Im gonna do. Some posts suggested it could be interference from USB? Idk. I turned my ps so the front faced a different direction also Ive tried turning my router to an angle. you would be surprised what small movements can  change it says on one thread. I have yet to find a foolproof method but it seems to be happening less. May disable the ghz band on the router next time it happens or just disable it altogether see if thats the problem. I think I read somewhere that it can overlap into the Bluetooth range. I also read that even when you plug in with a wire the Bluetooth will still be on? Idk but Im not happy when it starts happening. It has been happening to me on other games also it is not limited to iwmwr it has happened on rocket league as well as nba k. Usually I can tell when it is about to happen by the PS menu not responding properly ,Infinitewarfare,d99jd28,3,t5_3ecvx

9451489,0,t1_d9e0xha,Yeah thats fine for multikills. But at the end of the day my point still stands. All engagements on COD are CQC probably averaging m or so. Why would one class of weapon randomly go against proven physics? That is an illogical balancing. What they did to them is a logical way of handling it. Now only time will tell if they went to far with it. Balancing snipers can be quite hazardous its easy to make them OP and just as easy to make them completely useless.

Lag compensation outright deletes bullets when you die and there is still the connection from all three parties both players and the server that has to communicate.Firing  bullets into a guys chest and having only  or  of them register before hes killed me is absolutely lag compensation especially on a ms connection that is stable as fuck.I dont bitch about lag compensation.

9546185,0,t3_5bn4el,I had them in the beta. I was torn between going for the elite erad that also has an under barrel shotgun attachment but ultimately decided on the butchers. They are okay. I think they are pretty much on par with all the other shotguns in the game. And the problem with the shotguns isnt how they are actually performing its what weve become accustomed to and afar we expect from shotguns. In summary I think all shotguns get a range increase the butchers included but as they currently stand again they are okay. EDIT with as slow as the earn rate is for salvage like the OP says you may want to look elsewhere. If you get them out of a drop enjoy them.

9585086,0,t3_5c8aqw,gt I instantly revoke saying TiF was the best fps campaign Ive ever played.Im a little curious on your thoughts here. Having played both theyre both excellent and do things differently but I felt IW had more weak spots than TF  particularly too many good characters not enough time to develop them.IW Campaign Spoilers obviouslyThe game starts with excellent characterization. I really enjoyed Salters character and watching her grow. I actually laughed out loud when Ethan fooled Salt with the human farmer bit. It was all very organic and believable. Where it starts to fall apart is with characters who dont really have enough screen time to bond with them. I know that IW was a war story and part of war stories is that people die without a satisfying conclusion to their arc but I felt that there were narrative gaps  SSgt. Omar doesnt like Ethan then theyre buds. Pvt. Kashima wants into the LTs pants and then that arc is dropped until his dying words pay lip service to it. Brooks is unfortunately devoid of time to develop as a character. Perhaps most importantly theres definitely a close bond of some sort between Salt and Reyes and it never gets the exploration and narrative payoff that it deserves. Theres tones of character drama but also an ensemble cast and they dont quite mesh together.Also the SDF felt underdeveloped to me as a faction. Granted I have the same complaint about the IMC in TF but it gets more of a pass as its much more character drama than war story. I was super excited that Peter Weller was a member of the SDF admiralty. I couldnt wait for a dramatic confrontation with him as Reyes and crew wear down the SDF with guerilla raids... and then it turns out he dies in a side mission. If you didnt already know who he was youd miss it since its less VAdm. Caleb Thies and more one of three SDF dudes in a conference room. Despite the information we get on the SDF from death tips theres not a lot beneath the surface. I especially wanted to know why Adm. Kotch really really hates Earth and the answer is... he really really hates Earth. Its a conclusion thats missing the steps that lead to it.I do think that IW was the best CoD campaign since MW and this is coming from someone who enjoyed AW and Black Ops  even if BO didnt make any damn sense. I was just left wanting more but not in the good way Titanfall  left me wanting more.,Infinitewarfare,d9uk2sj,4,t5_3ecvx

9586805,0,t1_d9uqni6,I definitely think my aim is part of it. I think the lesser amount of auto aim in IW mixed with the shorter TTK makes me panic a bit more when using it lol as opposed to the annihilator in BO I was able to absorb  or  shots from an enemy and I could still count on the auto aim to drag the reticle onto the enemy for the kill.I think I just need to use it more. Ill eventually get better with it. Honestly I have found that to be the case with everything in IW. I played the game much faster in BO than I do in IW.

So get to level  of one then switch to the next mission team get to level five switch again when youre done level  for each go back to wolverines level up until you get the bonus and then switch again. Just concentrate on the active mission for each team.

The gun doesnt look like it was dunked in a vat of paint it doesnt cover the entire gun and if you look closely at the front of the barrel the tops of the grips and toward the stock there is a lot of weathering where the camo has been worn away. I think this gives the gun a more used and professional and realistic look. The ERAD with this camo looks like a gun that was actually used in combat. ,Infinitewarfare,da5azvh,23,t5_3ecvx

I popped BO in and while it wasnt buttery smooth at all times it was playable and the worse I did was break even out of nine or ten matches.Activision Ive had better online play from ps era online games.

Hiding player numbers. They just cant be bothered and would rather have those devs work on keyssupply dropsmoneygrabbing instead. Something happened during development which meant that multiplayer was x more rushed than usual. There were a bunch of bugs and they just didnt have time to fix them. I personally like this theory.

9784874,0,t3_5fc73u,I dont know what DimX is  but I have some comments for the rest.  go to hardcore  you get a kill feed and that is it.  Nothing distracting about it.  You learn to interrogate the kill feed to get useful information.  Couple that with what teammates you can see around you.  Make note of their gamertags so you can tell if they get taken out  there is an enemy coming from where you last saw them.  Your Xbox will ask your router to forward data to a specific port.  However your router will only ALLOW traffic that you specify.  Just open the firewall up completely for your xboxps by IP address.  Firewall and port forwarding are two separate functions.  PlugnPlay ONLY sets up port forwarding.  Your firewall will still block the traffic unless you explicitly tell it not to.  Give your XboxPS a static IP or reserve an address in DHCP  then create an ALLOW rule for all UDP traffic.  PnP will then request a port forward AND your firewall will allow it  your NAT issues should resolve.  Since they dont provide a breakdown of what challenges were completed at the end of the match  you really cant tell what the heck they are doing.  Best advice is to get headshots  lots of headshots during double XP.  In TDM  you get  XP for the kill  XP for the headshot  that comes to  XP for the headshot kill.  I dont think you get double XP for challenges.  I did the Alpha challenge that rewards  XP since I only got K for the game   I assume that it only counted once.  So I only think you get double XP for kills and objective stuff  not challenges.  I could be wrong but I dont know of a way to prove it one way or another.Edited Reddit turned some of my numbers into a formatted list and changed the numbers,Infinitewarfare,daj7671,3,t5_3ecvx

9787192,0,t3_5fcww5,I think it is the best single player and zombies that COD has had. I have not really been into zombies the last few years but man this one is fun. The story of the single player was great too. However the MP at least for me falls flat. We are three weeks into the game and I am already switching to another game when I want to play some online multiplayer. The game is just way too inconsistent and team balance is god awful. Not to mention I honestly do not know if IW knows how to actually balance weapons. People praise the game for its weapon balance but after the changes to the Volk there is no reason to use it unless you are going for camos. The Rk has way to short of a one burst range and the Type  seems a bit weak to me. I honestly feel like if I want to compete with an AR then I have to use the Kbar or the NV. We also cannot forget about an entire group of weapons which have been nerfed from past CODs the shotguns. The pump shotguns have no range at all and get outgunned by pretty much everything except another pump shotgun. Now I know they did not do this but it feels like they played BO and then if they liked something they made it better and if they did not like something they made it worse. They liked the ICR and HVK so they made the NV and Kbar and made them a little better. They did not like the Man o War so they made the Volk and then beat it death with the nerf hammer. Man after reading this it really sounds like I hate the game. I honestly dont. Like I said I love the single player and ZiS. It is just I do not really enjoy the MP all the much right now. But hey that is just one opinion and if you like the MP then that is awesome. I am glad you like the MP. I  have experienced way too many inconsistencies to really get into it.  ,Infinitewarfare,dajhg6r,3,t5_3ecvx
9789237,0,t1_daj9v0f,Theres no stupidity here at all dude. Fun is entirely subjective. I simply cannot comprehend how someone can have fun with a tense even competitive game in a war game. Dying in general is simply not fun. I place much more weight on staying alive than I do on getting kills. If you find it fun to have even games then more power to you. And my success is exactly what I think it is Pubstomping. I know Im not beating up on pros or anything. At the end of the day its a war game and I value immersion over anything else in this genre. Immersion is simply ruined when you die and respawn too many times a game. Its just so much fun to kill loads upon loads of people without dying and going on huge  killstreaks. If the game wasnt designed for that kind of stuff then why are there so many accolades for streaky gameplay? If CoD had say Halo s SBMM then it would be an absurdity to get a  killstreak. Every game of Halo  at the higher ranks was an absolute sweatfest where the most positive score you could hope to obtain was something like .I can kind of see your point in other genres such as RTS or fighting games. I dont like to play against noobs at all in those games I want close and tense matches. But a war game is something else entirely and I think most of CoDs original audience would agree. Why even play CoD if you want that kind of gameplay? Theres all kinds of FPS games that do everything better than CoD. CoDs only market niche has been to pound noobs into the ground with broken killstreaks and shit on them. But it wasnt necessarily to the detriment of those noobs. Because of the way the snowballing worked with MW streaks any noob might have his day one game. And that created an interval level of reinforcement which is the same psychological underpinnings of slot machine addiction. Thats what kept everyone playing. In fact if you remember in BO there was a huge outcry for a barebones playlist that removed killstreaks so that it was just gun on gun. That playlist was dead after a week. A lot of people seem to think they want fair gun v gun action in CoD but the stats dont really suggest it.,Infinitewarfare,dajqij9,-1,t5_3ecvx

Every match I get melted before I even get a chance to fire back or even better I shoot first and get hit markers first but still die on a few bullets.Ive not tried campaign yet but I hear that is good at least. I mainly got this for MWR so not really that let down but the multiplayer for me online is very disappointing compared to the other CoDs. I really dont care about special weapon unlocks or progression either so Im glad IW at least has offline support where Im not infected by the annoying netcode this game has online. Same thing happened to me with like Advanced Warfare I got to like level  online and never went online again. I still play offline bot matches with that game but refuse to touch online again.

Then I got even better in BO and even better than that in Ghosts. I was better than most of the teens and early s players that I played with regularly. Suddenly as if out of nowhere all the playing  sports a year in high school decided to hit me. I had a back injury from wrestling that always bugs me and two shoulder injuries from both wrestling and baseball that decided to flair up. I can still play for a good while if I have nothing to do but I am constantly adjusting my grip on my controller because I cant get comfortable and my ring and pinky fingers will get tingles that run through them. I am still at a . in this game but I doubt I will ever get better. I will say this though. If I knew then what I know now I would never have wrestled and played baseball in high school.

But it sees no problem with the NV and LMGs being God mode not to mention TTK for subs. A truly terrible player can use these guns and get a . kd yet many pro players who mainly snipe are rarely above that.

I found that a lot more people used Scarabs and Vultures in hardcore over core.Run Engineer so you can see where it is at all times and then run one of these payloads Overdrive my  choice run fast so you get to the Scarab before it finds a teammate Phase Shift bypass enemies to get to it easier. You can also see the scorestreak while in Phase Shift but I dont know if you can destroy it Active Camo same as Phase Shift except charges slower lasts longer and leaves you slightly visible and vulnerable to enemiesDont aim at the scorestreak aim at the ground under it Scarab or a wallceiling near it Vulture.You can take down a Warden as well I did for one of my  but youll want to either switch classes to one with the Spartan or have a buddy run the Spartan. It takes  shots with the Spartan plus about  with the Howitzer so its tough to get all those shots in without it flying away. It also needs to be on a map where the Warden flies fairly low mine was on Frontier.EDIT  Blind Eye is also a good choice for a perk so Vultures Wardens and Shock Sentries dont target you while youre going for them or other scorestreaks near them.,Infinitewarfare,dashvjq,2,t5_3ecvx

9912226,0,t3_5he9qo,Im mainly a core player so here are some tips Try to stay towards the outside of the map.  Core plays faster than Hardcore and players tend to gravitate towards the center or camp down the outer lanes.  Trying to play in the center of the map will cause you to get shot from multiple angles. Watch the killfeed and minimap a lot.  If you notice that a few of your teammates are on the other side of the map and the killfeed shows a couple enemy deaths in the last  seconds or so you should expect the enemy to be spawning behind you. UAV Vulture and Trinity Rocket are great streaks to use.  With Hardline you basically earn the Vulture and Trinity simultaneously and in my experience theyre good for at least  kills per use combined.  With the recent buff to the vulture its a great lowtier streak. Try to keep your engagements in your favor.  What I mean by this is if youre using an SMG try to put yourself in situations where youll get in close range gunfights.  Dont try to traverse large stretches of open map.  Stick to buildings and tight corridors.  If youre using an AR try to stay away from buildings and try to catch SMG users in situations where theyre out of range.,Infinitewarfare,dazl46p,1,t5_3ecvx

9917367,0,t1_dayz0ui,I doubt theyve made over a billion dollars. Also its pretty funny your trying to say Bf and Tf is better yet IW sold more then both of those combined. Call of duty always wins now better if they have dedicated severs or whatever theres not that many people who actually give a shit like my self. I play a game to have fun which is what is intended I dont try to find things to bitch about if the servers start getting to where they are shitty then I get off for the day and go outside. And of course bo sold more its because it had Black Ops in the title since bo and bo was such a big hit everyones gonna purchase bo but Infinite Warfare is a new title and its space themed and nobody wants to like it they want to jump on the bandwagon. If they didnt give a shit about us they wouldnt be giving us free shit they wouldnt add a way to get supply drops without paying. They wouldnt of added the salvage. They wouldnt have remastered a game because they knew people wanted BoG but it was to late to go back. So just calm your shit I didnt make this post for people to start bitching. Go play Bf or Tf both of them are shitty games imo which is why I chose Infinite Warfare this year Bf is a reskinned Battlefront. Titanfall  isnt all that great,Infinitewarfare,db09ajr,-1,t5_3ecvx

Sure it would be smart to constantly squad up when playing pubs as to avoid playing with garbage players but most people dont take this game that seriously. Your inability to understand that an OP care package can and will be used against you while remaining OP shows how smart you are. The best bang for your buck is to play smart and earn score streaks that dont require you to wait camp and possibly get killed while vulnerable and capturing your care package. There are more drawbacks to the score streak than there are benefits though I imagine walking you through it ten more times wont help that glazed look in your eyes melt into understanding. Everyone using care packages are either garbage stupid selfish or a combination of the three. Even a good player will lose a care package now and then. Smart money eliminates the risk of handing the opposing team a warden. Youd have to be an imbecile not to recognize the constant negative potential. Then you have the fact that spawns are kind of screwed. A good player cant fix spawns. A good player cant go around an okay player who happens to be in the right place at the right time.

9959762,0,t1_db5pz2h,. I was being fair to COD. In reality COD actually earns less than their mobile division and Blizzards games. I dont remember exact numbers thats why I just used an even  split to make it easy. In reality the revenue split from COD should be even smaller.. In  Jan. to Sept. to be exact net income divided by revenue equals  meaning only  of their total revenue clears expenses taxes interest payments etc. and makes it to bottom line. This is called profit margin.. Youre right. I must have found hard data for revenue streams somewhere and misplaced them. It should be  million if using a  split but I must have found what the split actually should have been and used that. So reverse the math and  of their revenue this year came from COD. Not the  we were assuming.. Well I really cant say that for sure. Past COD games have sold anywhere from  million on launch week and have done anywhere between  million in sales total. For some reason Activision does not report financials for the months of Oct. to Dec. Its almost as if their physical year runs between January to September.

10117894,0,t3_5krtfr,NV Flatline Good at winning the long range engagements. Bad at the close range engagements. Still my main NV to use though. Fun on terminal.RKT Description says it all. Handles well.Volk Corruption A more challenging gun to use. Recoil gets a little jumpy but is typically like a  hit medium range kill. The extra XP comes in the form of getting an extra medal called mo money every kill. I couldnt tell you how much extra it is though.Erad Cerberus One of my personal favorites. Run it with quickdraw and dexterity and youll be melting anyone whos unfortunate to run across your path. Also my goto gun in zombies. FHR Windfall Gets lots of hate but I honestly do better with it than the other variants thanks to the built in trojan sight. I havent noticed much of a dramatic difference when it comes to the invigorate perk though. Karma  Phobos This thing is SOLID. Works great if you do a lot of running and gunning. Good handling good TTK clean ironsights. Probably your best choice when it comes to mission team guns. HVR Gemini Fun to use but I havent found myself using them as much as I thought I would.RAW Liberty Hate reloading? This thing is your answer. Can rack up some solid kill chains and can be used in every situation. Very dependable.Mauler Mammoth This thing packs a punch. One of the more challenging guns to use but as long as youre running Merc man at arms then youll be fine. I try to stay out of CQB situations with it. Another good one for racking up some big kill chains.Titan Scout Take the titan and make the default sight highlight enemies and youve got the Scout. Dont sweat about crafting this one. KBS Big Brother Barely touched this thing cause Im not a sniper. Looks cool I guess. You can see through walls with it on zombies thats about all I know.EBR Bomber Its as good as youve heard it is. Again not much of a sniper but from the time I used it it seemed solid. EBR Osiris Eh dont worry about this one. Perk doesnt come into play a whole lot. Banshee Siren Been having a lot of fun with this one lately. The increased damage range is nice and its even better with speaker amp. No idea how well the perk does though.Rack  Smoothbore If slugs are your thing then youll like this. I personally havent had any problems with one shot kills but Ive heard some other people have. If you dont mind giving up hipfiring and spread for a good bit of extra range then go for it. Hailstorm Thunder Barely touched it so no idea. I bought the MP and Zombies holiday bundles and took advantage of that  rare cost deal. I dont mind dropping  for some drops here and there. ,Infinitewarfare,dbqday2,3,t5_3ecvx

10248670,0,t1_dc5pr7h,Look I understand that its not always fun to play in lobbies that arent completely full but its not my fault that your lobby ended up that way and I shouldnt be punished for it. When it comes to joining games in progress if I can help it I dont even let it get to the point to where I hit the loading screen. I dont know if youve noticed it or not but if you pay attention to the countdown in the pregame lobby there is an indicator that tells you whether the game is already in progress or not. If I see that it is I just back out and find another lobby so it shouldnt be affected by my choice with the exception of me just not being in that particular game. If the people that are in those lobbies that are mismatched leave before or after the game ends thats on them not me. Honestly though when it comes to me being in matches and the teams not being completely full I really dont have a big problem with it. I see it as one of two ways. Either were outnumbered and it makes it a target rich environment for me or we outnumber them and Ive got better odds of not dying. Sure it may slow down the match but I can live with it if it was my lobby to begin with. At least then I know what Im getting into from the get go and am not going in blind.Also in BO it really wasnt better. People would just join and back out so its not too much different. ,Infinitewarfare,dc5qrp6,2,t5_3ecvx

10267710,0,t1_dc7vsxw,If youre referring to me as being defensive because I have to rely on a party youre really wrong. I actually perform much better solo but playing in parties is still fun. Also just because youre in a party  doesnt mean that youre all going to be above a  kd. Its quite easily as feasible for the lobby made teams to all be above  kd as it is for a bunch of friends playing together. If youre whole party is above  kd youll probably have an advantage over the other team regardless of whether or not you are actually in a party or if the game put you together that way. Its funny how defensive people get when it comes to playing against parties see what I did there?. ,Infinitewarfare,dc7wg68,-1,t5_3ecvx

10275669,0,t3_5n5243,Hacks are out there but I find MOST games are hackerfree. I usually friend up with some average skill nonhackers so that I can join friends games for future sessions if I need to escape hackers. So far IW gives me fairer competition than past CoD games. TDM usually comes down to the wire with scores like  being very common.,Infinitewarfare,dc8swku,1,t5_3ecvx
10276978,0,t3_5n5kxj,Here are some facts that I can see from my router. If you dont switch lobbies the host be it dedicated or pp doesnt seem to change.. Most of the time US location Im connecting to a dedicated server. Thus the only things changing from match to match are players teams and the map. Unless theres some sort of bug that gives some players special sauce I cant imagine how such a bug might work the socalled inconsistencies are more playerdependent than gamedependent.If you switch lobbies you get a different host. At least for me most of the time I still connect to the same dedicated server site just a different server. Maybe some people arent getting dedicated servers and this may affect the consistency from lobby to lobby but this shouldnt be the case in NA and Europe.Anecdotally if you watch streamers people that are at least decent at the game their performance match to match is pretty consistently top of the lobby. ,Infinitewarfare,dc8y8zb,3,t5_3ecvx
10277697,0,t3_5n4iuk,I agree with this request. If the other team has all the good players and you have all the rest you already know how the games going to so why not let those who want to find a more suitable match leave? Also id much rather have some people drop out the lobby than start a match and then be left with one other guy pointing at the sky after a minute you end up having to leave anyway if everyone else bails.,Infinitewarfare,dc916xl,1,t5_3ecvx
10279979,0,t1_dc97pj9,Well youre getting angry at him for voicing his opinion saying who cares what he thinks. Why is your opinion more important than his. You also say that he should kick rocks and not interfere with you and your peers who care about the game to try and improve it. Why is it that his opinions about in game balance be of no value compared to your opinion about leaderboards in the game. You really have no reason to tell him to not interfere. If youre right you will get upvoted and the devs will read your posts. You also get really defensive and vulgar. Thats typically the signs of someone who is insecure. Finally his point is extremely valid. If you want something in the game come in here and ask for it. Let your peers upvote you. Post it every day who cares. But dont complain. If you continue to not get the game you want stop buying it. If enough people do that they will get the message. Continuing to complain while still buying content just proves your words mean nothing.

For instance I REALLY want the RKT but I dont want to drop k to craft it knowing that during the ENTIRE cycle Im going to be lucky to have MAYBE k total salvage I have k right now to use from here onwards with two semesters of school even if I played a fuck ton. I definitively regret the  I spent on the digital deluxe if they were going to spit in our face. I regret the  I spent on COD points last month. Why they didnt just do a server rollback that night to prevent all of this?Out of all the negative feedback Infinity Ward has gotten I have mostly turned a blind eyegiven them the benefit of the doubt.

There were already high chances for getting a preowned variant and now those are doubled. Plus however many epic camos were added times the number of weapon types. Crunching the numbers may show similar or yntouched probablity but thats not how its gonna work out. Probablity is a representation of what would happen in a flawless scenario.

Are you that shitty at creating an argument that you cant even understand the words you type? You dont get to make a general statement and then go back on it because I tried to prove you wrong. You fucked up and you tried to be more specific to cover your ass. Problem is in doing so you fucked up again and are now trying to argue instead of putting on your big boy shoes and admitting youre wrong.I have posted this source three times now. How about you put your money where your mouth is and actually read it. I used Google to get it as you suggested. That ought to make it worth your time.In case you get lost with all those words on that website though I did copy and paste the part you should look at below.December  Top  Xbox One Games Call of Duty Infinite Warfare Battlefield NPD collects digital and physical sales units. So no it didnt outsell it on the Xbox One. Its in second place as it always was. Since launch and until now.As for proof since December I dont have screenshots of that. All I have is from November th which shows Battlefield having a smaller player count than not just Infinite Warfare but even Black Ops III I did post the sales figures from December and the entire year above though which show Battlefield  didnt suddenly get more sales in December to offset that.So no it isnt doing better in current sales. Player count yes. But not current sales. My argument all along was never to disprove Battlefield  is more played at this moment. Any dumbass could look it up and see that it was. It was to show it isnt and never has at any point been selling better than Call of Duty. And it probably never will.If you somehow manage to come up to another counter argument then Im impressed. You have no leg to stand on with your statement of current sales.,Infinitewarfare,dcnztg3,2,t5_3ecvx

10424858,0,t1_dcpppf3, The HVR likes to kick up and to the right with its recoil. I say like to because on average when I went into custom game and shot at a wall multiple timestried after the buff to SMGs. I did this to see if grip does anything at all yet which is no so even you have grip on it youre wasting a slot. But anyways when using the gun aim for their left bottom torso. I drew on a guy...Look there and youll see what I mean. If you aim around there give or take up more it should recoil towards the chest and head. But do this at medium ranges. Close to medium up a tad higher. While point blank is well  hit so shouldnt be a factor. Thats he best advice I can give with it. But also if you shoot someone at mid and you dont kill them run away. Dont try and challenge it because chances are youll die at those ranges. Always stay moving with this gun. And if you jump around alot it has decent hip spread. So start with the spread and lock in when with ADS after initially hip firing first.,Infinitewarfare,dcpq60l,8,t5_3ecvx

There are so many factors that go into something being popular or getting supported by big youtubers that you really just gotta stay in your own lane and do your thing. Ill probably get a ton of hate for this but look at a guy like Driftor. One of the biggest cod youtubers of all time yet he quit supporting the game within days. Why? I believe its because he was just not good enough at it to support a channel. In all of his early vids he would go double negative and showed zero improvement. Whereas a guy like jhub was dropping deatomizers on day one. Nobody wants to watch streams and support a channel where a guy is going double negative every time. Then look at a guy like  thunder.

10480070,0,t3_5q2zxu,Mactav all the way its my goto right now. It has great range for an SMG which makes it great with a silencer and I feel comfortable challenging ARs out to the longer end of midrange. It also beats ARs up close which is nice in an ARdominated game especially with the new sprintout time changes although subs are getting more popular now. My only complaint is that its not my favorite kind of recoil pattern. Its definitely not a large amount of recoil but it is slightly random as opposed to straight vertical recoil which for me is slightly annoying. But since there isnt much of it Im fine with it and its only an issue at slightly longer ranges.,Infinitewarfare,dcw0vse,1,t5_3ecvx

And if you need to rush them you should go Akimbo and move around as quickly as you can.

Pellet damage is starting to feel closer to the MW AA with damage proficiency. Hopefully they continue buffing all the others in the same way. Just a few more good tweaks to damage and range and itll be perfect. Reaver Rack variants aside from Smoothbore Banshee and SRavage could all use the same treatment.

10628406,0,t3_5s39rj,I have a . KD and I consider myself a pretty fucking good player and I play mostly solo. Since I put the KBAR and NV away and replaced them with the Howitzer and fucking Kendal pistol to grind for solar camo you realise how much of a fucking sweaty bitch made wannabe try hard everyone is. Literally everyone uses the fucking NV and KBAR and I see so many kids with . KDs trying their absolute hardest in a game of demolition trying to spawn trap and get their st ever nuke. Its hilarious so every game as the match progresses and my team often full of negative KDs ala match making gets pushed further and further back I have to switch to my NV and return the favour just to scratch my KD back up to around . so It doesnt take a complete hammering as I try and get solar. Demolition is the absolute worst gametype for groups of sweaty bastards cordinating a spawn trap and the gametype is terrible for a person who enjoys playing solo like me. Its great when there are maybe only one or two other good kids in the lobby because the match is even and I dont have to pull out my KBAR to drag my team to overtime where we lose anyway because timmy no thumbs is going  and is feeding the enemy team wardens and endless counter UAVS.The point Im trying to make is this Demolition is great but there is no skill in spawn killing in it. Spawn trapping in demolition is fucked its not like capturing A and B in domination and keeping the enemy team pinned in C but still having to win gunfights its more like a team of  all with barely  KDs and clan tags like PhiZ and TP literally aiming on your exact spawn point as to where you cant move before you are dead.

10648199,0,t3_5sb3tp,I dont think its necessarily boring but a bit of dynamism to the environments really helps BOTG feel alive. A big part of why I liked Black Ops  so much is because I really got to learn the maps beyond just left lane middle lane right lane top level bottom level. There were a ton of ways to navigate from swimming to chaining wallruns. Hunted is a great example of a map that took full advantage of BOs new mechanics.Even something as simple as being able to blow a hole in the wall or automatically vault over a barrier would be a really cool addition to a bootsontheground CoD. Im not saying tear the whole map down or create murderholes like in Rainbow Six Siege but being able to shut down campers by taking down the rafters above them or creating a ramp to the second floor by shooting out a scaffolds supports would be a really unique way to play.,Infinitewarfare,ddea2sv,1,t5_3ecvx

10697138,0,t3_5sxqgj,Play hardcore. It is extremely easy to get streaks in hardcore. I almost exclusively play hardcore TDM.  My kd is a . SPM is . Not bragging just merely posting it to add some validity to this post.  I run UAV Warden APEX. I recommend you run UAV Warden maybe care package. I like to avoid aerial bombing streaksscorchers bombardment due to killing team matesyourself on occasion. Also I find them easily avoided most maps have a building close by to run into before its dropped. You want to play to your own play style and what you can accomplish. If you can only get constant  kills in a row then run streaks that you will get every life. Map awareness in my opinion is the most important part of getting streaks. If you always know where the enemy is coming from you will maintain a higher percentage of reaching your streaks. Whereas if you keep getting shot in the back because you have no map awareness you will not get any streaks. You also want to be invisible. I run  perksnot that you need to but it works for me I run ghostblind eye slot one. Scavenger slot two and dead silence slot three. You wont run out if ammo and the only way you die is if you lose a gun fight.To fill the remaining  spots we are allowed I mainly select a primary weapon with a sight and  attachmentsdepending on the gun you may or may not need a sight using the Fallout I would equip the Elo sight quick draw and a silencer. That type of set up makes up about  of what I use. Always adjust to the lobby you are in. If im in a lobby for a few games and no one is calling in any AI controlled streaks Ill remove blind eye for grenades etc. you want to move around the map in an advantageous way. When rounding a corner instead of slowly peeking or walking around it wall run or jump and aim. Instead if putting yourself in an area that has  different ways to get to stay in the outside and look in. The less chance an enemy has of being behind you the better.Dont fall into a pattern. Just because you used one route on map A and went  doesnt mean that will always work. I see so many people doing the same thing over and over again and failing. Adapt to how the game is playing. Some matches running around like crazy works really well others you will fail. Accepting that will play a big role in your success. Also if you find yourself missing a lot change your sensitivity. Keep tweaking it until you start hitting guys off the draw and not over shoot and aim back. If you need any more advice you can always message me. Figured Id stop already prolly to long. ,Infinitewarfare,ddjbway,1,t5_3ecvx

HC Dom is generally populated by a higher than average number of good players and pubstomp mans and may put you off entirely if you arent used to the TTK spawn knowledge etc. Stay away from HC TDM entirely unless you like looking in corners and avoiding trip mines,Infinitewarfare,ddkw3fq,2,t5_3ecvx

The Type has a  meter fiveshotkill range and the Volks  meter threeshotkill distance extends beyond the practical range dictated by its unpredictable recoil. Why you suggested range buffs for these weapons is beyond me. The NV and KBAR may be incredibly popular but they are not in need of balance changes. The NV is incredibly easy to use but kills slowly and the KBAR is hard enough to use at range as is due to its recoil. The proposed Karma nerf gave me a good laugh considering its statistically the worst SMG. I could go on but I wont.

I would do the snipers and shotguns together. Sniper for long range shotties for short range dexterity to switch between them quickly. Use this class on all maps. Youll get your challenges done quicker youll have a more versatile class and people never expect a sniper to be packing a shotty. Put a silencer on the sniper so you dont get hunted down.

In that situation the better player will win the engagement nearly every time. I certainly didnt say the better player wins  of all engagements. Obviously that doesnt make sense even TimmynoThumbs will probably kill Mr. Pro if he comes up on him with a shotgun while Mr. Pro is ADSing a hallway with a sniper.gtOf course thats a really stupid argument. Your last sentence is a strawman ... you set up a situation that is undeniably true but is in no way generalizable to other situations.

10986669,0,t3_5wv5x2,To be honest I really like the way it works. I have defended the AUAV since the start of the game. There is a chance for the opposing team and good players can still use the sweeping effect of it to their advantage. More time makes it overpowered because it already lasts a decent amount of time. People roll with launchers and that is fair if they take it down quickly. CUAV is also fine to block it out because that is a strategic play. I hear way too many people complain about it if you dont like it dont roll with it. There are plenty of other scorestreaks that will fit your playstyle. ,Infinitewarfare,dedayie,5,t5_3ecvx

They both have the reduced recoil perk. But the modular gets an extra attachment while the Bosozoku basically just moves the headshot multiplier to the crotch.The Ripper obviously kills faster than both but has more recoil. The RPR in general is a close range weapon in SMG mode. It shreds up to a certain distance. Whereas the Mactav isnt actually very good up close compared to other SMGs. The Mactavs major benefit is its range. It is accurate and does really good damage at range for an SMG.,Infinitewarfare,del3t7a,0,t5_3ecvx

Its going to bring back more fans of COD who left after AW because they hated Advanced Movement. Its going to make them bank and Activision is relying on nostalgia to bring that bank...and fans with it.  Its a great move on Activisions part. We have had years of Modern of current warfare themes. Its time to go back to their roots that the majority of fans are looking forward to. I learned to embrace the advanced movement but there are so many who havent and left BTW..WWII style is hardly boring. You are very much in the minority with your opinion.

11718862,0,t1_dgockd0,No doubt.  The maps was a problem in ghosts I liked the maps but sometimes you would just run and run because people were holed up in one tiny area!  I maps are super cool they are really great detailed maps with well thought out travel and cut routes I couldnt agree more.  Infinity ward also did a great job in ttdm for sure and they also provided multiple hardcore game modes.  Thats a lot of content.  They did so much right and I love this game but its a total mess because of the vpr situation right now.  I played the vpr a little when it was still just an smg and was like ok but went back to doing camos for the core guns... I played for  hours Friday night vmp... all camos except slide kills done prestiged the gun  times went  and  one match went  and   and  etc the rest and I am just not that type of player.  Its not that it sucks because you cant have fun with it it sucks because it takes the life out of the game the challenge.  I think thats what gamers want is the challenge thats what all the little milestones and earning keys and everything else is about the reward for the effort.  In real life you dont get constant instant gratification and that is part of gaming.  When it comes so easy when it goes so fast or means nothing then why play.  I dont mind getting killed by great players who outplay me I learn from them and borrow from them.  There is nothing interesting going on in IW right now though other than pay and spray and unfortunately I think that will lead to people playing a different game so it really is bad for business for infinity ward.  I dont want to be some priveldged you tuber and just pile hate for everything I think is mildly inconsistent with my vision but I love video games I also have skin in the game in terms of atvi stock and to make such a mess of the game right at dlc release is freaking crazy on their part.  I mean I will remember dlc  for the crazy vpr week.  I think it gave people a reason not to play more than it gave  them to play but I dont know I also think they had a vision for this and that it was intentional.,Infinitewarfare,dgod17s,2,t5_3ecvx
