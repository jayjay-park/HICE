493801,0,t3_1zrigl,You can go the private route.  Check out Ride Chicago. Sign up for the class that is in the united center parking lot. The class room part will be at ravenswood and montrose if I recall.  Take public transit there and back to both public transit is why Chicago rocks after all! Or ride a bicycle another reason why Chicago rocks!!!Ive done two classes with Ride Chicago. The licensing class and their intermediate class. Stellar operation. Yea sure you have to pay while the state run class is free. But they provide bike helmet gloves and all you need to bring is over the ankle shoes long pantsshirt. You dont have to wait for the list to open up nor travel to another county or something for the class. The people teaching are legit love riding are good teachers and create a fun friendly and safe atmosphere. Plus for  bucks you can take the state test on the same bike you practiced on the range with. ,ChicagoMotorcycles,cfwedkl,4,t5_2stf1

Ive got gloves drainpan rags oilfilter wrench a real one adjustable bike stand that should fit your rear swing arm just fine and a garage spot. Its actually a very clean process when you have all the proper equipment.

8575724,0,t1_d6djgct,gt dThats a buch of BS...gtEvery registration plate shall at all times be securely fastened in a horizontal position to the vehicle for which it is issued so as to prevent the plate from swinging and at a height of not less than  inches from the ground measuring from the bottom of such plate in a place and position to be clearly visible and shall be maintained free from foreign materials and in a condition to be clearly legible.  No registration plate shall be covered by any tinted or colored screen.  It is illegal to park a vehicle on any roadway if the registration plate or other registration material fails to comply with this subsection.  Any person who violates this subsection shall be fined the amount set forth in Section  for each offense.This looks like its supposed to be directed towards tinted coverings of license plates not motorcycle covers. Im not sure how exactly Id contest it but I know I certainly would.,ChicagoMotorcycles,d6djr6g,1,t5_2stf1
8786701,0,t3_50dde9,There are two places I would suggest checking out. I cant really recommend them as Ive not been to either I just got my first bike this weekend!. I plan on checking out Moto Guild Chicago near Western and Grand as they are somewhat close to my work. There is also Moto Garage out in Schaumburg. These places appear to have a bit of a different mission and operation but both look interesting to me! Moto Guild Chicago has classes to teach you how to do certain maintenance on your bike. Thats why I linked to that page on their website. Moto Garage also offers classes according to their website but they dont have any listed or scheduled on their calendar so that might require a phone call. Edit I always get the  backwards,ChicagoMotorcycles,d740egk,2,t5_2stf1
