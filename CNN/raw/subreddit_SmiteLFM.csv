4502741,0,t1_csy5mlk,wanted to reply to this as the thread you linked is completely false.  HiRez DOES NOT make their elo system known or ANYONEs current elo known.   What you see using a site like smiteguru is what that sites algorithm believes your elo is.  For all anyone outside of HiRez employees knows your elo could be double what smiteguru says it is or half of it.   I got crap qualifying games and was qualified into bronze  with about a  elo.  I NEVER ONCE skipped a tier off a promotion and I have managed to raise my elo up to about  on smiteguru and am in Gold .   Now my elo could be higher then  or lower as that is the smiteguru elo NOT HiRezs elo.  Sorry I am just beyond tired of hearing people blame everyone else for their elo or what rank they are.  You might have the knowledge of a player above silver  but your skill may not be up there with your knowledge or your reaction times or numerous other things.  I repeatedly play with diamonds and plats and have even played with and against pros sadly none of that means that I deserve to be up there in rank with them even if I do well in those games.,SmiteLFM,csy81fl,1,t5_2w6r8

Also about drew I have no control over that so the fact that you bring that up is invalid. Also when I tried to learn how to jungle I went over to solo lane to help you. Then a gank came and when we got forced under tower and ravana was near our tier  and I said follow me I will use my  playing merc and you dont follow causing me to die. Also we hardly ever played with you guys because you never wanted to play joust which you guys judged us by and clearly stated that you would participate in vs yet the entire time me and drew were there. We were the only ones in that v channel. The clan is extremely toxic especially you MC and me and drew arent the only ones that think that.
