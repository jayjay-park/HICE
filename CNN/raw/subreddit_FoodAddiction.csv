1160877,0,t3_27esde,I really REALLY dont think you understand the point of this sub...  This is for people struggling with food addiction as a disorder not a clever title for people looking for food porn. ,FoodAddiction,ci07tkx,5,t5_2tp8l
2709619,0,t3_2p0h19,Congratulations! The stomach stapling was big so many years ago and its hard to throw a rock and not read stories of folks overeating and stretching the stomach. You still have to have the controlit just means there are immediate and dangerous side effects if you do overindulge and youre severely limiting the amount of food you are allowed to eat. You still have to make yourself make healthier choices. You still have to discipline yourself. This is not negative toward anyone who has gotten the surgeryits pjust talking about the parts that feel confusing for me. Tldr you still have to deal with food issues just as you said. Congrats OP!,FoodAddiction,cnc2mk7,1,t5_2tp8l

8181582,0,t3_4r3z6o,I just found this sub today after realizing how poorly Im eating. I know in my mind I shouldnt but I cant stop myself. Ive always been overweight..I try to stay away from a certain thing for so long then I taste it once and Im thrown right back to the beginning. I would really like an accountability partner as well..that way I cant make excuses for myself anymore. Im f  weighing in at lbs..officially my heaviest. PM me if youre interested! We can do this!,FoodAddiction,d508x9s,3,t5_2tp8l
8280670,0,t3_4sv2we,Environment is way more important than willpower. Dont buy food that will trigger overeating. I have no junk food no snack bars no peanut butter no bread etc. in the house.,FoodAddiction,d5cn5dv,16,t5_2tp8l
8286253,0,t3_4p2il4,Create an emergency plan. What can you do in these circumstances? Have you joined an online overwater Editover eaters anonymous? Do you have a buddy you can reach out to? Certain distractions? I like to look at Pinterest boards for the styles I will wear when Im slender. Pray? Listen you are not going to starve between now and dinner. Most important  never eat sugar again. Ever. Not even on your birthday. Sugar is the devil. It will put you into binge mode every time. ,FoodAddiction,d5dc9he,3,t5_2tp8l
9602028,0,t1_d9sctcd,Thanks for posting this. This describes how I feel and behave. Quite often Im full and I dont want any food but I am compelled to continue eating. Theres a voice in my head that is well aware that I dont want to eat. Its screaming STOP but I just keep eating with no pleasure like a robot. If the opportunity to overeat without others around I have to take it. Thats really stuffed up. Also how did I do  years of this without realising I have a problem? Only just dawning on me now. Thanks so much for sharing.,FoodAddiction,d9wna37,1,t5_2tp8l
