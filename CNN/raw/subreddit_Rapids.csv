Hell New England seem to have figured that out now. Pablo needs that signature player and they need to be millionsofdollars good. And I think you may be right Gaby is worth more sold than on our roster. We nearly have our core players but we have some glaring defensive holes and we desperately need better depth in the midfield.

3458298,0,t3_2zuk3n,A few things. . Wow I am genuinely surprised. I went to the game and the Rapids played a lot better than I expected. Possession was nice they moved a lot off the ball a lot of chances were created and the defense played great as well. . Number  Sorry dont know his name played well but his touches are too light. There were a few times his passesshots seemed to not have any energy behind them. Minor complaint though. . Should have been a penalty. After seeing the replay I can understand why it was given outside the box but in my opinion it should have been a penalty. . Did David Villa play? I mean the lineup says he was there but that  was bad. NYCFC as a whole seemed to by lost for most of the game but I expected a decent performance out of a world class player. Dont get me wrong Im happy he didnt score against us but wow was he nonexistent. . A goal would have been nice but overall the team played well. If we keep up this form we might actually have a nice chance this year. A point is a point next time lets get  Overall I loved this game. It was fun and the stadium had a great atmosphere.

Having said that I know that they still play every Sunday at  or  at Cheesman Park north side. they will have at least two to three separate games going. they are pretty chill lots of diffetent skill levels but the field is not the best. they will play at Cheesman at the same spot on Mondays and Wednesdays after work so probably around  or  depending on the Sun and such. there used to be a great game at sloans park on the east side but Im not sure if that is still going. You can check meet up.com and see if it is there still but it was on saturday mornings around .I was new to soccer to only playing for the past three years as an adult with no prior experience and still had a great time dont worry about it.,Rapids,cq8egq7,1,t5_2suti
