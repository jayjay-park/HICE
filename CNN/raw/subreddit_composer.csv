487290,0,t3_1zn8kk,Props for this regardless. And I have two possible suggestions.First Maybe a melody? Maybe somethings with a more sustained voice just sort of singing above the rhythmic bed with longer notes. Or have the horns split and most play the rhythmostinato thing you have and then one or three in unison You know the rule always do unison parts with three or more voices play a longer held melodic thing? Maybe it could work? Youd have to be careful though as its quite busy already.Second Maybe in the ending section have the glockenspielorgan combo or whatever that is that does little interludes throughout have that join the rest of the band and play a unison or harmony part to the horns?Dont know if this helps much but maybe these will inspire you to other ideas.,composer,cfvnpsl,1,t5_2sjib

1055891,0,t3_266kgs,First Very interesting to see someone working with the prelude to and feasts of Eastertide as the basis for a composition. Cool idea. The last movement feels like it ought to be at a quicker pace as weve just had a number of slow passacaglias and a meditation. Do you have a particular facet of Easter in mind as inspiration? Depending on that perhaps a jig or other sprightly danceform would work and you could include a showoff cadenza to end the whole set.Another poster mentioned dynamics and registration. Include these if you have particular sounds that you feel are integral to the composition but otherwise dont feel obligated. Every organ is different so they wont be much more than a guideline anyway and part of the fun of organ music for me at least is playing through a piece and deciding what Im going to do with it as a partner in the creative process.I havent had a chance to sit and sightread through it but the idea is a neat one.

Writing wise its all sounds pretty sound but I havent looked at the score.Maybe if youre not happy with the repetition you could add a middle section to offset some of the repetition but I thought it was fine as it stands.

So much depends on the quality of the individual players.The sax background at ms starts of alright but the trumpet player began his phrase one or two bars earlier so it feels that they are not in synch. This sort of needs to be better coordinated. The trumpet player should have started his phrase a bar or so after the saxes. The various sections need to be a bit more distinct and probably distinguished by more obvious changes in texture.I would check out the arrangements of Don Ellis in this regard.

If youre working on a piece it will be more helpful to ask us specific questions.Two good resources are Elaine Goulds Behind Bars and Kurt Stones Music Notation in the th Century.  The Stone book is a little older and only deals with prerecorded sounds and the section is a little short FYI.Also a great way to learn is to just poke around and check out other peoples scores.

4999873,0,t3_3jf0fg,Just finished this score as my first ever international film! Was amazingly fun and rewarding to work on with a stressful recording session to boot in the middle. The films budget was decent but not enough to afford an entire orchestral recording session so we recorded live instruments cello and violin on top of a sampled orchestra. I wanted a deep rich and breathy sound to the cello so we used a bass drum microphone underneath the bridge of the cello as well as an  microphone setup on the two soloists for stereo close midrange and distant recording. The results were pretty awesome I couldnt be more happy with the recording results. Since the recording session was for many smaller cues and snippets the cues are understandably small. In playlist order on the clipStill though I thought it was great what the musicians pulled out of these extremely simple cues. I left them fairly sparse to encourage them to play with them when the music allowed for it.If youre looking for a session cellist or violinist in the Orange County area let me know and I will get you the contact info for these two musicians.

5688927,0,t1_cx270qs,Im somewhat familiar with Pollock but not enough. Im not sure if Cages use of indeterminancy chance processes used in composing works was a good match to what Pollock did. Pollock seems more like he was improvising in a free jazz sort of way. Cage was famously unimpressed with jazz because it still relied upon the memories and likes and dislikes ego of the musician. What Cage and the NY School did was to pioneer methods of composition andor performance that would take the composer andor performer out of themselves which would then allow music and sounds to just be  free from human ego. Was Pollocks paintings ever truly free from his ego his aesthetic ideas? We might need an art history person to really answer that question.gt I also find it interesting to think that for example listening to a squirrel in a park could be a musical experience.I have an analogy I use when people balk at that idea. Forgive me as its long and I like to hear myself typing.You go to visit your friend who is a composer of percussion music and lives in one of those trendy converted warehouses downtown.You enter their place on the first floor and you hear coming from the loft overlooking you percussion music. Delicate sounds dancing in complex patterns.You go up the stairs to meet your friend. You continue to listen to the music. You are struck by the simple patterns you hear and how they are combined with each other. There are so many and they keep coming in and out of phase with each other. You also detect that maybe the individual patterns arent quite as regular as you had assumed. Hmmm thats an interesting twist to conventional phase shifting minimalism irregular rhythms. This just makes the music even more interesting for you.Finally you reach the loft expecting to see your composer friend playing music through the speakers. Instead you find no one up there and all the equipment is off. The music you were hearing was the sounds of rainwater leaking through the roof and hitting the exposed pipes running along the ceiling. People who reject that  and Music of Changes are music would say that you werent hearing music in your friends place. But while walking up the stairs you clearly were having an aesthetic experience that was exactly the same as listening to Reich or Bach. So now how does it make sense that what you were hearing wasnt then actually music? Do we define music based on some dogmatic assumptions or do we base it on our actual aesthetic experiences? The latter seems most natural while the former seems like the tail wagging the dog.Of course some people will continue to define music and art in terms of how it fits in with a theory of musicart but oh well. Instead we can do as Cage and just suddenly listen.,composer,cx29lzl,1,t5_2sjib

Maintain a strong relationship with faculty particularly ensemble directors as this will pay off hugely in the future. Being able to approach them with a piece means you will always have a performing ensemble as long as they respect you and your work. And never be too proud to take advice. Not only will advice from faculty be most likely valid it makes them want to work with you more because youre showing them respect. And respect goes both ways.This is something I wish I couldve told my younger self. I was always too timid to approach faculty in that way other than just a couple people. Now  years out of school finding a performing ensemble means I have to rely on either paying musicians which I cant typically afford or having one of my friends who are now band directors to perform my pieces.

I think the thing about adding tonal harmony actually points to the biggest weakness in the piece which is that aside from being really dissonant the harmony doesnt mean anything and doesnt go anywhere. The piece lacks systematic harmony that can give direction and nuance so the notes can feel random.,composer,d6hsekz,2,t5_2sjib

From there adding it to Google Drive and sharing a link is one way to do it or Dropbox. If youve written it down then you may want to scan the pages or take photos of them then do the same to share them.,composer,d6pa4n0,1,t5_2sjib

Make money save it pay for an education with it.  Its not impossible.  Stop it with the excuses already the Im shit I never learned I did my best thats the garbage.Have you really done your best?

9023874,0,t3_53u113,Its pretty rare to have a turnaround time that quick but it does happen on occasion. I was writing for a series last year that was releasing episodes weekly. There were a couple times I was asked to score a segment of an episode that they had put in last minute during postproduction and they needed it the next day for them to be able to do the final editing and air the episode. Usually less than  minutes of music but as you have found out its not as easy as it sounds! These would typically turn into  hour work days something like  to get it written then another  to produce it to the quality it needed to be. The key for me was to only put in the necessities then add it embellishments later. So figure out a chord sequence then improvise over the chords a bit to figure out a melody. Once thats in place I would begin adding in all the stuff that takes it to the next level. Countermelodies harmonizing the melody varying the rhythm on the things Id already written and adding inbetween harmonic motion to make the chord changes sound as fluid as possible. Eventually you end up with something worth while... then you get to spend another  hours trying to make everything actually sound decent!  Honestly the biggest advantage you can have is simply experience from doing it a lot. When you have a deadline like that theres just no time for experimenting. You rely entirely on previous experience to put things together because you KNOW they work. And I dont know how long youve been composing or anything like that but if you do it enough you can pull  minutes out of your ass relatively quickly. Its the subtleties that actually take up time. Theres also a matter of making compromises but you have to know which compromises you can make and still end up with a high quality product. All of which comes back to experience... just doing it a LOT! Id suggest challenging yourself like this often to get more comfortable with using language you know works well for different situations. Just not daily because you dont want everything you write to be a speed run. Doing it too much and youre making too many compromises on a regular basis and thats a good way to create bad habits. But say once or twice a week give yourself a challenge to create a short gt minute piece that really stands on its own. And continue creating your best works in between. It wont take too long before youll have developed a builtin library of tricks as well as the experience to put them down quickly.Oh and lastly failure is nothing to be ashamed of. If you challenged yourself and learned something new then I would consider that a personal success. Ive failed so many times I lost count! ,composer,d7wj132,5,t5_2sjib

If that makes sense.Heres a piece that could almost be passed off as an etude just to show such things are possible should you want to write something like this If I were to write a violin etude with bariolage as the main focus I am a violinist btw I would do something similar to that. It would be pretty tonal for the most part starting off pretty much diatonic kind of like you did there and as the movement progresses I would start messing with the rhythms and timings while still keeping all focus on bariolage.Now I really want to write such a piece for solo violin hah,composer,d93p7km,2,t5_2sjib

9560913,0,t1_d9r9t2s,gt  if you make it too much like pop music then you are making pop music essentially and you have to kind of package it like pop music. A  minute piece. What a silly argument.  Contemporary pop pieces are often quite a bit longer than that many pieces in EDM can be as long as  or  minutes and feature complex forms and extended development much like in classical music.,composer,d9rkui9,3,t5_2sjib

A way to embody and express the dozens of different emotions I may feel a day between In Flames for when Im feeling pumped or Olafur Arnalds when Im feeling contemplative. However I also see it as a way of painting a cultural pallet through story and sound. As a musicologist its fascinating to me how powerful music is in bringing cultural identities together. Storytelling of ancient stories like the Norse Myths through Amon Amarth or just telling local ballads of Americans history through Wood Brothers.. its really our most effective tool as a people to create a cultural canvas of out planet and thats beautiful to me.,composer,da2p1c9,1,t5_2sjib

10490465,0,t3_5q8il6,Not a scientific answer just an observational one but I would assume it has to do at least in part with the materialsmethods of sound production.  I think a length of metal tubing will have fewer structural imperfections than a wooden cylinder covered in tiny metal bits and joined together with cork.  Add to that a sound produced by vibrating another imperfect strip of wood and youre going to get a pretty noisy sound wave.  There are potentially also issues of temperament and intonation that could be considered two trombones are more able to fine tune their semitone on the fly than two clarinets and depending on the temperament of the semitone it could be more or less in tune.Again this is just purely observational I dont have any scientific proof to back it up.,composer,dcx7der,0,t5_2sjib

11204883,0,t1_df1o6s3,Well if youre going to adopt a hostile approach Ill inform you of the reality. Im not suggesting this is anything close to a master jazz piece but it is most certainly rooted in the genre.The harmony is directly lifted from gypsy jazz structures. Take a second lookThe arpeggio shapes are borrowed strongly from the style of Django Reinhardt. Ill concede the rhythm is unorthodox for jazz but I had program limitations. I personally enjoy the tango feeling that resulted though.As to Jazz inspirations I like Django Mingus Roland Dyens he sits between the classicaljazz line in a way Metheny and Paul Whiteman thats a joke... among others.Who is your inspiration Antonio Salieri? ,composer,df22589,1,t5_2sjib

The answer is... yes of course it is. You could take a rock song and call it a sonata if you want for all I care.Of course the other side of this is that just as youre allowed to call something a sonata others are allowed to disagree.

11570551,0,t3_652xid,. I wont gush about it unless specifically asked but Dorico is a new option which is already pretty fantastic and has a LOT of promise. The team behind it are the original creators of Sibelius before they were given the boot and theyre a very talented and hardworking group. Since its new software of course its not as stable as it could be but in all honesty it has been more stable for me than Finale.. Ive used Finale since . Its codebase dates back to the s and it has never received a complete rewrite which means that its ancient. It has NEVER been stable for me it lags and has artifacts for everything and worse... it doesnt do a good job at things. My biggest gripe is trying to prepare parts with a score. First of all theres barely support for creating cues in parts but even worse... the unlinking of objects between the score and parts is crappy and no matter how hard you try youll always end up with many objects out of place in the score and parts.. Sibelius is definitely better than Finale in those respects its a slightly newer codebase going back to the s so thats good but it has issues as well. My good friend and trusted peer uses it well now hes on Dorico too not me so I cant be more specific except to say that when we work on stuff together Sibelius didnt impress me. The worse problem though is that Sibelius is sort of treading water now rather than actively developing and improving.
