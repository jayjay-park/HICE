6688008,0,t1_d0b2wrp,I really cant go any further into this without majorly spoiling things and answering your initial question. This is a major case of RAFO I remember when I got to the reveal I was blown away. The only thing I can say is to read as fast as you can its great.,robinhobb,d0b3k1p,3,t5_2sppx
6909229,0,t1_d0zguxr,Didnt wisdom awaken the other elderlings too? Or did he only quicken his own dragon? I get what youre saying about Verity being the sacrifice. Whatre your thoughts on Verity using Fitzs body to make a kid with his wife? Wouldnt that technically be Fitzs kid?,robinhobb,d0zhbwr,2,t5_2sppx
7534415,0,t1_d2ym3gn,Yeah. Youre right. They are always soldiers and rulers and it seems they are always desperate as well. And Kerf is very peculiar but thats exactly why I want him to be explored in the next book.,robinhobb,d2ymjqu,3,t5_2sppx

7822077,0,t3_4mceto,The explanation can be found in our everyday world. Most places that have a lot of seismic activity have lots of wonky shit in the the water. Its why hot springs usually smell terrible. Running water through certain mineral deposits could change the acidity of the water just look at what happens when old mines fill with water.,robinhobb,d3v9ngl,3,t5_2sppx

10120382,0,t1_dbqlb47,Early on Rapskal was endearing because of how simple he was and iirc it was implied he had some sort of mental developmental disorder. I think that contact with the dragons matured him out of that but he got a lot of their arrogance too. Now the dragons are all he cares about.Side note hated the thymara x rapskal thing,robinhobb,dbqoyrt,3,t5_2sppx

10766559,0,t3_5ta0si,I dont want to brag or anything but i caught on to the Liveships fool quite early. Ofcourse because it wasnt expicitly mentioned and i had not read any spoilers it wasnt until Paragon was carved that I was sure of it.

11193380,0,t3_5xmdaj,Too many but somehow I havent kept track of more than these two Fools Assassin Stop your whining. If you are frightened be silent. Whining is for prey. It attracts predators. And you are not prey. Royal Assassin describing an episode when Fitz is very drunkSomewhere in the back of my mind Nighteyes was frantic. Poisoned. That water is poisoned.
