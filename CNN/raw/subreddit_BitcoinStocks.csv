426244,0,t3_1yyhkb,This will help you out Other than that no proof no concrete information nada. Just continued smoke and mirrors. I have already even written off ActiveMining as lost. We are still neither on Cryptostocks or whatever that share site was nor do we seem to be any closer to a colored coin implementation. As usual their bitcointalk thread is filled to the brim with utter garbage via pancake and the rest of the crew so most people have pretty much abandoned the thread.,BitcoinStocks,cfoy1m0,4,t5_2xdbv

829703,0,t1_cguvvs6,Well it is wrong to blame havelock for this.Neo the company that had absolutely no revenue stream and planned to blow almost all the investors money on advertising huge offices and so on. So in the end investors got more or less exactly was expected a huge advertising campaign office space and no financial product.So why blame HL when NB delivered almost exactly what was expected?,BitcoinStocks,cgyl7qe,1,t5_2xdbv

1021186,1,t3_25sf6n,Cryptx bought a large number of shares from a big holder is putting those shares plus the original unsold shares from the first IPO up as a new IPO and he is holding all dividend payments from us until after this month is over.None of this was discussed with anybody and Cryptx did these changes without any feedback from shareholders. We are expecting our dividend payments weekly like it says in the prospectus but he is now using  of the funds to pay for hosting and reinvestment. It was also stated in the original prospectus that our shares would not be diluted and that is exactly what is happening with this new IPO phase. I wouldnt have mined it so much if he just resold the shares he bought from the big investor but he is putting the original unsold IPO shares into the market diluting our shares.Keep paying out dividends during this IPO phase and only put up the shares you bought from that big investor not the original unsold batch this wouldnt affect shareholders in any way but a positive one.,BitcoinStocks,chkd6ea,0,t5_2xdbv

2372784,0,t1_cm4u1kz,It works and its a little complicated.TLDR version you can buy and receive bitcoin on Novauri using any address you choose.  You can send and receive on Novauri only from the address created during registration.Long version To buy or receive you register we create a bitcoin address for you or you can add your own.  We dont care.  You buy lock in a price and when your payment clears we send the bitcoin to the address you chose when you bought.  Done.  We do have AML and KYC to run on you as a customer and it goes up a notch over  daily but that KYC is run on you not on bitcoin addresses.  Therefore add whatever ones you would like it doesnt matter.  Were just removing the step where you would send the bitcoin to an address anyway so why make it a pain for our users?  This also prevents us from pulling dirty tricks like letting you send us bitcoin receive and then denying you access yo your deposit claiming KYC.Selling and sending is more complicated. You can only sell or send from the address created during registration.  The trick here is that during registration we create a private key from your wallet password and other data this in turn creates your public key and bitcoin address.  Novauri never sees the unencrypted private key.   Then whenever you sell or send bitcoin from this address in the future you reenter your wallet PIN the private key is securely decrypted and your transaction can be signed.You cannot sell or send from other bitcoin addresses because Novauri has no way to let you get your private key.  We do not permit you to upload new private keys because that would require us to be more of a trusted rd party like our competitors a bank and that is not out business model or design.  To sell send bitcoin to your Novauri address first basically.,BitcoinStocks,cm4zfif,1,t5_2xdbv
