675028,0,t1_cggz9rl,honestly man I went thru an experience like this on another jeep forum. I wide eyed and bushy tailed asked for advice about a CAI and got crucified. hahaha its fine it made me do some serious research. and after a lot of digging I came to the point where I agree. the idea of getting more power out of a jeep engine is flawed unless you want to go supercharger but even still I dont see it helping on the trail but again Im sure theres someone out there to tell me Im wrong. if you want useable power on your jeep RE GEAR! thats what Ive learned. but dont let anyone make you feel stupid for wanting to do a CAI. its a logical progression to look for ways to make your jeep engine work better and we inherited the impulse from old muscle car guys. but these engines are SO different and the use is different. anyway I did a cat back magnaflow exhaust and I love the sound. it would gurgle and ssspppppllllltththh more with a CAI but I dont want to worry about hydro locking or dust in my shit while Im wheeling. good luck with your decision and take it all with a grain of salt bud!,Jeep,cgh01m3,3,t5_2r4jn

The mount can sometimes come loose or crack. If you think the trac bar is tight enough go back and tighten it again. Thats the case with aftermarket trac bar installations. Ive seen more than one installed that was so loose that it was dangerous and led to very strange steering feedback. I assume the trac bar is original. With the vehicle being seventeen years old I wouldnt be surprised if it had a bunch of miles on it now. Check each rod end to make sure the alignment shop tightened the jam nuts on everything.

GF occasionally drives it and moves my mirrors grrr Max tow would be pretty nice. I dont have a hitch the wiring set up or any of the fancy gear that comes with that option. I dont tow often but it would be nice to have. If you could get half doors consider it. Theyre badass hard to get and look really nice. Good but expensive alternative to tube doors. Dual top is an interesting option. I went with just the hard top not matching to body color which I like better and I bought an aftermarket soft top Bestop Trektop NX great decision IMO. Theyre cheaper aftermarket but you also dont get to use your payment for a Moparpremium soft top. I have cloth seats wouldnt go any other way. If youre going to wheeldrive with your doors off youll want to get some neoprene seat covers anyway. I dont find the heated seats or leather to be an option for me but thats my taste.

Jeeps are a high demand vehicle and con artists pick them up clean em up and sell them to people who cant tell the difference. I have a flawless  TJ Rubicon. It took  months of searching on craigslist and dealing with scammers before I found a guy who was selling his jeep for a legit reason. He had money a good job and wanted a JKU for his family and the TJ did not work for him anymore. I was the st person to see it on a Sunday morning. There was NO rust on the jeep. I live in Boston so I know what happens to these things in the winter and I know a clean frame when I see one. Caution is key. YJs are at least  years old.

Cold wet day not a deer in sight and I got bored in my blind so I decided to take a hike with one of the landowners to check out an area he was recommending for the evening next morning. We park at the end of this field and about half way across the field I froze in my tracks. A deer! Out in plain sight! About  yards out determined by the landowner I was with who was standing next to me spotting with his rifle right over the crest of a small hill I could see a decent doe from the chest up. Screw it I thought Im taking the shot. So I sighted my muzzleloader right along the top edge of the hill and took the shot. Landowner Billy goes WTF was that!? Apparently he saw something a blur or flail right next topast where the deer I shot at. Looking down range post shot and we couldnt see anything. Deer must have had a shit fit and took off. So I reload just in case and we start hiking over to check things out. As I walk up over the hill crest I see it and Im confused. There are two deer laying on the ground one  yards behind the other! No shit! At first I just didnt get it. I thought for sure the other deer had already been shot or Billy was fucking with me and somehow timed a shot up right when I took mine. Nope! His gun is still loaded! Upon further inspection the entry wound on this little guy was almost twice the size of the one on the doe which by the way was a PERFECT killshot. Dropped her where she stood. But that sold it for me. The exit on deer A was clean the impact must have mushroomed the round and it punched right into deer B.So after checking in we butchered deer A for dinner and deer B came home with us to be steaks and dog food. Pretty funny drive home in the Jeep after a successful hunt!,Jeep,co207ne,8,t5_2r4jn

There should be a distinguishable location for all of the different shifts. Meaning you should be able to feel it shift in to H then H N and L. I can usually tell when I am in H by a light whirring noise made by the transfer case as well as the steering is a bit more stiff. Edit Also if you were in L your RPMs would be through the roof the faster you went.Try googling NP Transfer Case Linkage adjustment. You might be able to find a video on youtube. It shouldnt matter if its an xj or tj as long as its the NP. You can confirm its a NP by looking under it at the transfer case.

Once the sticker is weeded then an application tape is applied over the top of the whole thing and using scissors the excess is cutaway.Then you take the sticker remove the paper protection from the sticky part position it on the Jeep with the application tape rub it down so that there are no bubbles with a credit card then remove the application tape from the front leaving the sticker.

4942458,0,t3_3ilssj,The  cherokee has some great stuff and some not so great stuff. Your heater core is probably leaking which is why you can smell antifreeze inside and not outside. Never changed one but thwy usually require entire dash removal and such. The blower motor resistor is bad on your blower motor. Tell tale sign is it only works on high. Youd have to check if its a separate resistor from the motor. For the idle problems...replace spark plugs and clean out the throttle body regardless of looks. You could do a full top end treatment with seafoam if you want to. Definitely wont hurt. If it still continues to stall and stuff get back with me. Obviously do oil and filter change. The heads on the late model xjs are notoriously bad and crack. So keep an eye on that. If you lose coolant and cant find a link thats probably it. Mine has been bad for a while and havent changed it as its driven in town and for very short times which isnt an excuse but thats the one im sticking with. If your oil comes out brown and milky the had has gone bad or the head gasket. Probably the head though. ,Jeep,cuhjbaz,1,t5_2r4jn

Best bet if you are in doubt about Chief products email them via the website the owner Bill is very helpful Ive found.Disclaimer I am not Bill from Chief  but Ive bought his products and think they are great.Edit you may be right about the lightbar fitting under your winch mount.  Then again there are some thin lightbars out there now that could be worth measuring up against the space you want to fill.  Main reason I stuck the bar down there was because my home state outlawed having them on the roof so I had to find an alternative spot.  I ended up liking the result.

5545270,0,t1_cwk1k65,On mobile but basically theres a valve in our gas tanks that failed and that valve is what causes the back pressure to stop the fuel pump at the gas station. Theres a GM fuel tank hose you can put between your gas tank and the.. thing you put the gas nozzle in. This hose contains a metal flap that causes the same back pressure effect when your tank is full. The part is less than  bucks and you do have to cut it shorter but it goes on fairly easily. The only thing Ive noticed is that if the fuel is coming in too fast it will shut off the pump so you would have to manually throttle the gas pump to fill your tank. Edit Couldnt leave you hanging went to the PC and found this link I hope that is allowed on this sub.. The GM part number is .. Amazon had it for about  but search around should get it cheaper.

5659976,0,t3_3sm4ad,have you seen the pitman shaft support they sell for earlier jeeps and dodge trucks.. uses a special pitman arm nut that a flange bearing slips onto .. that bolts to a bracket across and under the sway bar frame brackets.. so there is even less stress on the pitman shaft and its bearings.   this is a dodge truck version..  i might go as far and use a  bolt flange bearing.. i also worry about the drag link at the end of the pitman arm.. i would like to know how much additional angle the inner tie rod end can handle there..   you could actually make that out of tube..  with a double plate at the passenger end. to give you adjustability..  this would lock your frame horns together even tighter..dodge trucks had an issue with the steering column shaft lower bearing failing.. allowing the shaft to move in the column outer jacket and introducing some play..   that is probably the same column. .just curious.. do you have stock motor mounts.. i noted the motor bouncing around fairly far in the engine bay.. loose is probably OK.. in a x... i would just like you to check those..  on hollow motor and transmission mounts.. i used to fill the openings with multiple batches of urethane bumper repair kit.. dynatronbondo brand .. i dont think its available anymore.  it was used to repair enduro bumpers on late s and early s cars.. i would love to see something bent up like your track bar..  instead of just a straight angle .. if you get the axle in a bind.. you might pop that steering linkage apart... if you do it right.. you might be able to loose the  or  inch drop pitman arm and reduces the side loading forces to the pitmansector shaft.  they have Z bent drag links for older toyota xs that were lifted..   these links i posted are just to give you the IDEA of what i am talking about. i dont know if the parts will fit your jeep.. .,Jeep,cwyoan2,1,t5_2r4jn

5711975,0,t3_3tatqe,The lockers are great for people who are putting a wheel in the air regularly or going through deep sloppy mud a lot. Honestly with the manual transmission and the .I know that was the ratio on TJ I think the JK has same tcase you can still get a nice low crawl ratio with drivability on the street. The breakingweak point of the rubi Ds is really the front D. If you plan on wheeling s or higher lockedstock its probably not going to last long. A rubi D is not a true D its a D center housing with D ring and pinion but the axle tubesshaftsexterior are all D basically its D tubesetc welded onto a D pumpkin. Locking the axle only puts more stress on the shafts especially if you upsize the tires from the stock size. A stock jeep can absolutely do occasional offroading you dont need a rubi for that.People will tell you that you dont need that much lift to run s but personally I think it looks good. There seems to be a trend with JKs where people try to run tires as big as possible with as little lift as possible basically to the point of rubbing on any little bump especially if they unhooked swaybars. If youre going to actually wheel it I recommend getting more lift than you need for the tires so you have room to flex out and articulate. This is just my opinion but that looks better the giant tires on barely any lift looks so mall crawley to me.,Jeep,cx54k4q,2,t5_2r4jn
5712064,0,t1_cx540n4,gtThe D isnt that much stronger than the d the pinion gear and ring gear are the same size in both. This is wrong D has a .ish inch ring gear diameter D Im not  on the number but its over  inches maybe almost . I think youre just remembering wrong because the front D on JKrubis is weaker than a real D because they basically weld D tubesexterior onto a D pumpkin and use D shafts etc.gtPlus at s youll need to regear a rubi the . is going to be sluggish.Like I mentioned before rubi front Ds have D tubesshafts and they are not made to handle  inches especially not locked youll be spinning shafts off in no time if you wheel it that way. Like with a D s are the max I would ever try to run on stock axles and I probably wouldnt wheel that too hard because locking puts it under a lot of stress.You can get different kinds of lockers selectable are not the only ones out there you can get much cheaper youll just have to adjust your driving style and get used to it.,Jeep,cx54yhq,1,t5_2r4jn

The install takes all of  minutes including removing the grill and removing the stock headlights. Its super easy. Aligning them takes about  minutes. Be in a place where you can align them after installing them. That means flat ground with a wall where you can park ft from the wall. Adjust and align everything before reinstalling the grill. Contrary to popular belief there are horizontal alignment screws mm IIRC. The only problem is you have to remove the headlight to access them. What I did was install the headlight without reinstalling the bezel ring to get an idea of where the headlight was aimed them removed it and adjusted the horizontal alignment reinstalled and rechecked rinse repeat.

6179917,0,t1_cyrszyj,Hmmm.. Im always a little careful when I answer these kind of questions. When it comes to offroading theres a spectrum that runs from those who wont drive over a rock without  spotters because they are afraid they might scratch the differential and those who live by the motto when in doubt throttle out!. I defiantly lean more towards the latter of the spectrum so bear that in mind. If I dent or scratch something I consider it a battle scar that just adds to the character of the Jeep. But thats me.Now in all fairness there are a lot of more gnarly obstacles on trails out there that can be bypassed on easier routes and I took a lot of those. I feel like I could have made it over a lot of them but I was out there alone in an XJ that has a  budget lift is open front and rear is rolling on  Walmart tires and I was over a  miles from home in the vehicle I had to drive back. I didnt want to break it or get myself stranded in the cold with no lifeline so I didnt get real stupid with it. If I was out there with friends and I had a trailer I wouldnt worry about snapping an axle or blowing a ujoint. That wasnt the case though so I took it real easy. That being said I dont think I even dragged bottom all that much on the Poison Spider trail. We went a pretty good ways down the Golden Spike trail and we did all of that just fine. There were a few places I had to back up find a different line and give it a little momentum to get over things but it really wasnt bad. In some places there were  routes to take hard medium and weenie and I tended to take the weenie routes. Could I have done the medium or hard route? Im pretty sure of it but I also could have broke it trying and then I would have found myself out there alone in the cold and dark  miles from town with no cell service. That would suck. The trials in Moab are not lacking on traction. Your tires stick to it like glue. I hardly ever spun a tire. I dont recall dragging all that much. I didnt have much of a clearance problem. I took it easy and I still made it over most things without problem. I took a lot of bypasses but a lot of places I didnt and I made it just fine. A few places I had to give it some juice to get up and over but I think the XJ has a wheelbase advantage over my old TJ that made it easier. I think a TJ open front and rear would have had a lot harder time. Theres a lot of other trails I could have done with ease like Fins and Things and Chicken Corners Ive been over all those in a TJ. All those trails offer lots to see big dramatic views steep climbs some offcamber drives and some closetothesheardropoffpuckerfactor drives. Would it do Moab Rim? Mmm.. maybe. I just remember a lot of offcamber stuff on that and I really dont like offcamber. It makes my testes shrivel. I dont want to barrel roll down a rock slope towards the footdropoff of doom. So can you do it? Yes. Is there plenty out there for a less capable Jeep to do that makes the trip worth it? Yes. Do you run the risk of denting sheet metal without a lot of clearance? Yes. Are there places youll have to rely on more throttle and less finesse if you dont have lockers? Yes. Do you run the risk of breaking something doing that? Yes. MY old TJ had a V I put in it it had lockers front and rear  inch high pinion axles and  inch tires. Ive wheeled a lot of things and a lot of places. The XJ is not anywhere near that capable yet but dont think it cant make it up a hill. It can do more bonestock than people give it credit if you arent afraid to dent or scratch it. I say go. Throw caution to the wind. Wheel what you brought. Wheel what you can. Give it your best shot. If you cant make it or arent comfortable with it back up and take the weenie route. The views out there alone are worth the trip. Youll be out there wheeling and all those who say you cant do it will be home building things up for someday. ,Jeep,cys3bwl,2,t5_2r4jn

I had to do the alternator spark plugs an oil switch my rear window fell. I admittedly was in the shop a lot with it but never anything too bad. I sold it at  miles. I wound up buying an  KJ with K miles back in June. No problems although my turning radius isnt quite as good as the last one.  I still get about  MPG. I love the WD.

I know the feeling of being on a budget. My JK took some serious time before I got it up on s and looking the way I wanted. My advice though having done the mods I have is to pick a style and stick with it. Like my JK you bought a very neutral colour. Mines Black but its the same idea. You can now choose whether to stay with white mods or pick a colour to add to it. I went with Red for my accessories. My rig was built over  years and counting to look as retro as possible. I went with  tube bumpers and  tube rails to make it look older than it was. One thing that I find is cheap practical and actually changes the look of the JK quite a bit is a good tint on those back glasses. Unlike most cars you can leave the glass at the shop with the roof and have it done while youre out cruisinTheres no golden rule to how to mod a Jeep. Start bolting stuff on that youll use and that will make you look over your shoulder and check her out every time you park. ,Jeep,czsmidj,1,t5_2r4jn

Theyre all basically identical to GM small blocks and big blocks all the way through the .. and . but with less bulk to move around during machining. I do lots of old tractor restoration and find the old Continental flatheads or Johnny Poppers equally neat to build.I despise building up newer dual OHC V motors.

8754326,0,t3_4zx85a,Going off what you said before about not knowing much about electricity and the battery not being the same as before the alternator swap. It sounds to me that there isnt a good connection to the battery. By chance did you remove your battery cables and apply the battery grease to the terminals and then put the cables back on? I would work on cleaning up the terminals really well and make sure you have good solid connections. The grease you get with batteries is made to go on the top of the terminal to avoid corrosion. Putting it on the terminal before the cables does not give you a good connection which could lead to poor charging. If after you clean and check for solid connections it still isnt working. Take the Jeep to an auto parts store and they should be able to test the whole system without having to remove anything.,Jeep,d6zy5ig,1,t5_2r4jn

Ford to bring back the bronco would have to justify cost and production and the people would would buy it are old fans and hopefully new people trying something besides the wrangler. Ford has the raptor for dirt it needs a competition to the wrangler like the original bronco was for. ,Jeep,d8pa6e0,2,t5_2r4jn

10270203,0,t3_5n0bm1,I own a  Cherokee. Its a great small SUV. Like all the other vehicles in its class its based on a car platform. It depreciates quicker than a pickup truck or truck based SUV like a Wrangler. This is because of its platform.However its the most capable small SUV in its class. You will find that competitors such as Santa Fe CRV Edge Tiguan etc are very light I test drove  competitors. Others have said a subaru is well built. Not sure the reviews Ive read cite quality and performance issues with them.The Cherokee isnt comparable to a Wrangler its a compact car based SUV. In its class it stands out. My two cents... if you need a larger more off road capable SUV then you cant go wrong with the Wrangler. If you need a lower cost compact go Cherokee. ,Jeep,dc86mk1,3,t5_2r4jn

The link is This is a great cheap solution but admittedly they leave a lot to be desired. With my full doors ON I can see approximately  Yes ZERO out of the passenger mirror. I cannot imagine that it would be much better with half doors and uppers. In addition I had to send them back to Quadratec because they started rusting three days after I installed them. They sent new ones back and suggested I use engine enamel or something strong to protect the new pair. It has been a year and they are still good. So if you get them DO BE SURE TO PAINT THEM. Seriously. Paint them over the preexisting paint or sandblast  wirewheel them down to bare metal and repaint to your liking. Here is my previous post with pics. THREE DAYS... That is it.

11796098,0,t3_68b12r,I traded my tj for a  door jk at the beginning of this year.To me it rides like a dream. Im in the north jersey area and I go offroading every week or so that I can. I drive it in the summer and the winter. Its great in the snow if youve got some all terrain or mud terrain tires. And I drive down to the Carolinas every year. The ride isnt too bad. I dont really buy into the whole trim thing.If you want to get an lsd from the factory its an option on the whillys trim. For me a sport was fine because I lifted it myself and put on better tires. I also wanted something inexpensive and stick. College student so I dont have much money.,Jeep,dgx4m3c,2,t5_2r4jn
