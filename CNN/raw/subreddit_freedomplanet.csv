4469162,0,t3_3cab30,Spade has red sunglasses that he never uses because he tried to be as cool as his bro when he was younger which didnt work out. He ran away because he just couldnt be as cool as his own bro at the time. Then he joined the Red Scarves and kept the sunglasses because duh Red Scarves.Milla wears so many bracelets because they power her hammerspace and super shield bursts. Her parents were scientists and were experimenting with hammerspace technology and they gave Milla some bracelets as a birthday gift disguised as an experiment. They diedwent missingwalked out because reasons though and Milla kept the bracelets because of sentimental value. It explains how a  yearold dog is able to survive on her own without being an outright thief like Lilac and Carol even if she wouldnt have known how to use super shield bursts to wreck her opponents. Unfortunately they also have a bad reaction when they come in contact with alien technology.Carol learned everything she knows from movies because she has an uncanny ability to translate what she sees on the screen to the real world. So she can steal she can turn herself invincible by mimicking Chunli and she can not only ride a motorbike inexplicably well but also know how to use her weight to hold it in place when shes doing platforming with it. This unfortunately replaces her actual intelligence because she sleeps through the boring parts of movies. As a result she misses all the strategizing and outplays but is perfectly willing to sit through entertaining but unrealistically bad plans.,freedomplanet,csu0h13,1,t5_2wc9f

6724006,0,t1_d0et3py,Yeah. The ones i earlier linked.Torques line about keeping things secret probably was based on an earlier ersion of the story where they try and keep a low profile initially. Doesnt matter now though.Like i said though it was mostly redundant. Nothing to raise a stink for if they were left alone but also nothing for them being removed.,freedomplanet,d0etju8,1,t5_2wc9f
