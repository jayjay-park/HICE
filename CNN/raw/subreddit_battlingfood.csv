10626967,0,t3_5s0prq, Counting calories is definitely a thing for me. However at this point I make my meals as I eat them so I know approximately how much Im eating. The meals never change so that makes guesstimating pretty good. Eat the same thing over and over. Breakfast is chicken breast oatmeal spinach and some condiments most likely salsa. Lunch is chicken breast oatmeal and hot sauce usually sriracha but Im working through some tapatio I bought lol. Dinner is a cal protein shake after my workout. A workout routine. I use freeletics bodyweight fitness so you can workout anywhere. And come this monday Im gonna start using my parents apartment complex gym for elliptical.  Water. At my last job I sipped water every  mins mindlessly. Sipping water mindlessly is better than snacking mindlessly.  Sometimes gum. I think having something for your mouth to do helps a lot.,battlingfood,ddc39oe,2,t5_3iweh

For me working through eat day is better than looking at the bigger picture. You can do it!,battlingfood,ddeehkc,3,t5_3iweh
