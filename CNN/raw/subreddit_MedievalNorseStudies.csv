11405301,0,t3_5zftmo,Depending whether or not you are doing an academic study into the matter or are just generally interested will determine where you look for information. If academic study is your thing there is nothing better than your primary sources such as what you can glean from the Poetic Edda or perhaps the Norman Domesday Book regarding how people fed themselves. Archaeological finds like Birka Gokstad and Hedeby tell more about trade goods and status symbols than food preservation although Neil Olivers Vikings book and documentary series goes a little into it. If you are generally interested and not requiring peer reviewed journals than there is a ton of information out there and although its reliability may be questionable there are a few ideas that are relatively consistent regardless of source. Firstly check out Viking Answer Lady online. She seems to be a reenactor of the period and has some generally sound ideas about what people ate wore and lived like. She sometimes even explicitly shows her sources when she can.Hurstwick is another group of reenactors who do the same thing although they document their own experimental archaeology projects quite well. Another relatively useful source which is easy to access is the British documentary series Tales from the green valley and secrets of the castle. While both these series illustrate life at least  centuries after the period we associate with Vikings there are some aspects that might still be useful how wheat chests were made in France for instance or how wheat grains were stored on the stalk and only threshed when needed to keep them well aired and prevent mildew. Plus theyre all on YouTube and are a great watch regardless.Your best points of call however will always be museums. Dublin and York museums have an extensive collection of everyday goods used by the Scandinavians that settled there during the th to th centuries. Check out their online catalogues.Good luck. ,MedievalNorseStudies,dforyjf,2,t5_37556
