6603452,0,t1_czxz2r1,So I had a look at waifu There are indeed differences between the original low res and the processed files. Although they are very hard to notice and are more subjective I would think. The processed images regardless of artwork or photo seem to look a bit sharper but when you pixel peek theres not so much difference. At least with this specific picture. But I think Ill come back to this tool from time to time to get a feeling on which images work best with it!,ImaginaryBestOf,d02co37,2,t5_39oyj
