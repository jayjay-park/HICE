4379091,0,t3_3b58hl,Seems very ambitious. Despite my sympathy for the brand Id say its a desperate move from an archaic evolutionary line struggling in a changing market. Amphibians share is dwindling fast as they are particularly vulnerable to climate change and pollution and have difficulties moving into new ecosystems. The economy is just changing too fast. This jurassic business logic of expanding at the top of the pyramid just seems to confirm that. Despite this there might be some opportunities for restructuring  but there is no time to lose.I think they will change their mind on the packhunting it seems more for fit for a stalking type of creature and frogs lack the mobility having to stay wet and not being very fast even with a  increase in muscle mass they will still have an amphibian waggle or a tiring jumping gait and most importantly rely on a local wet environment. Instead it seems more efficient to focus on metabolism and pollution first. As it stands now theyre doing bad where they should be doing well and there are even parasitic fungi getting the better of them. Step up your game frogs. After this internal restructuring I think there are three niches where their plan could work out. One is an evolution from treeclimbing frogs. Bats are the most common mammals and have proven to be mobile and adaptive to the changing world. Becoming larger and camouflaged frogs might be able to catch bats with their tongue. Fangs could indeed come in handy and have proven feasible for limnonectes already. Another niche is that of the waterside where they could be a sort of mobile rselected lurking predator of birds and small fauna and fish. While most frog ecosystems are dwindling with some adaptations they could maybe eat gulls and rats in freshwater docks ducks and water fowl in parks. A minicrocodile for a human and posthuman world if you will. The third niche is a very short term plan that could nonetheless boost their numbers immensely. It relies on muscle mass and self loathing alone. This could enable a symbiotic relationship with homo sapiens sapiens wholl feed them the last fish and later on jellyfish to breed them for their tasty hind legs.,SpeculativeEvolution,csj9bu7,11,t5_2w9tx
4511113,0,t3_3ctxlr,PeopleAs another commenter said Bamboo. I did a whole report on the shit in th grade and the stuff it can do is crazy. But lets consider that lumber for this instance.There was a native american tribe on some islands near California Cant remember the name but there was a famous novel written about them who used a variety of methods Whale bones sinew and other materials from creatures around them. Keep in mind in this area there were no real trees just small bushes stunted by the wind. Rocks and stones Tall grasses used to weave baskets and such. This in combination with mud could make water tight surfaces so essentially basket buckets and huts on a larger scaleAnd up until they were discovered by colonizers from Spain IIRC they were thriving. So I believe humans would continue on without lumber as our ingenuity is what sets us apart from other creatures.AnimalsMy best guess is many more animals would not only get accustomed to using four legs but more animals would utilize burrowing as well to hide from predators spawn etc. Think about animals you would typically find in trees These are just a few example Apes  Monkeys would either become bipedal like us eventually or go the other way and as I said use all four limbs as legs to hunt and run with better speeds.  Squirrels would become accustomed to the ground burrowing like ground hogs and such other subterraneans rodents. There are ground squirrels now so I would guess the other species would have to adapt. Birds are the big one. They really utilize trees. But I doubt they would change much as flying would be an enormous preceptorial advantage few other animals would be able to utilize height without assistance of a branch. I would say they would either accustom themselves to an area with high rocks or mountains etc. Or burrow just underground and hunt during the day.Those are my guesses. Keep in mind its all speculation.,SpeculativeEvolution,csz9v1u,2,t5_2w9tx
4513058,0,t1_csyttwd,Are you writing a book? Scientists today seem to agree that dinosaurs probably didnt look all that reptilian. You might want to check this book out. Perhaps a dinosaur would have evolved that looked a lot like an upright walking hairless monkey with opposable thumbs only showing its dinosaurian ancestry by having down on its head instead of hair walking on three toes and pooping whiteish goo instead of peeing. ,SpeculativeEvolution,cszinmn,1,t5_2w9tx
