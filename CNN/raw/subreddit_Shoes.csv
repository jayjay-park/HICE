2735092,0,t3_2rdxsk,I ordered  prs. of the Margo PumpOn Amazon.com Black  and Black both in size . I recvd. the same pr. of shoes lovely yes. I am undecided about returning one. I thought one was patent and one was regular black. The photos were misleading. Even your customer service rep. was confused when we both looked at the online photos. Does the Margo come in black leather that is not shiny? Id like a response if possible.,Shoes,cneyuub,1,t5_2qink

5721263,0,t3_3tg8lt,I like ladder lacing mine. I use shoelaces similar to these They are elastic and have a clippy thing that keeps the two ends together at all times. I have the clippy thing coming out the sides so it looks cooler.

5908426,0,t3_3w8147,If theyre real leather and theyre only a quarter size or so small you can put on a pair of really thick socks and wear them around the house for a little while and they should stretch. Or you can go with what I usually tell women and go for the  and get these little sticky pads called heel grips to fIll that little bit of extra space in the back and keep your foot from sliding. Theyre definitely packaged for women but nobody will be able to see them and theyll help.,Shoes,cxu4llh,1,t5_2qink

8588889,0,t3_4umx01,No its fake. Do not even think about buying from them it will be a waste of money and I doubt you will be able to get a refund. If you want yeezys watch out for the release date on September rd and only buy from reputable sites for example flightclub. Do not ever try to get them cheap as it will always most likely lead to you buying fake shoes. ,Shoes,d6f77sg,1,t5_2qink
