423907,0,t3_1yxfsx,Well... few things to consider.  While a PPL and taking mathphysics courses may help show those like an OSO that flying rotary wing aircraft is something that you truly want to do... one can argue thats about it. Everyone gets the same training so as an English major or someone without a PPL you have the same chance of earn the wings of gold..  Assuming youre either in high school or college Id would recommend taking those mathscienceengineering courses if you enjoy it. As a pilot that has an engineering degree it rarely use that degree in my flying. Thats not the standard answer but I find the answers Im looking for in my flight pubs vice my statics and dynamics book..  As said previously getting yourself in shape and keeping yourself in shape is a huge thing with the Marines. On that note prepare yourself to be a Marine and not a pilot who happens to be a Marine. What would you do if you didnt get a pilot contract out of TBS? What if you were NAMIwhammid in Pensacola before API? What if you got stuck with MVs jets or Cs out of primary? Would you be okay with how your MOS turned out if you didnt make your ideal MOS?.  Lastly most people dont realize that flying in your fleet squadron is the only thing you do. Just wait til you check in and they tell you that youre the new Adjutant a gloried COs secretary that on the ground side of the Marine Corps is a whole separate MOS with a separate school or the S Embarkation Officer and the squadron is getting ready to det out and UDLs becomes your least favorite things.Just some thoughts as Im enjoying several tasty beverages.,Helicopters,cfopbce,8,t5_2slra

The required reading for ATPLH essentially consisted of course notesmanuals from the ground school training provider in my case Bristol.GS. They are used by some integrated facilities and widely used by those of us on the modular professional licence route and you may find older copies of their manuals on online auction sites.The general textbook situation is a little poor for the rotary world. When I did my PPLH I was advised to use Wagtendonks Principals of Helicopter Flight for the technical exams and some of that knowledge came in useful for the ATPLH exams. It is available on Amazon here Sorry I cant be of more use as I say these courses are new and I understand some within the industry are little dubious about them as they are seen a little as a way of milking the student loan system.

It can fly higher and faster than any medium lift helicopter in the military. except the v but I dont think that counts The Army sees this and thats why theyre planning of having it stick around for a century. No other medium lift helicopter can do what the chinook can and be better. The army sees it and so does the civilian sector. Ask Columbia helicopters why they chose to be all about the Chinook.

7353399,0,t1_d2dvt3p,Correct on the gearboxes!  The load of driving the ICDS is shared by the engine the Flight Control Computers automatically marry the torques from each engine so that the driveshafts and rotors are carried equally by each engine.  The drive shafts all rotate the same way the idler gear for the left proprotor gearbox is right before the proprotor mast so the rotation is not changed until then.The transfer of the power is completely seamless just like a twin engine helicopter torque load is shared and when one drops the other just has to compensate with more torque which is automatically handled by the computers.The only clutching is the sprag clutch from the input quill on the bottom of the proprotor gearbox that allows the gearbox to be spun by the engine but the engine will not be spun by the gearbox.  Video for reference same concept just beefed upEach engine has an accessory gearbox the AEC engines are selfsustaining monsters.  There is an alternator to provide primary power to the FADECs and Ignition exciter box a oil lube scavenge pump oiler conditioning unit filtercooling and fuel pump metering unit.  It is hydraulically started with a hydraulic motor attached to the accessory gearbox as well.  The theory behind the components on the engine is that in case of complete electrical failure on the plane the engines will be able to continue operating normally.  In the event that the alternator fails as well as soon as both FADECs die off the engine reverts to a fixed fail mode maintaining the last power setting until fuel flow is stopped.The tiltaxis and midwing gearboxes provide the accessories for the rest of the plane hydraulic pumps generators and pnuematic power.The engines are one unit the output shaft of the engine attaches to the proprotor gearbox.  When replacing the engines we just disconnected the shaft and lower it from the nacelle.  The gearboxes you are used to seeing are actually very similar the other style of the AE engines the C uses the same engine but with a gearbox that is integral to it thats provides power directly to the prop.No problem!

When I left there was a huge issue with CFI students flying a few times a week vs PPL flying every day mainly because the attrition rate is really high so few instructors had the min hours to teach CFIs. They are definitely money focused.They use their own PTS standards which exceed the FAA standards so even if you meet the FAA standards they will not let you take a check ride until you meet theirs. The Double standards are absurd too.My advice If you are privately funded go to a local FBO or a smaller school thats cheaper to get your ratings.
