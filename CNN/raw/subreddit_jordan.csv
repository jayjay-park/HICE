2786147,0,t3_2rovg7,Greetings to you my fellow detatched Jordanian. I can somewhat relate to your post therefore ill try my best to provide you with a valid input on this. Having spent the past straight  and a half years in the states I am starting to question many things where is home? I love it here but how would I feel if I were back in jordan right now? Am I missing out or am I just being paranoid? How would it feel to come back a different person to a place you know by heart?Nvm these questions I just suffer from a severe case of hamlets syndromeYou said youve been living in the states for the past  years so why the hell are you worried about this?  years is enough time to completely adapt to an environment and I am pretty sure you can call the place home by now so at the end of the day youre just visiting friends and family for a couple of weeks then heading back to reality. Glorifying the decay in the standard of living back in Amman wont do you any good bruh. Just lower your expectations and youll be fine. The greatest thing Amman could do for you right now is just it being there really. And again youre traveling so the whole experience is honestly worth it maybe this perception of yours will change and maybe thats what you need. Venture and not give a flying fuck ma dude.,jordan,cnkrwoo,-2,t5_2qkq7

11612647,0,t3_65p305,gtIs drinking frowned upon?Yes drinking is frowned upon mainly by the Muslim community and drinking in the street is illegal. If you go to a bar or pub or an place where alcohol is served nobody will really care. As long as you dont drink in public while walking or sitting on a bench on the pavement or in a public park you should be fine. gtDo liquor stores usually ask for ID?It depends on how old you look really. The shopkeepers will estimate your age and decline service based on that until you prove that you are of legal age . The majority wont really care and will sell you anyway especially if you look like a foreigner.gt Recommended places to visit in Amman?You have to visit the Citadel in Jabal Al Qalaa and the Roman Amphitheatre in Downtown. Theyre marvellous artefacts. Secondly Id say that you should try and visit Al Hussein Public Park just sit somewhere and people watch a great portal into the culture of Jordan not sure if thats your thing though.Youll like Amman.
