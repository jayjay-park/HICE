48565,0,t1_cejxv62,Ill post a comment to the OP with more of what Ive gathered over time. I know that there are many maps of each of these worlds but I settled with the ones that are deemed the most official by the various fanbases. I am also working on better scaling of each map but as I said in the OP I lost my work into that a little while ago.Im also coming into this from a mythological standpoint. There is no way I can definitively prove that these worlds are physically connected because there are many different maps and none of them are completely accurate I would assume. There are probably mountains where the maps say there are none and rivers where the maps show desert but we have no way of knowing. If I lived in this mythological world I could travel to these locations and confirm them for myself but I cannot. With this in mind it turns into a matter of belief. I believe there are lands beyond the edges of the maps and that the four authors involved are all translating texts from different locations in that world that have never really interacted with each other.,tolkienfans,cejyjkb,1,t5_2r6jm

In the ents language every word spoken is the entire story of existence for the thing it describes perhaps because Ents have so much time to converse and enjoy language for its own sake.

477122,0,t3_1zdvik,You seem to be doing a really good job answering questions so I might post a few. I think that this topic is lacking in true analyses and therefore I appreciate your attempt to explain what went wrong with the movies so far which is an important point the movies arent all out yet. I do agree that the movies have not been a true thematic success as of yet for the most part and I even wrote a post on it a few weeks ago however I feel that your analysis is lacking in a few areas. Firstly there are a few areas of speculation that you choose to use as analysisgt These movies suffer from the fact that Peter Jackson didnt really want to tell the story Tolkien wrote.gt In LOTR its evident that Peter Jackson had to battle the temptation to make Aragorn the hero.gt In Desolation we have Tauriel and Legolas. These characters exist purely for action scenes.My questions to you are these How do you know any of these things? Are they inferences? If so then they are not fact and cannot be used in an analysis. It is not helpful to simply state that Tauriel and Legolas are in the movies for action as they clearly perform other functions the class divide and conflict between Sindar and Silvan elves providing a larger spectrum of elvish attitudes beyond Thranduil an example of how people act under cultural threats and pressure etc. Furthermore even if PJ did have to battle the temptation to make Aragorn the hero that information is not important. What is important is what function Aragorn served within the movie. You can see my point.Next gt When you compare Tolkien to Highe Fantasye its evident that his books arent violent enough.Here I strongly beg to differ. Perhaps his protagonists are not prone to violence and his books may not contain Martinesque descriptions of crossbow bolts causing men to empty their bowels however there are many instances where characters not only participate in violence but revel in it. gt The final basic problem with these movies is that theres no character development.This too is what I believe to be a false claim. The movies arguably have perhaps more character development than the books Im thinking of Bard Thranduil Master of Lake Town heck even Radagast has character development! The only place I can see an argument for minimal character development so far is with Bilbo. It is important to remember that much of his development doesnt come until the Battle of Five armies. Here we see his true change from a simple Hobbit to one with rather worldly experience IMO.Ultimately however I do agree with your assertion that there is too little material in The Hobbit to make three full movies. I do appreciate PJ pulling from the LotR appendices about as close as we might get to a movie version of Unfinished Tales or the Silmarillion   however I dont believe his integration has been as good as I honestly believe it could be. Thanks so much for your post. It was good food for thought!,tolkienfans,cfui2e1,1,t5_2r6jm

The Elves of Lindon had contact at least with other Elves who sought the Havens and a way to Elvenhome.Galadriel in wielding Nenya to preserve Lrien as Laurelindrenan of old may have also put up something reminiscent of the Girdle of Melian though much less magical and more upheld by border guards around Lrien as much fencing themselves in as fencing the Wide World out.

705502,0,t3_228g4t, Its very probable that the Lands of the Sun due to their proximity to the Gates of Morning were a vast desert. This could also be the Last Desert that Bilbo references in his little comment about the East of East and the Wild Were Worms. I believe when the Nmenreans visited the Walls of the Sun they remarked that the land beyond was an empty land. The notion that the Lands of the Sun are desert is also supported by the fact that these lands are also sometimes called The Burnt Lands. Near Harad is very dry and arid with a vast desert region as evidenced by the many remarks about the breakdown of the Harad Road and the expeditions made by Gondor to defeat the Haradrim. Far Harad is said to have had regions of jungles but could also have had regions of desert. The Grey Mountains of the South which lie somewhere in Far Harad not to be confused with the Grey Mountains in the far North of Eriador and Rhovanion might be volcanic in origin and therefore might have formed a small region of ashy wasteland similar to that seen in Mordor. Khand is also possibly very arid. We know the Variags were a very hardy people who carried large axes. Its proximity to both Mordor and Near Harad would seem to indicate that the climate was rather harsh.  It is highly probable that most of Forodwaith is a great cold desert. I would also theorize that areas of the steppes of Rhn devolve into desert further East.,tolkienfans,cgkgvxl,25,t5_2r6jm

724984,0,t3_22gtlz,I would guess he was drawn to the Ring. Not consciously so because a Balrog probably wouldnt have much use for the Ring as it is a tool of domination rather than destruction. Evil things seem to generally be drawn to the Ring Gollum most obviously but also the Watcher Nazgl and arguably Shelob. Durins Bane likely fled into the deep places of the world around the time Morgoth was defeated and hid there. He could have gone out to terrorize people but either had no interest in leaving his new home or was afraid to either because of the attention it would attract from the Valar or Elves or just a general fear of the Sun which is common to all evil beings in Middleearth. Its important to note that he did attack the Dwarves of Moria which suggests to me that he did indeed want to keep killing and destroying just not outside of his chosen realm which would explain why he never left the Mines despite the potential for some easy conquests. So when the Fellowship entered his domain they became viable targets. As for Gandalf Id say the Balrog either couldnt tell what he was due to him taking the form of an old man or it knew what he was and didnt care or still thought he was no match.,tolkienfans,cgmomxv,23,t5_2r6jm

825547,0,t1_cgy3vxl,Thanks for that. I was following a similar idea where the Eye was a metonym of sorts. But as in the example you gave for the White House referring to the office of the US President it still refers to an actual object that exists in the real world. Following that I understood that Sauron was possessed of an object that was an Eye whether an artefact of large construction or something as part of his body. There are a several moments in the books that make it sound like the Eye is a reified object though not necessarily a giant eyeball floating on top of a tower but I can see how this can also be explained as a reference to Saurons will being manifested as a gaze.    Knowing that the idea of the Eye is something that was associated with Sauron in earlier ages clears up my question someone else here posted a quote from Akallabeth to demonstrate that. Unless Sauron was able to pinch some palantirrelated technology from Numemor during his time there my idea on the Eye being formed from a palantir falls rather flat.,tolkienfans,cgy46yr,2,t5_2r6jm

He has only four fingers on the Black Hand but they are enough said Gollum shuddering.Of note also is this passage from Letters gtIt is mythologically supposed that when this shape was real that is a physical actuality in the physical world and not a vision transferred from mind to mind it took some time to build up. It was then destructible like other physical organisms. ... After the battle with Gilgalad and Elendil Sauron took a long while to rebuild longer than he had done after the Downfall of Numenor I suppose because each buildingup used up some of the inherent energy of the spirit...Tolkien also mentions in  what Saurons physical form would have been while speculating on a direct confrontation between him and either Aragorn or Gandalf wielding the Ring against himgtThe form that he took was that of a man of more than human stature but not gigantic.If you only look at the text of LotR I agree there isnt much to suggest that he has a literal physical form.

1981079,0,t3_2hdd7r,Uruk is another word for orc which is a corruption of elvish Yrch. Hai means kindtypefolk. Urukhai is just an elaborate way of saying orckindTo draw an analogy....In Yiddish the word Mensch means something like human being.When englishspeakers say that guys a Mensch they mean a typically male person of honor or decency something like hes a real human being. You could think of phrases like Hes a mans man Someone with his feet on the groundThe direct translation of Uruk Hai is something like Orckind which is technically redundant. Tolkien was obsessive about language and did not mean for this to be accidental. Uruk Hai technically means Orcs much as mensch technically means a human being.  But similarly there is also an implied meaning a reason to use the redundant foreign term. Tolkien was not big on brightline linguistic divisions. Everything was something in relation to something else often in fuzzy and ambiguous ways. The orcs who insist on calling themselves the UrukHai can maybe be thought of as humans who insist on calling themselves real men or some such.

It is not clear how he might have fared in a spell duel similar to those in the first age.

I have read of a weird technique from France where they hardened it however this was not commonly done and this technique from what I can make out was incredibly time consuming potentially more so than making a piece normal plate. This is probably why it was never really used.As far as scale armour goes it is rather the same story Im afraid.

In the context of Tolkiens work Fanor paved the way for all the stories that we as readers love.I think its also because Fanor is a bit more relatable due to his faults.

2739509,0,t3_2rfrzg,Elves are not always reembodied and the website is puzzlingly incorrect as presenting the reembodied Elves as being reborn. Tolkien having favored but not without his own typical dissension with his own ideas Elven return from death by being born again moved away from this preferring rather that they were simply rehoused in new bodies provided for them or in very late works creating a new body from the recollection of their previous bodies. It is odd that this website presents rebirth as a unilateral front since it is quoting from Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth with the last half covering the fate of Men. And yet it is in Note  of that work where Tolkien first made the strong conviction which he held from then on about rehousing not meaning a second birth and childhood. That said even with rehousing in a body like the one they had when they died the kingship does not appear to revert back to the old king.

But if you compared it to the famous swords that Gandalf and Thorin found its not that special. The swords have a history. They can be traced back to their makers and wielders. They were used in important battles. The dagger could have belonged to anyone. In terms of rarity its as if Bilbo found an original cavalry sword from the revolutionary war cool!  but Gandalf found George Washingtons personal sword.

2750746,0,t1_cngoesp,uWiles mentioned finding a wiki edit as the first reference to this. I think it comes from the discussion about Ancalagon and the realtion of his fall to the breaking of Thangorodrim. There are two single events. The Fall of Ancalagon. The Breaking of ThangorodrimOnly in the published Silmarillion the prior versions it is based on simply state that he was cast down is it specified that he fell upon Thangorodrim and this has led to the deduction that his fall broke Thangorodrim and he fell upon the towers of Thangorodrim and they were broken in his ruin. and thus had to have been exceedingly large. The blotting out the sun is never mentioned in any of Tolkiens works and in any case it would only be relative to the observer  my pinky can blot out the sun.Later versions tell of the final events thus gtAncalagon is cast down by Earendil and all save two of the Dragons are destroyed. Tale of Years  gt HoME XI .In the final Tale of Years it is Fionwe and the hosts of the Valar that broke Thangorodrim HoME XII  Id interpret Elronds remark on the War of Wrath It recalled to me ... the hosts of Beleriand so many great princes and captains were assembled. And yet not so many nor so fair as when Thangorodrim was broken. Nowhere is it necessary to conclude that Ancalagons fall was the factor responsible for the destruction of Thangorodrim.  ,tolkienfans,cngqya9,15,t5_2r6jm

In the Bible the world was created perfect and people lived centuries.There seems to be a common theme that good pure people live longer than wicked people.

2906154,0,t1_cny7ttn,Partly for the same reason Frodo doesnt.  He doesnt tell Gildor about the Ring.

Both prefer to err on the side of caution.  We know that to Frodo an untimely whisper about the Ring could be disastrous and Frodo himself knows this full well.But partly perhaps Gildor fears to meddle too much in Frodos affairs.  Frodo goes on a quest with Gandalfs consent leaving the Shire.  That much is clear to him and probably also that it is more perilous and momentuous than Bilbos quest was.

2983871,0,t1_co72153,gt Is that just you being a snob and thinking whimsy has no place in MiddleEarth due to the tone of Lord of the Rings or is there any reason to think elves couldnt be whimsical or wallets couldnt talk given in Lord of the Rings? Because its not clearly not part of anything as far as I remember. It was a better time.No reason other than obvious thematic conflict and the fact that Tolkien definitely changed many other things about the mythos between The Hobbit and LotR since we have a draft of the Silm dating to the time of The Hobbit which is very different than later writings from the time of LotR and after.gt I do not understand why you think the most recent letters must automatically be what Tolkien really actually meant when weve established he sometimes changed his mind later. The reason I draw the line at actually published material is because hed have thought more carefully and been far far more certain about what he published than what he wrote in a letter.Yes and I think thats an unreasonably high standard. Things become vastly more interesting and no less consistent when you include the other  of Tolkiens writings.gt Not Bilbo or Sam.It clearly has an effect on Bilbo. He pretends not to have the Ring lies about how he got it and he is barely able to give up the Ring to the person he trusts most in the world. Sam did not have it for more than a few minutes.gt Except youre not really reasonably sure. You might think you are but you objectively arent. I dont mean that in a rude way but in a matter of fact way. Again you dont have a crystal ball not a working one anyway so discussion about what might have been is pretty moot to my mind.I would be reasonably sure from the evidence in LotR alone actually. The Rings influence being irresistible is implied so strongly I would think it odd for someone to reach a different conclusion. Between this and multiple direct statements by Tolkien on several different occasions at different times I dont actually think any other reading is valid.gt Because I assume youd agree that if I were to start caring about Tolkiens notes and letters that the ones Christopher Tolkien used to publish various books would be the ones I should care about the ones youd consider canon.Not really no. Its kind of a moot point anyway since almost all of Tolkiens writings have been published anyway so its not like only using those would give you an especially biased picture of the legendarium.gt Were starting to go in circles now so how about we just agree to disagree?

3305322,0,t3_2xzvi1,For things like this its essential to remember that in Tolkiens conception none of these characters are speaking English. What we get is a translated version. Here is a relevant quote from the On Translation appendix of ROTKIn presenting the matter of the Red Book as a history for people of today to read the whole of the linguistic setting has been translated as far as possible into terms of our own times. Only the languages alien to the Common Speech have been left in their original form but these appear mainly in the names of persons and places.The Common Speech as the language of the Hobbits and their narratives has inevitably been turned into modern English. In the process the difference between the varieties observable in the use of the Westron has been lessened. Some attempt has been made to represent varieties by variations in the kind of English used but the divergence between the pronunciation and idiom of the Shire and the Westron tongue in the mouths of the Elves or of the high men of Gondor was greater than has been shown in this book. Hobbits indeed spoke for the most part a rustic dialect whereas in Gondor and Rohan a more antique language was used more formal and more terse.So in this case its quite possible that Sam simply used some common Hobbit exclamation which Tolkien chose to translate as Lor bless you for the ease of understanding of his modern Englishspeaking audience. In the original language it may have had no religious connotations at all. Or again it might have. But without knowing the original expression in the common speech its really impossible to draw any conclusions about hobbit religion. ,tolkienfans,cp5175z,55,t5_2r6jm

Then Manw sat silent and the thought of Yavanna that she had put into his heart grew and unfolded and it was beheld by Ilvatar The Silmarillion .

3325785,0,t1_cp7bfqq,Actually in Tolkiens writings telepathymindreading is a skill that anyone can learn though most people apparently dont have the time or willpower to master it. In a very interesting essay titled Osanwekenta Tolkien describes this abilitygt Pengolodh says that all minds sma pl. smar are equal in status though they differ in capacity and strength. A mind by its nature perceives another mind directly. But it cannot perceive more than the existence of another mind as something other than itself though of the same order except by the will of both parties Note . The degree of will however need not be the same in both parties. If we call one mind G for guest or comer and the other H for host or receiver then G must have full intention to inspect H or to inform it. But knowledge may be gained or imparted by G even when H is not seeking or intending to impart or to learn the act of G will be effective if H is simply open lta ltie openness. This distinction he says is of the greatest importance.gt Openness is the natural or simple state indo of a mind that is not otherwise engaged Note . In Arda Unmarred that is in ideal conditions free from evil openness would be the normal state. Nonetheless any mind may be closed pahta. This requires an act of conscious will Unwill avanir. It may be made against G against G and some others or be a total retreat into privacy aquapahtie.gt Note   gt Here nra will as a potential or faculty since the minimum requirement is that this faculty shall not be exerted in denial action or an act of will is nirme as sanwe Thought or a thought is the action or an act of sma.gt Note   gt It may be occupied with thinking and inattentive to other things it may be turned towards Eru it may be engaged in thoughtconverse with a third mind. Pengolodh says Only great minds can converse with more than one other at the same time several may confer but then at one time only one is imparting while the others receive.This ability is also mentioned in passing in Gandalfs first conversation with Frodo in Rivendell where he says that it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory.,tolkienfans,cp7d8ea,5,t5_2r6jm

3351292,0,t1_cpa4wc6,Your interpretation isnt so different from mine.  Yes Saurons power was surging.  Yes Minas Tirith is closer to Mordor.  Yes Saurons power pervades the scene.  And Sauron does not exercise his power with a light touch.We know how much Saurons control matters from what happened when Frodo claimed the Ring on Mount Doom and Saurons attention turned away from his armies.  Did his armies go on fighting?  No every single one of them felt the absence of Saurons control and apparently stopped what they were doing confused except for the Nazgul and their steeds who immediately raced towards Mount Doom.In light of all these facts upon which Im sure we agree is it really the Witchking who speaks to Gandalf or Sauron speaking through the Witchking?  There is no right answer but I submit to you that it could be Sauron speaking directly through his general and slave who is vested with or possessed by? Saurons demonic power.,tolkienfans,cpa9t6b,2,t5_2r6jm

3484775,0,t1_cppfa7o,To quote Appendix AgtFour years later  great troubles came to Rohan and no help could be sent from Gondor for three fleets of the Corsairs attacked it and there was war on all its coasts. At the same time Rohan was again invaded from the East and the Dunlendings seeing their chance came over the Isen and down from Isengard. It was soon known that Wulf was their leader. They were in great force for they were joined by enemies of Gondor that landed in the mouths of Lefnui and Isen.  gtThe Rohirrim were defeated and their land was overrun and those who were not slain or enslaved fled to the dales of the mountains. Helm was driven back with great loss from the Crossings of Isen and took refuge in the Hornburg and the ravine behind which was after known as Helms Deep. There he was besieged. Wulf took Edoras and sat in Meduseld and called himself king. There Haleth Helms son fell last of all defending the doors.After Helm kills Freca his son Wulf now leader of the Dunlendings invades Rohan and kills enslaves or displaces pretty much all of its people. The Dunlendings were absolutely the aggressors in that case still sore from Helms smackdown of Freca after he disrespected Helm. Also the Rohirrim didnt chase the Dunlendings out of Rohan. Calenardhon was given by Gondor to Rohan it was never officially the Dunlendings land anyway. So really they were doing some very bad things.

Galadriels power is not divine and his healing in Lrien is meant to be no more than physical healing and refreshment.Whence his staff I have not seen mentioned nor if his body was the old one healed and reused or a new one created by Eru.  I suppose it would be of little enough importance to either of them.  I dont know if the staff was his old one repaired or a new staff provided like the new body by Eru or if Gandalf or some of the folk of Lrien made a new staff there.So it seems that when Gwaihir flew him to Lrien he was naked clothes probably burnt away in the fight no embarassment about nudity among the Wise given the circumstances with Glamdring and with or without a staff.,tolkienfans,cu74iw7,14,t5_2r6jm
4879635,0,t1_cu9l3qz,Im not making assumptions about the author but I do think some not all of his representations of gender are outdated. This isnt necessarily down to Tolkiens own views  without more evidence on those its hard to make real judgements. I think the earlier commenter makes a good point when he says the Aldarion tale shows Tolkien can write women well.The comment frequently made about Tolkiens works is that women are invisible. Everyone is x son of y. There are few referenced mothers. With very few exceptions the husbands are betterknown than the wives with often the wives being just a name if even that. Few women get a speaking role. Think of all the many hobbits that have dialogue lines in Lord of the Rings  two are women and of those only Lobelia has any personality sorry Rose.Asides from that I think there are numerous prowomen elements in Tolkiens writing such as his indications that the lines in Numeron failed when they didnt go with female inheritency. I think his problem is mostly one of underrepresentation which I put down partly to a style of the times. There used to be much more of a tradition of men write about men and women write about women.,tolkienfans,cu9m6dc,7,t5_2r6jm

5015173,0,t3_3jmmvp,gtAt the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this course west of the Mountains for many miles and days. The country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in Wilderland on the other side of the range and their going would be slow but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. The spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country and the paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell.There are a few other lines in The Ring Goes South that expound upon this but I think the answer is there the country was too treacherous and difficult for horses. The benefits provided by having horses would be counteracted by the necessity of finding paths in the rough foothills of the Misty Mountains that they could navigate. It would probably have been even slower.Edit For a visualization take a look at these maps Bear in mind this isnt based on explicit distances given for the most part but rather estimations based on the text.

It cannot comprehend the state of mind of the victims.  But a human doing much the same such as a Nazi dashing a Jewish child to death in sight of the helpless parents is evil.  You could shoot the crocodile to save the child you could judge morally and then shoot the Nazi to save the child.Then we get to the ingroup outgroup thing where the ingroup are the people whom we are ready to feel compassion for a bit like wolves in a pack and the outgroup those to whom we deny that like wolves from a foreign pack or strays who have not yet become accepted.  An evil person may be said to be one who has a clearly defined outgroup wholly denying compassion to it.  Nazis again many of them were loving family men who could come home from a day job of moving baggage from the trains to the gas chambers to hug their loving wives and children lovingly.  They had been presented with a noisome pustule ideology according to which certain human beings were of a race comparable to parasitic and diseasespreading rats and they had chosen to embrace it.Perhaps an utterly evil person is one whose ingroup consists of only himself.  Though a group of persons with a sharply defined outgroup is far more dangerous than an individual who will not cooperate with anyone.  I suppose in the story Sauron and Morgoth were of the former sort.  Most realworld evil people at least the effective ones at causing misery seem to be of the latter.When selfish ambition invites you to hurt people then either a strong feeling of compassion for them as fellow persons or a strong moral will will stop you from pursuing that ambition.  I suppose evil is when you follow such an ambition knowing or at least being able to know but wilfully neglecting that those are real persons that you are hurting.Is a paedophile evil?  He cannot choose to cease to desire to rape children.  But he can choose to not rape children directly or vicariously eg. by accessing child porn.  One who lets his urges drive him to rape children is evil even if he lies to himself that the victims are not suffering.I suppose Gollum was a parallel to a paedophile.  He had an urge to possess the Ring and he could not wish away that urge.  Pursuing it led to the suffering of innocents beginning with his cousin Dagol.  That urge imposed by an item of enormous demonic power must by the time Bilbo met him have been far stronger than the urge of any paedophile to hurt children.  Was it so strong that it replaced his empathy so that he couldnt comprehend the feelings of others?  Then he would be comparable to that crocodile only much more cunning.  But judging by some of his motives as they are presented by eg. his internal SlinkerStinker dialogues he understood full well that others than himself had minds the Stinker persona desired their discomfiture in vengeance.So I suppose Gollum was indeed evil  with a chink of good compassion and the wish to be genuinely loved by others still in him.  Though it may also be said that by the time of the War of the Ring he was so thoroughly dominated by his lust for it that good or evil he no longer had a choice in the matter the Ringlust was so much stronger than his willpower.,tolkienfans,cxkzgsm,7,t5_2r6jm

Or that the nazgul fear it or at least were wiped out by it.  Tolkien wrote that it would be difficult to support their fear of water but I cant think of a better reason.  Is it coincidence that the Ring is stuck in a river until the only creature capable of destroying it albeit accidentally and with a little nudge comes along?  After all Ulmo has made a personal selection of an important mortal before.  And Tuor also was essentially given that armor specially fitted .  Aragorn gets a good wind on the ships coming up the Anduin to save Minas Tirith.  Reminds me ofgtI will seek Manwe that he and I may make melodies for ever to my delight! And Manwe and Ulmo have from the beginning been allied and in all things have served most faithfully the purpose of Iluvatar.Not to mention if their is the connection between water and the music it is interesting that the children all need it to survive and are made up of it.Of course this is mostly headcanon and I doubt the Professor was consciously considering most of this but it is interesting.,tolkienfans,czhxeao,6,t5_2r6jm

Perhaps Melian or another Maiar more powerful than Sauron could have used it without being insidiously corrupted by it.

BUT this is the only thing they ever tried to use it for to hide from the minions of Sauron and they were merely using the ring they had not actually claimed it for themselves. When Frodo does finally break and claim the ring for himself baraddurs foundations shake and Sauron panics completely forgetting Aragorn because he knows the power of the ring and worries that he might have another true rival.The powers of the ring lie along its ability to assist its master in the domination of others wills be it to command armies or prevent them from noticing you. The truly heroic feat of Frodo is that he travelled all that way while avoiding Sauron resisting the desire of the ring to be used never claiming the ring as his own or using it to outright dominate anothers will.

There is also the underlying reasoning for creating them. Morgoth creates as a mockery of Erus creations and because he wants to control. Aule on the other hand creates as hes trying to imitate Eru and because he is eager for the Children of Iluvatar to come into the world. Aule is more like an admiring child looking up to his parent and playing dress up whereas Morgoth is more rebellious.

6826288,0,t1_d0pw6dc,I believe its implied throughout the book that Sauron didnt reach his full strength until after he attacked Gondor and sent the Nine forth to search for the Ring. Gandalfs long talk with Frodo and his account at the Council of Elrond give the impression that Saurons power is still less than fear makes it. The Tale of Years of the Third Age as well as The Hunt For The Ring in Unfinished Tales support this.But its just an impression and can be taken or dismissed as you wish. Bilbos Party was only a fairly short period of time before the War of the Ring so it can be argued that Sauron was certainly not lacking in strength at that time to discern the whereabouts of the Ring if he had any such magical power to do so. But its clear that he didnt.I dont know what takes place in the films as Ive never seen them but I dont think its a fan invention to say Sauron regained his power gradually and it didnt reach its full potency until the War of the Ring broke out. The Nazgul being so closely controlled by Sauron were also not as strong. The witch king for example appears much less powerful at Weathertop than he does before the gates of Minas Tirith. This has always been my impression at least made long before the films ever existed.Whew Im not usually so longwinded.

Saruman pries into things invents things because that shows his failure curiosity turns to greed and pursuit of knowledge turns to pursuit of power and domination because thats how Tolkiens world works. Or in Gandalfs implication he who thinks new things will bring back past perfection is dumb he who thinks he can usurp the gods power of creation without sharing Morgoths fate is dumber and Saruman knowing all this and still doing what he does is the dumbest.See the arguments in yesterdays Tolkien and conservatism thread.

7460626,0,t1_d2px1lp,In the movie the entire character of Denethor seems very different. The book Denethor is a truly great man. Pippin thinks of him gtDenethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did more kingly beautiful and powerful and older.Gandalf says of himgt He is not as other men of this time Pippin and whatever be his descent from father to son by some chance the blood of Westernesse runs nearly true in him... He can perceive if he bends his will thither much of what is passing in the minds of men even of those that dwell far off. It is difficult to deceive him and dangerous to try.Clearly he is a man of cunning and wisdom and no small power. However Sauron after being unable to dominate him used his palantir show in Denethors palantir a world in which there would be no victory. Boromirs death acted as the final blow cementing his sadness and undermining his ability as a ruler. To me at least the films interpretation of the character came off entirely different. He is foolish and proud refusing to light the beacons for aid from Rohan and generally comes off as weak and a bit crazy. More than that we never see his palantir and as such cant assume that Sauron had the same influence on him that he had in the books. Edit And lets not forget that the first time he stepped outside and saw the armies of Sauron he told everyone to flee for their lives,tolkienfans,d2q867i,8,t5_2r6jm

7508202,0,t1_d2vb6vp,I think it is clear that Fanor is the mightier of the two. I know Tolkien is into superlatives so that one might be like Wait he said that for that one and for this one too wtf? When Fanor dies it is said of himgt Thus ended the mightiest of the Noldor Of the Return of the NoldorThere is also the text in which he is mentioned as the mightiest of the all the Children of Ilvatargt For Fanor was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind in valour in endurance in beauty in understanding in skill in strength and in subtlety alike of all the Children of Ilvatar and a bright flame was in him. Of the Sun and MoonYet there is another passage where all the children of Finwe are described and there seem to be contradictions if you consider what was applied to Fanor.gt Fanor was the mightiest in skill of word and of hand more learned than his brothers his spirit burned as a flame Fingolfin was the strongest the most steadfast and the most valiant. Finarfin was the fairest and the most wise of heart Of Eldamar and the Princes of the EldaliStrength and valour are applied to both Fanor and Fingolfin although with beauty for Fanor we have fairest for Finarfin understanding for the former and wisdom for the later. This brings also Galadriel into the mix who appears to be second to Fanor in might.I am of the opinion that Fanor was a freak of nature and was indeed the mightiest of the Noldor if not of all the Elves although Lthien may have a say in that regard even though Fanor is clearly said to be made the mightiest... of all the Children of Ilvatar which would include Lthien. There are other passages which take note of Fanors might in Morgoths Ring.gt This child is the greatest in gifts that hath arisen or shall arise among the Eldar. MRgt Aul nameth Fanor the greatest of the Eldar and in potency this is true. But I say unto you that the children of Indis shall also be great and the Tale of Arda more glorious because of their coming. MRWe all know of his mothers situation following Fanors birth.gt The cause of her weariness she believed to be the bearing of Fanor great in mind and body beyond the measure of the Eldar.

7940188,0,t1_d48i0o3,How is that different from actual legends? They are usually full of madeup stuff. Aragorn and Legolas make up a song about Boromir on the spot. That doesnt happen realistically it could very well be something made up by a later historian. You see this in our real world legends as well. In the Saga of Ragnar the main character comes up with a prophetic poem while he is very busy with dying. Not realistic probably made up by the writer after the event happened.I think it is one way of making things ambiguous. JRRT claimed not to know what happened to the Entwives. He could have made up something but he chose not to and leave it to the mists of time. Let people make up their own mind. The conceit really allows him to say It is said that... a bunch of times in the book.Of course it is just a conceit but it is supposed to remind us of someone writing generations after the events happened and making up the gaps and to allow for speculation. Many historians in medieval times worked in the same way the list of kings of the Danes is historical but the early part is probably just made up. Beowulf names historical figures and peoples that likely existed but it is also a story with fantastical elements. They didnt mind mixing up history and fiction back then.The guys who wrote The Matter of France probably also werent there when it happened so they just had to make up the dialogue. We have several different Gospels about Jesus written after the fact and not really in agreement on the details. Most of the hadiths were written well after the death of the prophet Mohammed. The Sagas of the Norsemen are part history part legend.And many things we know about Middleearth are lost to time. We dont know about the Entwives it is said that Sam went to the Havens we dont know where Ungolianth came from we never hear about Radagast again after the Council of Elrond there is so much that is deliberately left vague.

8484826,0,t3_4vqzpu,All this talking of in both worlds at once strengthens my hypothesis that the Rings of Power represent Mens envy of the Elves and the desire to have Amanlike paradise and immortal life availableIt gave the Nazgul the delusion theyre immortals and in a divine realm while also in MiddleEarth it is written in the part of the Silmarillion on the Rings that they saw other worlds that were actually Saurons delusions.But there were also the Three Elven Rings made by Celebrimbor. I believe that unlike the Nazguls Rings their influence was real and not a delusion they really made the elves somewhat in Aman. Remember Glorfindel was one of the elves who lived in Rivendell under the ring of Elrond. I believe he could be in both worlds because of the influence of Elronds ring on all his subjects.I believe the powers of all the three kinds of Rings  Elven Dwarven and Human  existed to some extent in the One Ring. Bilbo and Frodo were both pure and good and did not wear the Ring for more than a century and Frodo had it for much less time than Bilbo so I believe they were influenced mainly by the elven aspect of the Ring. Thats why they were so much more elvenlike and wise compared to the other hobbits and thats why they could  as well as the ringbearer for a short while Sam  sail to TolEressea that was unavailable to other mortals the Elven aspect of the Ring made the aspects of the worlds that are accessible only to elves accessible to them too.Like at the end of the First Age the Silmaril made Valinor accessible to Earendil.The Ring is the Silmarili of the Second and Third Age a power that should have died naturally but kept artificially nevertheless.,tolkienfans,d625dr7,-2,t5_2r6jm

In Fellowship Tom appears to exist as this nearly omnipotent figure whose purpose in the narrative seems solely to get the Hobbits out of trouble. Though Im really intrigued by Tom. He seems to be extremely magical and his songs are incredibly powerful. I almost wonder if Bombadil were to have left the forest and met a Nazghul or Orc if his songs could render them powerless.   But from the letter I get that it was simply a literary device Tolkien wanted to use to get the Hobbits out of trouble without the use of fighting or violence since Hobbits are not warriors themselves.   Of course Tom seems to represent the idea of simply being and he seems to be a very happy and pleasant person untouched by the troubles of the world detached if you will.

8844389,0,t1_d7awhw3,I think the only major women in the Volsung poems are Gudrun and Brynhild but they more or less dominate the stories. The death of Sinfjotli Grpirs prophecy Reginns sayings Fafnirs sayings Sigrdrifumal all focus on the men but most of them are more wisdom and didactic focused than narrative. The First Lay of Gudrun Brynhilds HelRide Drap Niflunga The Second Lay of Gudrn Third Lay of Gudrun Oddrns lament Gudrunarhvot Hamdismal all concern themselves with women and most of them even have a womens perspective to the events unfold. Atlakvida and Atlamal are more mixed devoting several verses to the battles and the actions of Gunnar and Hogni but Gudrun still gets significant time in both. I dont remember enough of Short Lay of Sigurd tho Id have to go back and read it.Thats not to say these poems are somehow progressive or feminist some of them have pretty negative views on women and the women are generally defined by the men around them but women are indisputably a part of them. Gudrun and Brynhild are larger figures in the story than everyone except Sigurd Atli Gunnar and Hogni really. And from Sigrdrfumal on Gudrun and Brynhild become the major drivers of the narrative of the different poems at times conspiring and others seeking revenge. Brynhild gets the brothers to kill Sigurd Gudrun in some versions has her brothers killed in revenge Gudrun kills Atli and his sons and Gudrun sends her sons to die. Theyre hardly passive particpants.Even in other versions of the story women tend to drive the narrative. The Nibelungenlieds which admittedly seems to argue against women holding powerful roles first named character is Kriemhild and shes largely the protagonist up until Siegfrieds death with Brunhild being the antagonist where she sort of becomes the antagonist eventually leading the Burgundians to their death. As for the rest of the Eddas I think youre right that women are less prominent. They seem to more often be a part of the narrative stories. SigrunSvava has a fairly large role in two of the Helgi lays but theyre more centered on Helgi than her for the most part. The Lay of Volund features has his vanished wife and the Kings daughter and Freyja and Idunn seem to get wrapped up into the LokiThorOdin adventures at least somewhat often. Beyond that women are scarcer and appear generally only as names but a lot of whats left are wisdom poems and didactic work anyway.Not saying that the poems have a positive or even dynamic view of women just that theyre at least there and part of whats going on. Its a little weird that the hobbit doesnt have any female characters considering a lot of fantasy childrens novels contemporaneous to it and prior to it do the work of George MacDonald comes to mind for me and for LotR it seems like a break in both in universe tradition considering the much larger cast of women in the Sil and the wider mythological traditions that influenced it. ,tolkienfans,d7ayxol,1,t5_2r6jm

8941246,0,t3_52rbhx,I agree with OP. Compared to Sauron Morgoth generally seems to come across as a bit of a musclebound thug. The only really cunning dialogue I ever remember him getting into was with Feanor at the doors of Formenos Friendship he feigned with cunning argument urging him to his former thought of flight from the trammels of the Valar and he said Behold the truth of all that I have spoken and how thou art banished unjustly. But if the heart of Feanor is yet free and bold as were his words in Tirion  then I will aid him and bring him far from this narrow land. For am I not Vala also? Yea and more than those who sit in pride in Valimar and I have ever been a friend to the Noldor most skilled and most valiant of the people of Arda. But apart from that he mostly seemed to prefer just stomping his enemies. In comparison Saurons battle in song with Felagund was awesome as was his cunning corruption of Ar Pharazon as was his doing battle in the form of a werewolf. I guess becauses Sauron has less raw power he had to be more cunning which makes him a more interesting character IMO.,tolkienfans,d7mltpz,6,t5_2r6jm

9330589,0,t1_d8yoea2,Theres no need to read The Lord of the Rings as a Catholic work Tolkien made sure of that.  But privately in his letters thats what he called it.Its also a philological work with the invented languages coming first and the stories created to explain or give a reason for the language.  Again theres no need for the reader to read it that way.  But if you want to know what influenced Tolkien Catholicism and philology are high on the list.What about Norse mythology and Arthurian legends?  Tolkien was not a fan of Arthurian legends.  He wanted to replace such legends not draw on them.  When asked he generally denied such influences.  But he admitted that Frodo and Bilbos departure to Tol Eressa was an Arthurian ending.The pantheon of the Valar owes something to Norse mythology.  But in Tolkiens mythology the Valar are stewards for God the One which is very different from Norse mythology.  Tolkien attempted to blend the mythology of Northern Europe not just Scandinavian or Icelandic but also Germanic and AngloSaxon and Finnish with JudeoGrecoRoman Christianity the classical tradition.  But in his mythology the Christian stories which he considered the true mythology always took precedence even though he only hinted at their existence.  Thus in The Silmarillion we read much more about the Valar than about Eru so on the surface one might consider the story more pagan than Christian but Tolkien would have taken exception to that.  Tolkien was following the tradition of Beowulf an AngloSaxon story written by a Christian monk.  He was writing about elves and dwarves and a pantheon of gods not typically associated with Christianity.  But he made sure that in his Secondary World there was room for the story of Christ to take place off stage or in the future and many hints foreshadowing that story.,tolkienfans,d8ypxw2,3,t5_2r6jm

The argument is that as the one supreme being and creator of all things God is supremely and exclusively entitled to all those things and all gloryhonor. If you study the Bible you find that a lot of what is considered sin is simply man trying to take what is entitled to God for himself i.e. glory honor dominion etc. and that is exactly what led to the fall of Lucifer and his becoming SatanThe Devil he wanted some of that glory honor and dominion which was exclusively entitled to God.

10756008,0,t1_ddnw4he,Im not actually strongly attached to the idea of pointyeared Elves actually. I just gave the quotes I know of because OP asked for a source.That being said I do think the quote from Etymologies is very clearcut and if one accepts it as written there there isnt a lot of wiggleroom.  That Elves and Men are part of the same biological species isnt actually a problem  small differences in biology could easily exist in two distinct populations of the same species. Compare for example Hobbits to Men of Gondor  size alone is a much bigger difference than slight variations in earshape between Elves and Men and Hobbits being Men themselves are far less removed from other Men then Elves are.The real problem with the second quote as I said in my post isnt that its indirect its that it isnt clear whether it reflects Tolkiens latest views on the matter. The fact that there is a more recent entry on the LASstem by Tolkien that doesnt include the above quote might indicate that he no longer wanted to clearly state how Elves ears were shaped which in turn might indicate that he no longer wanted them to differ from Mens.Then again it might not. Thats the trouble There arent a lot of sources for this topic and none of them are perfectly clearcut.  However if you really want to go by Occams Razor Id say you should come to the opposite conclusion. There is some evidence even if it is somewhat muddled that Tolkien thought of Elfears as pointed and there is no clear evidence that he wanted them to not be pointed. If one really wanted to take a side I think the pointy ears win.For my part Im happy with saying its unclear and theres no definite answer.,tolkienfans,ddpegkh,2,t5_2r6jm

11099651,0,t1_deq41a6,LotR wasnt written for schoolage children. Nor was the underlying Silmarillion mythos. The Hobbit was but thats part of what makes it so detached from the rest of the stuff.,tolkienfans,deq4wg3,48,t5_2r6jm

11128134,0,t1_desq8li,I agree with you there but this is in reference to the Ainur the offsprings of his thought and the shaping of the world through their music. Are they not a piece of Eru himself? Therefore would freewill be impossible for them? Are they not different than the children Elves and Men who were given freedom in the lands of Middle Earth?,tolkienfans,detd4qv,1,t5_2r6jm

11167004,0,t1_dexrg4r,gtalso where are they mentioned?The new lands? The Silmarillion after the AkallabethgtBut the land of Aman and Eressa of the Eldar were taken away and removed beyond the reach of Men for ever. And Andor the Land of Gift Nmenor of the Kings Elenna of the Star of Erendil was utterly destroyed. For it was nigh to the east of the great rift and its foundations were overturned and it fell and went down into darkness and is no more. And there is not now upon Earth any place abiding where the memory of a time without evil is preserved. For Ilvatar cast back the Great Seas west of Middleearth and the Empty Lands east of it and new lands and new seas were made and the world was diminished for Valinor and Eressa were taken from it into the realm of hidden things....gtFor the Dnedain held that even mortal Men if so blessed might look upon other times than those of their bodies life and they longed ever to escape from the shadows of their exile and to see in some fashion fee light that dies not for the sorrow of the thought of death had pursued them over the deeps of the sea. Thus it was that great mariners among them would still search the empty seas hoping to come upon the Isle of Meneltarma and there to see a vision of things that were. But they found it not. And those that sailed far came only to the new lands and found them like to the old lands and subject to death. And those that sailed furthest set but a girdle about the Earth and returned weary at last to the place of their beginning and they saidgtAll roads are now bent.,tolkienfans,dexrnza,28,t5_2r6jm

11367327,0,t1_dfkfwy6,gt current Silmarillion mostly a compendium of the latest edition of what hed writtenThis is really not true theres stuff from the Silmarillion for which the last source was written during WWI and there are several places where Christopher Tolkien deliberately passed over newer source material for older work.Tolkien objectively wasnt up to the task he had over twenty years but still died without having completed it and you just need to read the published Silmarillion to see the massive drop in quality from LotR or The Hobbit as a result.,tolkienfans,dfkgqgq,-1,t5_2r6jm

11438742,0,t1_dfskbmu,gt So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few now can read even of the loremasters for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men. And Boromir there lies in Minas Tirith still unread I guess by any save Saruman and myself since the kings failed a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away straight from the war in Mordor as some have told the tale.To be clear Gandalf does not say any of the scrolls are unreadable by anyone in Gondor. He says few modern loremasters could understand some of the scrolls.,tolkienfans,dfskjv1,8,t5_2r6jm
11476302,0,t3_63r7lf,In addition to the other comments here which hit the mark very well Id also add that Bombadil serves as a reminderexample to the reader that there are other greater forces scattered throughout Middle Earth who are not caught up in the War. Its easy to get trapped in the idea that the conflict enveloped the entirety of Middle Earth when thats simply not the case. Bombadil to me always represents these beings who are above and outside the fight to color in what else might be out there besides who we become exposed to through the main events of the LoTR.,tolkienfans,dfwu1z4,18,t5_2r6jm
11494029,0,t1_dfyeuj8,I also vaguely remember some sort of compelling power coming from the witch king when the frodo sam and gollum were climbing the stair. i cant quite recall but i feel like at the time frodo was compelled to reveal himself.  was written as if the witch king was casting his will out the whole area like a net to pull people out of hiding. my memory is pretty vague on that so i may be way off. ,tolkienfans,dfyuigc,2,t5_2r6jm

11522532,0,t1_dg1w0te,You are absolutely right on the first two quotes problem is Who started Menegroth? The Elves. Who did the HandWork? The Dwarves of Belegost. Nargothrond Takes inspiration from Menegroth AND Dwarves were ALSO part of the construction. I dont think you need to know from where Thranduis Halls took inspirationWhat i am trying to say here is that there is not a single type of Eldar that is willing to go Dwarvish or better yet Less Spiritual on its culture its even like if Elves were just too pretty for getting their hands dirty with basic materials.I dont want Elves to adopt the Dwarves manners or to go full industrialization but i have always believed that the Elves should be AS or even better than Dwarves at CraftingMaking things out of any type of material i cant see a single valid and realistic reason why Elves would have Armors weaker than those of the Dwarves i mean sure Dwarves know everything Aule taught them and as starters on the first ages they should have the upper hand but Dwarves are not inmmortal wise scholars we know Knowledge can be lost Nmenor but the Elves are a race of Wise Superhuman Scholars that literally spent all their day seeking Knowledge reading and writing singing of the long forgotten past etc .... At this point ive realized that there is nothing wrong with Tolkiens idea regarding Elven and Dwarvish culture and that this is just my own personal deal ... But it will never stop bothering me how Stuck Elves are regarding technology and im still looking for an alternative fantasy unniverse where Elves are the Dwarves of that World but still respecting Nature like im not mad but i am not happy either! I would love to know how Ost In Edhil would look in the fourth age!Im a Spanish speaker with some wine in his body so please if there is anything wrong with the text do correct me!,tolkienfans,dg22x4q,1,t5_2r6jm
11538561,0,t3_64o599,Tolkien explained exactly what he did in On Fairy Stories.Many people dont seem to notice.As a Catholic we believe that everything we do intentionally or not is part of the world where Catholic norms are.He just worked on it intentionally.You can see this in Leaf By Niggle so brilliantly as to be unignorable.Or in the beginning of the Silmarillion.As a Catholic Im called to work to imbue everything I do with Christ even this Reddit post.,tolkienfans,dg3wccn,36,t5_2r6jm

11719585,0,t3_677n1q,I cant add much more here. It might help you to know that most not all people struggle with TS on their first reading. I dont think I managed to get it until my second or third attempt. But dont let that discourage you. I didnt have or seek any help as you have wisely done. Youve been given some excellent answers here. I echo urakinos sentiment that Professor Corey Olsens podcast lectures are incredibly useful. I came here to link to them myself. Id already read TS at least once when I discovered Olsens podcasts but listening to them alongside my reading really helped solidify things.Id also echo the sentiment that you neednt get hung up on names. Yes the sheer number can seem overwhelming. But the number of characters who you actually will end up focusing on repeatedly throughout the book is actually much smaller. A bit of artwork for characters can be really useful because you have something to mentally reference as you read.I suggest that as you complete each chapter you spend some time searching for artwork for the particular major events of that chapter. Imagery does a lot to solidify things in the mind.My favourite Tolkien artists Donato Giancola Jenny Dolfen John Howe,tolkienfans,dgofz6y,5,t5_2r6jm
