9739005,0,t3_5ekm9m,I think a  issue arc is better for reprint and trade purposes. Since it would be cooperation this needs to taken into account. You give each the right to reprint their tie ins and half of the main series at will without paying the other company. This gives us fans a better chance of getting the series later on. No repeats of Marvel vs DC.,comicpop,dadjmpg,1,t5_37hjn
