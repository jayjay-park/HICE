729161,0,t3_22hzqf,Ive always used the starring as a way to see which songs on an album I like most. It was an easy way for me to look at an album and kind of get an idea of how much of it I really enjoyed. I never used the starred playlist for anything since I typically listen to albums in full so I dont really get why the starring was removed and instead is a unique playlist I can add songs to. Spotify seems to think that people dont listen to full albums any more with their changes. A few years ago they removed the option to view a playlist as an album list which would display album art right in the playlist view. It was great. Now theres no way to mark your favorite songs from an album. Sure I can drag a track to the starred playlist but again I dont use it as a playlist I used that to keep track of my favorite songs on an album. I get that they want us to use their software they way they envision but their idea of how people consume music is getting further and further away from how I actually do. Im a paying subscriber and plan to stay this way since the service itself is amazing but the software is making it harder and harder for me to listen to music the way I like to.,spotify,cgn5qrb,26,t5_2qofj

2169942,0,t1_clflpgc,Ok. I see people on here often complaining about the same stuff constantly whether it be that the shuffle isnt working well that songs arent playing for them properly or that the music recommendations through either the radio or Discover are completely off and I agree as Ive also experienced these things before. Now these arent truly a deal breaker for many it seems yet these problems have been known for a long time now and yet we rarely see improvements that make a difference. And especially as far as the user recommendations go when youve got so much data on the music weve been listening to how are we still getting recommendations that are completely off or the same seemingly  bandssongs on the radio playing over and over? Another thing I take issue with is that its such a shame that this subreddit has to exist for users sharing playlists in the first place. The peer to peer interaction on Spotify is atrocious in my opinion when it seems like it could be so much better. Why is there no easy way to browse user made playlists through Spotify? In my opinion people discover music better through each other than they do the Top  on Spotify types of playlists yet its almost impossible to interact with other users unless you already know who they are and have them added to your friends lists. And sure you can go to the Search function right now and start typing something in and youll probably find a playlist for it but I dont think many people are doing that and you cant really discover playlists that way you have to already have something in mind before you search. If users could maybe tag their playlists as well it would be easier to categorize them. Im not asking for Music Facebook just better peertopeer interaction so that I dont need to come to this subreddit in hopes that someones posted a decent playlist. This may just seem nitpicky but Artists photos under Biography are basically pointless if you cant see them  of the time. Theres no way to expand the photo so you really cant see the when their all fixed to thumbnails. Whats even the point?  I guess to add on to my PeertoPeer point Id like to see the ability to have a comment section on an artists page. This way you can talk about the artists or songs with other people or talk about the lyric etc. Id also just like to know why songs arent classified by Genre? Currently if I want to sort my songs by genre Ive got to make my own playlists. That should be so easy to correct. No keyboard shortcuts. I have to use autohotkey to make macros for Spotify yet other music services seem to get along. Im sure Im not the only one who would like keyboard shortcuts either.I guess I should correct my original comment saying that Spotify is everincreasingly worse when its more like that its rarely improving upon itself and eventually other services are going to pass right by it whom are willing to implement new things and fix problems.  These are just some things that I think Spotify should have already had after being around since . Thank you very much for listening.,spotify,clfnfd5,1,t5_2qofj

2200937,0,t1_clj34sr,Sure. First open a blank spreadsheet. Then go to Spotify and select all the songs in your collection. Or at least the ones you want to shuffle Once they are all selected controlC them. Go to the spreadsheet and paste ctrlV them onto the page. Your specific spreadsheet may require a paste special or something but the results in each cell should be something like Dont forget to add in your Local Tracks as well if you want them shuffled into the mix as well.Once all the music you want shuffled is on that spreadsheet open up the website I posted in my first post and hit C to clear the box. Copy all the data in the spreadsheet and paste it into the box of the site. Once the data is in the box hit the Random button. I usually will hit Random Reverse and Random for a very thorough sorting. Now copy your randomized data from the site and paste it into a second blank spreadsheet page. From there you can copy any number of songs and paste them into a new playlist in Spotify. It will already be shuffled so all you need to do is hit play and let it run. It takes me a month or two to get through all K  songs in my collection and I just repeat the process once Ive gone through all of them so that I dont ever have to say that I listened to the same damn mix. It really doesnt take that long once you know how to do it and I ALWAYS have fresh mixes to listen to.,spotify,cljld5d,2,t5_2qofj

2452029,0,t1_cmepz04,My method was to dive through the small labels as well Honest Jons is still my favourite or the ones that made weird compilations like Transgender Brass bands cover Heavy Metal add those to my library and just press Play my library on random.Another thing I really miss as an option is to comment on playlists like Rdio has it makes it just so much more social you can ask for more tracks like that one specific one that you just heard give some feedback on the artists used etc. As a playlist maker it gives you just so much more then just the number of people following your list and there are even a couple of playlists there that are small communities of themselves.Something else that is a lot better on Rdio the option to search for peopleplaylists to follow according to a term I typed in not just by selecting from a list. Example searching for playlists that are named s Ska works exactly the same way as searching for artists same goes for searching for other people btw search for Glenn McDonald he used to have really good playlists for all of the genres that Echonest uses. Also Rdio has the option to give a bit of information about the playlist just a compilation of your faves are they from a specific category or genre. Tell the people.The only downside for me as a free player was that I was limited to a certain amount of time to play music and that due to some glitch I burned through that in a day although that made my playlists the most played ones rather quickly D .

5953429,0,t3_3wyqjl,.  Spotify does streaming really well but I have never liked the way it handles my local files.  IMO their goal is to have a massive music library already available so that there is no reason to bring your own files because ideally they are already there.  My understanding though is that the Artists category should show you all the artists you have saved including local files.. I cant speak for Mac but on Windows if you hover over the Spotify icon in the task bar then a preview should pop up and there should be the basic skipstartpause controls..  I concur it appears you cannot adjust the queue order.. Hulu and other streaming providers all have the same problem really frustrating.You might try looking into something like Tomahawk  You could use something like Subsonic to make your local library streamable and then you would use Tomahawk to access both Spotify and Subsonic from one music player interface.,spotify,cy00wni,2,t5_2qofj

7648128,0,t1_d3bimhh,I agree. I admittedly only just started looking at notifications in the last couple of weeks but I really liked them. You know why I didnt look at them before? Because Spotify has this stupid idea that you have to publish your playlists on social media to allow people to find your playlists. So I basically had no notifications before recently when I posted some playlists here on Reddit. When people subscribe to my playlists I like to look at their playlists since they might have something of interest to me.Do we have to change our profile notification settings to receive notifications by email now or will that be automatic?If I were the Spotify CEO I would fire every manager and almost every developer saving only the few responsible for the low level song serving which works pretty well.

8358958,0,t3_4u30ux,gtHi All i was using Deezer for about the last months as there was an offer for Deezer for free for months. Now using Spotify as the Spotify Family option is great. I have a couple of questions whilst i get used to the new layout and ways of finding music.gt Can i only change my Avatar by changing it on my facebook account? why does my wifes facebook image and name not load in my Spotify account as i am following her spotify account. PC App Can i not change the album art for a playlist it seems everyones just shows  random song covers. Guess i already know the answer to this. When using the PC app i search for an artist click on them and then i can get the  most popular songs. How can i get a list of songs by popularity for a single artist? On Deezer there is a loved songs list which if you like a song you hit the heart and it adds it to a list. Is the only option on Spotify to add a song to a playlist? Any cool tips and tricks for spotify? not sure what im after just anything cool im missing.If youre logged with your Facebook then if you change your profile picture is should do the same on Spotify. Im not completely sure why its not appearing. Could be bug. Is she also signing in with her Facebook account? No right now you cant but I believe from what Ive heard is that it might be a feature at some point. If you wanted four particular albums as the picture I believe you can rearrange the songs to the very top.You can arrange songs by popularity unfortunately. If you hover over the popularity meter it should give you a rough estimate on how popular the song is. On the left side of the song there is a plus  button click on that and itll be added to the Songs section. Cool tips or tricks cant say I know any really. It has shortcut keys but I dont personally know any tricks  ,spotify,d5mf6zq,1,t5_2qofj

Saying search Spotify for closer by nine inch nails brings up Spotify and does the search for it so then all you have to do is click it at least.
