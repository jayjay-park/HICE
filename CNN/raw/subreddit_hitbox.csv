101005,0,t1_cemshm9,Hey Ertzel may I contact you privately about possibly paying you to help me make a chatbot for my friends channel on hitbox? I can either pay you to help me make it or I will pay you to set it up. We are wanting the bot to have a different name since his channel is meat themed ,hitbox,cepxi1n,1,t5_2z59p
146446,0,t1_ceuzdmv,Hey! The stream went as well as it could I had no viewers but that was kind of expected the service worked great. The only issue I had was getting my Minecraft server started Haha!   Hmm Features where to start.     Having to contact Hitbox support to get my channel name is weird to me. I think that could be a turn off for people who want to watch but they want to be able to make their account on their own. Im not really sure why they have it that way but I feel like that will stunt their growth.    The profile description section is pretty limited as far as what can go in it I love Markdown because Im inept at html But I would be even happier uploading some images and having a little more control over the look of the channel page.    I love the dashboard but I also like to monitor my stream to make sure its not falling apart in encoding so maybe a small premuted video window in the bottom of the dashboard would be useful.   Mind you these arent really complaints they are just the spot that I see could use some improvement.  Other than that and the notsogreat streamer to viewer ratio which will get better I know I really am happy with the service.  ,hitbox,cev40hy,1,t5_2z59p

838622,0,t1_cgzldna,Hey man Im glad you made an account to post this. Its very informative as to the nature of what is going on. When I was clued into this inkling of information about  weeks ago I instantly asked for my stream to be removed from this site. Since then I have noticed the  random guests have disappeared from my stream list. But I agree with everything you say. I hope you reconsider at some point because someone like you we would love to have as a streamer on Hitbox. Thanks for your input brother. ,hitbox,cgzlrdx,2,t5_2z59p

The error s stopped but the video wasnt there so I tried another test and that one worked. My guess at first was maybe it doesnt record the stream if it was too short but you say you had a  hour one that didnt save so that doesnt hold up.,hitbox,cmrjar8,1,t5_2z59p

2957676,0,t3_2tx0sb,I did take a look at the website for the software and I must be honest and say that I saw nothing that impressed me. I have used both XSplit and OBS and I dont see anything that this software does that raises the bar. Its a little hard to join in with two streaming giants when you have nothing fresh to offer that clearly sets you apart from them in a strong way.,hitbox,co4awec,2,t5_2z59p
2980369,0,t1_co6vmox,Some of the networks do lock you in. For example  I know A Panda Co you can stream elsewhere unless you a certain point of viewerssubs on Hitbox. Ive personally left Hitbox offered a deal to stream elsewhere for a few reasons. But it seems like its getting easier and easier to get partnered every week. ,hitbox,co6vtdz,1,t5_2z59p

7251199,0,t3_4eowy9,Hey man try viewing the stream in incognito to see if it still stutters.  If it does then try a different browser.If it doesnt stutter in incognito then you may have an extension that is interrupting your video playback.,hitbox,d22er18,1,t5_2z59p
7393958,0,t3_4gcuyr,To follow up on what Kelso said We typically recommend a bitrate of around  thats what most viewers can watch without too much trouble any higher than that are you start excluding viewers who have slower internet speeds.Whats the different between the average viewer on Hitbox compared to Twitch?From my own experience people on Hitbox are a lot less toxic and welcoming than those on other platforms. Were a lot more community oriented and even people who come from more toxic communities seem to get better after a few days in Hitboxlandia.As for streaming on multiple platforms we STRONGLY recommend using Joicaster over other thirdparty options. Theyve been super reliable and friendly so far and their support team is excellent. Their connections seem to be stable and dont cause any issues on our side like I replied to stimie in another comment here.But as I say to everyone if you have any questions dont hesitate to reach out to us in Support and we can do what we can to help  ,hitbox,d2in72l,3,t5_2z59p
