2327890,0,t3_2ly1w0,Making a good grilled cheese sandwich should take more than  minutes probably around  minutes. Your biggest problem is probably that youre cooking it on too high of heat. You should have low heat. Also depending on what cheese you use try and make the cheese in as small of pieces as possible so its easier for it to melt. If youve done both of those and your cheese still isnt melting before the bread burns maybe you are cutting your bread too thick?,grilledcheese,clzfuuh,1,t5_2qyw8
2337430,0,t1_cm0ljt4,ill be honest my favorite GCs usually consist of at least some Jarlsberg.

2544211,0,t3_2oujvf,I disagree with you Think of the two objects ham and cheese. Which is stronger? Which stands out? Id say ham Ham is usually the base whereas cheese is usually sprinkled on top as an addition or topping. The beauty of the grilled cheese lies in its simplicity of taking cheese a minor footnote on your dinnerplate and making it the main attraction. thus naming it grilled cheese Its just cheese thats grilled. Thats it. Now on your point of sauerkraut I think thats OK! thats a little side deal a taste enhancer which we can safely call a condiment. Picture a turkey sandwitch its called a turkey sandwitch cus its main protein is turkey. Now you make it a club and add ham. do you still callit a turkey sandwitch? No Its a completely different entity now. ,grilledcheese,cmqnykr,2,t5_2qyw8

Bacon is good.But this is one of those exotically rare instances where bacon does not make something better like maybe a peanut butter and jelly  sandwich. There is not really any bacon in the soup just loads of bacon like flavoring. Also zero  Creamy cheese undetectable due to bacon overload.The can should read BACON soup with tomato flavoringI still have half the can and perplexed about what to do with it?

7901110,0,t3_4n39ng,A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread usually butter. This entire subreddit consist of melts. Almost every grilled cheese sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called grilledcheese is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? Its called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I dont know what the hell youd call that but its not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager Ive eaten more grilled cheeses in my  years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it make your own subreddit entitled melts because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. Im not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white midwestern male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac amp cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit I stopped lurking after  years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. Ive seen post after post of peoples grilled cheeses all over reddit and its been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is.

The sandwiches are really really bad the meat always seems like its low quality and the buns are gigantic meaning youre basically getting nothing but bread.  For the same price as a tims turkey sandwich you could get one from subway that would have the same amount of meat but also cheese and a mountain of fresh veggies instead of the two tomatoes and single leaf of lettuce you get from tims.  The soup is generic fast food soup pretty bad but nothing to really complain about compared to anywhere else.The breakfast is basically mcdonalds exact menu but not as good.  I would wager heavily that a mcdonalds egg muffin would completely destroy a tims one in any sort of objective taste test despite being basically the same thing.I dont really mind the coffee and love the steeped teas but all of their other drinks have so much sugar its unbelievable.So yeah I guess this post got longer than I was expecting but tldr tims food sucks people only eat it cause its everywhere.,grilledcheese,d97dq2c,17,t5_2qyw8

11299892,0,t1_dfc4hr8,I just fry the sandwich in a pan like I normally would with a grilled cheese but after the first flip Ill sprinkle some grated cheese on the side I just cooked and cover the pan with foil I dont have the best kitchen gear lol Then Ill wait for it to melt. Once its melted I put more butter in the pan and flip it then I repeat the process with the other side. I hope that helps!,grilledcheese,dfctqvn,1,t5_2qyw8

11643526,0,t1_dgfrbxn,I agree. The anti melt thing has gone too damn far. There are some absolutely classic adds that go back further than any Reddit post. Tomatoes bacon and jalapeos have been added to grilled cheeses since the invention of bread. Grilled onion as well. What really makes or breaks the difference between melt and grilled cheese is what the primary ingredient is. If youre adding a  burger then its a melt. Clearly the star of that show is the burger. But if youre crumbling a slice of bacon in your grilled cheese that has  slices of cheese on it then its still pretty clearly a grilled cheese. Lets keep the melts out of this sub but lets also not go full Old Testament when the New Testament clearly allows for some classic adds. ,grilledcheese,dgft2ob,41,t5_2qyw8
