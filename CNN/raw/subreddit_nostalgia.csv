Ive personally seen the Speakers Corner sex tape  VTR operators at City would regularly compile footage of people fucking in the Speakers Corner booth and pass them around both among City employees and others in the Toronto TV industry.I had a Betacam copy of one from ... at least once a week a couple would use the booth as a secluded place to fuck or get a quick blowjob. Quite a bit of man on man action but sometimes some hot chicks getting stuffed.I bulk erased a bunch of tapes about five years ago and I think my tape accidentally made it into the pile.

Apparently what the guy had done was emptied them out dunno if he drank them or dumped them and put another liquid in there and closed it back.

I was still a kid then so granted my perspective is a little skewed but it isnt just the theme park which is bland the whole Mall is bland. It used to be this exceptional place full of unique shops with interesting stuff. Even without Camp Snoopy and the Lego store the Mall of America was this really cool place and it made perfect sense that people would take a vacation from across the globe just to see it. But then the mini golf park turned into what some Breakfast Cereal Adventure bullshit? The awesome shops turned into standard mall bullshit jewelry stores and clothing stores. Camp Snoopy turned into Generic Bullshit Land. The aquarium tunnel is pretty cool but also small and only worth going through once in your life. The Lego store is still there and unless something has changed in the last five years thats the only place worth going. What used to be this awesome unique mall that happened to be really large turned into standard bullshit mall that was unique for being large. Fucking bullshit.,nostalgia,cwnatca,16,t5_2qnub

Almost sort of a DIY love project rather than something meant to make money.Basically Comcast decided G wasnt doing well enough because it wasnt in enough homes. Rather than bruteforcing the network into more homes they decided to broaden the target demographics of the network aka compromise the niche value of the network and try to make it MTVSpikeTV for gamers. They put money into it to strip it of its individuality just to try to get it into more homes and attract more advertisers.Pretty silly but thats how giant corporations work.

Subtraction is quite literally taking away.  Addition of negative numbers giving an opposite amount...kind of like a vacuum.Philosophy may state they are different.  In any practical situation they are not.  Unless you are grading based on a word problem and requiring that the student write it exactly as it was conveyed in the story adding a negative is the same as subtraction and by only using addition is one less operator to worry about.gt.

11534353,0,t3_64jq0h,It took me several years to realize that shows like Pokemon and DBZ were originally created in another language. They were just cartoons to me. I knew Godzilla movies were dubbed over but that was very much common knowledge and more visibly obvious.InuYasha was the first time I saw something I truly recognized as different. It just had a unique flavor compared to other animated shows Id seen including its strong feudalJapan theme and blood. Pretty sure it was the first time I saw blood in a cartoon since DBZ was edited. And most importantly Adult Swim aired the shows closing credits complete with the songs Japanese audio. So it was obvious that the show was from Japan.If I recall correctly back then Toonami didnt show the opening or closing segments for DBZ just the previous episode recap and the next time preview. So I thought DBZ and similar Toonami programs were made that way.For anyone interested Toonami has been reusing some of its classic themes and segments for the past few weeks as part of its anniversary. Some great nostalgia for those of us who watched in the s and early s. Theyve also posted some cool retrospectives online that I encourage fans to check out.,nostalgia,dg3f68d,2,t5_2qnub
