I have had older customers ask for the Dockets often though. They are probably the widest but not the most fashion forward. ,Vans,cs7geuu,1,t5_2slt1

10237550,0,t1_dc42bdx,Vans are basically all unisex. maybe pink ones are more girly but to each their own. yours are blue so not girly at all. if you like them and they fit whats the problem? the tag has a size for men too probably? I have a pair of sk hi slims in a pastel green color because I think theyre pretty rad. I found them in the womens section on the vans site but all other places say unisex anyway. enjoy your new shoes! ,Vans,dc4heql,2,t5_2slt1
10314765,0,t1_dccx4es,If its any consolation and you cant find the Vans lunch bag Nixon makes a pretty nice one that is on their website. Equally cool at the office or beach next to the Vans one.
