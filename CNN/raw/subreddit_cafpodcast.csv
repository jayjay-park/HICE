Also I got so drunk I puked and blacked out.All in all though the second runs of the episodes were fucking amazing. Im glad we did it.Fun fact when V and I were talking about which song to use in episode  she was like Use Cold Hard Bitch and I was like Ugh no way will that work but Ill edit it up and see how it sounds just to appease you. Note I didnt ACTUALLY say that but its what I was thinkingAnyway it turned out fucking perfect. Sometimes I love being wrong. Yay for using a comment twice.,cafpodcast,cimm2va,2,t5_31yhz
