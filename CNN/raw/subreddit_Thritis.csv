1193757,0,t1_ci3wvwk,Nope!  I have insurance through the government marketplace because we dont get group insurance through my husbands job and I have a debilitating  preexisting condition. Apparently theres some loophole here in Florida where they arent required to provide autism coverage even though its a mandate. Somehow they get by with that. It was the only company offering high level coverage through the marketplace!  Im shocked they would do that but Ive had two different doctors try to get it covered. They wont cover his speech therapy either. ,Thritis,ci3x011,2,t5_2sc0a

1730215,0,t3_2ds6ph,Have you tried chia seeds? lt that was a really bad joke. Sometimes when things turn to shit for me I just schedule an hour to cry. It sounds dumb but this sucks and a short lived pity party is like an afternoon thunderstorm. It can leave things clear. Throw all your resources at it. Get the procedures scheduled try some pain pills antiinflammatories and metamucil. Maybe try something like acupuncture or get into a swimming pool for an hour each day just to get gravity off your ass. Dont forget the epsom salt baths grandmas cure really can be helpful and if you drink some epsom salt water you can poop. Snuggle a dog. Youve been doing this for  years. You and I both know that there are good and bad times youre due for a good one. Just keep chugging along right now if you can. No one will ever understand what its like to live in our bodies unless theyve lived with this. Its impossible for other people to really understand what its like to live with constant pain and exhaustion. ,Thritis,cjx9b5c,1,t5_2sc0a

3943687,0,t3_35l8tb,Your doctor should be able to suggest something that would help if youve gone through the whole fiber thing.

4008222,0,t3_36bolk,I try to differentiate between tired and fatigue. Tired happens after you stay awake too long and try to do too many things. Fatigue shows up out of no where and makes you feel like youve been awake for about a week and any movement has a lb weight attached. If Im tired I can push myself to do a little more when fatigue hits Im done. I have literally pulled over to the side of a highway for a nap because all of a sudden I couldnt keep my eyes open another minute. I didnt even have time to find an exit. Fatigue and tired are not the same fatigue is tired on steroids it so much more powerful and completely uncontrollable and unpredictable.  ,Thritis,crd61qy,1,t5_2sc0a

FWIW my generic pills look identical and my pharmacist told me he thought they were identical. As in same manufacturer.

5532920,0,t3_3qfluq,dont go off treatment ever again especially if it is working. Similarly if the injections ever seem to stop working ask for a DMARD to be added.  If still less effect switch to a different biologic.  As far as diet is concerned no one has tested a vegan diet vs placebo but I imagine there is no significant difference between the two usually placebo has a  response rate. But if you lost weight while vegan that can help with arthritis.,Thritis,cwivni7,1,t5_2sc0a

9866303,0,t3_5gn379,I follow a ketopaleo diet and its helped immensely. Carbohydrates have always been linked to inflammation so the sooner you can cut them out the better and youll notice a difference quickly.

10732511,0,t3_5tj6du,Have you got a good rheumatologist? I have PsA and finding a good specialist made a world of difference for me after years of being told it was either nothing or a mild dislocation for several joints. I started getting symptoms at  and didnt get diagnosed for about  years.You need more than just pain treatment. Pain relief is minor compared to drugs that will help with joint damage and inflammation.Exercise. Im terrible for this but it helps.

11571104,0,t1_dg7jd21,  Would that the world had more people in it who shared your mind set. The vast majority of people with health issues  want miracle pharmaceuticals. The problem there is many pharmaceuticals show an effectiveness rate only slightly higher than a placebo. Worse some pharmaceuticals affect people in ways far worse than the conditions they are prescribed for. How many people take pharmaceuticals because their doctor prescribed them and never bothered to read all the fine print ?,Thritis,dg7l9oi,1,t5_2sc0a
11784477,0,t1_dgus2go,thanks for the shoutout uadante DJ your brother can hit me up or find me on my stream to talk about AS and how I do weightlifting with it. I can talk in more detail about what signs I listen to.As adante pointed out AS varies WIDELY between people and their conditions. It is true that for me sometimes I can feel a flare up coming and I need to go easy or else I risk a flare up. Pushing through it in these cases is a bad idea. I feel the pain coming so I need to stop.If pain lingers too long then sometimes I need to just take a lot of advil then do lighter weights of the lift do lots of stretches and call it a day.It was a very careful balance of learning for myself how hard is too hard and just when I should ease off of it. Again everyone will be different.I will say that AS tends to make a lot of my general joint  inflammation problems seemingly worse. I think recovery is generally worse for me because of that.In regards to the difficult part I agree with adante. The heavy compound lifts being difficult is not an acceptable excuse. If his form is bad that will absolutely cause pain and he needs to stop and relearn form. All that being said deadlifts have helped my back in general quite a bit. Squats? Not so much. I have piriformis syndrome and squats tend to be risky for me. I still do them but the flare up pain seems to always be creeping at my door whenever I do squats. Long term Im not sure if I will try to push myself to squat super heavy.,Thritis,dgvt4wb,2,t5_2sc0a
