4929230,0,t1_cuf1lar,I like Cannon. sweet and fluffy and serious. The Breeder by Texan Lady is super serious. I reread The Once and Future Taiyoukai by RosieB today. On Dokuga I read anything by SunsetMikoImani JoainKanna and a few others I cant remember. I like some AU as long as Sesshomaru and Kags are in character. not a huge fan of OOC. Behind the Curtain by MissKatt is good. So is visiting the vet by xinyi. I have a bunch of favorites but havent bothered making a list. Ill try to do so when my  month old is down for his nap time tomorrow. Thank you so much for the link!lt,inuyasha,cufvaba,1,t5_2sie6
