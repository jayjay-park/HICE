2818854,0,t3_2scuc9,I received a  inch ashford rigid heddle loom for Christmas. I immediately ordered the . dpi reed and it finally arrived last week but this loom and reed came unfinished so I have been working on sealing the wood. So the only thing on my loom is two coats of tung oil haha.My  inch ashford knitters loom is put away after my binge of  scarves for Christmas gifts,weaving,cnohw9q,3,t5_2vd9p

3058396,0,t3_2t3ox5,Thats a preeetty broad question there. I see people have recommended some books Id probably also recommend signing up for a basic course somewhere. Often you can take evening courses or summer schools. Best of luck!,weaving,cof00af,1,t5_2vd9p
4783644,0,t3_3gezd9,Every time I weave I start creating an uneven weaving very quickly very tight in the center. This happens even if I make an effort to keep the weave loose and results in the finished product being uneven in width. Starting from my first row I have to push the thread down with my fingers because theres so much tension!! Am I warping it too tightly?,weaving,ctxio90,1,t5_2vd9p
5317903,0,t3_3nu4w3,There are a lot of  shaft drafts out there. What kind of loom did you get? Do you know any basics at all like how to warp it? YouTube videos are helpful there but make sure you watch several since there are a few different methods which are good for different types of projects. Check out a book called Learning To Weave Im self taught and it has been a terrific resource. ,weaving,cvrfagg,1,t5_2vd9p

I havent taken it but I think I might in the future. Good luck!,weaving,cz483nh,1,t5_2vd9p

11173069,0,t3_5yivon,I second the Peter Collingwood rec is book is quite amazing. His son Jason does workshops around still so keep an eye out.I also recommend anything by Tom Knisely and he teaches at Red Stone Glen Fiber Arts Center if youre around the Pennsylvania area.Documentaries can still impart quite a bit of information about weaving processes I still comb Youtube for anything about Navajo weaving and tapestry weaving.This website also has a lot to mine ,weaving,deyge4y,1,t5_2vd9p
11411641,0,t1_dfpeur3,awesome pictures.  will draw up the draft for you when i get a little time.  basically it is basketweave and twill.  Basketweave is where  threads are acting as one  threads over  then under  in the squares navy on one side and colored on other  the twill area has a diagonal line running through.  I would expect this to be handwoven due to complex color arrangement did it have any tags?  also wonder if its wool or other animal fiber looks fuzzyhow old do you know?  very cool. Id def. take a second look at it!Design elements included in weaving are structure how the threads are held together in this case twill and basketweave plainweave the pattern the design the treads make fiber and colors. sometimes all are used but not necessarily...it can get complex when you look at all the variables!  thanks for sharing.,weaving,dfphxf2,2,t5_2vd9p
11577135,0,t1_dg7iytr,Its woven! My last post shows my improvised loom. Ive made crocheted rugs before but I wanted to do a rag rug so I got my mom to help me make a loom. It actually ended up working very well! I like the semi braided look but I have no clue how I achieved it... It was some trial and error. ,weaving,dg89w1e,1,t5_2vd9p
