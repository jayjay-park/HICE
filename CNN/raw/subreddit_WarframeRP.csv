6005627,0,t1_cy4j641, uLeroxxxThe StormAmara felt a tinge of uncertainty she had only ever used this power once in here life and the last time she did it left her exhausted unable to fight let alone move. She continued to absorb the energy from all around her feeling it course through her warframe sparks of psychic energy danced around her like electricity and in the centre of her chest a white shining orb of pure energy. Aurak shouted to her Do it now! And although he was standing right next to her it sounded as if it were hundreds of metres away. For a moment everything was silent. Everything was still. In this single second of time only Amara existed. An explosion erupted from her warframe and it shook the Earth to its core. The Grineer all around them were instantly killed and many of the others further away were  thrown off their feet and crippled or killed. When the dust settled she could see the synthesis target somehow protected from the blast. Armed with the Synthesis Scanner given to Amara by Simaris she staggered through the piles of corpses around her. Barely able to lift the scanner she fell among the corpses too exhausted to complete her mission.,WarframeRP,cy6v9rm,1,t5_3baff

6420704,0,t1_czjemwb,Nikela was a bit surprised at her reaction jane you dont understand right now Zeus or what is left of him cannot be reasoned with. What he just did might be small but until recently he has been in containment because he doesnt know when to stop and will not stop unless  you drill it into him and I mean drill it into him... I made the mistake of leaving him unattended while I visited you dont think of him as weak. Let us go. unless you have some wonderful way of fixing this psychopath hand him over to me. She pleaded trying to break the hold her sister held the volt primes hand twitched as he was being healed Jane you dont know what your messing with.,WarframeRP,czjfr7q,1,t5_3baff

6480049,0,t1_czpkk2s,Why the fuck do you personally hate Orokin? In the Canon lore their evils were far outweighed by the Sentients. The Tenno committed an equal amount of atrocities as the Orokin. Just because we play as them doesnt mean we get to call them the good guys. Yes of course I like the Tenno more than all the other races but thats pure bias it would be foolish to say otherwise. And thats coming from me as the author and as a player and a writer. Not as a character.,WarframeRP,czpl26u,1,t5_3baff
