1781109,0,t1_ck3lha3,Its not the identical though. Its not like I can decide to hit a mountain bike trail or race cross and just use the gearing I know to use. Id have to use a gear calculator to figure out what expensive cogs to buy. I guess my real reason for not wanting a belt drive is expense.Traditional chains cogs and chainringschainwheels are cheaper at this time. Im cool with continuing to run old school drivetrains for now. The belt drive stuff will get cheaper and more common in time then Im sure that many more of us will be using them.I do think that belt drives are good and will have a future. Im just not on board with them yet.,SingleSpeedMtb,ck3nvef,2,t5_32801

3361962,0,t1_cpbcxjt,I built it up from parts. The frame came from ebay. The wheels and cranks were repurposed from another bike I have. I ordered the rest. This bike was originally just going to be a backupoccasional rider. It turned out so well that I pretty much ride it exclusively. ,SingleSpeedMtb,cpbhlqg,1,t5_32801

8873804,0,t3_50z3nk,Hey dude that bike has shifters so definitely not a SS MTB. The bike you posted is more of a touringcommuter bike so Id prolly pass on that if you want something for light trail use. If youre looking for something you can ride around town light trail use and comfort I would suggest a cyclocross bike. You can findbuild one with gears or single speed and it can serve many uses.,SingleSpeedMtb,d7ei8dt,2,t5_32801
10509015,0,t3_5qgq9q,Some purty components.  Endless cogs seem to be worth the money.  Do you ever change gears?  I am debating a drooper on my SS what sold you?  ,SingleSpeedMtb,dczb3sn,4,t5_32801
