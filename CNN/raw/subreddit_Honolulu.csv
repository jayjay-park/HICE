Preparation for moving involves planning financially so make sure the money you two have saved can stretch until you two become employed. If you two are looking for FampB jobs Waikiki is always a good place to start. Try looking at Craigslist. In Honolulu go to Leonards for malasadas. Zippys is a chain out there with solid food with  hour locations. Cant help much dont live out there anymore.Edit dont live out there to dont live out there anymore.,Honolulu,cm5k8su,3,t5_2rhhc

6490706,0,t3_44jisp,public works projects are always a bad idea until they are completed and working and people depend on them.seems that universally people hate on any sort of mass transit initiatives and dont want to spend on it and continue to whine about traffic.it usually makes it worse that the way the things are bid they always go over budget and time so people just say I told you we shouldnt have done this. Man traffic sucks today.Then we get the vested interests of the oil auto and road barons using their money to poison the well of public opinion and their cronies in the government castrating the projects financially or in implementation out of spite. That way next election they can say I was against it all along and push to privatize something else because Government shouldnt be running this private industry does it better meaning their buddies in the private sector financing their campaigns.Oh yeah...and who owns the media?

8187063,0,t1_d50fs05,No I think the demand is real the problem is the effective no property tax makes Hawaii an insanely amazing place to hide your money in an investment property and as such yes lots of foreign money.  The other problem OFC is the lack of high density rental only properties i.e. apartments which forces folk that would traditionally rent to buy and then if they move just sit on it given the lack of property tax.,Honolulu,d50xn1y,1,t5_2rhhc
