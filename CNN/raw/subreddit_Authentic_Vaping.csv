5425083,0,t3_3pbusd,A tale of woe from the ECR Classifieds!I received a Panzer in trade last week that needed a new button housing. In messaging the MCV Facebook page I was asked to provide photos. After seeing the photos the pages admin or whomever was operating the chat at the time replied that it was a clone and they couldnt help me. Here are the photosI have to ask how can he tell? I watched multiple authentic v. clone videos before agreeing to finalize the trade and in both cases there were noticeable differences. I cant see any difference on this one compared to photos of an authentic. What did I miss? I am relatively confident that the manufacturer can serve as the final authority on authenticity but I figured I would put it to you fine folks if only for the sake of discussion. ,Authentic_Vaping,cw53zrv,4,t5_35cpi

I do however have some input on the Origen V.I havent played too much with fiber in it  I genuinely enjoy working with mesh more than I do with cotton  but it is an insanely good mesh atomizer.  Im using this build from Jong Yeol Kim and its great.  Whether you want to have a really super wide open draw or a nice tight one for loads of throat hit the Origen V is the way to go.  Whether you want to use fiber mesh or ceramic dual or single coil its seriously great.  For its versatility it remains my  atomizer.I really find that build quality versatility and thoughtfulness havent meet in an atomizer like this since its release so Im very excited for what Norbert has planned next!,Authentic_Vaping,cwl68oa,4,t5_35cpi

8381622,0,t1_d5p7azy,Hahaha I agree that they are very rarely full replacements for a tank. And I agree that designs dont ever transfer over fully. Call me a fanboy if you want but I dont think Nar mods has it in them to make a bad product. The reason the NarTa looks so similar to the NarDa is the deck design is perfect. If youve never tried out a NarDa the secret is in the air flow coming through the deck and precisely hitting the bottom of the coil. Best rda out there in my opinion. Period. Ive tried more than a few different Attys in my chase for flavor and none of them produce such a dense and flavorful vape. If one could simply take that same concept of airflow to the rda and transfer it to the rta and avoid leaking problems then why decrease flavor in order to cater to a new design? It is my understanding that the NarTa is meant to be a hassle free NarDa for those who dont have bf mods. TLDRIf it aint broke...PS Nar mods is rumored to have another tank coming out soon. One that is different from the previous NarDa and NarTa deck. Supposedly before Aug  hits. So well see how that turns out. ,Authentic_Vaping,d5p91sv,3,t5_35cpi

8465114,0,t3_4vlftr,Some good information regarding plexiglass tanks like the Steam Tuners capsgtAlcohol is the only thing that can crack a plexi tank. I cant tell you the exact material that other plastic tanks are made of but food grade plexi like our tanks can be harmed from alcohol. I know that many customers clean their tanks that way but we always suggest to them not to leave their tank more than few seconds in alcohol. The thing that make people believe that their tanks keep a smell from old juices most of the times is the orings so an other advice that i can give you is to change them if it is possible with new. That way you can avoid any extra cleaning procedure that can harm your tanks.This is directly from Steam Tuners support.
