6331710,0,t1_cz8txo2,gt Miegakure Holy! Wow! This looks just like the way I was trying to visualize higher dimensions.... I cant wait for this to come out!Check out the visualization guide and also the strawberry post on this subreddit and the D lake post. The way I imagined the higher dimensions in those post and the way this game appears are similar leading me to believe that I was right in the way I was imagining the extra geometry. Amazing!Are you on the Miegakure team? Id love to do an interview for rfived if you or anyone on team is interested and has free time.Thank for sharing ,fived,cz9cgqv,1,t5_3bt01
6528613,0,t3_45227g,This youtube channel Zogg from Betelgeuse features a charming ostensibly alien character who speaks exclusively via fairly entertaining speech synthesizer. He runs at least two playlists Earthlings  which describes Earth Humans and their culture and biology to other aliens via a thin veneer of fictional yet quite entertaining narrative tropes but hes now also doing this series called No edge which describes different potential descriptions for the ultimate shape of the universe.In this first episode he discusses mathematically possible eg not ruled out by evidence so far gathered by humans arrangements for the universe such that it would have a finite volume yet no edge.,fived,czulzgp,1,t5_3bt01
