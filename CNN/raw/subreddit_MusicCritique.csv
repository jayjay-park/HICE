407130,0,t1_cfmoz3a,Lawlz it is good to know that it was meant to be funny.My mainstream comment was mainly about subject matter of mainstream rappers they all talk about sex and stuff like that. Not the songs that are on the radio but from the rappers that tend to get on the radio.EQ A slight scoop on the instruments for the vocal range of frequencies and cutting out the nonvocal frequencies of the vocal track.Id suggest looking up different sources for what effect certain frequencies can have on the sound of a voice then playing around till it sounds clear and good. But you should definitely scoop slightly the vocal range on most of the instruments so that the voice can come in clearly and coexist without having to be louder.Once you have the super highs and super lows removed form the vox as should be done anyways you could run a slight compressor on it but I tend to not do this unless they are processed with effects or recorded in a certain way. If you do put a slight compressor on it to level things out a little more Id suggest no makeup gain...or play with it till you get a natural sound. But not too much you dont want those little breaths or clicks to be too prominent.The easier and more effective way is just to be a limiter on the vox bus and alter the ceiling till you get a good all around range of dynamics without having some areas come in too loudly.Sorry if my first comment came off a bit like a dick. I just wasnt sure if you were a guy having fun or a guy that was full of himself. Thank you for replying and asking about some production things.,MusicCritique,cfmyrsy,2,t5_2w8ze

1549361,0,t3_2bxnxz,Its a great composition but your main lead is weak try addinf reverb to it with a distortion after and tune the distortion so the threshold is set to its lowest. i also recomend working with the Waves Vintage Aural Exciter on your main lead. And last get fancy with your automations make them unexpectedly expected. Awesome track in my opinion keep up the good work!,MusicCritique,cjahi41,1,t5_2w8ze

2231629,0,t3_2kpf6a,Some timing issues but it sounds good. It needs more depth though I think right now it seems like background music for a movie. It seems to be more of a bridge to a song than a song in its own right. ,MusicCritique,clnhrmj,2,t5_2w8ze
2249057,0,t1_clppayk,yea that completely makes sense. Honestly I like it like that as its something I can just put on in the background while I do something else. Still thank you for the critique.,MusicCritique,clppf1g,1,t5_2w8ze

2385182,0,t3_2mons7,Im not familiar with the original just gave it a listen so my feedback is a bit limited. The intro is nice and sounds quality except the snare that hits each bar seems very loud. Its definitely a much more chilled start which I definitely appreciate. The track progresses really well to its peak and gains momentum throughout which is great! I thought the outro seemed a bit forced and didnt really flow it kinda sounded like the song started again.Good work man!,MusicCritique,cm6im9j,2,t5_2w8ze
2544278,0,t3_2ond7w,I love the feeling of this one!,MusicCritique,cmqo9w1,3,t5_2w8ze
2787497,0,t3_2ru4xh,I listen to dubstep but not so often  the raw or heavy but more melodic dubstep and thats maybe not what you are aiming for. But anyways I would say add something more like more melodies and chords pads and synths. Right now it feels a bit empty.,MusicCritique,cnkxfyf,1,t5_2w8ze
2814645,0,t1_cnnd8aw,Yeah more instruments is right I think its currently done on only four channels!Thanks very much for your response,MusicCritique,cno0n1f,2,t5_2w8ze
2896119,0,t3_2t98ui,Its not bad. Nice flip on the Ritchie sample. Two things it seems a little repetitive and the transition from the beat to the outro feels a bit weird due to the samples low BPM.If you wanna give it that real boom bap feel throw a little bit of swing in those drums.,MusicCritique,cnxak4p,2,t5_2w8ze
2998366,0,t1_co8ooyt,gtlearn synthesissounds interesting. care to elaborate?im new to music production in general so i would be grateful for any advicei have a whole bunch of vsts including nexus and massive pretty much the only ones i use a lot of people say that these vsts are the best out there but is that true?,MusicCritique,co8s1cu,1,t5_2w8ze
3126423,0,t1_colpwwd,It wasnt constructive though. Calling it bad or horrible right off and then having it as one of your main points is not constructive and does not make me want to listen to anything you say. You clearly dont like the style which the rules say Dont respond if you dont like the genre. You can tell me what you want but youre complaining about sound quality basically. Also repetitiveness I guess. ,MusicCritique,com1w0b,1,t5_2w8ze

4585560,0,t3_3dtpde,Id think it the other way.. instead of trying to sound in a particular way that already exists sing it with your own voice your own sound leave your mark on the rap world instead of trying to fit in with what people say rap should sound like fuck that,MusicCritique,ct8lyie,3,t5_2w8ze

4868673,0,t3_3hkoal,Id maybe turn the vocals down a teeny tiny bit but other than that its mixed very well I like the arrangement and the flow of the song. Nicely done,MusicCritique,cu88emu,1,t5_2w8ze

6254635,0,t3_4193hp,Very cool song. I really liked when the drums and electric guitar kicked in.Three things  During the intro I would lower the guitar volume. It was difficult to hear your voice over the guitar. Listening on a Macbook Pro with about  volume could not understand a word you said. Second I think it would be cool if you added vocals to the electric guitar part. I kept waiting for you to start singing again but you never did...Lastly a very tiny suggestion. When the electric guitar kicks in you do a little  note intro  It would be cool if you lowered the volume during that part and gradually rose it over the  notes. That way when the drums and guitar finally hit that first main note its more powerful. hopefully that makes sense,MusicCritique,cz0l182,3,t5_2w8ze
6267617,0,t1_cz1w53p,Im excited that you see potential in this lol I might go and work on it some more adding an actual bass line etc. Thank you for the suggestions!And Ill give it a listen ,MusicCritique,cz2243a,2,t5_2w8ze
6584110,0,t1_d00cn27,Also I think the length is fine. The piano and outro and tempo change round it off nicely.,MusicCritique,d00cnik,1,t5_2w8ze
7551210,0,t3_4ikjlj,I really dig it! Got a nice Housey DrumampBassy vibe to it. The progression and everything is good. If theres anything I could critique Id say maybe the transition to the final progression around  or so could be a bit smoother and it could be mastered and leveled better but most songs could use a bit of that. Nice work!Edit Gotta say that Alright bootleg is pretty damn nice too.,MusicCritique,d30jbmk,2,t5_2w8ze
7656379,0,t3_4k2319,Sounds good. Youve got a good voice and the recording quality was good.  The song has the potential to sound better though IMO.  I feel the opening is far too long and Im not a big fan of the effects on the second guitar.  The song should be shorter.  Theres just not enough variance to warrant . Should be more like .  If youre trying to break the standard pop verse chorus verse chorus format youll need to do something a bit more interesting.  Overall good job just wanted to give some constructive criticism.  Send me a message if you end up with a new version I usually have to go through  revisions lol,MusicCritique,d3chkek,1,t5_2w8ze

I thought it was starting to get a Bit dull but then i heard the thunder! if you asked me some more things like that would be good for the song!Looking forward to that super good solo youre talking about ,MusicCritique,d4gx05m,1,t5_2w8ze
8033204,0,t3_4p5q44,I love it! Your voice sounds fantastic and suits the style and beat so well. The part after the break where the bass restarts absolutely floored me. My only critique would be the lead in to the break just after the vocal sample feels a bit empty for a touch too long.. Ive never tried to make this style so Im not sure what you could do to change it maybe a trailing delay or make the verb a bit more pronounced? Such a minor thing though really its such a nice track! Looking forward to hearing more.,MusicCritique,d4j0asg,2,t5_2w8ze

10381468,0,t3_5onro6,Cool vibe going on. I would say the automated vocal panning in the bit before the first chorus is a little much. Its a really cool idea and on speakers it sounded ok but in headphones it span me out a little and detracted from the chilled out vibe of the song. Maybe have the vocal bit in the centre and then have the delay parts echo from side to side? Otherwise good rendition well done! ,MusicCritique,dcksxvx,1,t5_2w8ze
