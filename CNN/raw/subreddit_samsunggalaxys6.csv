3710866,0,t3_32vg1r,For the S it used to be its own setting but with Lollipop it is a little more obscure. Its now under More Networks in the Network Connections category.Perhaps this is true of the S as well?,samsunggalaxys6,cqf9itf,1,t5_33edz
3713232,0,t1_cqfcet7,Im running the google launcher as well. I dont know if I turned off or disable some voice setting when killing all the samsung apps. Its very frustrating. TMobile purchased if that matters.,samsunggalaxys6,cqfj8ix,1,t5_33edz

If turned on it will vibrate when you pick up your phone or press home button to notify you of something even if DND is enabled etc.  This is all separate from the other vibrate for notifications settings in the sounds and notifications settings.,samsunggalaxys6,cuud9ae,2,t5_33edz
5070562,0,t1_cuwn981,The original cable did the best at  milliamps at  charge. The other cables were all under  milliamps and when my phone only said charging instead of fast charging those cables were the worst at  milliamps. So.... Using any usb cable for fast charging is incorrect. Download the app and check it out ,samsunggalaxys6,cux70au,1,t5_33edz
5210023,0,t3_3m9bkd,Hmmm. If I were you Id take it to a store. ,samsunggalaxys6,cve00za,1,t5_33edz
5791365,0,t3_3u9fu6,My S stutters too. Its one of the first things I noticed about it as soon as I first picked it up like going through Google play and stuff. My old LG G is way way more fluid yet less powerful. ,samsunggalaxys6,cxez24i,1,t5_33edz
6371264,0,t1_czdu3q1,you can log the temperature in the charts view click on Temperature at the top and look on the righthand side. So far as I am away off it can tell the temperature with the battery level and time since you downloaded the application. I downloaded it in November and I can scroll back until then. The dates are not shown only the day with times,samsunggalaxys6,czducb6,1,t5_33edz
6510667,0,t1_czsju7h,Is it worth buying? Absolutely. Due to its portability and wireless functionality I think it even has a place if you get the new Oculus or Vive coming out. Its pretty awesome and easily worth the  asking price if you have the phone. Its orders of magnitude above a Cardboard.Is it the best thing about it? The best thing about it is that its an amazing phone in almost every way. But the Gear VR is a pretty amazing Pro to have and for me it pushing it ahead of the Nexus devices.But from that perspective a Note  is even better. The S is more prone to overheating when in use by the Gear VR and the Note gives better FOV.But if you are interesting in VR yeah the Gear VR is a pretty huge feature.,samsunggalaxys6,czsr4bp,1,t5_33edz

8717037,0,t3_4zen2t,my fast charger came with the phone has lasted a year and still going strong you may have gotten a defective one.,samsunggalaxys6,d6v9okg,3,t5_33edz
