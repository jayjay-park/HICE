1897094,0,t3_2gc9ij,Hi  If swapping pcb will probably not do you any good  and perhaps even create some damage. You better go to a pro  pricedepends on location probably  but if the word to describe the data is irreplaceable  than dont go for the cheapest option... Good luck! ,datarecovery,ckhsgds,2,t5_2qpkw

3080542,0,t1_coh8pky,Will DiskDrill let you do a deep scan?I wish osx let you push a disk map out. I recovered a disk array with mixed RAID volumes on and old HP MSA after a controller failure. I say recover because it really was as simple as feeding it the config file. It should be that easy.  I really wish we had gotten ZFS...

3960434,0,t3_35htt7,You cant just cold swap PCBs from one Toshiba drive to another.  You have to transfer the ROM chip to the new board.However it doesnt matter now that you opened it and ran it outside of a clean room.

5224236,0,t1_cvfmhbn,PhotoRec is a great utility but in the users case its probably not the best option as it does not preserve directory structure or file names which is probably going to be important with the video and audio files and their dependencies for the project they are trying to recover.Also since the program recovers data based on file signatures it can have difficulty with larger file types like video.PhotoRec is a good free option generally if you are looking for smaller file types photos office documents etc.,datarecovery,cvfpmwo,3,t5_2qpkw

6634963,0,t3_46gvng,According to me you need a software which can recover and repair both. So that your corrupted files get repaired and then recovered.Your hard drive saves a copy of your original file in some binary form. Sometimes OS can not retrieve your file from the sectors of hard drive then this problem occurs.  I recommend you to try a software i.e. Hard Drive recovery software  It will repair all your corrupted or damaged files.,datarecovery,d05m1wn,0,t5_2qpkw

8943527,0,t1_d7mujd1,Yeah those TB DMs have a pretty high failure rate.  Id put my money on degradedfailing heads and service track issues.  Might be able to get it to speed up by turning off media cache and autoreallocation but theres not really a great solution for doing that DIY that I know of We use a PCKId probably recommend finding a recovery company at this point.  Those drives can be a pain to deal with and when they finally crash they tend to crash hard.  Theyre also currently the subject of a class action suit against Seagate.,datarecovery,d7mvp8t,1,t5_2qpkw

9960042,0,t3_5i6c8a,Are you sure B ids a TB drive?  Looks like .TB to me.There could be a number of problems with it ranging from software to hardware.You should try to clone it first so that you have a backup in its current state see ddrescue in sidebar.  If you cant clone it you cant recover it.After cloning it you can try to repair the MBR with free utilities like TestDisk.  Or you can recover the data with recovery software.  There is free recovery software that you can try like Recuva.  But you  may have better results with paid software like ReclaiMe RStudio or GetDataBack.Good luck!,datarecovery,db5ti8o,1,t5_2qpkw

11358789,0,t1_dfjduyh,Perhaps you could post a high resolution photo showing the damage. I doubt the magnet would damage the NAND.  But most reputable labs dont charge for the recovery if they are unable to recover your files.,datarecovery,dfjhxnp,2,t5_2qpkw

11380121,0,t3_62bcpt,Its tough to say what the problem is here but in every data loss situation where the suspected problem is not a physical failure the first objective should be to duplicate the patient drive so that there is an unaltered backup.   Then work from that clone on a functioning computer to recover the data.  For instructions on cloning the drive see the ddrescue page linked in the sidebar.After you have a clone Id suggest scanning it with better data recovery software like ReclaiMe or RStudio.  Both have free trials so you can see if your data is recoverable before you buy.Good luck!,datarecovery,dflx1jr,1,t5_2qpkw
