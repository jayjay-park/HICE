2317704,0,t3_2lu1od,I wanted to discuss idea  and . I personally love to try to get more discussion within the subreddit as I think ranime is a community driven place however as a person who is on new a lot I tend too see way to many things get shot down and downvoted to oblivion. Most of the post you see get downvoted before there even  mins old which to me seems unfair. If ranime is place driven towards discussion about anime I feel that there needs to be some silver lining that will atleast give new some more survivability. Now dont get me wrong there will be and usually some bad post that will warrant it to get downvoted however I do tend to see some good post get downvoted which in turn make ranime a place that is quite harsh for newer users to accommodate.,SEELE,cly6lh6,3,t5_2z0iv
2332406,0,t1_clzzwb3,Its a random thought but we could time it so I have a shadow account post it to the regular sub when the mods are usually gone for hours on end.It would blow up and it would be in a lot of peoples minds. Or it could be downvoted for being meta who knows.,SEELE,clzzyix,1,t5_2z0iv
2332604,0,t1_cm00t88,Good point actually. If we did get banned it might be more effective in making them realize how much of a mistake they were making.,SEELE,cm00u6f,2,t5_2z0iv
2362462,0,t1_cm3pjp5,Yeah that seems like a solid alternative to making it monthly,SEELE,cm3plfb,1,t5_2z0iv
