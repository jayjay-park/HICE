9023004,0,t3_52lcil,My IGN is Stormageddon Oath. In  years on Bryn the bulk of my experience consists of helping newbies and leading a FC that specializes in just that. When I joined Brynhildr it was the second smallest server in the game and I liked it that way TBH but continued to enjoy my home as it grew.From what Ive seen the biggest drive for people to help each other has been their serverpride which of course right now is at an all time low people arent even sure if they want to stay. This is an especially difficult issue because the game itself is hurting not just our server but many cant differentiate between the two not to say that our server doesnt have its problems. I have a lot of server pride myself and seeing the server start to go down this route doesnt scare me as long as guys like you and Masha etc. are still around. To me its just trimming the fat and allowing us to redefine Brynhildr as it picks itself up again. Continue encouraging cooperation and an improved atmosphere publicly. Keep helping other players to enjoy the game and dont be intimidated when you cant see the results of your efforts youll see it more later on down the road. New players and players looking for a change are going to read these and be inspired to join Bryn with these values in mind and never post here to let you know but a year from now youll start hearing stories from some greatsupportivefun players you meet in PF about how they read one of your posts and was determined hit  one day and do their part. This might sound farfetched but Im speaking from very similar experiences trust me. If you guys need some help in advertising your efforts or events feel free to drop a post on FFXIVRealm.coms Brynhildr section and Ill feature you on the front page over there Im GeekMatt. ,Brynhildr,d7wf9qh,1,t5_317oh
