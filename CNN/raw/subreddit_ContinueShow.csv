599439,0,t1_cg8bqjw,Nope my friend indemaPIMP recorded all the matches.  Im not sure how difficult it would be to get everyone in the tournament to commentate the video.  We do have some edits in the match though.  Like when Jerry the King Lawler mentions how a chair can cause permanent damage we put in a  TRUE FACT in the same way as Continue?.Or later Paul S. nails Paul R. midair in the nuts with a sledgehammer we made it a mini slowmo epic maneuver.  I dont really watch any of people that are in this tournament like he does. Im just helping him edit the videos since I have video editing knowledge and have a faster PCinternet.,ContinueShow,cg8ercj,3,t5_2vmpy
