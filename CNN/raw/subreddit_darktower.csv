4747455,0,t3_3fxekd,Two years out isnt bad especially for something as large of a project. What worries me is we dont have a named director potential cast writers or anything like that and they are giving a release date. Guessing that it takes about a year to get a director approved script and a cast. Then another year or so to film and produce Im not sure the quality of the movie. Ill have to wait and see who is doing what before I pass judgement. ,darktower,ctsymt6,3,t5_2sbdf

5946585,0,t1_cxz2vz3,Thats a really good point. Its been so long since Ive read the books. Is there any scene with Roland and Susanna where the difference in skin color comes into play that is super important to the development of the story?,darktower,cxz4lhz,2,t5_2sbdf
6606271,0,t1_d02iq7o,The actor who plays jake should have read the books so they know who jake is beyond a quick wiki description. If he does get the role please make him read the books before starting to shoot. ,darktower,d02n6lt,14,t5_2sbdf
6702448,0,t3_47fkpk,Looking at it this way will help cope. I think youre right  there is no way to please everyones expectations. There are even things i hope get edited out of the story anyway.Regardless of what they do Id like to approach this adaptation as a separate reimagining. Mabye the films will take out some of the more bloated or unnecessary parts of the story.,darktower,d0clafy,2,t5_2sbdf

6845003,0,t1_d0rev56,I like to think of myself as a realist not an optimist. I tried to use examples of were source material and adaptation were different but both still regarded as very good. GOT may not be a straight from page to screen faithful adaptation but its still regarded as one of the better shows on air right now. Even if it departs from the books and goes away from the story the quality of the show still exists.,darktower,d0s6r5j,2,t5_2sbdf

8148489,0,t3_4ma5tf,Its strange. No present time passes during Wizard and Glass just one measly night. Wolves is a long story that takes place over a very short period of time I think a few weeks or a month been a while. I really Liked Wolves because I always enjoyed that direction of this universe where several realities are clashing at once and no one is even sure which world theyre in. ,darktower,d4w3wuo,1,t5_2sbdf

9304299,0,t3_56avo1,If you do a search on the thread there have been many posts on the books that are related to the story and there are a lot of those books. Yes it is interesting to read the tie ins but it is far from necessary. If however you are dead set on reading some before you move on do a thread search. Safe travels. ,darktower,d8vdy8f,1,t5_2sbdf
