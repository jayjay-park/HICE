6036852,0,t3_3xw5oj,I have a few questions for clarification. When you are referencing    cuts are you stating that you have    versions of your doc? Or are you stating that you have  edit points within your project timeline of the doc? Im assuming its the latter but you could be ambitious and like to have lots of versions.. When you renamed all the clips and you look at the timeline... does each clip despite not having the correct number have the correct video content within the clip? Which I believe is your stated problem but I just want to clarify that you are in fact seeing the correct content in the clips with in accurate labels. Ive test this scenario albeit on a small scale and Ive found that FCPX is designed to change the name of the compound clips in all project timelines to correspond with any changes to names in the Library. When you changed the names in the library it should have changed the compound clip names in the project timeline. I would estimate that if this did not occur as you are suggesting then it may be an error with FCPX. Bummer dude. If by chance you didnt create  projects but instead are referencing  edits... then I suggest the following option. In the project timeline you can select a clip and then right click that clip. The very bottom option is reveal clip in library browser. The shortcut is ShiftF  this will show you the exact clip in and out points in the library. You can then drag that from the library browser which will have the correct number on it and hover it over the clip in the timeline. This will prompt a clip icon with a plus sign. Release the hold on the clip and it will prompt an options window with replace options. Select replace from start and it will replace the clip in the timeline that has the wrong number with the clip from the library in with the correct number. The best part is that it will basically be replacing the clip at the same in and out points that you edited before just as youve requested. However this is a tedious approach even if youre only doing  edit points...and its especially tedious if youre doing  edit points for  project versions. The quick fix may be trashing the FCPX preference files. The links below will help you. Scroll down on the Apple page... its towards the bottom. It has step by step instructions and the Larry Jordan link has a video.Good Luck!,fcpx,cyay0k4,1,t5_2slnk
8362282,0,t3_4u3fw0,I do the dummy share to youtube directly from FCPX menu item and the results are very good though Youtube always complains my upload could have been optimized better. I think it asks for a streamingoptimized source format.  That doesnt bug me too much as youtube doesnt take that long to process once the file is done uploading.,fcpx,d5mu541,1,t5_2slnk

9627552,0,t1_d9zit9w,Thanks for the input. I going over every clip doing it all over again it seems to be working. ,fcpx,d9zsl17,1,t5_2slnk
10641858,0,t3_5s7pu5,Look around. I know there are some stock VHS footage you can import and combine. There are a few procedural plugins that I know of but I think they are for for AE and Premiere Oh and Red Giants Universe has a VHS effect too.,fcpx,dddmjzw,1,t5_2slnk
10835341,0,t3_5smdyg,Im just starting out myself but i like the little glimpses into the trip.  Great job keeping my attention.  ,fcpx,ddxl7rd,2,t5_2slnk
11154192,0,t3_5z77nj,Move the whole project to a portable drive its the only realistic way. Ive done this a lot with FCPX its just simple amp easy.  Youll have to reconnect some clips but thats not really hard to do. ,fcpx,dewbdtu,2,t5_2slnk
