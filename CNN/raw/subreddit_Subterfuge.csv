5432554,0,t3_3pfpcw,Well specialists like the king queen and security chief can interact with shields and I only found this in the rules book An outpost may have weak shields maximum charge of  or strong shields maximum charge of .As far as I know theyre indeed random but I have very little game knowledge because I started a few days ago. Lets hope that someone more advanced will be able to help here. ,Subterfuge,cw62at9,2,t5_2s95f
5458909,0,t3_3pu27m,There is no speed stacking but like with any game the more actions you can do in a given time the better.Speed in this game is like card draw in games like Hearthstone or Magic. I started my st game w a smuggler and the ability to cross my area lightning fast was crucial I was able to move troops from one outpost to another base and to a defensible location faster than I would have been able to just move them from point A to B.Not to mention once he outlasts his usefulness he reduces the spawn time for all of your drillers at each factory so he is a HUGE late game boon too.,Subterfuge,cw9fe9s,1,t5_2s95f
5490556,0,t3_3qaiy5,bases are given either  or  shields when the map is generated. you can check the list of specialists to see which ones modify shields.AFAIK you can stack specialists to have lots of shields.,Subterfuge,cwdgx0c,3,t5_2s95f

5602092,0,t3_3rrpbt,I used a similar combo that would result in gaining troops from fleeing subs.Speed Helmsman Thief and War Hero.Speed lets you chase fleeing subs. Theif steals . Then the War Hero kills  which usually ends the battle. If not I also had a scientist restore  of loses.I was able to chase down  subs that way and had more troops at the end of it.,Subterfuge,cwrhrvh,1,t5_2s95f

5712034,0,t1_cx4zvy7,Hmmm but thats part of the game not waiting for the specialist you desire but learning to use the ones you are forced to choose. ,Subterfuge,cx54tnf,1,t5_2s95f
5718212,0,t3_3tfzwk,Before the match would start we would all talk to each other make sure we are pronouncing names correctly everyone understands the rules for videos etc. Then we play a regular game making your daily vlog of the game what your current strategy is who are your allies who are your enemies do you trust your allies etc.No one knows what your doing because you wont submit your vlogscommentaries until AFTER the game to keep it fair for everyone.,Subterfuge,cx5wf56,1,t5_2s95f
5901852,0,t3_3uvvfv,What do you think of revealing all of the chat logs to all of the players in the game after it is over? Much like how there is no more fog of war on the board there would be no fog of war about communication.this could also be a deterrent for multiboxingallied from previous gamesjoining with other friends and teaming up.,Subterfuge,cxt9lu4,1,t5_2s95f
5907505,0,t3_3w6lfx,I once had an ally do something similar to this for me. I was able to target his subs with my Pirate to travel x faster to my destination to eliminate an adversary queen in transit.

10833464,0,t1_ddxe4pw,What about the order of promoting the inspector or the smuggler? Both seem to give me a great global presence. Do they work well together or should I just use a smuggler and an inspector and keep boosting my shields around my map? Next hire I have a choice between intelligence officer martyr and infiltrator,Subterfuge,ddxe915,1,t5_2s95f
