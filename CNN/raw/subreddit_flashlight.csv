261469,0,t3_1x334q,but i feel the video quality is ruined by the bright hotspotIt seems you are running your light in a fairly high mode just to get a bright enough fill. The spot becomes way to bright and worse yet the beam is still not very wide.The TM will have a brighter fill simply because it is capable of producing so very much light. But the hot spot will be blindingly bright at those distances. The reflection from the hot spot might even cause the camera to underexpose the rest of the scene.EDIT In other words the TM will give you many more lumens. But your biggest problem in not lack of lumens. The lumens you have are too concentrated in the hot spot and the spill angle is too narrow. The TM will not likely improve either issue.,flashlight,cf7uzbg,3,t5_2qjmy

380308,0,t1_cfk3nvj,Ill add to the comment above. The EA is probably too bright with too much throw. Such a concentrated hotspot can be a problem when working up close. And the low of  lumens is indeed a bit high. I was surprised to find that I use settings of  lumens down to  lumens sometimes lt  lumen more than half of the time.Nitecore characterizes the EA as a searchlight  not something that was designed for use under a car or inside a tent.The beam characteristics of the EA are better suited for general use. Even that light is not really made for really close work but Nitecore has very good diffusers that are cheap and will give you a very nice diffuse beam when you need it.Eagletac makes a similar light that comes with a diffuser.  the XML version is probably best,flashlight,cfk6n79,1,t5_2qjmy

428364,0,t1_cfp5kdm,Its a great light but to be objective as possible and help you decide there are a few minor cons that I found. The UI is a bit confusing due to the number of modes. There is no memory so you have to click through the modes every time. It starts at the lowest lumen output so you arent likely to blind someone or fire off strobe accidentally or anything. You may see a memory mode mentioned in the instructions but that only applies to the xAA and CR versions.. Eagletac uses a stupid proprietary .mm hex bolt on the clip that is difficult to remove without stripping using a normal . hex wrench some people have jammed a th into it with better results as it is .mm.. Its fairly expensive for a small light but its well within your budget so I dont think thats an issue for you.,flashlight,cfp5yg0,2,t5_2qjmy

734959,0,t3_226rle,I think its simply called adjustable beam. But Id like to know why would you be interested in something like that. Is it something you really need? One of the few applications that would really benefit from it is diving and yes diving lights with adjustable beams do exist no matter what other people said in this thread. You can search brands such as BigBlue  and Hollis  There is a brand called EDIT which also made some models in the past but I am not sure of the state of the company or if it even is a company here is the website for australia  and the international? website which is not available for me However specifications for such distances as  meters are not realistic in my experience. Beside the hard number of lumens per watt per square inch I could hardly distinguish anything at that distance and is not a common occurence to find yourself in an area with  meters of unobstructed visibility in darkness.This might not be a popular opinion with flashlight aficionados but if you just need a poweful convenient and portable source of light and you remember fondly the simplicity and quality of Mag Lites Id suggest you get the Coleman CT   It will most likely be the best light you and your family have ever owned is made of solid machined aluminium waterproof takes either  or  AA batteries and emits more than enough light in either of its two power settings and while does not have an adjustable beam the beam was carefully designed to be quite practical and reach a long distance at the same time. You may even find it at your local Wal Mart or outdoor store. BTW I got mine for significantly less keep an eye on offers.,flashlight,cgnthg5,1,t5_2qjmy

908736,0,t1_ch78i7u,As far as throw I would say useful down to maybe half that.  Depends ALOT on the ambient lighting.  I have a SRT  which is cdm compared to the HCs cdm and I find in the city at the night its good for about  m.  Out the dark more youll get more range.  The throw is designed to be a light intensity at the range approximate to light from the moon.  So usually you want more on target.The HC will basically light up absolutely everything in your field of view for m or so but no really beyond.  If you need to see more downrange youll have to look at lights with higher cd ratingslonger throws.Illumination Supply has it for .

3185157,0,t1_cos4lhq,OPs comment that I cant see in the threadgtThanks for the reply! I already have a Nitecore i charger as I vape and Im definitely familiar with s. While indeed most of my work when inspecting will be done within ft Id like for enough light to surround the object Im looking at to provide a greater view of the crawlspace.gtLike instead of the light directly focused on the floor joist Im looking at I want it to also shine down on the ground all the way over to the nearest cinder block wall etc. Not for any particular reason other than its much more comforting working in an area you can actually see whats around you. A previous job of mine wed setup work lights in the crawl to work throughout the day. Thats not possible with this job as Id have multiple stops and time is pretty crucial.gtSo I guess overkill is sort of what Im looking for as I do have a Coast PX that I bought at Home Depot last year just to have a decent flash light. Im probably looking at a total of  or  hours of total run time throughout the day. Id really like the led to be a either white or blue not yellow. I hope this helps!gtEdit My Coast hadnt been performing as well as it once did. Started thinking about it and the obvious fault was the batteries. Just like vaping when your performance is starting to slack its due to the batteries. Feel completely dumb. Popped in some freshly charged eneloops and shes lighting up the entire back yard again.gtTho I will be getting the same Trustfire that mcfarlie says he has.

You could probably get what you want for a lot less money but Im gonna go ahead and recommend something awesome  how about the Thrunite TN  Its a light that offers a good balance of flood and throw which makes it great for something like checking out your big yardfields.  Max throw distance is about  meters well beyond your needs but at  total lumens output its really capable of flooding the area in front with light as well.  Most other lights that are capable of really long distances like this really focus their light and dont illuminate the area as well.This light like almost all good highpowered flashlights is powered by  rechargeable batteries.  Youd need three cells and a charger.  Id recommend these KeepPower cells and this Nitecore i chargerAll in Ive recommended about  worth of gear.  Add in shippingtaxes and Ive spent your whole budget but it would be an awesome setup.

4291887,0,t3_3a3b1i,The XML is a line of light emitting diodes from Cree. There is a newer version the XML which tends to be more efficient and capable of producing more light. As with other highperformance semiconductors like computer CPUs there is considerable variation in performance from one unit to the next. After manufacture LEDs are tested and sorted in to bins based on their performance. Higher bins produce more light from the same amount of electricity. Sometimes manufacturers of supercheap flashlights get the names wrong or mention only the bin and not the product line.Common bins for the XML and XML from less efficient to more efficient are T T T U and U. A U exists but is rare. At its rated maximum current of . Amps an XML T produces about  lumens. An XML U will produce about  lumens with the same current.LEDs are also binned by color spectrum both in terms of tint does it look more blue? more yellow? and color rendering index Cree uses a number and letter like C to refer to the tint bin. Lower numbers are more blue or cool  higher in color temperature. Higher numbers are more warm  lower in color temperature. An XML U A is therefore an emitter that produces about lm of cool white K or so light when driven at its rated maximum. Most flashlight manufacturers dont advertise the tint bin. They usually advertise cool neutral or warm and sometimes the color temperature.Better is a hard question to answer. Flashlight manufacturers that arent trying to rip off their customers use a variety of different emitters to accomplish different goals. The XML is very popular right now because it is the brightest and most efficient emitter can run on a single lithiumion battery and produce beam shapes that most people find useful with a reflector size and shape that fits comfortably in a pocket. Its also fairly inexpensive. If your goal is to illuminate things at extreme range the XML may not be the best emitter though some manufacturers have managed pretty good performance from them  the Luminus SBT seems to produce better results. On the other hand if youre trying to light up a large area youll do better with the Cree MTG or the new XHP. Unfortunately those require  Volts so youll need either a multicell light bulky or a boost driver inefficient and a lot of cells cant handle the load anyway. Just in case somebody comes along to mention the XPL  yes youre right but only because the XPL is an XML mounted on a smaller package  they perform the same.tldr  just get a Nitecore P P or P or a Zebralight SCw most people who have tried it think the neutral tint is worth more than a  difference in lumens or an Olight S or if youre on a budget a Convoy SS.,flashlight,cs9f0wm,5,t5_2qjmy

Since I didnt test the runtime this way  I cant say for sure if the runtimes are affected.  I might try and test it in a few weeks so I can know for sure.  I was a bit busy when I made the review and a long runtime test or two can add a single day or multiple days to my testing.

I did this to get some shots of a new Armytek Dobermann for another redditor but I included some of a Convoy and a Solarforce at the bottom.The Convoy has an OP reflector that is in no way optimized for the XPL HI emitter and the spacerinsulator isnt quite right. In spite of that and in spite of its wider spill  it does well against the Dobermann at that distance.Here is another shot of the Convoy M.I used the Solarforce to demonstrate a triple because it has an XPG dropin. My S has the triple Nichia. I love the triple Nichia but I wanted the brighter XPG on that day.That image doesnt reveal the beam profile of the BICOM triple TIR  which I think is a good alternative to the Carclo lenses.

With a directdrive light the batterys internal resistance factors in to how much voltage the circuit gets which determines how many amps the emitter can consume and thus how much light it produces.

All of the tints are nice the cool white A is not really cool white. More of a pure white than cool if I had to pick a number it would be under k. The eagle eye X is also a good recommendation. Its almost a do all light has a wider hotspot than the C and spill is on par if not slightly wider and brighter. I have all of these lights mentioned and my regular use lights are a BLF A D or A and my hot rodded X. The A lives in my left jacket pocket and the X in my right.

6001571,0,t3_3xnytk,I only use adhesive when there is a risk that the assembly process will turn the emitter board and potentially cut the emitter wires. A P can do that. I wouldnt glue any of my other lights including Convoy S series M and C hosts.The other reason to glue an emitter board is if there is nothing else that will hold the board firmly to the shelfpill. Much of the time the reflector is pressed down onto the emitter board which will hold it down. However there are flashlights where the reflector is held in place by the structure of the head and it doesnt press against the emitter board. In that case the emitter board should be screwed down or glued down.What kind of host will this be?,flashlight,cy6c48y,3,t5_2qjmy

From the Wikipedia page for efficacygtLuminous efficacy of radiation measures the fraction of electromagnetic power which is useful for lighting.A quote directly from the articlegtIn their system the desired visible wavelengths pass right through the material and on out of the bulb but the infrared wavelengths get reflected as if from a mirror. They then travel back to the filament adding more heat that then gets converted to more light. Since only the visible ever gets out the heat just keeps bouncing back in toward the filament until it finally ends up as visible light.They are not increasing efficiency because they are generating the same fractional amounts of heat and light as they were before they are increasing the efficacy because they are using the nonvisible light to create more visible light.

At first I felt bad taking such a nice light as compensation but  stacked  chips four reflow attempts and a ruined XML later Ive decided it was fair.Of course I cant leave a perfectly good light alone and my love of the C is well known by now. I had to do it. Turns out that too was a lot of work.The bezel is held in place with loctite but my strap wrench made short work of that. The MCPCB is oddly shaped and the contacts are both on one side. The leads are short too and the driver is glued in making its removal risky. I extended one of the leads and added my own insulation over the solder joint then cut the side off a mm Noctigon to make it fit. I didnt get pictures. Sorry. No Im not taking it apart again.Getting the emitter centered was hard. I tried butterfly spacers no spacers and an XMXP adapter but ended up just using the original XML centering ring. It got a little beat up in the process and it makes the centering look a bit off but its pretty close to ideal. At least its good enough for cd m FL.

6781569,0,t3_48my38,OK so when I see this I feel compelled to say flashlights are great for situational awareness which is the most important aspect to self defense out there. They are not great perhaps even bad as devices to be used in engaging a threat physically. If you want a contact weapon get an actual baton or pepper spray.Avoid Deescalate Run Fight.Flashlights are useful up to Run. I do not see them as an item that could be used as a defensive weapon. I do however see them as a defensive tool that can greatly improve your effectiveness in avoiding deescalating or running from a threat. NOW I think you understand that as you eluded to in your OP. I personally would like a light with  lumens or more and a fast strobe that can be accessed through a single command even if its triple or double click . Realistically lumens is probably enough but  is where you really start to throw around some pain. Like anything the most important X is the one you have on you so you want to pick something you want to and can comfortably carry. Beyond that it should be reliable and well made so you trust it.Zebralights SC really fits the bill here perfectly. Its very small very bright quick access to strobe and I trust it as a tool. In addition it has a plethora of outputs available and excellent low options which is probably what  of my use of the light resides at  lumen or less. Eagletac lights are also good for this as most can be set to modes where a double click triggers a strobe and I have found that their strobes are for whatever reason insanely disorienting. Maybe not significantly. Im droning on. Get an EDC light that works for you whatever it is. Basically if it has  lumens and a fast strobe you are GTG but beyond that and selecting something specific things like switch format UI throw v flood and price will have a bigger factor in determining whether or not you like carrying it everyday.,flashlight,d0kz4y0,2,t5_2qjmy

Always use proven EAGTAC batteries for best performance and reliability.gtAll EAGTAC flashlights are designed to use buttontop battery battery with protruding positive terminal. For rechargeable liion battery use only EAGTAC liion battery or other protected liion battery with compatible length and diameter. Before using the battery check and ensure the battery outer wrapping the isolating plastic film that wraps around the metal housing of the battery is complete. Broken battery wrapping may lead to short circuit and damage to the flashlight.gtLithium and Liion battery can explode or cause burns if disassembled shorted or exposed to high temperature. Do not mix new and used batteries. Do not mix batteries with different brand capacity voltage or install batteries backwards.gtNiMH rechargeable battery may release gas during discharge.

The PD has more candela for longer throw than most lights in its class and therefore may not be what you want.Id lean toward an Armytek Partner C for this application. The TIR optic produces a large hotspot that isnt very blinding when its not being shined in to your eyes and when the head is tightened fully operates as a singlemode light which is more foolproof in an emergency situation. The warm white tint is a little less painful than the cool white of most LEDs to a darkadapted eye in my opinion.Id also take a Thrunite TN in neutral white over a PD Tac. The modes are better.

7043155,0,t1_d1ei9fa,When throw is important an XPL HI would of course be a better choice. However I carry a triple specifically for the very floody beam it produces.Triples have some advantages over a single emitter. LEDs are more efficient at lower currents so by dividing the current three ways each emitter is operating more efficiently. Depending on the specifics the increase in efficiency might not be dramatic but it does exist. What is more significant is that XPL XML and especially XPG S emitters have a fairly high forward voltage Vf. That means that typical drivers fall out of regulation and output diminishes as the battery voltage sags. The voltage drop across an LED is dependent on current. The lower current through each LED of a triple means a lower Vf so a triple will stay in regulation longer than a single LED for a given total current.,flashlight,d1ep63h,2,t5_2qjmy

7523366,0,t3_4idcrm,Right so based off your any headway comment Ill try to give my  cents. First option would be a small mm light. But that could still be too bright and it probably doesnt look much like daddys light. First thing that came to mind for some reason is the streamlight nano. Its  lumens though Im not sure if its too bright. And its really small dunno if thats what youre looking for. Another option would be to modify an existing light. You could add a resistor in series with the LED which would drop the voltage a bit and in turn decrease the current that the LED wants to pull if youve got a flashlight with no constant current circuit but constant voltagedirect drive. But that would require some modest soldering skills and a bit of calculatingtrial and error. As for the current you should be aiming for in a moonlight mode I cant tell you for sure exactly it would depend on the LED as well I think. But a little test with my current source tells me youre in the range of . mA. In the case of the xml t I tried it with thats . volt. .v will give you mA already. Ill see if I can find some AA or AAA powered lights that would fit the description. ,flashlight,d2xdbd2,2,t5_2qjmy

I wasnt clear I mean to say that it stopped charging at mAh and when I went to check its total charge in my VC it read out as only  done meaning that it stopped short of offering it a full charge which kinda makes the whole mAh readout useless.gt Refresh mode might also be supposed to leave the cell depleted Yeah I got the distinct impression it would discharge and charge  times in succession maybe the manual is to blame for the mixupgt Furthermore some data logging would be a great addition to this unit  those two mentioned cycles could finish with a charge and still report the depletion mAh and be useful.Couldnt agree more.

Convoy makes a nice little C flashlight that you can get for around  or less including seperate battery and charger.  And its a respected brand in the flashlight or flashaholic community.  I really like the C form factor because its relatively small puts out a lot of light and you can get a good quality one for a reasonable price.  The Convoy C has an aluminum reflector and glass lens  which is a big step up from plastic.  Mountain Electronics sells and ships them from the U.S. which will cost a little more but youll get it faster.  You can get them cheaper directly from China but you will have to wait longer to get it.Good Luck.,flashlight,d4dr1nx,1,t5_2qjmy

8009392,0,t1_d4gb8au,This protrudes out though correct? Im thinking that its its making contact with the battery in addition to the spring which because of that its bypassing the clicky switch. Unless youre ok with using the HG batteries in going to suggest getting these LG MJ which make sure you select the buttontop option. I figured Id recommend the battery since its probably cheaper than the Nitecore batteries that you bought. Nitecore is typically overpriced vs others. Sorry youre going through all of this trouble with your light. This is the first time Ive ever heard of a protected buttontop battery having issues in an Eagletac light and Ive been stalking this subreddit for over  years now. Youll just have to save that Nitecore for a future light as long as its not a Zebralight since theyre picky as well. ,flashlight,d4gbx5y,2,t5_2qjmy

8274372,0,t3_4ss6bc,Three AAA batteries is not exactly a good choice.  They need to be balanced and the cheap NiMH chargers that people pick up at walmart are typically a x charger that can only charge in pairs.  Sometimes with a timer instead of dv termination.Result one of the three will be charged with twice as much current as is good for it.  Do try to make it use   or  cells.  xAAA has basically the same energy capacity as xAA.  Smaller and easier to work with too.  The only reason places make xAAA is when they are too cheap to get a  driver.Try mntelectonics US fast shipping or fasttech for parts.  The Nanjg  boost driver is good for  or  cells.

Then each person has an armytek wizard pro xhp  warm N.B.  lumens will go down to  or  because even though the led and circuitry is very efficient by flashlight standards theres a limit to how much heat a light that size can dissipate without getting hot enough to fry the electronics and the user. If everyone has a few ncrga batteries that should get them through the day then have a load of chargers for when you turn on the generator for afew hours. Alternatively you can get standalone worklamps that have a battery pack that will last the day but these need to be charged at night as well.

8506773,0,t3_4w8f83,First things first  WOW this thing has some really nice throw for its size! Im not sure what I was expecting but I can easily light up all the trees and buildings in my complex from off my balcony. Ill have to take it out to the trailfield nearby to see the full extent but Im seriously impressed. I havent tested the amp draw on FET but it should be around .A on the Q.Its smaller and lighter than I expected as well...not an EDC per se but it can and will fit in your pocket in a pinch. The build quality is great...no anodizing blemishes the matte black is quite nice and the square cut threads are smooth.The tint from the A XPL HI is superb and I have no regrets going with it. Its similar to my SCS XHP HI but the difference here is that its gives off a rosy tint against a white surface than the ZL is the ZL is more pure of a white to my eyes. My crappy photos probably dont capture this well but this is the impression I get.The HF? Ive only just charged the Qs up so I havent had a whole lot of time to mess with the lucidrv firmware yet. I just wanted to get some photos up first so expect an update here when I get around to it.Edit Finished messing with the driver. Wow...so much freedom. It was a bit tedious but worth the effort. I can set the mode spacing any way id like  linearramping steps to choose from! Up to  modes can be selected per group you can add and remove modes at will I used all  for funzies. Additionally It has  different channels for  different userassignable mode groups...cool stuff! Heres how I have it set currently I set one channels mode group to nonmemory with  modes  the first  are moonlight  mA for efficiency it only uses  x  with the last mode set to full regulated  x  blast. A double click from any mode or clicked on the immediately half pressed takes me to fullon FETDD turbo mode  really cool! This my indoor mode. With the memory turned off it always turns on the first mode moonlight. Speaking of moonlight...is it really dim rivaling that of my ZL! Amazing. The second channel is setup similarly all  modes used again but regulated max is th and FETDD in the final mode. Memory in on in this mode and the double tap goes to a maximum brightness fast strobe. I call this my outdoor mode. Also each individual mode programmed anywhere can be set to constant brightness fast strobe beacon slow signaling strobe or bike mode a doublepulse that oscillates  how cool is that? Theres a short cycle memory that remembers the last mode you turned off with but skips any modes higher in the group effectively hiding any higher modes you might now want all the time. The PID target temp is also customizable between a C and C range with C steps. I currently have it set to C I believe stock is C. The thermal regulation is seamless with no harsh step downs just smooth ramping...just like a ZL! Seriously impressive!Im considering dropping one in my Manker E once it gets here...Lastly shout out to udjburkes for doing this build for me! He did great work! I was going to build this one myself but I dont have the supplies soldering iron etc at my place right now and I couldnt wait P. Im planning on remedying that soon and giving it a go so this one will make a great template for me!

8550468,0,t1_d69z5b8,I wonder if the fourth emitter really makes that much difference. It will only lower the forward voltage by a little bit and the overall efficiency a little bit which I think are the two reasons it would be brighter. The triple B lights Ive seen are pretty wonderful.Richards S Triple has a B option. They arent as inexpensive as some but the HF driver looks like a fantastic option. Id contact him and see if the K B emitters he just acquired are an option.My protected NCRGA cells are a tight fit lengthwise in an S with driver with a stiff spring like a qlite. However they fit pretty well with driver with a brass button and according to the HF product page the HF is compatibleavailable with a brass button.TLDR  A triple K B Convoy S with the HF driver with a brass button and your choice of Carclo optics. The fact that the optics come in a variety of beam profiles is also a plus. They are inexpensive and easy to swap in an S host  so you could try them all.EDIT my mAh Eagletac cells are a little shorter and narrower than those GA cells but they do cost more and have less kick in a direct drive light.,flashlight,d6adpxa,3,t5_2qjmy

Im afraid it might make it explode or get so hot it cant be held but figured I would ask Not on those specifically but I have a much crazier light that will melt the spring if not bypassed.It will not explode. It probably will get uncomfortably hot to hold in your hand if you run it constantly on the highest mode. How to respond to that situation is left as an exercise for the reader.gt Whats a good  battery?Did you mean  or ? If youre trying for the maximum output this being a directdrive light benefits from a highdrain unprotected . With the spring bypassed a battery like the LG HG or Samsung Q will be visibly brighter than any of the  mAh protected cells.The AW IMR s are pretty good for s. Note that the review says AWs from China are all counterfeit. This Keeppower IMR is also not bad and its available from Illumn a dealer we trust here. Id be hesitant to buy batteries from Banggood. These wont provide as much brightness as s and the runtime is much shorter. Nitecore batteries are OK in that theyre typically based on the same highquality cells as any of the batteries that test well but theyre always badly overpriced.

Why do you prefer usb recharging over a external charger?The thrunite tc is probably the best option if you ask me but it is slightly in the throwy side of things. Take the neutral white version.I dont like any of your options too much. The mhgt is a VERY throwy light. the klarus xtgt and the tkr are just slightly less throwy. The sd mini lowest mode is  lumens which I consider FAR too bright. The uc has a good mix of throw and flood but the lowest mode is slightly too bright for my liking at  lumens and the mode changes are a bit abrupt.

9492369,0,t1_d9ii61i,Thats a good question. I think the possibility exists but there will be some difficulties. According someone on BLF Armytek has confirmed that the bezel is press fit. Here is a video of someone removing a press fit bezel from an Olight SA. Ive also seen someone remove a press fit bezel from an Zebralight handheld. The nature of their construction made those two tasks somewhat easier than I imagine it will be to remove the Wizards bezel. The Wizards bezel is very thickdeep and might be tighter for that reason.  It believe it is easier to remove the Olight and ZL bezels without marring the surface of the light due to their construction. In spite of all that I might be tempted to give it a go... Once the bezel and optic are removed it shouldnt be too hard to remove the MCPCB with the emitter. If it is a standard size MCPCB then the rest is easy. If the size of the MCPCB is close enough to the typical MCPCB then it might be possible to file a replacement MCPCB to fit which is what I did with my old Partners. If there is no way to fit an replacement MCPCB the you would need to reflow an emitter onto the existing MCPCB  which is not as hard as it might seem  but it does require some care and planning. A little practice might be in order. More about that later if its relevant.,flashlight,d9j4yml,2,t5_2qjmy

T which is an AA light is in my opinion a bit big for an AA light.The tint is absolutely lovely a bit warmer than T neutral white or should I say more neutral. If I shine it at the ceiling in the bathroom in turbo it feels like everything is exactly the color it should be.I already programmed it to default to .lm lm and  lumens since I prefer lower output higher runtime. I dont really see myself using turbo much anyway.

Do quite a bit of night hiking ruins exploration midnight sailing etc. I like to have a light that I can see the top of another mounting from the one that Im standing on. I would stick with the P then. They do offer a Neutral White tint version if youre interested in something less blueish. The PGT is great for the improved throw. I have the Acebeam EC and prefer it over the P. Better modes lower moonlight mode more throw and better tint assuming you get the XPL HI NW version. Plus the Military Green body is awesome.

If you are going to keep using the heavy lead batteries you might have to mount the ballast outside of the light. I have factory HID spotlights like that and the wiring and battery are pretty much the same. If you are planning on buying a cheap HID kit you should be prepared for blue light and very long warm up times. The output isnt great either. I wouldnt really bother doing this unless you already have the parts for it. The larger old ballasts you can salvage from cars are much better than the ebay crap.

11150133,0,t3_5z1uue,So to offer a dissenting opinion I would also tell you to consider a Sevens Preon P I know its more expensive than the Thrunite. I know its specs are worse.... on paper. I think Sevens is more realistic about output. I have a current gen P preon and the Thrunite and side by side they are nearly identical in light provided. Runtimes are about the same in real life use. The preon does eat a BIT more battery but it also has a slightly nicer hot spot which is half of why I want the pen light. It also has those nice machined ridges which are insanely nice if you actually are trying to hold on to the dumb fucker in anything but the most controlled of conditions. It is worth the  to me to not have to try and hold on to the smooth surface of the Thrunite so the preon gets carried more. I have a previous generation in titanium that I let my buddy have because I like the ridges so much more even though it doesnt match.  Things like the programable interface in the preon and the ability to make it a single AAA light are nice but not huge selling points IMHO. ,flashlight,devut6t,2,t5_2qjmy

11202652,0,t3_5zwhw8,Headlamps headlamps headlamps.  Headlamps?  Headlamps!There are two main holdouts for bulbs.  First is for tight throwy beams.  An incan bulb is easier to focus and the warm white tint is better at cutting through dust.  The second is for medical use  incans are high CRI by default.  The last few years have changed this.  Now LEDs are available in every tint imaginable including some that look identical to incans.  Or sunlight even better.Neutral whites and high CRI are worth understanding.  If you want a tactical spin it will make it easier to identify what you are looking at and easier means faster.When talking about batteries a big thing is how often they need to be checkedchargedreplaced to ensure the equipment will be ready to go.  Alkalines monthly.  LSD NiMH yearly.  Liion yearly.  Lithium primary five years.

TMT PLX  not wellknown in the flashlight community but a Cree XPE with unspecified tint is not an LED Id want to buy today Thrunite TiT NW  the highest output of these on high the lowest output on low and made of titanium. The tint and color reproduction wont be as nice as the Nichias. I love my TiT after putting a Nichia in it but it was acceptable with the stock LED. Nitecore MTMD  similar to the Lumintop but starts on low instead of medium. The low mode is higher than Id likeIf I was going to buy one of these and use it as it came it would probably be the Lumintop. Of course Im not in the habit of leaving well enough alone so Id get the Thrunite and put a Nichia C in it.,flashlight,dfmo1gc,6,t5_2qjmy

11448514,0,t3_63fa5q,Keeping in mind that I dont know squat about photometry or spectroscopy or whatever else is relevant Ive made the following attempt at translating. Nichias before the C didnt look enough like sunlight too rosy or too greenishbluish. The blackbody radiation curve is the black line on the color temperature graph and describes the spectra emitted by a heated ideal black body which is a fancy way of saying that it absorbs all light that hits it. Rosy falls below the curve blueishgreenish falls above the curve and sunlight falls pretty much right on the curve at whatever temperature the sun is.. I dont have a clear understanding of what steps are in relation to MacAdam Ellipses but its fairly clear that theyre a measure of how much tint varies. An emitter with a Step MacAdam Ellipse thus tends to have a smaller variation in tint than one with a Step MacAdams Ellipse but it looks like the nstep ellipse statistic isnt as useful as the MacAdams Ellipse itself. Im guessing that this means that the Nichias on the blackbody curve are too variable in tint for Zebralights taste.tldrThe older Nichias werent sunlightlike enough too rosycreamygreenetc and the newer ones that are  have too much tint variation.,flashlight,dftogsi,9,t5_2qjmy

11457353,0,t1_dfunq0z,I didnt see anything on forums but did find someone on Amazon. gt  There is a rechargeable that is safe to use with these lights. You can also use these batteries with Surefire lights. Amazon sells them. Here is a link.gt K Energy LFPA Rechargeable Li Ion .V Battery Replaces CRA  Singlegt These batteries are fully charged at .v. They can be used safely to .v. They have a nominal capacity of mAh. The chemistry is Lithium Iron Phosphate or LiFePO. They maintain a steady .v. This means your light will maintain a high level of light output. If using the light for a long time the microprocessor may stage down the light output because of thermal regulation but not due to the voltage dropping. .v is maintained for more than  of the charge cycle. Once the light enters low mode turn the light off and charge them up. Simple. Over discharging can damage them. The runtimes are decent in the Streamlights I own. Protac L ProTac LAA. I also use this in a Gen  Surefire Fury  lumens. no runtime test yet conducted on the Surefire with these batteries It saves money in the long run and the fact that you can charge them up at any time means you will not have to guess how much power is in your light. When you turn on your light youre getting max output sustained. One battery charges in  min and  batteries charge in  minutes. Those charge times reflect .v up to full at .v. I use the charger that came with the batteries made by the same company. There is a picture in the link above. You can charge these batteries ONLY in a charger that specifically states it can charge LiFePO batteries! Here is another examplegt XTAR VP Independent Channel Battery Charger w Dual Voltage Display USB Power Bank for  and similar Lithium Ion and LiFePO Cells Simple Kit  no Car Charger included AC adapter onlygt Do not charge above C. The capacity is mAh so charge at NO MORE THAN mA or .A. Really mA .A to mA .A is safe and still fast. Keep a spare set with you and be ready. Most chargers come with or offer a car adapter to charge on the go.Here is a link to some runtime graphs including with lifepo for another  AA streamlight. You can try asking Streamlight.

They limit current based on how many chips there are with the highest configuration being .A with  chips.A single C on a FET driver is iffy. You can do it but it should probably have thin leads from the driver to the emitter and maybe not use a highdrain .Triple and quad Cs with a FET are more a risk for burning the users hand though oddly enough I did just burn the domes on two Cs in a triple today. I think the problem was that the domes had too many scratches in them which absorb rather than transmit the light turning it to heat.

11677570,0,t1_dgjnd6v,If I had to guess Id say its because flashlights arent nearly as demanding as electronic cigarettes are. The chances of a cell venting are much lower.

11678765,0,t1_dgjmtql,Is the rifle a true short barrel?  Shorter than  and registered with the NFA?  On turbo the XPH probably gets too hot and thermal management kicks in to try and lower it and the light output.  On a gun you probably want instant access to the mode you like.  You probably dont want instant access to a mode that throttles all over the place.  I was just looking at the manual The flashlight can quickly heat up in Turbo mode. When the temperature becomes C  thebrightness decreases by small steps. After coolingdown provided that battery voltage is sufficient the brightness increases to theTurbo mode again. This stepping goes cyclically to maintain the users safety and the flashlights functionalityBut in the UI you can pick either turbo  or turbo  to use.
