5440891,0,t3_3omoyz,I got udev rules to work in Trisquel Linux which is a Debian gt Ubuntu derivative by reading the Debian wiki so this should help you too. etcudevrules.dmooltipass.rules    SUBSYSTEMusb ATTRSproductMooltipass ATTRSidVendord ATTRSidProducta MODE GROUPplugdevThe above rule might not work for your system. I figured out what the correct matches would be for my device on my system by plugging in my Mooltipass and executing the following     sudo udevadm info namedevusbhiddev attributewalkThere will be several sections of output produced by the above command. Find the interesting section by looking for a line that references Mooltipass i.e. ATTRSproductMooltipass. Remove any matches that dont make sense on your system and replace them with attributes which do.Dont forget to restart your scripts after updating the .rules file before unplugging and reconnecting your Mooltipass     sudo udevadm control reloadrules,mooltipass,cw74kse,1,t5_368l4
