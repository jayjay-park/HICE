6379833,0,t3_431vt1,This was so good. I loved every story even the silly ones. Mignolaverse!Conan more fleshing out of the new agent Xiang from  and teenage Liz was adorable. And then the LoJo endpiece was hilarious. I hope we see more of these Mignolaverse anthologies in the future.,Mignolaverse,czethdg,3,t5_39nr9
7965203,0,t1_d4b56np,There are no plans yet but thats because those stories are still being told. When they are completely finished the intention is to collect them in omnibuses if that format is still viable.,Mignolaverse,d4bd4wd,2,t5_39nr9
8835813,0,t1_d79gv5d,Its about as close as you can get to owning an original page without actually owning one. They are printed  scale so its a very large book and you can see all the intimate details in the pencils and inks.The Amazing Screwon Head and Other Stories is a very short book so theres a few additional stories and lots of Mignolas cover work.CONTENTS The Amazing Screwon Head  Abu Gung and the Beanstalk The Magician and the Snake  The Witch and Her Soul The Prisoner of Mars In the Chapel of Curious Objects The Exorcist of Vorsk The Goon  Mignolas pages only  Rusty Razorclam  Abu Gung and the Beanstalk Original Version EDIT Oh I should point out that stories that were digitally lettered wont have the lettering on the page. Ive put a check mark next to the lettered stories.,Mignolaverse,d79xv26,2,t5_39nr9
9343522,0,t1_d8zw3tw,Its gonna be really weird if another main character dies at the end of this.  Part  will just be some random soldiers constantly getting stepped on as the Ogdru Jahad roams around the planet doing...dragon stuff...Maybe it will be the end of humanity and the book will focus on the future world and what these monsters actually want to do aside from be spooky and wreck things up since its supposed to be a new age and all.,Mignolaverse,d90cwo2,2,t5_39nr9
11483605,0,t3_63x1w9,I assume you mean the prose book? No you dont need to read that first. The comics do a good job of rehashing the whole story so you could read the comics and never need to read the prose book. I loved the prose book though so Im definitely not advocating to skip it. ,Mignolaverse,dfxnxvn,6,t5_39nr9
