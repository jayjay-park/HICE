I knew a few people who tried to learn while getting to class and it was embarrassing for everyone involved.  I ended up teachng my roommate and wed go cruise together. It was about a month or so before he was comfortable taking it to class.  You wouldnt drive around campus without knowing how to drive right?  Know how to footbrake and how to run off.  Get the board into your hands without awkwardly bending over and fondling it. IMO uccs is a fantastic long boarding campus.  Some hills are easy some more challenging. Scout it out and ride it when there are no people so you know its within your limits and dont be afraid to carry your board partway down the hill.  Just know what youre doing before the first day of class or you could get hurt or hit someone.  As far as biking goes its easier to do right of the bat but less efficient on such a hilly campus with stairs.,UCCS,csxrk9t,1,t5_2st9k
