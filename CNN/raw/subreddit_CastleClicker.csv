6869789,0,t3_49t5q0,You may need to build up to it first.  For instance to build an airship you have to build all other ships first.  Blueprints just mean it wont be locked when you have all the other requirements built.,CastleClicker,d0v02op,2,t5_3bupu
7784771,0,t1_d3qk47h,While that is true the fact that you cant increase the amount of worker XP youre gaining per second would make worker XP useless at some point. Eventually youre not going to gain even one level a day when constantly using workers.,CastleClicker,d3r2ap5,1,t5_3bupu
9901220,0,t3_5h1xw5,Im trying to make the game simpler and more elegant.  With sheep regen you either didnt have nearly enough and it would take years to regen your sheep or it regenerated immediately which made it pointless.Im going to put out an update that shortens the regen time and give people an artifact if theyve harvested a billion sheep that will make regen time a couple minutes.I know why it is frustrating but I think in the long run it makes the game better.  The reason Im making changes now is because a lot fewer people are playing so might as well try something new P,CastleClicker,day5ha4,1,t5_3bupu

11558936,0,t3_64yzqq,Someone correct me if Im wrong but isnt that a math equation? You can only fit so many numbers on a mobile screen so it makes more sense to use that format. Its been years since I took a math class but if I recall correctly xe would be ? Its a lot easier to fit e on a screen than it is to fit a number that is  digits long.,CastleClicker,dg67k65,1,t5_3bupu
11724225,0,t3_6794xf,I see what youre saying.  Deciding how to do progress resets was really hard to do.  There is probably a better way to do them but Ill try and talk a little bit about why things are the way they are..  Its true that workers equalize after a progress reset.  The idea behind this is that it kind of rebalances the game.  If you have way too many levelups in one area or not enough you might have a more balanced game after a progress reset.  Also it hopefully makes all of your workers more powerful once you catch up to your previous progress.  You can still specialize in different workers after a progress reset..  Spending gems on levels helps you progress if you cant make progress you wont have the ability to progress reset..  All you should have to do is get back to your original progress and youll start leveling again.  Plus youll have more of a multiplier XP bonus so itll be easier to level overall.  I didnt want players to get dozens of levelups as soon as they reset.  Because going through the levelup process dozens of times in a row isnt that fun..  Yeah the idea is progress gets a bit harder and harder as you go.  I figured eventually people might collect a lot of reset stones and do a full reset since you keep those stones after a full reset and will get more if you keep getting ng.  I might look into changing this.The idea behind other resets in games like this Ad Cap Clicker Heroes etc is that you completely reset your game but can make a little more progress each time.  That doesnt really work too much in Castle Clicker but I tried to make something a little bit like it.  I know what your concerns are I kind of had the same ones when I released it.  Youre the first person to put it out there so thanks for that.  I dont really want to dump peoples strategies after a progress reset but I thought this did kind of help stuck people that are making no progress so that they can make the game easy again and hopefully make more progress than when they had before.,CastleClicker,dgoyz20,1,t5_3bupu
