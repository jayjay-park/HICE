11711399,0,t1_dgn6xqb,FWIW I think that reticle has the perspective to make the game more immersive. I actually tried to make T work for me in TSW for a while but could never get it to work quite right. Unfortunately these leaks have not given me much faith in Funcoms ability to make reticle targeting work and I wouldnt consider the system to qualify as action combat at any rate so plenty of newer players are likely to feel deceived by marketing.,TheSecretWorldLegends,dgnily3,3,t5_3jw4m
