2512777,0,t1_cmmjy9i,Im pretty much in the same boat. Sometimes the Guardian will make the right assignment and an amazing review will result John Gray and Pessoa Will Self and Borges Ursula Le Guin and anybody. But most of the time theyre just as group thinkey and reputation rubberstamping as the US press. The NYRB is still good but nowhere near as good as their archived materials. Sometimes the LA Review of Books is pretty good and they are willing to call foul on things like Sheila Heti or Knausgaard.,badliterature,cmmk46g,1,t5_2zbr6

5151450,0,t1_cv6xujk,Im partial to the latter my own personal thesis is that people use Knausgaard to justify their own nihilism or apathy. Life really is pointless and Knausgaard doesnt shy away from that. Hes popular among younger people too and I think its a general sign that young people today know that something is deeply wrong with society and the ways that they live but feel powerless and cynical about it. So they retreat to a literature that makes them feel better about their choice to forsake any kind of responsibility or freedom to take their own lives into their hands.,badliterature,cv6xy0w,1,t5_2zbr6

7058070,0,t1_d1gdnvl,gtI think most of them misunderstood the question?Yes youre correct its just that . Im being an ass..

Hence the Salon reference in the title.,badliterature,d2ficpc,5,t5_2zbr6
7570335,0,t1_d32orie,Oh yes definitely. Weve touched on this subject in some of our earlier conversations. By globalization I specifically refer to the postCold War era in which the entire world save a few pockets of weirdness like Kims Korea is stitched together in a time of relative peace to cooperate in an almost completely global economy. Thats not to say universality means equality and the uneven relationship between certain states in this global environment has been well documented. The colonial era of the long th century was very similar in a lot of respects.,badliterature,d32pktm,1,t5_2zbr6
7643528,0,t1_d3awzzq,gt would you take him seriously?I hope youre using the plural you to pose the question to the other guys and not the singular you to pose it directly to me because that question has also bothered me for a long time. Pierre Menard was such a mindfuck the first time I read it. Also I feel very dumb when I think about it because I feel that Borges is playing me like a fiddle and laughing at me from the grave. I think Ive made a strong connection between Pierre Menards Quixote and Marcel maybe the closest thing that we have to a real Pierre Menard Duchamps recontextualisation of the urinal into Fountain. I guess I would see Menards Quixote as a similar attack to the art establishment and would probably take it seriously as a statement... but only given that Borgess short story didnt exist in the world that a real Menard existed. If Dan Brown really pulls off a Menard and leaves the book as it is or ends up doing what ulestrigone says I would probably laugh my ass off but I wouldnt take him seriously. I dont know. Fucking Borges I love him.I just wanted to add that I feel that the horror and uneasiness in some of Borges stories is often massively overlooked. I think The Library of Babel which is kinda thematically similar to Pierre Menard is one of the most disturbing stories Ive ever read and the idea of the Library of Babel as a place is so maddeningly frightening that it makes Lovecrafts Rlyeh look like a childrens playground.,badliterature,d3b10f7,3,t5_2zbr6

7990078,0,t3_4odzht,What do you mean by dark? Like horrible events happening or everything in life is miserable?If you mean the latter Im always going to recommend Jean Rhyss Good Morning Midnight. Its a fairly slim text but its one that I recommend heavily because it has some of the best affective prose Ive read.Katherine Mansfields short stories can be miserable but otherwise excellent. You can find an edition fairly cheaply and I recommend her heavily if you want to read about colonial guilt in a New Zealand context. I am biased towards her because shes one of the subjects of my dissertation but that doesnt make her less lovely.Edna OBriens Country Girls Trilogy comprising of The Country Girls The Lonely GirlGirl with the Green Eyes Girls in their Married Bliss is a look at Irish women and their social standing within Ireland and in England. Its dark affecting and although the conclusion is unsatisfying and a bit retrograde the rest of the writing is utterly brilliant. You may need some context on Irish history but that should be fairly easily remedied. Check out R.F. Fosters Modern Ireland for a readable but thorough overview of Irish history.Don DeLillos Libra is an engrossing look at Lee Harvey Oswald constructing a narrative that both explains his actions and fails to adequately explain him. Its a novel that deals with the complications of history and conspiracy while also being a genuinely fun read. Its surprisingly light for a  page novel about political assassination.John McGaherns The Dark is an upsetting take on child abuse within the context of th century Ireland. Id recommend it if you can take physical violence against children if you cant you should stay away from it. But it is fantastic dealing with the sense of entrapment and inability to move forward while also dealing with how gender roles are reinforced in rural Ireland. Just a great novel.Once your done with these tryAnything by Samuel Beckett.Anything by Oscar Wilde.James Clarence Mangans Poems.Elizabeth Bowens The Last September.Pat Barkers Union Street.Toni Morrisons The Bluest Eye.Marilynne Robinsons Housekeeping.That should do you for a good while.,badliterature,d4e5t4e,1,t5_2zbr6
