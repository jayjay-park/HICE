252272,0,t1_cf6v64o,I understand your objection and without knowing the specifics of Lavabits encryption we must keep some of this more generic than might be useful but it seems to me that the government in this instance is requiring more than enough information to make decryption possible in a very reasonable amount of time. Certainly nowhere near   and likely not anywhere near  .Practical cryptography assumes that the attacker is after the plaintext but when that becomes a given and only a  or kb key needs to be revealed it changes quite a few underlying assumptions. Nonces for example are typically only  bits or so. Sometimes even sequential and known to the attacker. In the context of an unknown plaintext and key this provides ample entropy to make the ciphertext indistinguishable from a RNG. Given the plaintext however Im not so sure.The example I gave in which an attacker was allowed as many chosen text attacks as he wanted and the RNG key actually was reset at the beginning of each attack seems quite an appropriate model of what the government was demanding here. The decryption method would be known to the attacker and implemented on his machine for the attack and if it was necessary to try  nonces against a few hundred sets of plaintextciphertext sets or something in that order of complexity I just dont see that as a serious obstacle to obtaining a server key.I appreciate your time and attention to this though and despite the limitations imposed by our shared lack of knowledge about the specifics of Lavabits encryption if there is still something Im overlooking Id be interested in your thoughts on the subject.,worldpolitics,cf6whwg,1,t5_2qh9a

Ukraines Navy flagship the Hetman Sahaidachny is refusing orders from the interim government and is reportedly flying the Russian flag. With autonomous Crimeas parliament approving a referendum for secession and Russias parliament approving military action in the area the weekold Ukraine interim government is getting the sense that its maritime province is quickly slipping away. Thats got them riled up and threatening war. Thats the rhetoric the antiRussia protesters in Kiev want to hear but as a practical matter Ukraines military options are few to none with both the majority of Crimeans wanting secession and Russias much larger military willing to back them.Disclaimer this summary is not guaranteed to be accurate correct or even news.,worldpolitics,cfsdpzc,4,t5_2qh9a

Meanwhile Russias deputy foreign minister has held talks with Ukraines ambassador in Moscow. He confirmed Russia had contacts with Ukraines interim government but said Kiev was beholden to the radical right.

Not only dont they commit such heinous acts of evil like the US does on a regular basis they also dont terrorize torture and massmurder critics like the US does. The US sends drones to kill people overseas who make critical youtube videos of the US ffs. Who do you think the US are targeting in the drone terror strikes? The huge majority are simply civilians who are highly critical of Americas mass murderous foreign policy and wish to resist. gt Russias laws effectively make it illegal to be openly gay and gay people risk arrest and imprisonment if they publicly come out. Hate crimes against gays have skyrocketed since the law was implemented.The first claim is outright hyperbole. It is true though that Gays are treated slightly worse in Russie than in the US. But this can be easily counterbalanced by the fact that the Russie doesnt prop up the most misogynistic and homophobic regimes in the world in the mideast central asia and africa where being gay is an instant death sentence. Where do you think the Taliban comes from So Russie is better. gt lol what do you think would happen if there was an occupy movement in Russia? You think the NYPD tasing and pepper spraying people was bad look at the way Putin deals with his detractors.I dont think you can say that for certain.  There are many people who have protested Putins policies in Russia without being harmed. On the other hand the CIA NSA FBI and US Military are world leaders at terrorizing torturing bombing and murdering critics of the US government. If the occupy movement became a serious political force theyd terrorize torture and murder its members like they did all the other movements I mentioned previously. gt I said you are idealizing it claiming that the US is worse in terms of oppression shows how naive you are.This is the most easily defensible claim and you have to be a proamerican zealot to seriously object. Russia at worst does some shit things in its own countries and some of its neighbors. The US constantly terrorizes bombs and oppresses the entire world. As we speak the US is busy murdering torturing and  terrorizing poor peasants in numerous countries in Asia or Africa. gt Saying that the US is the chief bully on the planet is just ridiculous considering that Russia has just invaded their neighbor because they want to retain access to a seaport.The US has been terrorizing latin and south america for decades for far less ffs. Why do do you think they despise the US so much? Russias actions in Ukraine look angelic compared to Americas reign of terror in the Americas.gt Theres strong evidence to suggest that Putin is one of the leaders of the russian mafia the most brutal organized crime syndicate on the globe. They look like humanitarians compared to the American government its massmurderous military and it terrorist organs like the CIA and NSA. When it comes to international crime terrorism and mass murder the US is the indisputable number one in the history of the known universe.gtIf anyone is a global bully its China  no country has supported more genocidal regimes and the way they treat the tibetans is brutal.Nonsense. China hasnt invaded anybody in recent times nor does it have an army of drones torture camps and military bases it uses to terrorize poor people worldwide. The Tibetans have it far better than the Palestinians do under the Americas Israeli regime. They are rightful citizens of China and legally have the same rights as a Chinese person living in Beijing.  If the Chinese really wanted to descend to American levels of depravity they would totally ethnically cleanse Tibet destroy its entire cultural heritage and pave it over with a concrete military base like the US did in Deigo Garcia with the help of the British. The Chinese look enlightened compared to the US. I have visiting China several times and I would much rather live there than in the US.gt Brainwashed people like you are fooled into thinking that the US is the worst because its critics are the most vocal  when in actual fact the other global superpowers are worse they just dont tolerate criticism. This is where you are most brainwashed. Some of the other world powers at worst occasionally do some shitty things to their own people or to neighboring countries.

The Israeli actions are being removed from their context and reframed as a matter of control oppression occupation etc that is to say the cause is detached from the effect and thus removed from the moral evaluation of the whole phenomenon. It is necessary to do so to construct an argument that says these actions are immoral. When the causes the intentions and the law and the precedent are accounted for Israels actions suddenly appear to be justifiable and justified. Simply put terrorism coming from Gaza can not be permitted regardless of what Palestinians claim to be the justification of it and for this reason the border between Israel is Gaza is shut tight and only the most critical necessities humanitarian aid and sick people are allowed. Marathon running is neither. Gaza is not a part of Israel and Israel is well within its rights to restrict movement of persons through its border without needing to justify itself before anybody. It is not this control of the border that is a priori immoral the Palestinian terrorism is.

994827,0,t3_25i0hz,Youve somewhat answered your own question without realizing it but Israel doesnt have a right to nuclear weapons. It just has them. Israel has not signed the NPT so it has never signed a treaty that says it cant have nuclear weapons. Ditto India and Pakistan. Iran has signed the NPT and thus agreed that it cannot have nuclear weapons. The NPT says that if you sign it you agree that only five states in the world are allowed to have nuclear weapons US Russia China UK France and if you arent one of them then you wont develop them. If you arent down with that you dont sign the treaty. Many countries took their time in signing the treaty or deciding not to sign it because they werent comfortable with that restriction. Iran has reaffirmed many times that it is happy to have signed the treaty. If they desire Iran can withdraw from the treaty the NPT gives provisions for this as North Korea did. Such an act would have repercussions for sure but it would be legal. The only place that rights come up here is that the NPT says that any signatory has a right to access peaceful nonweapons nuclear technology. This is what Iran asserts when it says it has a right to anything nuclear.

1207384,1,t1_ci5e3t9,gtYeah but they cant legally replant the seeds.    Not unique to GM seeds these agreements exist with many conventional breeds. Here is the agreement for Clearfield seed by BASF.  Also GM crops have been shown in the past to be very beneficial to  farmers of virtually all economic levels.    From a study which analyzed available data form the Philippines.  Form their conclusion.    gtUsing farmlevel survey data from the Philippines and quantile regression techniques that control for selection problems we find that the effect Bt corn on yields is generally more strongly felt by producers at the lower end of the yield distribution. If we subscribe to the typical belief that loweryielding producers are mostly poor smallholders i.e. subsistence farmers then the results from our analysis provides some evidence that Bt corn technology has benefited poor corn farmers in the Philippines through higher relative yield effects as compared to the more commercial producers at the upper end of the yield distribution. It is likely that the proportionately higher yield effect observed for poor smallholders is made possible by the damage abating property being embedded within the Bt technology. This suggests that Bt technology does not require substantial levels of technical skills and learning for it to be an effective insect control technology i.e. as compared to say some Integrated Pest Management control practices that require seasonlong Farmer Field School training to effectively implement.      Also the net effect of Btcotton has mostly been favorable to farmers in India. . .     gt Bt cotton has reduced pesticide applications by  with the largest reductions of  occurring in the most toxic types of chemicals. Results of fixedeffects Poisson models confirm that Bt has notably reduced the incidence of acute pesticide poisoning among cotton growers. These effects have become more pronounced with increasing technology adoption rates. Bt cotton now helps to avoid several million cases of pesticide poisoning in India every year which also entails sizeable health cost savings.  And...     gtWe address this shortcoming byanalyzing economic impacts and impact dynamics of Bt cotton inIndia. Building on unique panel data collected between  and and controlling for nonrandom selection bias in technologyadoption we show that Bt has caused a  increase in cottonyield per acre through reduced pest damage and a  gain incotton profit among smallholders. These benefits are stable thereare even indications that they have increased over time. Wefurther show that Bt cotton adoption has raised consumptionexpenditures a common measure of household living standard by during the  period. We conclude that Bt cotton hascreated large and sustainable benefits which contribute to positive economic and social development in India.   Source    gtAccounting for possible selection bias we show that the Bt pesticide reducing effect has been sustainable. In spite of an increase in pesticide sprays against secondary pests total pesticide use has decreased significantly over time. Bt has also reduced pesticide applications by nonBt farmers. These results mitigate the concern that Bt technology would soon become obsolete in small farmer environments. The survey data on actual pesticide use in farmers fields complement previous entomological research.    Source      gtThis is not a unique phenomenon this actually happens and has lead to the suicides of thousands farmers in India.

1261765,0,t1_cib9ikg,Ok well lets go from the ground up with you.  When I say profits I mean economic profits.  Basically whether something is worth making or not.  Iron is useful.  Rust not so much.  Lets say that my factory was contacted to make thermite for a demolition.  Its a big order and outside our usual area of expertise so we bring in extra work and a thermite expert.  The hired laborers take our usual iron product grind tonnes of it off and expose it to oxidants to provide the necessary iron oxide.  Once thats done in order to save valuable iron I let these workers know that the factory has no use for them.  We will be producing no more thermite and so it is pointless for us to keep them on staff.It is a social GOOD to lay off these people.  To not lay off these people would have them destroying useful iron. This is a direct parallel to the statue earlier.  If people stop buying the statues its a waste of wood or plastic or whatever to make them.This is where my point about fully funded unemployment comes in   cyclical layoffs are necessary due to differences in labor demand.  It is better when labor is not being used for it to be returned to the labor reserve rather than sit idle.  Consequently the skillful unemployed are providing a useful service and should not be penalized by a reduced pay.This is my extreme socialism.  I believe in extremely strong unemployment benefits and social programs as well as state enterprise entry into necessity markets in order to block monopolies and to force proper competition.Just because I accept the limitations of our society doesnt make me any less socialist.  If you explained my views very few people would say hey that sounds like a reasonable policy lets vote for him.gtThe point of the analogy is to say that efficiency makes jobs obsolete. Im sorry but whats the point? It shows the value of laying off redundant workers even in a socialist system.You have to admit that there are methods of production that are frankly better and if so you also have to admit that not changing to them wastes human effort.  If you still deny this then you believe human effort is worthless.As I said above I believe that pleasure goods and services should be a capital market because it prevents career artists from doing solely what they want without respect to what the public wants.  Ive never seen good socially funded art  its either been the artist masturbating artistically or a dispassionate bureaucrats idea executed with the best skill the artist could.gt Does Pewdiepie really produce the best and most valuable content on YouTube?

1276919,0,t1_cibkgth,Define benefit. A wage? Just enough to keep you alive? Probably eating cheap processed canned food because you cant afford anything else? How is that any better that subsistence farming? The worker does the same amount of work maybe more because even with farming you can take a break after reaping the harvest but the end result is the same calories for survival.Will the worker one day be able to gather enough money to retire? Maybe. But then again wasnt the whole system supposed to benefit consumers? The idea is that free markets give people choice  that you can spend as much on what you want  but then again cheap goods arent very durable. A worker who cant afford to buy durable shoes could actually end up spending more money on shoes because he has to keep replacing them compared to the wealthier capitalist who can afford the best.How about upward mobility? Maybe if the worker works for a wage long enough he or she can afford to provide his or her kids with an education. But what then? If the kid is able to leverage that education into an office job then the kids just joined the middle class bourgeoisie. At the end of the day any real benefit you could gain from working labor can only be translated into lasting quality of life if you transition out of working labor in other words its temporary and meant to lead to something else. Far more often the system keeps entire households stuck living their lives as labourers buying shitty shoes that break and continuing to work low wage jobs even if they do get a state sponsored education because thats what theyve known their whole lives.Let me flip this around and put it this way. What benefit do YOU see in labor? Why dont you just quit whatever cushy job you have right now and go work for Qualcomm getting paid shit to put iPhones together? Oh right you wont even get qualified for that because only young  year old Chinese girls have the nimble dextrous fingers and sharp eyesight to do that task. What happens when after enough  hour days of that kind of work? Well their eyesight goes so theyre moved down the line to work with bigger pieces. What a benefit! What a promotion!If there really was some sort of benefit to working blue collar instead of working white collar then wed see more bankers quitting their jobs to become carpenters. We dont see that. Instead we see carpenters trading away their dignity to work as a glorified assistant for Donald Trump on a reality TV show.The only way for workers to receive a decent quality of life is to unionise it is completely within the interest of their employer to pay them as little as possible as every penny saved on the worker is another penny of profit. Unions have goals decidedly different from that of the employer. One could say that its confrontational even or perhaps a class struggle. Clearly you cant have both parties benefitting if theyre at odds with each other fundamentally right? This is not a winwin situation. If the workers get paid more the capitalist makes less. If the capitalist makes more the workers get paid less. Its that simple. Even if workers were getting paid well without the need for union demands at the end of the day this is a result of the employers largesse at least as long as youre in a capitalist system And if youre going to use that free market bullshit about how all transactions are voluntary let me remind you that that only works in a model of full employment. There is never full employment and actually high unemployment benefits capitalists Marx called the unemployed the reserve army of labor because if the current workers ever rebel the capitalists know they can always replace them with homeless people desperate for any kind of pay because theyre starving and dirty.So yeah if you want a system that benefits the starving homeless that is willing to work insane hours for a pittance because if they dont theyll die then go with capitalism.If you read the communist manifesto one of the first things Marx uses to evoke class struggle is to point out that class struggle has always existed. Freeman and slave patrician and plebeian lord and serf guildmaster and journeyman in a word oppressor and oppressed... etc. You dont need to make statements like X had to have been... when you could just refer straight to the source material. So what if industrialised society has given us more technology? Progress should be the standard. What however distinguishes the way we organise society between an agrarian society and an industrialised society? Industrialisation does not guarantee happiness and freedom  its not the same as democracy. You can just as well have an oppressive tyrannical totalitarian state in an industrialised society as you can in an agrarian one. In fact an industrialised state has the benefits of modern arms to project force modern media to spread propaganda and a dependence on a centralised state in order for it all to function. Meanwhile an agrarian society can be decentralised  actually one of the major reasons that Jefferson argued an agrarian society would be able to better preserve the founding fathers ideals in America.

Hamas doesnt give the slightest shit about civilians remember how they are still a terrorist group. Do you know that Hamas also fights from the shelters that Israel direct civilians towards? Hamas benefits from civilian casualties because the whole world is too shortsighted to see that Hamas are the ones who are putting the civilians in front of the dangerAlso youre right. The proHamas groups never say that Israel should just ignore it. They either completely avoid answering questions of what they should do or they just say that Israel shouldnt be there in the first place.And about their right to stop the rocket fire. People have died from the rocket fire Iron dome can only stop so many. Just because they have a  effective system of defending against the rockets that are specifically targeting civilians doesnt mean that they shouldnt be allowed to stop them which is what this is about not a land grab since Israel themselves gave away Gaza to Palestine.,worldpolitics,cje1m89,1,t5_2qh9a

1606791,0,t3_2code6,Without knowing all of the details of this specific situation all situations are different it seems to me that Catarina Martins is misunderstanding the alternatives here.Money has no inherent value. Or rather the value of money is tied to the willingness of economic actors to trade it for goods and services. This willingness is measured in prices.If a bank like Banco Esprito Santo was allowed to fail it would have had a great impact on the economy. What people dont realize is that a bank failure means the disappearance of the banks deposit guarantees. What does that mean? You might ask. Well you know how banks make money by loaning money? It turns out that they are allowed to take the money you have saved in the bank and loan a giant portion of it to people or companies. For example say that you have  in the bank. In the US banks are allowed to take up to  of those  and loan it out. And heres where it gets complex usually whomever asks for the loan spends the money and by spending the money the money ends up in the pockets of someone who then puts it back in the bank. So now the bank has that  in someone elses account and can take  and loan it out and repeat the whole process again.When a bank fails it admits the loans will not be repaid in the timeframe they expected. And so people with savings in the bank wont be able to take the money out of the bank. The bank then get liquidated which can be a messy long process and in the end savers can only get a small portion of whatever they put in. In countries where they have institutions like the USs FDIC the government insures a fraction of the deposits but not all of them. I believe the European Union requieres member nations to guarantee up to  of the first  Euros in deposit accounts per person.In other words when the choice is for the government to either spend the money covering the deposit guarantees destroying a bank impaling the financial system discouraging anyone from trading with your country in any way increasing prices for everything nationwide and making the entire country poorer immediately or for the government to purchase the bad debt and use its enormous power to negotiate with the people or companies who owe the money and recover most of it the government has to make a decision that will both cost the least amount of money to taxpayers and cause the least amount of pain to the public.And guess what? Sometimes a bank bailout is the option that costs less and causes the least amount of pain...Now having said the above of course bailing out the bank as an institution does not necessarily have to mean letting the bank executives get away with criminal behavior. After or during the bailout process Portugal is obligated to prosecute any wrongdoing that may have led to the crisis. Of course! This is obvious! It must happen! But this prosecuton is independent of the banks bailout decision and its effects and considerations on the economy.Not to mention the fact that should Portugal fail it would cause a strain on the Euro as a currency impacting the economies of all the countries that use the Euro including Germany the worlds th largest economy France the worlds th largest economy Italy the worlds th largest economy Spain the worlds th largest economy and many others. Counting all of it it would impact an economy bigger than the size of the United States causing a Global Recession at best or even a Global Depression. The last time we had a prolongued Global Depression it led to a World War.So of course finding ways to avoid a mess of that size is preferrable even if it means bailing out a bank than any other alternative. I just dont understand how people can think that any alternative is preferrable...,worldpolitics,cjhpcdc,3,t5_2qh9a

I support the right of any human to resist oppression violently if necessary.  gt First reported by Maariv then in English by inews thousands of terrorists were meant to cross over to Israel from Gaza through the tunnels and kill and kidnap as many Israelis as they could.I would take any information coming from Israel on this with a large grain of salt.  Just as Russia can be suspected of propaganda just as the US lied to the US citizens to go to war every nation state will cast an enemy as an imminent threat.  Israel to quote Chomsky has chosen expansion over security.  You dont get to claim self defense when you are the military occupier.   How do we know it wasnt a false flag? gt The original source for all those articles is statements made by Israel which I assume you would dismiss as lies. I will definitely take it with a large grain of salt.  I dont think thats even me being antiIsrael thats me exercising critical thinking and intellectual self defense.  Im sure you can agree.gt I dont really see who else is in a position to say what was found in the tunnels except for Israel though.Evidence?  Pictures reports anything.  Regardless Gaza and the West bank are open air prisons filled with humans who are watching their women and children die.  Would the Jews in Warsaw have done any less?gt Smuggling from Israel into Gaza is quite impossible. An attempt to use a tunnel with opening on the Israeli side for smuggling on a regular basis wouldve been detected by the IDF resulting in destruction of the tunnel.I havent been to Israel so I will have to defer to presumed greater knowledge but nothing is impossible.  In the US the mexican gangs often tunnel into a house or a warehouse and the tunnels get found but the effort is often worth it.  I assume there would be some concern for collateral damage from the IDF on Isreali soil but perhaps not.  gt It makes no sense to try and smuggle from Israel when they have thusands of tunnels into Egypt for that purpose.Again assuming that such tunnels actually exist which we only have Israels word on it does seem like such would be useful as a means of attacking.  I still dont blame them.  Considering that the world views the Occupied Territories as illegally held land they have the right to resist.  Were I a Jew in Warsaw and I saw my people being killed by Nazis I would dig a few tunnels myself.  Israel has allowed the scar left on the Jewish psyche to twist them into a cruel child of Nazi Fascism with the Palestinians taking the place of the Jews this time around.  I dont blame the Palestinians at all for taking steps to resist.Thank you for the links regarding the different tunnels I found them quite interesting!  Insert previous points about peoples right to resist and what would the Jews do if they were in the Palestinians place etc.  There is and has been a way to make sure that there is peace retreat to a two state solution based on pre borders or continue on their path and commit the same crime that was almost perpetrated on them and sooner or later the world will have had enough and they will turn their back on Israel and it will become an illegitimate state.EDIT Gave you an upvote even tho I still would advise caution in believing was informative and you didnt resort to attacks.,worldpolitics,cjkaskx,1,t5_2qh9a

The only thing that money does is allow the U.S. to restrain Israel during these episodes of fighting. It doesnt by any means sustain their economy which is growing at a tremendous pace despite the state of the world economy. gtAntihasbara?You do understand that lumping everything you see in support of Israel under the Jewish lobby and hasbara tags is precisely the proof of antiSemitism that people keep talking about?You may think youre smart or funny by saying that but all youve done is prove your bonafides as a Hamas apologist and someone who only cares about demonizing Israel and Jews rather than seeking peace and end to conflict.,worldpolitics,cjz322b,-1,t5_2qh9a

Would that be different from calling for their justice or their punishment for severe and continued violations of human rights and international law? I see that as a significant improvement frankly. Wishing death is essentially what the IDF has been doing for Gaza quite honestly. I think if you consider my arguments fair then we should recognize that the words may be comparable but the crimes and levels of oppression are vastly different. And lets not forget that as you said the charter has since been changed. I think that charter that wished death to the Jews was from the s. Dont quote me on that I might be wrong. But Hamas has pretty much stood by the international community in supporting a twostate solution so I agree with them in not recognizing Israel as an occupying power or its right to exist as a nation considering the expulsion required for them to establish it.

1906729,0,t1_ckinpi7,So is the manipulation of gullible and ignorant people by lying politicians and media. What ever happened to those mysteriously disappearing Yazidis? Nothing was heard about them again. Obama started bombing Iraq near Erbil Capital of Kurdistan to slow down the advance of ISIS which was threatening Exxons oil interests there  see my latest piece in Iraq  the first part of which I have CampP hereWhat you are not being told about the latest crisis in Iraq  What you are not being told about the latest crisis in IraqObama says he is going to start restart airstrikes in Iraq and drop humanitarian aid because Iraq has become a catastrophe.In order to understand what is currently going on in Iraq we first have to understand some of the background history and the more recent events over the last year or so.Its getting pretty complicated  so please bear with me while I try and explain.Prime Minister MalikiMaliki has now fallen out of favor with Washington DC because he has got too close to Iran.Obama and the State Department want him replaced with someone else I dont know who yet.Maliki signed a deal with Iran and Assad in July  to build a gas pipeline from Irans South Pars gas field the largest in the world to the coast of Syria for onward export to Europe.This was the real reason for the sudden escalation in the attempts by the US government to get overtly involved in the Syrian civil war in late August and September  and to start a massive bombing campaign in Syria.The chemical weapons attack in Damascus in August  that was immediately blamed on Assad was actually a false flag attack by Islamic Extremist rebels on rebels in Damascus and was probably engineered and schemed via Turkey.See  information on the Syrian civil war.Maliki has recently become even more friendlier with Putin and Russia.There were already some deals for Russia to start drilling for oil in Iraq from a year or more ago.In the last couple of months it has been announced that Russia has started producing oil in Iraq and that Russia and Iraq were looking to expand Russias involvement in developing Iraqs oil assets. See .Maliki became frustrated with the USs refusal to supply any of the previously agreed  Fs or to supply weapons in general so he has obtained jets from Russia instead. See .Iran also returned the  Iraqi planes that were sent to Iran in  during the first Gulf War to prevent the US destroying them. These will now be very old.Malikis Shia led government has always been favorable to Irans Shias.Hence the calls from DC that Maliki must form a more inclusive government with Sunnis this is just code to move away from Iran.Maliki recently stated that he wants to triple Iraqi oil production by . Saudi Arabia did not like that at all  it would severely limit the Saudis ability to sell their oil at anywhere near current prices. US Foreign Policy has been directed at reducing the supply and distribution of oil from countries other than Saudi Arabia and Gulf States for more than a decade. See Iraq  Libya Syria and Ukraine.Maliki fired his Kurdish Foreign Minister in July  see .The Kurds in IraqObama has refused to arm the Kurds in their current fight against ISIS.The Kurds have urgently requested resupplies of ammunition etc. which Obama has so far refused to do. It is not yet known whether Obamas humanitarian airdrops are cover to supply munitions and weapons to the Kurds or if the Kurds are still out of favor  see below.The Kurds have recently fallen out of favor with both Washington DC and Maliki because they have recently started selling their own oil for their own revenue bypassing any involvement of Maliki and Baghdad.If the Kurds can sell their own oil without the involvement of Baghdads Oil Ministry they will have the necessary revenue to declare complete independence from Baghdad.The Kurds are selling their oil in a joint operation with Erdogan and Turkey. Oil tankers are being loaded with Kurdish oil in Turkey and then sold on the open market.There is an ongoing US court case concerning an attempted delivery of Kurdish oil to the US. See . The Oil Tanker in question which has m worth of oil on board. This is only one of  tankers that have been loaded with Kurdish oil in the Turkish port of Ceyhan since May. I do not know how the Kurdish oil is getting from the Kurdish oil fields in Iraq to Ceyhan in Turkey.The oil tankers have and are delivering oil to various locations around the world see .It is not yet known what impact if any the current fighting between ISIS and the Kurds is having on the Kurdish oil export business to Turkey.Update From February Iraqs Oil Rift Between the Kurds and Baghdad Deepens Over Exxon MoveExxon Mobil to develop oil fields in Kurdish areas of IraqErdogan and Turkey Erdogan has now completely fallen out of favor with and split from Washington DC. See .Erdogan started negotiations to buy a .bn missile defense system from China in late  thus snubbing DC.It is known that Erdogan is very frustrated with DCs lack of action in overtly arming the Islamic Extremist rebels in Syria.Erdogan also became frustrated that the False Flag chemical weapons attack in Damascus in August  did not result in the start of a massive US bombing campaign in Syria and the subsequent start of an all out American military campaign in Syria.See .The planned massive bombing campaign using over  Tomahawk Cruise Missiles just in the initial strikes would have had little effect on Assads military capabilities and would have undoubtedly failed to meet its supposed objectives to alter the course of the Syrian war. The bombs were always to be merely a stepping stone for more direct American military action up to and including a significant number of American boots on the ground.Erdogan is working with the Iraqi Kurds to sell their oil independently of Baghdad.Erdogan has recently issued strong condemnations of Israels attack on Gaza.This despite reports that one of the Kurdish oil tanker deliveries was to Israel at a steep discount  before Israels invasion of Gaza.ISISISIS captured Fallujah in early January and have been getting stronger ever since so it wasnt a surprise when ISIS also captured Mosul in June although the Western media made it out to be something that came completely out of the blue.ISIS captures Fallujah amid rise in violence in Iraq.,worldpolitics,ckiy612,1,t5_2qh9a

There were and remain to some extent plenty of animals that pose a serious threat to you. None of this was really the case in the UK at the time.

The potential for abuse is awesome the committee observed especially when checks and balances designed  to assure accountability have not been applied.

The agencys metadata collection program now targets everyone in the country old enough to hold a phone.

American Jews have never voted with AIPAC theyve overwhelmingly voted with the Democratic Party.That said the Democratic Party also has horrible positions on Palestine so that doesnt say much but it does establish that theyre hardly more loyal to the Zionist lobby than to the United States. If anything its the neocon ultraright and its Bible thumping retard crew that thinks their elected US President is a secret Muslim Brotherhood agent working for Hitler and Stalin at the same time while embracing blind loyalty to a foreign regime called Israel. The Zionist lobby might be made of Jews at the top but at the bottom it does not appear that they have made the kinds of inroads into the Jewish community in the United States that they have wanted. Its a difficult subject on the one hand it means that we cant bunch the Jews in America with the Zionist lobby on the other hand theres still considerable antiMuslim racism among that community as with all communities in the US.

He is in constant debt but not doing poorly.If its true that it can never be repaid of course that is bad for the creditors but often for others as well but you have said nothing to indicate that its the case that it cant be repaid and central banks are consistently making it easier to repay debts not harder since they are causing inflation and inflation makes it easier to repay debts.,worldpolitics,cm4dwtj,1,t5_2qh9a

The PRI hasnt changed much but of course the PAN was no better when in power and these mass kidnappings and previous alliances with the PRI and PAN in passing bad legislation show that the PRD is not the answer either.Not long before all this happened I was with the EZLN in Chiapas. People in zapatista territory are still poor but they hold their heads up with dignity and they rule themselves through their Good Governance Councils. It is a collective model of resistance and autonomy in opposition to the corruption and exploitation of the state. They tried to spread their model through the Other Campaign years ago but not much happened. Hopefully now people will see their model as an alternative. The families of the  have meet with the EZLN and accepted their support.People act like the big problem in Mexico is the cartels that they are the source of the corruption. They are responsible for a great deal of corruption and murder but if you removed them the government would continue being corrupt and exploitative. Maybe the local and state governments are corrupted by the cartels but the federal government is corrupted by people like Carlos Slim. A mayor might kidnap a few dozen students with a cartel but the president will throw the whole country under the NAFTA for the owning class. The whole economic and political structure is rotten to the core and must be replaced. Mexicos problems are not just national as the corruption and exploitation are tied to the global neoliberal economy.All across zapatista rebel territory there are signs that say Here the people speak and the government obeys. It is time that more people join in their vision of horizontal libertarian socialism as the answer to the chaos of inequality.,worldpolitics,cm893dd,49,t5_2qh9a

Now that literally is a conspiracy or multiple conspiraciesThats a stronger argument but its still not necessarily evidence of an intentional conspiracy so much as a general predisposition in society to avoid punishing the welltodo or powerful.Its of a piece with affluenza and the general trend of lawenforcement officers tending to defer more to powerful individuals  not necessarily a conspiracy and more just everyday humdrum corruption and bias in our social systems.Again a cop letting a senator off a speeding ticket doesnt have to be because theyre part of the same smoky secretive Masonic lodge when it can just be because the cop exercises his judgement and his own prejudices mean he decides that the guys just a respectable individual that made a mistake as opposed to an dirty impoverished criminal scumbag... or recognises that the powerful individual could make life hard for him if he chose to prosecute.Theres no intentional conspiracy necessary  just a corrupt society that as an emergent property happens to protect the wealthy and powerful more than the poor and powerless.Do you know whats really scary?  Its not the idea that theres a smoky room full of a small group of powerful industrialists lizardpeople and jews who might one day be identified exposed and overthrown.Its the idea that nobodys in charge nobodys deliberately pulling the strings and the entire gargantuan immobile edifice of society acts in concert to benefit wealthy powerful people and stick poor people with the shitty end of the stick because thats just how life is.gt None of this bullshit about having a conspiracy mind which is just a meme used to smear people who challenge the status quo.Once again actually read the abstract of the study the article is referencing.

2454221,0,t1_cmelfcc,gtTo this day it is generally although incorrectly believed that when Adolf Hitler was appointed German chancellor in January of  the German government began policies to suppress the Jews of Germany including rounding up of Jews and putting them in concentration camps and launching campaigns of terror and violence against the domestic Jewish population.While there were sporadic eruptions of violence against Jews in Germany after Hitler came to power this was not officially sanctioned or encouraged. And the truth is that antiJewish sentiments in Germany or elsewhere in Europe were actually nothing new. As all Jewish historians attest with much fervor antiSemitic uprisings of various degrees had been everpresent in European history.In any case in early  Hitler was not the undisputed leader of Germany nor did he have full command of the armed forces. Hitler was a major figure in a coalition government but he was far from being the government himself. That was the result of a process of consolidation which evolved later.Even Germanys Jewish Central Association known as the Verein contested the suggestion made by some Jewish leaders outside Germany that the new government was deliberately provoking antiJewish uprisings.The Verein issued a statement that the responsible government authorities i.e. the Hitler regime are unaware of the threatening situation saying we do not believe our German fellow citizens will let themselves be carried away into committing excesses against the Jews.Despite this Jewish leaders in the United States and Britain determined on their own that it was necessary to launch a war against the Hitler government.gt,worldpolitics,cmf1ltj,1,t5_2qh9a

2587318,0,t3_2pfo04,Juan Cole has an interesting article on Gwenyth Todd an adviser to the Navy and former National Security Council staffer that outlines her clash with the Jewish neocons.gtWhat happened to her was typical of Neoconservative ways of operating. Paul Wolfowitz Douglas Feith Richard Perle Scooter Libby and other Israel partisans inside the Pentagon or in Cheneys office repeatedly played dirty tricks held meetings and did not invite principals contolled meeting agendas and spied on and tried to discredit foeign service officers at the State Department according to FSOs who have privately talked to me. The Neocons did these things in order to get up the Iraq War which they thought would protect Israel. According to Wesley Clark they hoped for a series of wars. In  Cheney was clearly pushing for a war on Iran. Many of the Neoconservatives had left government by  but the network remained powerful especially in Cheneys office.What I found interesting about this video was Todds very credible claim that the main reason for invading Iraq was to provide a base for orchestrating either regime change or war with Iran. Even a fool should be able to see by now that  was a longplanned pretext for a series of wars in the Mideast and that the Zionists were at the center of the conspiracy.All that stopped their falling dominoes plan was that Iraq turned into a disaster for the U.S.Yet this Israeli fifth column is still burrowed in and burrowing a way at starting another major war but its not just the Zionist Jews as this writer points outgtGwyneth Todd paid with her career and exile but that makes her a sacrificial lamb to a problem that has not gone away. Cases like hers are not uncommon when a whistleblower doesnt threaten the system it becomes a problem when the integrity of the system itself becomes a threat. The crisis has the potential to deepen because farsighted and responsible politicians seem to be lacking in the current generation of leadership.gtThe U.S. federal debt in and around the  trillion mark rising unemployment and an economy in stasis represent problems that a president of either political color has not been able to address. The foreign policy problem is that a military adventure will take away attention from these structural problems much like the Arab spring has done but when the bill comes we wont be able to do anything about it.gtIran is the best candidate  in light of the fact that the rational thing from all perspectives is to not have war we might yet attack the Persians. Not so much for their nuclear program with North Korea and Pakistan being rather more dangerous atomic states than Iran. Attacking the country would have political not logical motivations and would end in a disaster.

Hence the producers have had profit gains throughout the ages without consideration to what those modifications do beside the profits  which for example is why maize has lost most of its value as a food. The difference here is that Monsanto knows what theyre doing to the product unlike the farmers from  years ago.

3972355,0,t1_cr8zzsn,I live in America a small town.  we have a Muslim family that lives here a large one.  they own a couple convenience stores and a lot of the family works there.  they take on Christian names and wear them on little plastic tags so you can communicate with them easier.  I see Harry about three or for times a week at the store down the street from me.  he is learning english and enjoys practicing it with me.  he remembers small things Ive told him about my daytoday life and brings them up of his own volition.  he likes to talk about the weather and tell jokes about the drunk hobos who hang around outside his store trying to con him into selling them more beer in my state you can lose your liquor license for overserving people.  sometimes he will joke about how hes overserving me if I come back down for a second beer later in the day.  he has never been anything less than friendly to me.  I never see the guy with a shitty look on his face never hear him raise his voice and I watch him close.  most of the other employees are white and they have their good days and bad days and it shows much like myself when I worked a cashier and had to wait on costumersI have a sister that is  years younger than me.  when she was in grade school I chaperoned one of her field trips.  Harrys father the patriarch of the family also chaperoned.  he was a tall lean man with a big bushy beard and a full turban.  he rarely spoke but he was fluent in English.  he scared the shit out of my fellow rodeotowm citizens.  guy was like a space alien.  the other chaperones went out of their way to avoid having to walk by him formed little groups to talk as far away as they could from him on the other side of the park.  ir was intentional I dont know how he could have failed to notice.  this was before I met Harry and I admit that he scared me too.at the end of the day a long hot day of herding third graders around town the kids got free ice cream at a small parlor by the park.  it was part of the deal with the school but sadly we adults got none.  I really wanted ice cream and was thinking about buying some for myself when the patriarch I forget his name now it was the only time I ever met him told us as a group we should get what we want and he would pay for it.  he said he appreciated us taking a day off to help the kids have a fun day.  it was one of those oldschool ice cream shops in an old abandoned mining town turned into into a tourist attraction.  shit was expensive.now maybe thats antecdotal maybe youll take a shot at me for being naive but that family has made a big impression on me over the years.  my sister graduates next year the muslim boy in her class as well as his younger brother two grades below are constantly in the paper for winning some sort of math bowl or making some kind of national accolade list.  kids are crazy smart and judging by my sisters yearbooks pretty popular too.  sometimes a woman who doesnt speak much english will be at the store instead of Harry.  more often than not she has her daughter with her who I place at around two or three.  she sits on the back counter and happily makes funny noises at the customers as they pay for their goods.  sometimes shell let loose a long string of excited talk in whatever language they speak I asked once and was told but now I forget.  she is cute as a button and makes my day better every time her mother brings her in.  she stares at my beard intently when I reach the front of the line it is black and bushy and I dont think shes used to seeing one like that on a white person as the only other people to have such a beard are old men.  like I said its a rodeo town and pretty cleancut still.anyway I hear a lot of talk about how we have a Muslim problem in America too.  I dont see it.  I like Harry and his family a lot.  I cant say the same for a lot of the white families who are constantly badmouthing them.  a couple years back a guy that owns most of the orchards in this valley got caught employing a large number of undocumented workers.  they were all deported and he was given some slap on the wrist fine which was probably only a tiny percentage of the profits he made over the years only having to pay his illegal workforce a couple dollars an hour.  he immediately signed up for a state sponsered program that flies in Jamaicans a couple times a year to harvest and thin even though unemployment is skyrocketing in my county.

The wiring of terrorist funds if they are carried out electronically should be easy to trace.We also know that Kuwait is a major center for the laundering of terrorist funds and that large amounts of these funds are transferred to Turkey to be picked up from there by the terrorist groups operating in Syria and Iraq see below.It should be relatively easy to determine which banks andor offices are being used in Kuwait and some more investigation on the ground by CIA  MI following the SIGINT signals intelligence leads should reveal the major sources handlers launderers and end receivers of large amounts of terrorist funds.So why isnt this already being done? Its unlikely that it is being actively pursued or treated as a priority  we havent heard anything about such activity.  The intelligence services are not likely to keep it a secret if they had broken a major terrorist funding ring. They invariably leak any successes they have against terrorist networks  they are so very few and far between. E.G. The NSA made a big song and dance about someone in San Diego wiring  to an Islamic Extremist group in Yemen.

See also Bernie Sanders statement on TPP below which includes comments about Nafta.See also numerous statements by Pat Buchanan on how Nafta hollowed out the US economy and cost hundreds of thousands of well paid jobs. The free trade deals put in place have added hundreds of billions to the trade deficit.Obamas Republican collaborators TPP treaty set to destroy jobs and kill millions both Chomsky amp Buchanan oppose it The following link summarizes the effects on the US of Nafta Globalization and the increasing Corporatism we have seen over the last  or more years and the current state of the global economy TPP and TTIP are NOT free trade agreements. They are massive Corporate Power grabs dressed up as trade deals to get them to pass.A selection of other TPP and TTIP articles and information are listed below. Basically everyone from both the left and the right who isnt in the pay of the big banks big pharma big oil and Monsanto etc. very strongly opposes these deals because they are very bad news for over  of ordinary people.People who openly and strongly oppose these deals include Joseph Stiglitz Robert Reich Noam Chomsky Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Pat Buchanan and Paul Craig Roberts.Robert Reich is very strongly against TPP the same reasons also apply to TTIP in Europe Bernie Sanders has written a very strongly worded statement condemning these deals which I would recommend everybody read The corporations have bribed the political leaders in every country to sign away their sovereignty and the general welfare of their people to private corporations. Corporations have paid US senators large sums for transferring Congress lawmaking powers to corporations.  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts former Assistant Secretary to US Treasury former editor of the Wall Street JournalRule By the Corporations  TTIP The Corporate Empowerment Act Geraint Davies UK MP The harsh reality is that this deal is being stitched up behind closed doors by negotiators with the influence of big corporations and the dark arts of corporate lawyers. They are stitching up rules that would be outside contract law and common law and outside the shining light of democracy to give powers to multinationals to sue Governments over laws that were designed to protect their citizens.Caroline Lucas UK MP pointed out in support of this that the Czech Republic Slovakia and Poland who are in trade agreements that include this kind of investorstate relationship have been sued  times and have lost an amount of money that could have employed  nurses for a year.UKIP oppose TTIP because it is NOT a free trade deal. Its a Corporate power grab dressed up as a trade deal.The TPP TISA and TTIP in Europe agreements are massive Corporate power grabs dressed up as trade deals Corporations Win Again Senate Passes Obamatrade FastTrack Bill TransPacific Partnership TPP Job Loss Lower Wages and Higher Drug Prices TPP The Dirtiest Trade Deal Youve Never Heard Of How Obamas Trade Deals Are Designed To End Democracy ISDS denies equal access to justice Leaked Text Shows Big Pharma Bullies Using TPP To Undermine Global Health TTIP Heres why MEPs have been protesting it and why you should too The TPP What Youre Not Being Told Revealed Emails Show How Industry Lobbyists Basically Wrote The TPP Forget the TPP  Wikileaks Releases Documents from the Equally Shady Trade in Services Agreement or TISA Julian Assange on the TransPacific Partnership Secretive Deal Isnt About Trade But Corporate Control  Reasons Why You Should Oppose TPP and TTIP TPP Power Grab World Bank Goldman Sachs and the CFR Backlash Against TPP Grows as Leaked Text Reveals The Scam To Increase Drug Costs Joseph Stiglitz Why Fast Track Was Defeated Once  and Why That Was the Right Decision Bernie Sanders statement on Fast Track and the TPPAlso see fairly recent comments made by Elizabeth Warren about the concerns she has with ISDS.The TransPacific Partnership clause everyone should oppose Elizabeth Warren fires back at Obama Heres what theyre really fighting about The purpose of Fast Track is a to remove the Constitutional requirement for a two thirds majority which is otherwise required for a treaty or international agreement and b to prevent any amendments to the deals being allowed or proposed. It becomes a simple up or down vote.The reason for the draconian efforts to keep the texts of the deals a secret up until now is to enable Fast Track to be passed without a riot on the streets. It wont really matter after Fast Track is approved. It will be very hard stopping them getting approved in the US.These Corporate Power Grab deals transfer Sovereignty to Corporations. They will only benefit the top .  the major owners and boards of large Corporations. They are dressed up as free trade deals in order to get them to pass. They will lose well paid jobs increase unemployment depress wages increase poverty increase pollution and jack up the price of prescription drugs.

4788606,0,t1_cty0gsw,You keep using that same article which is so riddled with errors in an attempt to be inflamatory.  There is no european procedure that requires Swedish prosecutors to question Assange in Londonthey are biasedly referring to a Swedish procedure which requires them to interview the accused before he can be formally charged becasue so many people want to know why he isnt charged yet.  Assanges attorneys invited the Swedes to come to the Ecuadorian embassy in London to dot he interview there becasue they knew that it would make Assange look like he was cooperating while explicitly refusing to cooperate.If a fugitive says I wont come to your court but you can come ot my house and conduct my trail here what judge would say Oh yeah it is American procedure that we need to conduct a trial so we will agree to that.?  But the REDICULOUS part is now the Swedes have to comply with this insane demand becasue Assange ahs been holed up long enough that the Swedish charges are bumping up against their statute of limitations unless they can show a good faith effort to charge him!  So Ny is going to London to conduct the interview incidentally sets terrible precedent.As to truth out and their continued yellow journalism. Sweden CANT and has no incentive to issue an assurance that Assange wont be extradited to the U.S.  To issue such an assurance would be in violation of international law as it would violate the extradition treaty between Sweden and the U.S. If you let a fugitive say I will allow myself to be prosecuted in Sweden but only if they promise I wont be prosecuted elsewhere for different crimes then you are allowing fugitives to again dictate whether they consent to being prosecuted. It is crazy how many people dont understand that Sweden saying We will not deny a lawful request made by the U.S. under international treaty  until after we see it and investigate whether it complies with the treaty is not a giant conspiracyit is the very basis of international law!,worldpolitics,cty55et,2,t5_2qh9a

4840415,0,t1_cu4ewa5,So some points. The relevance is this. There are countries out there that have human rights issues IMMENSELY worse than what happens in Israel yet few people say anything about those countries. In fact very many people who for part of the Hate Israel chorus come from countries where Judaism is outlawed.  Why this is specifically relevant is because those who speak out against Israel and ignore human rights abuses in islamic states are doing so not because they care about people but because they either hate Israel andor it is socially acceptable to do so.. Im from South Africa. So I know what Aparheid means. Quite literally it means Seperate Development. The key word here is SEPERATE. What that meant was that in South Africa each of the Tribes Excluding Afrikaaners were given a patch of land to have as their own. It also meant that those people did not have voting rights or could live in areas where whites lived. So let up put this in context of Israel Do Jews AND muslims Christians Athiests Buddists etc. etc. have voting rights in Israel? YES they do. Do Jews AND muslims Christians Athiests Bhuddists etc. etc. have the right to own property in Israel on a equal basis? YES they do. Did Israel give a patch of land to everybody else and say Go Develop Yourselves? NO they did not.So clearly ALL the apartheid checkboxes are not checked in the case of Israel. Please tell me then why you use the word Apartheid and its relevance?,worldpolitics,cu4o7jn,-3,t5_2qh9a

4888811,0,t3_3hv1go,Ayesha TanzeemLast updated on August    AMISLAMABADThe United States reportedly is blocking a military aid disbursement to Pakistan for lack of progress in fighting the Haqqani network according to a Pakistani newspaper.The network  declared a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department  is one of the deadliest groups under the umbrella of the Afghan Taliban.The Dawn newspaper says U.S. officials determined a counterterrorism offensive that began last June in North Waziristan has not damaged the feared group. If the Obama administration does not certify to the U.S. Congress that Pakistans military operations have significantly damaged the Haqqani network it will hold up the next payment of coalition support funds.  This is the money reimbursed to Pakistan for actions that help the U.S. military in Afghanistan.The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad did not respond to requests for a comment on the newspaper report and Pakistans Foreign Ministry is also refusing to comment.ZarbeAzb operationQazi Khalilullah Pakistan foreign office spokesman acknowledged Pakistan is discussing the issue with the United States but avoided answering direct questions about the discussion.  Instead he repeated what Pakistan has been saying since the start of the military operation.  I wish to reiterate that under the ongoing military operation ZarbeAzb action is being taken across the board against all enemies of Pakistan and Afghanistan said Khalilullah. ZarbeAzb has targeted militant groups in the North Waziristan region along the Afghan border.  Pakistans military claims it has killed more than  terrorists in North Waziristan since Sunday during the operation.  U.S. and Afghan officials have long alleged the Haqqani network has received covert support from Pakistans spy agency. Earlier this month the U.S. commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan General John Campbull spoke on the issue at the Washingtonbased Brookings Institution. There is no doubt in my mind that Pakistan over the years has probably not done enough to be able to help us get after the Haqqani threat Campbell said. He added Pakistan is probably afraid to pressure the Haqqanis too much.  I think as they look at it they have a lot of other issues theyve got to deal with inside of Pakistan and they dont want Haqqani to turn on them.   A U.S. decision to withhold the military aid would damage Pakistans claims it takes action against all terrorist groups without prejudice.  It would also give credence to Afghan claims Pakistan provides safe haven to militants.  Following several violent attacks in Kabul and surrounding areas during the past few weeks Afghan President Ashraf Ghani lashed out at Pakistan.Pakistan still remains a venue and ground for gatherings from which mercenaries send us messages of war Ghani said.  The incidents of the past two months in general and the recent days in particular show that the suicide training camps and the bomb making facilities used to target and murder our innocent people still operate as in the past in Pakistan. Mullah OmarThe relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan warmed after the election of President Ashraf Ghani but has seen a sudden decline since news broke last month that the Afghan Talibans reclusive leader Mullah Omar had died in  in a Karachi hospital.  Pakistan denies Omar died in Pakistan.  News of Mullah Omars death surfaced a day before Pakistan was to host a second round of peace talks between the Afghan government and the Afghan Taliban which pulled out of the dialogue and increased attacks in Afghanistan. When the Afghan Taliban announced their new leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor they said the head of the Haqqani network Sirajuddin Haqqani has been appointed one of his two deputies. But Pakistan insists the peace talks are not dead. Our efforts are that whichever leadership of the Taliban emerges that leadership continues with the process of peace and reconciliation with the Afghan government so that lasting peace can be established in the region Pakistan Defense Minister Khwaja Asif said earlier this month.  Since then Pakistan and Afghanistan have leveled allegations of cross border firing at each others troops and called in each others ambassadors to lodge protests.,worldpolitics,cuarunh,2,t5_2qh9a

You forgot to mention that Arabs have been fighting and killing each other for centuries just as they do today. What I was pointing out is that prior to  Jews and Arabs got along great. My grandmother told me that the Jews and Arabs would get together during harvest and would celebrate each group respecting the others religious beliefs by observing the others customs. She said they were like family. Had the Jews stuck to my grandfathers plan and continued to purchase land there would be a homeland for the Jews and there would be peace between Jews and Arabs today. But the Zionists were determined to take the land by any means necessary. Many Jews opposed this and for good reason. It was the Jews who opposed the Zionists plan who told their Arab friends about the Balfour Declaration otherwise the Arabs had no clue. Word spread and tensions mounted as the Arabs became paranoid. Muslim Brotherhood was an outside radical group that made the situation a  times worse. Many Arabs who were friends with the Jews did not support Muslim Brotherhood but supported them later when they were fearful of the Jews taking over Palestine. Both sides are to blame. Zionist leaders are to blame and Arab leaders are to blame.

And low and behold just like international Zionism that internationalist Communist Party hierarchy served Jewish careerism and material interests and murdered millions of Gentiles to attain the Jewish terms of peace.So when you say you are a leftliberal Jew what you really probably mean and likely amount to is a leftauthoritarian Jew and when you profess to want peace what you really mean is surrender and subordination of goyim to the JudeosupremacistZionist interest.But its not entirely your own fault that youre deluded and selfdeceived into believing that authentic peace can ever come under JewishZionist authority given the extreme ritualism brainwashing and tribal conformity pressures to which indoctrinated Jews are subject by their nation their tribe their rabbis and their gurus.If you are willing get some professional Chosen cult deprogramming help from  whoever it takes  a psychiatrist a neurologist a priest whoever  your perspective is likely to change and your moral and ethical IQ is likely to leap several fold.,worldpolitics,cvzyyl2,0,t5_2qh9a

Wolfowitzs statement cost the taxpayers between two to six trillion dollars.Additionally Bushs own father has stated that Ironass Cheney and arrogant Rumsfeld damaged America with their hawkish reaction to Its obvious now that the Bush II administration was hijacked by Israelfirst neocons and the veterans that the first Bush administration was relying upon to guide the malleable GW were themselves corrupt and depraved to the core.But ambition arrogance greed and stupidity are no excuse for treason.So when do the trials begin? ,worldpolitics,cwthndw,4,t5_2qh9a

5981476,1,t1_cy3occc,Im of the idea that the conceptualization of certain ideas being more dangerous than others is itself more dangerous than any thought the concept might stifle. Dangerous thought insinuates the inability of the individual to make rational choices for himself this insinuation is the basis of authoritarianism and the refutation of representative government. Its the first step towards living in a china where you have the great firewall to protect you from antiPRC dogma or a USSR where your friends and family will report you for unpatriotic leanings.The most dangerous element is that this authoritarianism is being effectively portrayed as some sort of rebellion to the wrongs of history. Because its enforced by propagandists that arent visibly directly linked to the state people buy into it much more readily. Theres a disconnect where people associate the positivity of technological change with some sort of inherent virtue around change itself which is a perfect cocktail for the statist reshaping if morality history and interpretation. Human societies dont move vertically they move laterally there is no definitive best society in the same way that there is no definitive absolute morality. Societal structure ultimately serves some sort of purpose for its time and the same old immovable human nature lives through it all. Morality is a utilitarian artificially constructed concept. Whether its the Catholic Church in the s or the U.S. government today if somebody wants you to behave a certain way to adhere to their new better morality its not because its better.

We joined comrades on May Day to march against capitalism. And most importantly we learnt about the Golden age of Jewish culture a time of stunning cultural achievement and coexistence between Jews and Muslims. Indoctrinated Jews are apparently incapable of ever taking any middle ground. Either theyre openly tribalfascist Zionist totalitarians or crypto tribalfascist Marxist totalitariansTheir goyimhating chosenvalidating religoracialist ideology is truly toxic brew no matter what they get up to.And I find it interesting that the leftwing of the Jewish nation is now attempting to ingratiate itself to Islam even after working within leftliberalism and as partners with the neocons for all those years to help instigate the Mideast war agenda that has now killed and displaced millions of Muslims.As far as Jew Stooges go if Islamism were ever to take the West these same pigs that sold out to the Diaspora Zionists will be selling out to the Diaspora Islamists without missing a beat and organized Jewry will place itself right in the middle profitably brokering the deal.Face facts most Jews are indoctrinated by their ideology and tribalsupremacist culture to do anything for power and money and throw any nonJews under the bus the second they become inconvenient without a second thought.Thats the real reason Jews have always been so hated and persecuted down through the ages and why they always will be.But somehow I doubt theyll be able to play the Muslims for fools as easily as they have played the postChristian postWestern identity West for fools.If the West hopes to survive it better get its GrecoChristian mojo lodestar back.If its gone too far down the rathole to survive it might as well bend over right now and kiss its own ass goodbye.,worldpolitics,cytgm9a,2,t5_2qh9a

Stop being a part of the problem and do something already.Edit  This is the most ridiculous thread and its under politics.

7088960,0,t1_d1jiwei,Really the entire election process needs to be reformed in a way that eliminates the need for a twoparty system. Under the current system only two candidates count those with the greatest and secondgreatest popularity. The Two Parties exist to discover or rather create those candidates. Other candidates are either irrelevant at best harmful for moderates generally in agreement with them at worst. This is because everybody has to pick just one candidate and the only way to win is to pick up  of the vote minimum.This forces voters to consider not who theyd like to see win but who theyd like to see lose. Voting for who theyd like to see win might allow the Bad Guy win. The most rational strategy is to vote against the Bad Guy and thus for the Other Guy. There is literally no other way to win the game as it is is currently constructed. But there are alternatives.My favorite is very simple approval voting. Instead of voting for the ONE GUY youre hoping can beat the Bad Guy you can check off everyone you find acceptable. Winner is still the one who gets the most votes but you arent restricted to ONLY Hillary OR The Donald for example. You could still vote for Hillary but you could also vote for Bernie.  Maybe enough independents also vote for Bernie that he edges out ahead of Hillary with no risk of splitting a vote that under the current system really needs to be united against the Bad Guy take your pick.Some people would really like to indicate their degree of preference and so advocate Instant Runoff Voting. I dont care for that system though preferring range voting which involves rating each candidate on some scale five stars or ten points or something. It can be treated the same as approval voting for those of us who like it just give five stars to everyone we approve of one star to those we dont while those who would rather signal degrees of approval could rate in a more nuanced fashion.Either of these methods would make the parties obsolete in the Presidential election. The purpose of the Two Parties is to produce Two Candidates who have a reasonable chance of beating the other. No doubt the Parties would continue to work to vet and promote candidates but under either of these voting systems we could just say screw the parties without fear of being marginalized in the process.,worldpolitics,d1jwh3v,22,t5_2qh9a

It also brings the top part directly into question. After the amount of dishorable and deceitful misrepresentations by Hillary of both Sanders and Trump over the last six months she has no credibility in my eyes. People may claim that Trumps nationalism is an act but I honestly dont think so. I think Trump truely does care about his country out of a sense of patriotism in addition to self interest. Its more than just a brand thing I see Trump recognizing we have a really good thing going here in America especially for the rich. The corrupt oligarchy is going to fuck it all up though. Its not in any way far fetched for a person like Trump to recognize the quest for short term profits without regard to the long term health on the name wont end well.Id like to see president Sanders but Trump is definitely the  choice right now. Clinton will absolutely continue the path of corruption and make America a worse country than before. Baring her starting WW with the Russians shes not going to destroy the country just continue the slide downwards. Trump has the potential to really make America much better and to restore parts of what weve lost. Its possible hell fuck things up as bad as Clinton though its hard to say .

And this is the thing that ye shall do Ye shall utterly destroy every male and every woman that hath lain by man. And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan. And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon and to call peaceably unto them. And Benjamin came again at that time and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead and yet so they sufficed them not. And the people repented them for Benjamin because that the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. Then the elders of the congregation said How shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin? And they said There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel. Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the children of Israel have sworn saying Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin. Then they said Behold there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem and on the south of Lebonah. Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin saying Go and lie in wait in the vineyards And see and behold if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out of the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.Numbers  And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses and they slew all the males. And they slew the kings of Midian beside the rest of them that were slain namely Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba five kings of Midian Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods. And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all their goodly castles with fire. And they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and of beasts. And they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto Moses and Eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the children of Israel unto the camp at the plains of Moab which are by Jordan near Jericho. And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp. And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from the battle. And Moses said unto them Have ye saved all the women alive? Behold these caused the children of Israel through the counsel of Balaam to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord. Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.TortureDeuteronomy  If there be a controversy between men and they come unto judgment that the judges may judge them then they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked. And it shall be if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten that the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten before his face according to his fault by a certain number. Forty stripes he may give him and not exceed lest if he should exceed and beat him above these with many stripes then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.SlaveryEphesians  Servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto Christ Not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart With good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord whether he be bond or free. And ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your Master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him.Also heres a bonus passage of both slavery and tortureExodus  And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod and he die under his hand he shall be surely punished. Notwithstanding if he continue a day or two he shall not be punished for he is his money.There are Muslims that ignore the bad parts of their religion as there are Christians who ignore theirs.,worldpolitics,d33blle,7,t5_2qh9a

You do want Islam to be associated with islamist terrorism because there is an overlap between islam as a whole and the radical groups like Isis.To me these two stances dont match up. If you think that a large group should be held responsible for the actions of its members then you should also hold TheDonald to that same standard. Or if you dont agree with that and do think that its unfair to judge TheDonald for its Stormfront connections then Id expect you to show that same level of consideration to Islam.Thats where people are seeing hypocrisy here.

Those big ships carrying food and basic goods from farms and factories to markets...they ONLY accept US Dollars or EUros as payment.The problem is...Venezuela only has a limited amount of USD saved up in their vaults...because they use a different currency called the Bolivar. So if a supermarket want to put food on the shelves...they need some of those USD from the central government bank. The Venezuelan government says Ok food is important so well give this supermarket capitalist businessman the best exchange rate of  USD for  Bolivars so he can stock his shelves with food for the people and make a fair profitBut because there are so few USD available the demand for USD has skyrocketed and a black market exists with people accepting  USD for  Bolivars! So the capitalist supermarket businessman says to himself I can make MUCH more profit trading my USD on the black market instead of selling food...so he in true capitalist fashion screws the masses and makes an x profit without buying or selling any food at all.So you see the US governments refusal to trade USD to Venezuela at a fair exchange rate combined with the capitalist ImporterShips policy of only accepting USD has created this currencyfood problem.Some of the more connected Venezuelan people who can get a travel visa fly to the US with a suitcase full of Bolivar cash and exchange it for USD at a fair exchange rate.

8441815,1,t1_d5wqjbh,Ultimately this and any argument related to truthfulness in politics is futile. My stance is built from the foundations of game theory and the act of running for president can be summed up as a simple communications game made complex by the scale it is played. I do not think it remotely possible to come to an accurate conclusion regarding the truthfulness of any and all politicians. There is a reason that modern psychology is still heavily influenced by behaviorism. B.F. Skinner used the term black box to refer to the human mind. While I dont exactly see eyetoeye with behaviorists such as Skinner it is a good analogy to show that deception whether conscious or unconscious is remarkably easy for anyone to get away with. The skill of habitual lying is dependent on two sets of tasks narrative maintenance and information framing. The former isnt even required by the politicians as they would have a team of people checking the polls and determining what stance to take on certain issues. The latter is the ability of the politician to respond to inquiries such as answering questions in a debate or other formal inquiry. The number of ways in which one may fabricate exaggerate deflect distract or mislead makes it impossible for a casual observer to determine the validity of genuineness of a given politician on stage. Left Right Inbetween. Doesnt matter. Its all a game where the stakes are indefinably high.

Global economic collapse could lead to nuclear war in the worst case and mass starvationviolence in the best case. At that point we are splitting hairs. I am of course talking about global economic collapse not another recession. Like I said I agree climate change is a very serious issue I just dont think the debate is framed properly. You are upset because you hear about corporations who lobby in opposition to climate regulations. That sounds bad but you have to remember these companies are already subject to very strict regulations in the U.S. and are only trying to survive. Corporate profit on the dollar is surprisingly low only around  cents. It isnt as if we are living in the early s totally unregulated capitalism era. My main point is there needs to be a balance between regulation and growth. Growth leads to new technologies that will combat climate change or at least help us cope with the effects. It leads to cleaner energy more efficient factories better methods for dealing with waste etc. When faced with a serious issue there are very few things humans have been unable to solve with technology. There is a breaking point where regulation becomes too severe. Growth slows hard working Americans feel it in their pocket and investment into new technologies declines. I am just trying to remind everyone how complex this issue is and that we shouldnt demonize each side with rhetoric that is extreme. It isnt all about greed and corruption. ,worldpolitics,d7fupg8,-1,t5_2qh9a

9162605,0,t1_d8d2hmq,Yeah pretty much. The its impossible to be racist against white people position is formally correct  the anthropological literature pins racism down by loose consensus as prejudice by an empowered group against a disempowered one based on their relative races  so unless someones about to contend that white people are actually a disempowered group you cant be racist against white people under the formal definition. Trouble is that formal construction which is useful when doing sociology and anthropology has also been picked up by people looking to expand the scope into casual use of racism i.e. racial prejudice  which absolutely can happen between any two or more people who are of what one or more of the participants perceive to be  different races. In common English wed call that out as racism and be correct in doing so according to the descriptivist principle of language everyone calls it that we all understand what we mean even if not everyone agrees on the nuance and might not use it that way its fine. Now I dont begrudge people trying to scope the definition back down to being closer to the academic one  I think they have a point that it helps to distinguish macroscopic societywide prejudice against individual prejudice and different words may help that but I think they have a mountain to climb when the linguistic shoe fits. Personally I think that its a losing battle and academia should develop a new vocabulary for talking about systemic racism vs individuallymotivated racism or similar but Im not even a participant in that literature let alone capable of shifting an entire discipline. All this is not helped by the fact that angry opinion piece writers on both sides of the fence rarely go into this why do we have these terms what do they actually mean discussion and instead open with a broadside its impossibleblatantly obvious that white people experience racism because riling up their opposition and generating lots of lovely clicks and shares with what a twat this person is underneath. Rather like this article in the Sun actually. We would all be a lot better off if we stopped fighting over nitpicky terms asked each other to clarify if needs be and got on with fighting a thing that we can all agree exists and is bad.  Now we get into define race which is another horrible thorny question and boils down a lot to white Europeans being at the top of the heap in the Colonial era characterising everyone else along arbitrary lines that suited them at the time.  Racial and ethnic tensions dont have bright lines  look at discrimination against nonHan Chinese people by Han Chinese gt majority for instance where outside China both groups would face similar prejudices but within China one is heavily disadvantaged against the other. ,worldpolitics,d8dfe18,2,t5_2qh9a

The President has a big pulpit especially when his party controls one of the houses of legislature to prioritize what he wants to see in a budget.

Hell no. All that is happening right now as the world gears up for the New World order is that governments and megacorporations are trying to muscle in on positioning themselves to have as much power as possible in the role they will play in the NWO. China and Russia are under the Rothschild Umbrella.The fiat currency that is at the heart of the RothschildNWO agenda isnt the issue. The issue is Who is going to control any global fiat currency that is allowed to arise or consolidate?The rest of the world can now see that it is the unstable selfserving racist and economic totalitarian international Zionist rackets that dominate fiat currency in the West and even the West is getting fed up with their abuses and irrational fanaticism.And they are fanatical and unstable because they are a systematically brainwashed cult under tight social political economic and psychological control of their rabbis gurus and overlords.Because they are brainwashed and otherwise psychologically and physically abused by the Zionist cult system and have been their entire lives they are unable to ascertain objective reality and unable to lead others in any kind of stable and functional direction.When WASPs had control of the Anglosphere with Jews as the junior partners this wasnt as much of an issue. But once the JewsSemites ascended and the Zionists took full control of organized Judaism and the Jewish rackets saturated the financial sector the multitude of Zionist pathologies mental deficiencies and the emotional and intellectual arrested development that is at the root of their system have come into strong relief. Systematically engineered arrested development of its offspring is how organized Jewry regulates its hierarchy and controls the lower levels.All of the global failures that the U.S. and the Anglosphere has suffered since the rise of the JewsSemites into the elite is another sure giveaway that the Zionists simply lack the sanity coherence and ideological maturity to ever lead any diverse group of goyim in a healthy and functional direction let alone trying to lead Western Civilization and the world.On top of this is the moral disaster that is Israel. The Hebrews there have been killing ethnically cleansing terrorizing abusing and thieving from their own Semitic brethren since its very founding a dead giveaway about the true pathologically narcissistic nature and character of international Zionism. So they cant fake it any longer. They are what they are and their moral and ethical defects and arrested development can no longer be hidden.Yet you think these stunted psychopaths and moral defectives who comprise the international Zionist cult are destined to rule the world?Its not going to happen.

This is why its VERY important to determine how we continue to support Israel.Im not questioning why youre doing it Im questioning if you accept the results of continuing to do the same things to try and accomplish your goals of supporting Israel ISIS Iran threat Syria Afghanistan and the worldwide refugee crisis can be traced back to US meddling in the middle east. Supporting Israel is meddling in the middle east so it should be done with great caution and care .,worldpolitics,dary05b,1,t5_2qh9a

For many people its literally impossible for them to accept that their son or spouse may be dangerously ill. They just cant bring themselves to come to terms with reality. Or maybe they just wont notice at all. many mentally ill people are relatively effective at hiding it. in many of our societal problems relating to guns guns are the symptom rather than the cause. If we reformed our mental health institution and worked towards actually helping inner cities crippled by gang violence then any gun control beyond restricting them from violent felons wouldnt really be necessary. Magazine capacity limits and assault weapon bans have literally no effect and we need to stop pretending that they do so we can focus our efforts on solving the underlying problems that actually lead to gun violence.edit Gun crime rates correlate better with poverty than with actual total gun ownership.

I dont think our views on media analysis are THAT far off in general. Where we disagree is I think elite established formerly print outlets like the New york Times Washington Post Wall Street Journal Financial Times the Associated Press Reuters Agence France Press... they really are the most independent most reliable orgs out there. They re institutionalized which in practice means free money. Free money sounds bad but if you compare the monopoly press of the previous era to the brokeass destroyed industry we have now I think its clear the monopoly outlets with fewer commercial pressures were better. Hard news fundamentally isnt good business. Thats probably the overall biggest problem in media in my view. So sure NYT isnt fully objective. True objectivity in public affairs really doesnt exist. I think you have to judge by a What Ive been harping on financial and management independence. You havent said a thing about it. To me its the pillar on which the best free media of any era stood. b Professionalism. Some orgs are trying a lot harder than others to do good work. Im a journalist as I said.

I mean I think the simplest proof of this is to just look around the world. I mean we do live in democracies dont we? Sure it is somewhat corrupt and whatnot but it is still a democracy and at the end the people are responsible for electing someone who doesnt do dumb shit such as you mentioned but they dont give a flying fuck about that. They mostly care about rhetoric they care about a flag about their favorite color and they care about the opinions of their echo chamber of choice.  At least as it stands now politicians do fuck up on small things like that but they dont fuck upthat much that is on the bigger picture and they serve as scapegoat to all our problems. Ohh everything is because of how corrupt politicians are but if you remove that you will have no one to blame it on and things still will be shit and even more so. The majority of people can be led they can be lured which is the main issue. I mean just look at how badly people are getting fucked over and how they wave a flag celebrating it. Its all really about perspective and everything can be spun in whatever light one wishes for.I can back this up historically as well just look at the present and the past of how peoples decisions have been influenced through threats fear bribery or some other rhetoric. Also on top of that if one were to have a stable direct democracy in the US the nation would have to be divided quite radically since people have fundamentally different views of the role of government so yeah no direct democracy is not really the answer.

In other words just like Israel the USA has no legitimacy left.  And since just like Israel the USA are unable to frighten their enemies they are basically left with nothing no legitimacy no ability to coerce.  So yes the Neocons have won.  But their victory is removes the last chance for the US to avoid a collapse.Once the Internet broke through the Israeli government hasbara and corrupt MSM and Zionist fifth column propagandaa the world image of Israel transformed from courageous persecuted democracy to the fascistparasite entity it is in relative short order. The same will happen to the Diaspora Zionists and their stooges.Trump politically exploited the widespread knowledge of this treasonous and selfserving Israelfirst fifth column to gain an America First victory but hes refused to take it to the next level of prosecuting the leaders for their treason. Apparently he thought he could take the glory and the spoils without fulfilling any legal political or consititutional obligations.Hopefully given the way the Diaspora Zionists and their leftright accomplices in MSM and the corrupt Beltway have absolutely mugged him from day one will teach him to use the tools of government to bring these criminals killers warmongers and fascists to justice because if he doesnt theyre going to make an example of him to buy themselves another shot at WW for international Zionism and its agenda of economic totalitarianism since their war on Islam failed to light the fuse and their Plan B for war with Russia also failed to trigger it.Slowly but surely the world is learning how so many Jews down through history have been destroyed as a consequence of the actions of their own evil leaders and racist misanthropic ideology.,worldpolitics,ddr4rcr,2,t5_2qh9a

10998519,0,t3_5x2643,PaywalledIsrael has denied citizenship to a fourmonthold infant whose Israeli father died during her mothers pregnancy.The mother a nonJewish woman from Ethiopia lived with the Israeli father in a commonlaw marriage in Netanya. The couple had two other children who have Israeli citizenship.The Interior Ministrys Population and Immigration Authority did not respond to the mothers repeated requests to grant the baby citizenship after her birth. This week the authority finally told the mother she must produce a court ruling in order to obtain citizenship for her daughter.The baby who was born prematurely has no legal status in Israel so cannot receive medical treatment under the state health insurance law. Because of this she was discharged too early from the hospitals premature babies ward. The family cannot afford the examinations and medical treatments she needs and so far she hasnt been receiving any.The mother who was in the process of receiving a residents status as the partner of an Israeli citizen is also in an uncertain position due to his death. Her visa is due to expire on Friday and she has not received an option to extend it.The father Mesegnau Moshe Trakin of Ethiopian descent died last May of cardiac arrest leaving behind his partner Pentai Marga and their children Daniel  and Yosef . Marga was then three months pregnant. Their daughter ShaiLi was born in November in Landiado Hospital in Netanya.The hospital asked the mother to get the babys legal status sorted out as soon as possible so that she could be insured in a health maintenance organization.But a month after she was born the Netanya branch of the Registration Authority said that due to the fathers death the decision to register the baby as an Israeli must be made by higher ranking ministry officials.Some two months after the birth when no progress had been made the familys lawyer approached the authority again noting the infant needs more comprehensive tests but the family is unable and shouldnt have to finance them. So far we have received no response despite the registration urgency.Last week the authoritys Netanya deputy director replied that after consulting with Jerusalem it was decided the mother must produce a family court ruling to register her daughter.So far ShaiLi has received nothing she isnt a member of a health maintenance organization her mother Marga told Haaretz on Wednesday. In the hospital they made a list of tests she must undergo. I cant pay for any of them.She said she couldnt afford private health insurance. My visa expires on Friday. I have no answer no appointment with the Interior Ministry. I cant work without a visa. Where will I find work? How will I raise three children?The baby has no ID card or any papers. I cant put her in a day care center its  shekels a month. How will I pay? I have rent electricity taxes children she said.Ultimately says attorney Eilam this isnt a legal matter. Its a matter of ShaiLi a fourmonthold baby an Israeli citizen by birth. Not only was she born a premie and orphaned from her father but due to the ministrys completely ignoring our numerous requests to register her as a citizen she was discharged too early from hospital and isnt getting the medical treatment she needs.Eilam said the authoritys manager in Netanya told him explicitly that they had no doubt the late Mesangau was ShaiLis father and had he not died they would have registered her as his daughter and as an Israeli without delay.Despite this and after months of endangering the babys health and safety the ministry has decided to punish the family further and demand a court ruling as a condition for registering her. This is an unnecessary demand which makes no legal or other sense. The interior minister must ask himself if additional expenses of thousands of shekels and a delay of many more months until the baby is registered as an Israeli is the way to go he said.The authority said in response that under the procedure a minor with an Israeli father may be granted citizenship if the mother is legally allowed to stay in Israel as his commonlaw wife. Due to the regrettable circumstances in this case we cannot act according to procedure so Mrs. Marga was asked to get a court ruling for her daughters registration.As for the mothers status the authority said that since the Israeli partner died before the process was completed the case was passed to the examination of the interministerial committee on humanitarian matters.,worldpolitics,deend61,2,t5_2qh9a
