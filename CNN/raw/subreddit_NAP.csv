5893298,0,t1_cxs106r,Who says it is the best social strategy?Its a principle that all humans OUGHT to adhere to. If  every human did adhere to it indcluding Somalis and Mexicans there would be no problem at all. Surely the NAP would be adhered in a high trust society those NRxers keep going on about. The fact that non whites are less likely to not to be libertarians can be taken it account but again that still doesnt matter.Aggression is wrong. Period.The next question is what happens when aggression will be committing regardless of what happens? This is where the open borders libertarians lose the plot.They just stress the fact that borders are the initiation of force against immigrants and thats it. The mistake is looking at the issue independently. Open borders just redirects any aggression towards the native populance who are forced to fund the arrival of these new migrants deal with minimun wage laws and forced association laws. There is also the fact that migrants is much more likely to democratically vote for leftist parties. This means an even bigger state.If someone is going to get hurt. I have a personally preference to make sure it the other guy not me.,NAP,cxs58ul,4,t5_2sk0o
