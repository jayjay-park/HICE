4766017,0,t1_ctgg4ez,This should have been fixed in one of the updates. You should go buy the game and if possible make it to Sum Tunnel within  hours to see if the game is still unplayable since Google Play has a refund option which lasts  hours.,EvoCreo,ctvati7,1,t5_30b4j

6697953,0,t1_d0bol26,Cant really base much on stats since higher stars will have higher stats. Lumigon is a good creo with void and gamma available. I think the first evolution learns shadow maul sometime so if you missed that an attack based version may not be optimal.Again in game you should be fine. You have several advantages over the enemy to use that help close the gap in star difference. ,EvoCreo,d0c4jzq,1,t5_30b4j
7737916,0,t3_4ktd73,The creo you bought is likely from the most recent update. You can indeed use the creo devolver on it as long as it is still level .,EvoCreo,d3lqtkq,1,t5_30b4j
