4641609,0,t1_ctfc1da,I think the .b is headed in the right direction but its still a bit harsh. I currently have .m shards and decently leveled buildings. I let it run overnight and have m pending. However that  increase in shards only bumps my income bonus up around  meaning I cant get back to  heroes any time soon.Also it doesnt look like theres a counter for the Lich boss. Was that intentional?,SAGAIdle,ctfn3d0,1,t5_38wu4
