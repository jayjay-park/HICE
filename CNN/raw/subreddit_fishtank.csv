210264,0,t1_cf2cogi,How did you cycle the tank?It sounds like its cycling now which leads me to believe it didnt cycle in the first place. ,fishtank,cf2e66i,2,t5_2rdvk
456834,0,t3_1yji4j, days of no food isnt really a lot. When I go on vacation I will leave the fish for up to a week or so with no food.  So perhaps something was off in the water?  Sounds like maybe it was since a water change fixed things.  Of course my first line of defense whenever a fish seems off is a water change.  If there were still a bunch of gunk on the bottom after the water change that doesnt sound good either.  You should be vacuuming out that gunk when you are doing the water change.Im glad your fish are doing well.  If you regularly forget to feed them for days on end that could cause problems and as others have mentioned an automatic feeder might be wise.  Also checking the water chemistry from time to time is a good idea.  Any chance of moving the aquarium to where you will see it more regularly and think about it?,fishtank,cfs6w7h,2,t5_2rdvk
673306,0,t3_21v440,For those small schooling fish rasboras and tetras I wouldnt be surprised to lose one or two at all sometimes they look good at the pet store but the stress of moving helps do them in. Its why a lot of online places send a lot of extras in large orders of those schooling fish.  I wouldnt worry unless all the rummynoses look bad or your other fish start looking rough.,fishtank,cggszgy,3,t5_2rdvk

5864493,0,t3_3uhslx,For a first tank I would say to aim for  gallons.  The best tip I ever received Make sure to not add fish too quickly.  I would start your tank with a few cheap feeders one fish per  gallons to get it cycling. Look into low maintenance live plants  they make it so much easier to maintain the tank.  They act as a natural filter and aerator for you tank.  I would look into adding live plants about  weeks after initial start up.  After your tank is fully cycled  weeks or so I would add no more than . inches of fish per gallon weekly not to ever exceed more than an inch of fish per gallon.Sorry for the disjointedness of this post I kept thinking of things to add as I was writing!,fishtank,cxod6c3,1,t5_2rdvk
6052380,0,t1_cychwsb,So you could keep a  inch fish in a  gallon tank? You can get away with a few small fish but the rule still stands for larger fish in tanks.,fishtank,cycyuzv,1,t5_2rdvk
7299672,0,t3_4f9g8o,As a freshwater guy this is the one thing that makes me consider jumping to salt.  It would be so cool to have a school of clown fishes inside a bunch of big anemones.  What an amazing showpiece tank! ,fishtank,d27x8ph,1,t5_2rdvk

8035832,0,t3_4p545x,I moved  hours. Took water from tank and placed it in a double stacked sterilite container.  Cut a small hole on top and placed a battery operated air pump into it.  Add stress coat.,fishtank,d4jaww7,1,t5_2rdvk
8701209,0,t3_4z4dun,I dont mean to be a debby downer it looks like a great start! but you have a few issues with your current stock. Neon tetras should be kept in groups of  minimum as well as the cory they are both schooling fish and can become stressed in low numbers. Also the albino rainbow shark may become aggressive towards your other fish and will out grow that aquarium in no time they are very territorial and need an aquarium with a large foot print to accommodate them. If you have any questions im happy to try to help I just want to see you and all your fishes happy ,fishtank,d6ta7ys,5,t5_2rdvk
9156546,0,t1_d8cdlon,I figured Id have to go to a g but a betta and two snails sounds like a perfect population to start with. I heard Plecos do well with bettas too I assume they need a larger space though? I was planning on doing live plants so Ill definitely give that a look! I saw some mention of fishless cycles in my prior research Ill go back and make sure I know what Im doing before I go any further. Thank you for your help!,fishtank,d8cnpow,1,t5_2rdvk
