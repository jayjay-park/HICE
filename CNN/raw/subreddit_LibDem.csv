8920616,0,t3_52gust,Since the Financial Times sometimes has a paywall...David Davis flanked by his fellow Brexiters made his first statement in Parliament this week on Britains impending EU exit since starting his new job. It was a masterclass in speaking while saying nothing. Questions of substance were dodged by the Brexit secretary under the sensiblesounding pretext that the government wants to take the time to get it right.The reality is that time is not on our side. Prime Minister Theresa May has made a commitment to implement Article  at the beginning of  from that point on we only have two years to put everything in place to ensure a smooth transition to the sunny uplands Mr Davis told us awaits.Brexit will make a deep mark on British life. Most importantly it will upend our trading relationships with Europe and the rest of the world. Only  per cent of UK total trade is with countries that are neither members of the EU nor covered by an EU trade agreement that is in force or under negotiation.Brexit ministers have argued that far from creating risk leaving the EU will unlock growth by freeing us to sign trade agreements with whomsoever we please. Unlike Michael Gove the proBrexit former justice secretary I think we need to listen more to experts not less. In an attempt to ensure someone is holding the government to account I have been working with experts to find answers to the difficult questions the government is refusing to address.Since the vote in June we have been analysing the implications of Brexit for trade and on Thursday I presented the findings on a platform alongside Peter Sutherland the former founding directorgeneral of the World Trade Organisation. The conclusions are stark. The idea that we will be signing any new trade deal in the next two years is a pipe dream because of what government officials call sequencing. We will have to do things in a particular order and it will take time.First Article  has to be triggered which sets the clock ticking on the exit negotiations. These talks are primarily about how we disentangle ourselves from the EU. Trade discussions will start during this twoyear period but they are very unlikely to conclude rapidly because of the number of issues to be resolved. While this is going on Liam Fox international trade secretary would like to be lining up new deals with China India and the US. He can try but as Australia has made clear  we will not be able to progress beyond informal talks because the UK is not legally able to sign its own agreements until it leaves the EU customs union.In practice no one will want to sign deals with us then either. Potential partners will want to see what trading terms we manage to negotiate with the EU before they put forward their own offer. This means waiting until a full UKEU agreement is negotiated which is likely to take several more years. The closest model the EUCanada trade agreement was launched in  it has still not been ratified .A trade agreement with the EU will in some respects make doing business with the continent much harder. Exporters in the UK have been promised a red tapefree Eutopia but they have been sold a pup. Substituting Britains current arrangement for a freetrade agreement will create a deluge of paperwork for exporters who will have to put their products through exhaustive customs checks and comply with complex rules of origin to prove where their goods and component parts were manufactured.The most likely scenario is that the UK leaves the EU without any preferential trade deal in place. We will therefore lose access to more than  existing freetrade agreementsEven with a UKEU agreement in place there is one further hoop to jump through. The UK will have to establish its own schedule of commitments  the tariffs it proposes to levy on imported goods and services  at the WTO before any country will do a deal with us. This requires negotiation with  other countries any one of which could derail the process in the hope of extracting concessions.Our analysis suggests the most likely scenario is that the UK leaves the EU without any preferential trade deal in place  and without a WTO schedule of commitments. We will therefore lose access to more than  existing freetrade agreements. For these reasons we recommend trying to negotiate an interim arrangement possibly based on the Norwegian model with continued membership of the single market but the flexibility to pursue our own trading deals.So where is the government on all of this? Not even at first base. Mr Davis breezily says it will make a decision whether to leave the customs union before Article  is triggered. The Conservatives are stuck between a rock and a hard place stay in the customs union and Mr Foxs department might as well close its doors. Leave and British exporters to the EU will be hit by a tangle of red tape.Ministers must make their plans for Britains trading relationships clear as soon as possible. We are in the calm before the storm. Whatever form Brexit takes it is going to be a rough ride.,LibDem,d7k4lmm,1,t5_2qwov

The justification that people wont vote for the LibDems because of tuition fees was ex post facto  vindication for dropping support rather than a cause of the drop. Tuition fees most likely did however cement this drop and prevent the number going back up.

Of course we often talk about the SNP as representing Scottish nationalism but in reality they represent both separatism and nationalism in this way the SNP is unique amongst separatist groups in Europe. Scotland has a long established and fairly recent history as a nation unlike for example Catalonia. Even though I am a staunch unionist both for pragmatic and idealistic reasons I think this is at the heart of why the Union is so fragile and likely to fall apart it is essentially still a personal union. It didnt come about because of some great feeling of unity between the peoples of England Wales and Scotland it came about because of purely political reasons and although a British identity has certainly developed and even become the dominant identity in the country there is still a feeling of separation between the English Welsh and Scots Im omitting Northern Ireland for various reasons which are too convoluted to explain here that does not exist in most unitary countries which we supposedly are or even in federal states.
