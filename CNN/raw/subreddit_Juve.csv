905593,1,t3_24hko9,Here comes Conte whining like a little girlConte The team that least deserved it went through.What didnt work was that we didnt get that incident going our way. Its a shame as these games are right on the limit Benfica obstructed us at every turn and the referee allowed them to do it.He gave six minutes of stoppages when we were already three in without playing so it took us for a ride said Conte of English referee Mark Clattenburg.Its a shame as with two shots on target over two legs Benfica went through. Over the two games Juventus certainly deserved to go through.I think Juventus gave all they had. It is an exciting but also very exhausting season because for the first time weve reached the final stages of European competition.I dont think we saw a team struggling to stay on its feet tonight. They ran from the first to the th minute. It was a strong performance we didnt get the lucky moment we needed to change the game so in that sense Benfica were more fortunate.It was a real pity as in the first leg there was a red card and penalty for the elbow on Chiellini while tonight there was an obvious penalty not given. The team that least deserved it went through.You just have to look at the statistics. Benfica had two shots on target over two legs. That was it. They have international experience and showed it tonight as down to  men they stopped us playing and I am truly disappointed the referee allowed them to get away with that.Conte needs to man up and stop making excuses for this team.

Whether you want to take this concept politically or talk about it in the context of Juve... Conte holds Juve to the highest standards and Im glad he does it loser mentality? Hell no absolute winner mentality. He expects nothing short of perfection GOOD. We were the closest to competing with them apart from being wrong when you consider Dortmund really means nothing in the end when you cant beat scrub teams. Celta Vigo beat Real Madrid too for that matter just a couple weeks before the final Celta ready to win the CL?

What we and many other big clubs do is use players from the youth team to fill the requirement. We have Giovinco and Marchisio who are homegrown in the first team and I believe we used Mattiello and Marrone to fill the other two. This is precisely why Coman is a great deal and why we let him sit on the bench instead of loaning him out. Hes  when he joined which means if we keep him here all  years hell be clubgrown.We also need to register at least a total of  nationtrained trained in the nation for at least  years before the age of  including the  club trained players.

3187767,0,t1_coscgp1,I think people who say that dont know anything about soccer. BvB is a high flying counter attack style team. Pirlo is a player you want because he can hold up play and bring players into him and then redistribute when hes made space for others.

On a personal level id like to avoid PSG. This is because I want to see PSG vs Juve in the Semis. I dont mind facing Madrid but id rather avoid it. Madrid is still the best team with the best players. Maybe not the best team but undoubtably better than Juve on a technical level. Id like to see us drawing Monaco. That would be ideal.

You cant say for sure a final is a totally different animal its totally unique how they players play is down to how much they want that trophy on the day. A final is the most unpredictable match in any tournament. I would say we have a strong chance of making it and a even stronger chance of winning it he have a strong midfield and an incredible defense for us to line up against Real and further Bara or Bayern. We can do it Allegri knows we can do it Vidal and the players want to do it they have the skillset to achieve it. I hope against all else we as fans see that as a team we have made it to the semifinal nothing has made me more happy recently than seeing our team get this far. Its incredible my best wishes to the squad they have destroyed any expectation put on them they deserve all the respect in the world. All those years scandal players leaving Conte leaving have finally concluded with this our chance is be champions of Europe once again. Its an honour to watch the old lady at this stage in the CL every player on that squad deserves that trophy although they still have two teams to push over to get it I hope they see that and finally get what they and we deserve.

4237433,0,t1_cs31rsb,I think conceding the early goal actually helped in that respect. I never expected to win  so I always figured wed have to score twice to win. Barca scoring early they really seemed to take their foot off the gas as a result and it definitely settled down for the midpoint of the game.Then we started to impose ourselves Alvaro scored off a Tevez shot dont forget and we were in it for  minutes of intense action and relatively wellrested.

4560454,0,t3_3dih0b,And Thuram too...Ill take this thread as the okay with Vidal departure thread and Ill run a quick analysis of our transfer season so far.As GK we changed Storari  years old for Neto .In defense we signed Rugani  for free and sold Ogbonna  for m.In midfield we apparently sold Vidal  for m and let Pirlo  go we signed Khedira  on a free.In attack we sold Tevez  for m plus Vadal  and we bought three strikers Dybala  for m Mandzukic  for m and Zaza  for m.I believe the first two reparti have been clearly improved with young free signings. Attack is going to be interesting I think we still have to sell Llorente which will give us some more cash but if Dybala and Mandzu perform like they did in the past I think we wont be any weaker. Midfield is going to be less stellar maybe but we dominated even without Vidal last season we have Marchisio in his prime and Pogba one year more mature. Khedira is a WC winner and a midfielder who could start for almost anyone just like Vidal. The net expenditure of the season so far has been m m if we consider coownership resolutions which include fully signing Pereyra and tying up Berardi for next year.I think that it is not a bad window. We may be slightly weaker than last year possibly but we have significantly lowered the average age which was among the highest in Europe big clubs. It had to happen. With the huge money influx from last years CL we might have a lot to splurge on a trequartista maybe well see. Sturaro and Asamoah will be very useful this year Im eager to see if Sturaro develops in a world class player especially.By the way if we wanted to sell Vidal this was the right year  just after him carrying Chile to the Copa America. We will never see that kind of money for him again.,Juve,ct5gnra,16,t5_2t9a7

4600838,0,t1_cta3rqm,Dont think hes just entering his prime. This IS his prime. Plus his injury plagued season and off pitch issues surely factored into depreciating his value.

Lets see who Marotta and Peritici replace Vidal with. ,Juve,ctaiw3u,2,t5_2t9a7
4638521,0,t3_3eig1a,asamoah only played left because we use to have  guys in the middle of the park. to play as a left back with  men in the first line would take sometime for him to adapt and i think he plays better in the middle i dont see asamoah as a evra backup but pogbas left side of the diamond.,Juve,ctf94ri,5,t5_2t9a7

We let them take us all the way till our  yard line till we pressed. What would I have done differently? I would have subbed Pogba and Sandro instead of Morata and Khedira. I would have put Sturaro in for Pogba and Asamoah in for Sandro. Last sub would have put Rugani in for Cuadrado. Now Lich is our right mid and Rugani is the back. I also wouldnt have changed to a  for the little bit of time we did in the second half. I also would have players pressing much higher in our side of the pitch. Started the press on Vidal by Morata instead of placing him on KimmichAlaba. Im ok with playing more defensive Im not ok with parking the bus the entire second half.

I hope if we come away with anything this year it would be that Allegri learned a lot from that game and doesnt repeat that mistake.  Just please dont do another rebuilding this summer.

Lemina is a better option right now he has performed well in Marchisios absence.Gomes is definitely not slower than Isco and Allegri hasnt really prioritised pace in that role earlier. Gomes is a good dribbler and is equally good with both feet in addition to having a decent work rate. Perfect for the trequartista role Allegri has utilised before IMO.,Juve,d2pjg8v,1,t5_2t9a7

7837308,0,t1_d3wx71j,So much wrong information here.Vidal in his last season with Juve wasnt playing as well as he had previously. Struggling to finish  minutes issues with his knee were probably the main cause of that. He then drove drunk and wrote of a Ferrari who are owned by the Agnelli family who own Juventus and who give Ferraris to Juve players when they when Serie A. Ferrari dont sell Ferraris to people who damage their image and combined with his drop in form and the drink driving meant that he was always going to leave or ushered out.Marchisio isnt leaving hes Juve through and through. Nothing more to say. Pogba was given the number  jersey when he signed a new contract last year I believe besides signing a new contract the number is significant as it is so revered at the club. Hes taken on that mantle and responsibility of other greats and it seems like the club were happy to offer it to him. The media arent clued in when it comes to transfers.

Clubs show loyalty as long as it benefits them too lets not forget. Were hardly ever angry at clubs pushing people out because their washed up. But we always go at the players heads and call them money whores or disloyal.Pogba did some good things at this club people should instead focus on that. The pain of him leaving will pass.

8812584,0,t1_d774ihu,The  was more of an asymmetric formation with Cuadrado playing more like a winger while Sandro played a more reserved role with Pogba helping as well its not quite the same thing. We should have Dybala and Higuain up front every time now. Note that we lost that game after Khedira was subbed.With Lichtsteiner being left out of the CL squad and having  CBs with  very attacking RWBRMs I think well stick with the  in the Champions League. I could be dead wrong because Allegri always has something up his sleeve but thats what looks likely to me. Maybe his classic  with Pjanic in the hole but that depends on the fitness of the squad. If Marchisio and Khedira were both injured I think that would be even more case for a  man midfield but I am not a master tactician like Allegri so well see what happens  ,Juve,d775ih6,1,t5_2t9a7

Mandzukic didnt do well at all either and Dybala seemed a little frustrated in his play.

9023146,0,t1_d7wffmz,Its because of the midfield. Pjanic Lemina and Hernanes are good at moving the ball around. Khedira doesnt get involved as much and Asamoah slows the play down too much also in the last game Pjanic was regista so he was too far back to be properly involved. This midfield set up is way better and can only be improved in a technical aspect I believe by the addition of Marchisio. Id throw on Khedira for overall effectiveness though.,Juve,d7wfvv6,5,t5_2t9a7

You cant only compare sheer ability when training material and so many things have changed over the years.

The question I have for you though is why does this matter so much to you?I hope that you dont allow the possibility of being down voted by other users keep you from posting an opinion that to me seems worse than the people who just dont understand the etiquette and think theyre right to down vote an opinion they disagree with.My point is if you believe what you say that its an internet discussion forum not a voting poll or popularity contest. then why do you care so much about seeing others being down voted or being down voted yourself? Im not trying to come off as preachy here although I sense I am but it seems far more logical to me that if you dont think the popularity of your comment matters what matters is that you make your comment heard then you shouldnt bother with this kind of stuff rather you should perhaps just continue on posting what you think you should post and whoever wishes to vote in whatever way can please themselves by doing so.

He had no importance to the team here he also never reached an acceptable standard of play either but all that seems to be forgotten because he posts a few instagram videos laughing and joking with teammates or a comment praising Juventus.The truth is that many of the people here have some fondness for United and liked Evra there and thought the positives he had there would immediately transfer over. They never really judged him on his play in the position he has spent most of his career in but had no problem judging other new signings slotting into new positions overnight.Evra was not a good signing and will be looked back as having the same impact as Salihamidzic did,Juve,dcxhdzt,2,t5_2t9a7

11205438,0,t3_5zwzc1,If we dont lose first leg we have a chance. Need to keep it minimal score ideally not concede at all.Id take a  tbh then go to Nou Camp and advance with a  or smth.But its going to be really really tough match. I really hope noone of the starters gets injured before these games. Thats why im worried with the formation Allegri needs to rotate. Luckily i saw our schedule isnt the hardest during those games in serie a.,Juve,df24es4,5,t5_2t9a7

11680619,0,t3_66obo6,I think our biggest enemy against an opponent such as Monaco is overconfidence. Not of the sort who are these chumps? but the kind that can affect a team that beat Barcelona  over two legs and now has to play a less proven less established team. That said Im cautiously optimistic. The best team we could get out of the three and probably will make for an exciting match up. ,Juve,dgk0jlf,13,t5_2t9a7
