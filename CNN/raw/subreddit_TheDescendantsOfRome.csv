And he couldnt be more wrong. In fact it is the complete opposite. I am targeting him because he is so weak. He may have big muscles but his mind is weak. He is on a knifes edge and is I push him the right way he will destroy the camp for me. You see really the only thing I have done to you is stab Oliver. Let us look back shall we. The whole thing with Zander and Ollie....that was all Zander. In fact I now wish Mr. Winchester had died because he is one of the only things holding your camp together and I sent him a letter as well. Next...the fire. I didnt set it. It was another of your beloved campers...Maya isnt even my favorite little helper. And finally with Emerald. That was all Mayas idea. She suggested attacking a praetor she suggested Emerald and she cut her throat. Now why am I telling you this. I want you to see how little I have done...that with a few suggestions you destroyed yourself. This is what happens when you put psychos like Steele and Mitch and Aeliana in charge.
