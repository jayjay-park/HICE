1961278,0,t1_ckmm4gv,v Clan Battles sound so much fun and all but it rarely works out. You have to get ! People together at the same time with a few hours of spare time. The only game I saw this working in was WoW and that was an RPG at first and mostly played by  year old school children back then me included. CS is still going strong because its highly competitive and you only need  other players to make a match same goes for games like League of Legends. If you dont have a clan with AT LEAST  people you are very rarely going to assemble  to play.I doubt Clan play is the way to go I think expansion and new content might help. If you see other WW games like War Thunder for example. Everyone is sticking to that game for the eventual World War mode where you combine Air Sea and Land forces one one huge battlefield to fight against each other. They release new Tanks and Planes on a monthly basis and balance changes role out all the time. Now thats not really possible for RO but at least a few alternatives to K and Mosin would help the game. The tanks also seem very well done but they lack proper maps to be effective and fun to play on I suppose. Mods and user created content is what keeps Skyrim going strong until today. The only thing really available right now is Territory but I would love for some other gamemodes to become popular maybe a coop mode or plan defense and attack before one decisive battle with only one lifetldr RO isnt dead but Clan support is not its problem new weapons maps and gamemodes might help the game.,redorchestra,ckpjash,1,t5_2rr0a

I dont think the mg isnt viable anymore it still is great in its own ways but they really need to decrease the rate at which the barrels heat up.

3651380,0,t3_325aq5,Konigzplatz was the quintessential RO map for me. Germans had to rely on superior small arms against Russian artillery and tanks. It was perfectly balanced. The Germans would run out of reinforcements around  minutes making the end game extremely intense as they tried to fall back from C amongst the onslaught. Run out at  Russians would usually win. Out at ? Germans stood a damn good chance. Great combined arms warfare that defined everything the game was about.There were a ton of really great maps in RO though.Smolensk Stalemate Odessa Zhitomir  all classics. Other personal favorites of mine includedTcherkassy  a great defense map if you played German. Urban combat done right.Krasnyi Oktyabr  Russian sided as hell but if you won as the Germans attacking it felt great. Last moments inside the warehouse always got extremely intense. Good bleak atmoshpere to it.Kryukovo  Underrated as hell early war combine arms map. Largely forgotten about.Really there was a ton of really solid maps in RO many of them community made.

8000352,0,t3_4ordvw,Id go with a fictional futuristic setting keep the main parts of the series the combined arms objective based large scale brutal combat but throw in a bunch of equipment scenarios and environments never seen before in that type of game. You could have all sorts of crazy stuff like energy weapons jetpacks and transformable vehicles but leave out the CoDish crap like lockon weapons energy shields that tank bullets or guns with real easy handling.I figure Verdun already has realisticish WW multiplayer combat down then soon well have Battlefield  on the more arcadey side.I reckon more WW would be a missed opportunity to do something new and interesting and theres a small resurgence of WW games with stuff like Battalion  on the way anyway. Korea might be interesting but again is pretty similar to WW in that it features almost all of the same weapons and gear and balancing the different armies in a way that makes them equally powerful but still unique would probably be pretty difficult. Some interesting but lesser known settings like the Second SinoJapanese War or Soviets in Afghanistan or Chechnya might be cool but with would make an already fairly niche game series even more so. Modern warfare scenarios have already been done to death and the more realistic side of this time period is being handled pretty well by ARMA  and Squad.If you could somehow take the unique parts of the series we know and love and place them into a futuristic setting with all kinds of far out stuff that still manages to fit the style of the game well it could create something really great that no one has ever done before. Course the actual name Red Orchestra wouldnt make sense anymore they could just pull a Rising Storm and just give it a different title but more or less still consider it a full part of the franchise.Theres been loads of WW or modern warfare games that lean towards the harsher realistic side but as far as I know no one has even tried this sort of thing in a futuristic setting yet I havent played any sort of futurebased action game that actually felt like playing through an actual conflict or came anywhere close to the intensity of a game like RO. ,redorchestra,d4fbdgm,-8,t5_2rr0a

8667851,0,t1_d6p2qp2,Father Lemons joined Red Orchestra out of the blue as early as JuneJuly. Ever since he joined hes been wrecking people left and right within those two months. On one hand he has a lifetime of playing Counter Strike. On the other hand the majority of players have a harder time getting the feng shui of Red Orchestra without getting a grasp of the games flowmaps.Out of respect to both individuals pride I wont say hes the same as  Million Pies but both characters came out of the blue  Million started playing Red Orchestra in January of this year and have resulted in becoming a rising star cult of personality. Theyre both charismatic in the since that since they gather a love relationship with one group they are a linger stinker to another group of individuals. You can see it in the amount of players renaming their avatars  Million... makarons tears memes fries... Some people do it out of love while others do it out of hate. Lemons is the same and has a serious sheibe following. In other words there is a group of players that will not play Alliesonserver if  Million is playing. Andthere is a group that wont play Axisonserver if Lemons is on.Now  Million Pies is a very passionate opinionated individual. And like all antistaxis generals you become a bit nutty from the job. So like all abandoned individuals on a Jihad against the Staxis Crusade he is on a lonely road to find out and ghostbust all the hackers on Merrills lax cancer.So through and through all these introductions... The meat and potatoes is that a good following of both Axis and Allied players including and not including  MP followers have been suspect of Father Lemons hacking. In the same way that the South thought every Northerner was a John Brown abolitionist nut every time someone votekicks Lemons they think its a crazy MP justiceled fanboy. And every time MP starts to get kicked people on the Allies think its a Father Lemons led conspiracy. Selfperpetuating cycle of people being in love and hate  in war.Ironically when a single player starts to try and kick one the cycle begins  like speaking of Trump on Merrills RS. The accusationshackusations begin and one wont get booted without the other also getting vote kicked. Quite romantically attached like one man hiding in the closet while the other is under the bed. Both waiting for the other to get in bed first. Their fates are tied.Now I dont know whether Father Lemons is hacking. The video is suspect sure but more evidence is needed. If he does hes a cunt worse than Garmo. If he doesnt he adds to the passion injection that is the testosteronic sausagefest that is Merrills RO aka cancer to the haters. In the same way that  MP is a perfect fit in the dying old world where men could be mencharacters with some serious character flaws hung on their sleeves.,redorchestra,d6p3o01,8,t5_2rr0a

8961093,0,t3_530w48,I think by large scale battles they mean  players. Rather than map size. But who knows.Expanding the map size but keeping the player size the same really makes things smaller. In the RO series your team is about the size of a platoon. So you fight as a platoon. Rather than in small squads dotted around a massive map which is why project reality is. The biggest battles in something like project reality is when the whole team is fighting for a single flag. Rarely are you fighting for more than  in project reality. When you are or theres not many people around a flag in PR thr largest your combat is going to get is  squad fighting another.With the new squad system players create squads. Rather than you being forced in a certain squad based on your class. Giving you more freedom to play with friends or change squad if you think your current squad leader is a bit rubbish.,redorchestra,d7ozlqj,10,t5_2rr0a

Things like HUD or FF are just the tip of an iceberg.In a game like BF one hit kills is making the gameplay even more random and chaotic in a bad way. Consider how much of shit there is to randomly kill you but wait there is even more of that!One hit kills in games like RO are fine since the whole gameplay is very precise. On the other hand in BF you cant control the recoil since it doesnt even match the moves of iron sights. Its completely random.

Half the time I play Cu Chi I dont have a TL and it pisses me off. Honestly I feel like vietnamese SLs are more enjoyable to play as if I get my ass plugged full of trashy nam era . rounds I can just keep my squad in the fight and I KNOW that I need those tunnels up and to keep moving them when I hear a loach.

11616114,0,t1_dgceqc2,It got popular on American servers because it works. Just because the attacking team is incompetent doesnt mean the strategy should be utilized.  I agree that B amp D are both good points to hold. However they are not great for draining the enemy tickets. The only reason to defend them is to hope for a lockdown and if that fails the ticket situation is probably worse that what it started as.With falling straight back to F the team has time to plant traps set up in proper positions and receive directions from the team leader. If theres MGs watching the main entrances assaults on the stairs rifles on the ground floor and squad leaders upstairs F will be defended  times.I guess that this can go back to what Chip said about the original post gtThe idea of defending a single point comes from many vets realisation that some points are pointless to defend and a much better understanding of the ticket game and taking advantage of the lockdown system. Defending some points results in a defensive ticket drain which is insane!
