1265486,0,t1_ci9n7e6,Well Ill try to give it to you in a nutshell. When I say all I mean that this is a most verbs most of the time rule. Also it is a simplified form. This is not going to be a full dissertation rather just a view into how verbs are viewed. Also note that this is both book Persian and in a Latinized form.Verbs come in two forms  a present stem and  a past stem. Their infinitive is always past stem  an. But you wont really use that all that much so forget about it for now.On those stems encliticsaffixes are applied sometimes on the front sometimes on the back sometimes both.The enclitic that is almost always applied to the end of a verb stem is the personal pronoun enclitic. While there are stand alone personal pronouns in Persian you dont really need them because of this personal pronoun enclitic. These are am I and they im we and so on.In the present tense there are two prefixes on verb stems  mi which is like ing in English and  be which is like to in English.There are past imperfect future and other tenses in Persian as well but dont worry about those for now.Lets take a few verb stems and run some examples using what we learned above To Go Past Stem  raft Present Stem  ravI went raftam. They went raftand. We went raftim.I am going miravam. They are going miravand. We are going miravim. To Want Past Stem  khst Present Stem  khhI wanted khstam. They wanted khstand. We wanted khstim.I want mikhham. They want mikhhand. We want mikhhim.And together Want to GoI wanted to go khstam beravam. They wanted to go khstand beravand. We wanted  khstim beravim.I want to go mikhham beravam. They want to go mikhhand beravand. We want to go mikhhim beravim.Verbs always appear at the end of sentence so the subject will come before them if needed. Bachcheh is children and is plural. The children went would be bachcheh raftand and the children want to go would be bachcheh mikhhand beravand.If you have specific questions Im sure everyone here would be more than willing to help out.,learnfarsi,cibzekg,1,t5_2y9zj
