2226172,0,t1_clmbjor,I honestly dont know.Im still on Windows  since is working fine with everything.You can try using SweetFX through RandeonPRO then even if you have a Nvidia card. But Im not sure if newer SweetFX shaders such GAUSSIAN will work. Or wait a little bit for SweetFX ..,sweetfx,clmstby,1,t5_2vyhz

4319888,0,t3_3aafg7,If SweetFX was a game then Reshade would be the engine that it ran on.Reshade handles injection so the game will use the SweetFX shaders.  It copies the framebuffer from the game the game output so that SweetFX has something to work with.  It can grab the depthbuffer from many  but not all games so that effects that use the game depth information can be used.  It displays the output of SweetFX on the screen.  It displays fps clock and statistics.  It handles keypresses.  It takes screenshots.  It translates the shader code in SweetFX . to the language needed for the API you are using DD DD DD or OpenGL.  It wraps DD code to DD allowing you to apply SweetFX shaders even to DD games DD technically had shaders but they were very limited  It monitors changes to the shader and settings files and recompiles SweetFX when changes are detected so they take effect immediately.  It provides SweetFX with additional helpful stuff like time and frame  counters that can be used to create effects that have movement or change over time.It does not process the game image .. all that is done by the SweetFX shaders.,sweetfx,csckwgj,6,t5_2vyhz
