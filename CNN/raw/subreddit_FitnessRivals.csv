4821394,0,t1_cu29rgj,I ate a lot still ate mostly clean just a ton more than I used to and Ive been going to the gym  days a week. I guess the mental acknowledgment that Im bulking helped out too. ,FitnessRivals,cu29ykv,1,t5_393pf
4870629,0,t1_cu8gqrn,Im  lbs from my goal of  youre . from your goal of . Anyone could still win. Yeah this has been fun. Knowing that if I mess up too much on a weekend will ruin my weighin has helped keep me in check.Ill probably reversediet back up to maintenance once I hit . I started SL x about a month ago and I foolishly started with the program minimums just the bar for most lifts. Its been pretty boring so far although Im definitely worried more about getting my form down. It seems like I have a minor injury each week so thats slowing me down as well. One week its a shoulder this week its in the hamstringglutelower back area. Hoping to get all that sorted so I can get back on track and get to challenging weight ASAP. I guess what Im doing a horrible job of saying is yes another challenge would be fun. I assume youll be starting when you get back from trip? Not sure how we would track progress on a bulk as I certainly dont need motivation to gain weight as quickly as possible. Maybe we can use calipers to track lean mass gains? ,FitnessRivals,cu8hai4,1,t5_393pf
