2535050,0,t3_2oq47k,I used to play kendama in Japan when I was little but it was like an oldtimey toy you would find at street venders and old village reenactments we were much more focused on Super Mario Brothers .  Recently I got into yoyos and was amazed to come across all these people playing kendama here in the states!  Right around this time I see the kickstarter for the kendama website and decided I had to get back into it.I wish I knew if I have any saved anywhere. They all had paint jobs like these tops I managed to dig up.    I cant imagine kendama from the s would be comparable to the quality that are being made now right?   Is it worth digging in attic boxes?,Kendama,cmpgu92,4,t5_2skuv

3379052,0,t3_2ysfis,Activities like this require a fair deal of reflection and analysis as you play around in order to improve. For the specific tricks you mentioned learning to control the ball while moving between cups is crucial. Having the hole facing you when going for spike is ideal so you can visually track it. Experiment and notice how the hole moves when you move the ken in different ways. ,Kendama,cpdfr04,3,t5_2skuv

F have an updated ken shape and pretty amazing paint as well. All are great choices. A portion of Pro Mods go to the pro F is the new updated Sweets kendama and Roots have pretty much the best paint on the market. My pros of each. All of them dont have any cons.

5580214,0,t1_cwocfhv,Ok. You are gonna want to take a lighter and lightly char the area where the cups go then soak it in dihydrogen monoxide. Itll soak in and grow the wood to about .x the normal size. It should then be soft enough to where you can place the cups exactly where you want them and they will fuse to the spike. If that doesnt work you should turn the kendama upside down slowly back your car over it ,Kendama,cworzwd,1,t5_2skuv

7182598,0,t1_d1ua4ba,While I understand that it is inevitable that you will learn how to juggle just as you would with a long string so long as you just keep trying. Getting accustomed to a nontypical style of play to learn something vs. learning it the way is meant to be learned is for one thing more rewarding and another thing it will provide the learner more practice overall. Kendama is a challenge  you will have to overcome difficulties at all points in learning the game. Might as well start early. Your strategy can work in other types of learning as has been shown by many schooling related studies. ,Kendama,d1ulk2b,1,t5_2skuv
