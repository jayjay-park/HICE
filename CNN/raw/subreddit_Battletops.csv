8578926,0,t1_d6duwxo,it is impressive and I wish that I could claim I had something to do with figuring out how this is done. But theres actually a really active community of tech people who developed the whole egpu concept and wrote code to make it work. I bought a unit based on their work because I didnt want any hassle trying to figure anything out. Even though I did devote a fair amount of time to this setup I dont have the time I used to have to wade through all the technical issues of assembling something DIY.,Battletops,d6dy7ni,3,t5_36bk4

10489965,0,t1_dcx4hob,I know they will remove a imac setup I have seen that happen before as well. I get they want PCMASTERRACE all cool with that here but this is my battlestation even if it lacks a physical tower the mac mini is certainly a desktop and combined with my mbp not sure how its not a battlestation. But I will take some extra karma from rmacsetups as well.,Battletops,dcx5bth,2,t5_36bk4
11471911,0,t1_dfvop37,Hey so Ive got it up and running the same model but how do you get the visual appearance like on the laptop in the picture ,Battletops,dfwc3kv,1,t5_36bk4
11717414,0,t1_dgo4m8x,They are fairly impressive for their size! The sound is well balanced mids and highs are taken care of. Plenty of clarity and a great tight bass for their size. If youre not satisfied with the lack of a deep bass you can always add a subwoofer later. They wont fill a room as much yet works wonders in this xm office. Its definitely up to audiophile level! Just... Cheaper and smaller than a real audiophile hifi set. Lets say you wont fool anyone that they are bigger than they are. I attached it via USB and made them work their own DAC which does make a slight difference in quality. Oh and putting them close to the wall really helps with the bass. Id mention that the controls are all on the back side. I have not problems with that because I control the volume with my laptop. If I play some deep house synthy music or jazz they sound terrific. That tight bass and clarity in voice great. As you venture to the music with a lot going on metal or so I find myself turning down the volume a bit. It gets muddy sometimes. For what they are what they sound like and how cool they look Id definitely recommended them. Just dont expect to get a studio sound in this tiny package.,Battletops,dgo7520,2,t5_36bk4
