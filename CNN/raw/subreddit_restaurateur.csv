662532,0,t3_21q20p,I think this is a terrible strategy.  The way to get more customers in your restaurant is by offering them great food they cant get anywhere else.  If this involves changing your menu you do it.  If it involves adding items to your menu that are not traditional to the cuisine...well...personally Id frigging do it.  You figure out a way to have the best food in your town.  If you cant do it on your own you pay for help.  You find a consultant or chef to help you upgrade your menu and make it trendy.Personally I dont give a shit about a free drink.  In all honesty if I buy lunch at your place Ill buy a drink or I wont...I dont really care if a  drink is a bargain...I want quality food.  If I saw a sign on the street or an advertisement offering a free drink Id dismiss it.,restaurateur,cgfkvhd,1,t5_2u6u9

5765083,0,t1_cxbktnh,I was in Norway recently and at one restaurant the waitress actually left the portable card terminal with the customer unattended while she took care of something else and came back a minute later to pick it up.If places are uncomfortable leaving a regular card terminal something like an Ingenico iWL with a customer unattended then they might look into something like the Ziosk terminal that stays on the table at places like Chilis and Red Robin presumably theyll update to support EMV at some point.,restaurateur,cxbpmqu,2,t5_2u6u9
6418687,0,t3_43l7oa,Having some Seat Yourself tables is a great idea whether top or top.  Sounds like a big place with ish seats around the bar. Encouraging people to wait at the bar with or without having a drink works for some.  Some comfortable waiting seats around the hostess stand is also a great idea.  Bringing around periodic little apps like bread gratis gives people good vibes too.,restaurateur,czj88rv,3,t5_2u6u9

9692084,0,t1_da7it0u,Thanks a lot for the answers. You have a really valid point about nonusers growing resentment for not being rewarded. You mention that its build from a diners perspective  I agree. If I were to go another route and build something from a restaurants persepctive can you mention some problems you as a restaurant operator face? ,restaurateur,da7r6sn,1,t5_2u6u9

11015667,0,t3_5x63vl,I would not suggest closing for a few hours between there. Like others have said prep and clean for the dinner hour and stay open for any in between traffic. You could probably do much of your prep for the next day at this time if you really want to. Yes you will be spending on labor during this time that is the restaurant business. But closing for three hours in the middle of the day is bad for business when people see closed its logical to think for the day. Its also bad for labor if Im working in a restaurant and I have three hours in the middle of the day that I cant be making money Ill find another job. You can also tweak scheduling have more employees during the early day or through lunch then they can go home and the closingdinner shift comes in toward the end of this slow period. ,restaurateur,deglff3,2,t5_2u6u9
