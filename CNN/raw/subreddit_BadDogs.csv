We have spent  years retraining him and he still has behaviors we will never be able to train out of him going after other dogs etc. Its not fair to the dog its not fair to you...and when you eventually snap and get rid of him those behaviors will be so ingrained that his next family will have a hard time helping him adjust. Next time start training the dog RIGHT AWAY. All of those behaviors were easily correctable when he was a baby but now he doesnt know anything different.,BadDogs,df13w6p,2,t5_2sj14
