Usually his relationship to Jacques Ketant is cited as evidence.I dont really have a bias for or against the man personally since I dont follow Haitian politics closely enough to have an informed opinion.

163207,0,t1_cewwybr,Re needing space to play basketball in the islands we played football soccer to you EVERYWHERE. In the classroom at recess in the driveway in the street in a small field or a big field. All you need is a shitty ball and  pairs of shoessandals to make goals heck we use big stones boxes crates doesnt matter. Boys in Brazil gain their skill from small one on ones plays where they could master footwork and keep their endurance up. My brother played everyday for hours coming home sweaty and gross. But as you say its viewed as boring here. For me when I see someone pelting down the field and knowing no matter what I only have  mins to finish a game in most instances youre anxious that entire time. And the build up of them kicking the ball into the goal or missing it is intense joy or heartbreaking sadness. ,Blackfellas,cex0smb,4,t5_2xfe1

But for someone who willingly leads their people into selfdestructive or counterproductive behavior because they know that by doing so they will win the approval of white people the term applies.

People would rather complicate thingshate than simplify and love one another.gtstoop to using my white female privilegeYou have a power to use. Use it. There are ways to use this power that is not reinforcing racism and isolation. If minorities can use their disenfranchisement you can use your privilege. This should go without saying but so often people use guilt as an excuse not to take responsibility or stand up. gtit will be his job to care if I am perceived as a trophy. No it will be his job to take care of you. Theres nothing he can do about other people besides tell them to stopwhich could literally endanger his life. There will not be deep considerationcomprehension that youre seeking until everyone can let this shit go. To expect your man to do this day in and day out is another sign of your privilege. He already has to worry about being perceived as a damn animal every day.  gtI think the people you are talking about are in the minorityMost people maintain biases as far as I can tell not because they think theyre truly right or wrong but because it makes them feel superior and helps group them. Until everyone gets over themselves and acknowledges diversity as an essential part of our world this will not stop occurringwhether you acknowledge it for what it is or not.You need to look into people who talk about black masculinity and femininity and how it is viewed differently than any other race. gtIt is a situation that came up that I wanted some insight into as I had never encountered it before Didnt you just say you had been in many interracial relationships?

Think before you go out and put more of your money in the pockets of these people who hate you and mock your suffering and wish you harm. Do you really need what theyre selling? Is there another place you can get it? Make sure theres no alternative.Ive never had much respect for NOI mythology or ideology but Im becoming more and more convinced that they had the right idea as far as what our people should be doing in the long term. This should be a wakeup call for all of us. What we should be doing is closing ranks. Focusing on maintaining and growing our own neighborhoods towns businesses cultures. Focusing on nonviolently resisting the occupying forces calling themselves law enforcement at every turn. Buying guns to defend ourselves whether from criminals or peace officers and putting together our own peacekeeping forces to keep order in our own communities. Focusing on employing one another and seeing to one anothers needs wherever possible. Keep our money in our communities like every other race does.This is nothing we havent done before. Edit And its imperative we do it again. I believe we are seeing a gradual but deliberate undoing of the civil rights movement. The Supreme Court became complicit when they gutted the Voting Rights Act allowing the southern states to resume their voter suppression efforts.

3586350,0,t1_cq0zzjl,gtWhats wrong with what Raven said? She could mean that she doesnt want to be defined by the color of her skin and feels theres more to her than her complexion.Here you exhibit exactly my point. Why would the topic of Ravens race even come up? Did she bring it up? The simple fact SOMEONE ELSE brought up her race should be the simple clue for her that her attempts to break away from the confines of her blackness are moronic stupidity. That doesnt at all mean I dont understand why shes saying that I just attribute the opinion to stupidity.Hey maybe if black people really try hard to imagine theyre not really black then when they send in their resume the person on the other end wont discriminate against them maybe the cops wont harass them or commit assaults on them maybe the justice system wont punish them overly harshly. We can solve our problems with imagination!Acknowledging my blackness is not a dismissal of my talents my personality my history my culture my nationality my sexuality my gender. All the other things that make me me dont in turn negate my blackness. The fact you regard blackness in terms of its confines is why I cant begin to show you the respect you seem to demand. Youve only served to prove my initial assessment.Lets go through them all although the exercise should prove utterly futile in your case.Pharrell and some others seem to have the idea that their success proves a rule rather than being an exception. Hes a fucking musician. Try this go look at the video of Waka Flocka at an SAE retreat. White people do not let race get in the way of their own entertainment and enjoyment. From long before Josephine Baker youd be a fucking idiot to think musicians actors or sports stars were in some way an accurate indication of where black people as a whole stood in society. But what those stars should do once given the platform is bring attention and humanity to the plight of the whole.New blacks like to cling to a sense of individualism. They want to break from the group...they dont want to be lumped in. Ill touch on the contradictory stupidity of that in a second.So these New Blacks get in their head a few odd beliefs. Your own perception of your blackness will somehow shape how others see and treat you forgetting that they are in a special position of their talent being a means of empowerment for others. From the big men who own the teams studios or record labels to the thousands of white people who work below them these stars provide a living for others. The way they are treated is no indication of anything beyond how a star will be treated in an industry that relies on their talent. These strategies wont work for the guy who works at the coffee shop. They wont work for the student walking across campus. They wont work even for the doctor. Shit they dont even work for these celebrities until the person dealing with them finally recognises them! This is what Chris Rock was highlighting. Then a New Black Isaiah Washington decided to chime in with his foolish adapt advice. Yes its on us to put ourselves in positions where we acknowledge our blackness acknowledge white racism and then cower and change to mitigate it. Thus we have our first contradiction. Why would one do that if they dont acknowledge their blackness? I thought pretending were all the same was the way forward?What Washington did was place the burden of white supremacy on the shoulders of black people. Its on us to avoid racism by reducing ourselves as targets rather than loudly demand our humanity be recognised. And this is where a fucking idiot like Raven gets it wrong. She wants to avoid racism by making race irrelevant. Im black. Shes black. It should be a fact that doesnt warrant avoidance. I dont restrict myself based on race. Others may try to do so but that has little to do with my own self identification.The problem with Kendrick Lamar is that again in the face of New Black individualism he suggests the onus is on the black whole to fix a certain issue to justify our humanity. You see it would be hypocritical to cry about Trayvon Martin after coming in from gunning down another black man over gang beef...but are the people weeping about slain black innocents and those committing gang related murders the same people? Am I a gangbanger? Are you? Should it be okay to kill you because some guy youve never met or heard of killed another guy yesterday and all you share is skin colour? That makes sense to you?No its not on black people to fix black on black violence before were allowed to demand police stop killing unarmed black people or brutalising us. Thats not how it works. Black on black crime is simply crime. Its the job of police to fix that. How many drug deals have you personally stopped? How many gang murders have you personally prevented? You dont think its a bit absurd anyone would ask you to take responsibility for fixing that before its not okay to gun down a  year old in a park or shoot a man in a Walmart for picking up a product sold there? You get where theyre coming from when someone makes such a fucking ridiculous suggestion?Because to me that is the real threat of New Blackness the legitimisation of fucking stupid opinions. I know why some people think global warming isnt a real thing. I know why some people think vaccination causes issues not solves them. I know why some people believe the Earth is only a few thousand years old and dinosaurs arent real and we didnt descend from apes. I get where theyre coming from because I acknowledge there will be fucking idiots with fucking idiotic points of view in the world. what I dont do is legitimise their bullshit by furthering the wrongheaded notion that all differing opinions should be respected.I respect that which is grounded in some form of logical thought. I dont blindly adhere to well everyone is entitled to an opinion I should respect it bullshit. Dumb fuckery is dumb fuckery. New Blackness is predicted on dumb fucking ideas. You cant hug racism out of a person Common I dont care how much I like your music.

But damn this is getting ridiculous. Maybe it always has been and Ive only started to notice it. I think Im going to have to get away from the internet for while.Browsing these gendered subs especially the black ones is making me angry. I know many black activists say that you should be angry if youre a black person in America but I disagree. Getting mad is not the same as getting involved. Your emotions dont create solutions reason does. You can use emotions for inspiration but if you hold on to them for too long theyll consume you. You become jaded and cynical. I dont want that. I see that a lot all over Reddit.Im fairly young and have very limited experience with women but Im finding that redditors resentments towards women is rubbing off on me. For some reason Im buying into the whole gender wars thing when I have no personal experiences to support that any of the stuff Im reading here would apply in my personal life. I wish there were more positive posts on women. The consistent stream of negative posts about women is something we could do without. The silent majority that is allegedly more representative of the black community should be more vocal so we can have better perspective on this.

You somehow turned being hispanic into a privileged race being called a racial slur makes me into a racist somehow  removing my ethnic identity and categorizing me as a fragile white person. You are racist as hell and you dont even realize it. If I called you anything remotely like that you would immediately jump on the opportunity to call me a racist.Ironically defending myself makes me weak providing cited evidence towards a claim makes me ignorant. You provide no evidence other than anecdotal and everyone has to take it to heart or else they are racist. There is literally no angle that someone can calmly and rationally debate anything without you twisting it into either ignorant or racist.If I use a non FBI source is that ok? Or are all governmentindustrialuniversity studies that I could use for any claim antiblack? This is a legitimate question. Because it seems that if I provide evidence from any source Im racist studies are flawed. Dude PEOPLE are dying. Black  hispanic muslim asian and white. You cant just say white people are killing all black people. Do black people make up the majority if I could include unreported homicides? Maybe I am not sure and if it is dont know why. Again instead of saying yes it is because white people are racist why dont you say yes it is this study shows yaddayaddayadda.. Im sorry but any educated person knows that evidence beats anecdotes. Resorting to Ad hominem attacks makes you sound even more ignorant. But you genuinely believe that there is a conspiracy race war going on against black people in america by all non black people? Are some terrible people like Roof racist? Yes! Is the system rigged against black people? If you can show me good evidence I am ALL ears and will accept your point of view. I have no issue doing so. I already admitted that there are flaws with the citation I posted once it was pointed out by another poster. I am literally willing to change my opinion if good argumentsevidence is provided.But it seems like you imply that all whitehispanics are raised to hate black people and that is a ridiculous statement. How the heck did Obama win the presidency if all white people are racist? They make the vast majority of the voting population for crying out loud. There are black police officers a black president an associate justice for the supreme court is a black man. These are all people that work in the legal sector are highly successful and have great influence in this country. Things are far from perfect for sure and there is always work to be done.

Like agnosticatheist people really need to step up to the plate. It seems like their is only criticism coming from agnosticatheist but no actions. I believe that they would have to learn how to tailor their words in a way where they dont shun religious people but speak pragmatically.

4988159,0,t1_cun61s2,Personally ... I would like to see an older mature Bond. Not in the sense that hes Danny Glover and too old for this shit. But ... like MGSPhantom Pain where in its not about the dashing hero and his playful fervor. But a dude whos seen too much whos a little tired a little more patient and knows how to stalk and hunt.Then again Im in the minor crowd where I think Bond isnt a good action character. Thats the difference between him and say Jason Bourne or what became of John McClane where both are almost a force of nature though Die Hard got really weird and stupid.Bond is a spy he is smart he plays people patiently and makes his enemies doubt their henchman and own plans and twist themselves into a corner and only then should Bond strike Ala Goldfinger Licence to Kill Casino Royalty etc. Thats when hes the coolest to me.

For example recently we got a post on friendship two I posted about erotic fiction and hoteps that made some interesting conversation a post about marriage etc. Many people in this sub have argued that blackladies just has a higher number of subscribers so naturally there will be more conversations there. Which would be true IF I didnt see how much activity this sub got on certain topics.Topics about white women? Dudes are happy to show up and chime in. Conversations about black women too especially if theyre negative ones. For some reason white men feel safer airing out their boring or irrelevant feelings here which dulls conversation. A lot of yall will encourage them though. Honestly I think many posters here are really aggressive. Im a woman so I dont know if its just a masculinity thing.

You cant celebrate this heritage whether on the roofs or in your closet like Southern whites do without celebrating continuing oppression and genocides. While its possible for a German Jew to acknowledge their German heritage it would naturally be offensive to other Jews if it is played off as being equally vital or relevant to being a Jew.

6243135,0,t3_411mzp,ok so the combination of a post i recently wrote about movies with women in them and the fact that the TV show just aired has me thinking about the Mortal Instruments series again. its a fairly big series with a few spinoff series to my recollection. But it has me thinking about what IMO is the fatal flaw in the series. Which is it takes a teachable moment and ruins it. Like Disney did to the little mermaid In the first book and Im not spoilering this because its a stupid plot point its fairly obvious and it makes the book much less frustrating its spoiled in the movie and its very old at this point Clary our protagonist falls for random badboy Jace. Then stuff happens and she finds out that she has a secret brother.. and that secret brother is Jace. Now heres where I think the book couldhave made a teachable moment. Learning to let go of love learning to make friends with a boy. Heck Clueless had Cher go through this cycle but I suppose things based on classic literature have a hand up.Instead she just mopes and lusts over this dude she knows is her brother. Until the third bloody book. Just nothing but blood heating glances touches that are vaguely but literally electric. Scents that are stupidly specific. she never lets go. She never tries to get to know him as a brother. He spends his time running away from her because he loves her too much and dramatically saving her because he loves her too much. It completely soured me on what was a series I was reading just to have something to read as opposed to say enlightenment or good writing and I didnt even care when they found out they WEREnt related because it made no difference too them. It made me think about my nieces and their love for Twilight and the message this sends to girls that no matter how unattainable if you love a guy and your love is true youll be rewarded.

6655656,0,t1_d07b8iv,I suppose this just comes from our differing experiences. My experience of Asians and Hispanics getting slack on racism isnt really heavy theres varying degrees of calling out but its called out. My experience with people using antiblackness among other groups as an excuse for their own bullshit is far greater. To go further on this point it is called out. Nonblack people when not agreeing with it love to call it out because it makes them feel cleaner on their own sins.  Perhaps its our different circles but black people will definitely call it right the fuck out in my experience. So it just doesnt seem to be that hidden unspoken and untouched element impression Ive gotten from you. Going out of my own experiences I just call it out when I see it. I think realizing the ulterior motive behind these callouts is just as important as having a conversation on such things happening.

I agree with point  almost completely and as someone who thankfully has never seen anyone die in person or had to deal with someone in critical condition Ill take your word for .    Point  bothers me and heres why We could go back probably not very far and find examples of antiAsian discrimination within many any? police departments. IF this is about Asians who wear the blue shield getting the short end of the stick there were plenty of other better opportunities to raise your voice. IF this is about white cops getting nonindictments for far worse things than this case then standing with black people during the many high profile cases that have arisen on this issue in the past few years would have had the added benefit of Liang not having to carry the sins of a nation on top of simply being the right thing to do. Since Asians to have waited until this case to raise their voice its extremely difficult to interpret it as anything other than Asians not realizing that they can be affected by racism in the United States.Point  Theres undeniably been some black shitheads targeting Asians. But Id argue that it goes both ways. I can pull up personal anecdotes. talk about Asias antiblackness alongside its appropriation of black culture as well as heinous crimes committed by Asians against blacks Im not trying to turn it into an Olympic competition but its not as one sided as your comment makes it seem. But heres the thing Asians have something we never did their Model Minority Status. Asians could have used their standing to make things better for everyone including the Asian community. Instead Asians focused on Asians seemingly believing they could be negate white supremacy through hard work and possibly fall back on their MM status if things didnt go as planned. Now it turns out that this is not the case and youre in a real tough spot.,Blackfellas,d0cj44e,8,t5_2xfe1

What??  Then you tell me Clinton called Black criminals super predators!   So then you find a speech where Sanders said pretty much the same thing  Oh well there were other parts to that speech so its reaching.  What?So now your ass is putting my name in your post talking about Clinton said racist shit about Obama!   Yet a little over  hours ago you told me how it wasnt a big deal that Sanders ignored the racial profiling that was going on in his state.  Ive said before I dont really give a flying fuck who you vote for just that you go out and vote.

He said something like a lot of the guys he works with are cowardly dudes who had never even been in a fight before or punched in the face.

ISIS is an extremist group essentially on the far end of a spectrum of morality. It is significantly easier for people to discuss this topic because almost everyone would agree that ISIS is bad.When talking about gun violence people are less hesitant to discuss the topic because it is more polarizing. People would rather keep the peace in social situations and discuss topics everyone can agree on.. Media is significantly more prevalent to society. Everyone can state their opinion on social media now. This allows point  to further exacerbate more agreeable topics. So because thats what the people are discussing the media reports it and the government will act on it.. Its easier to talk about other peoples problems than your own.

You can say one is more important than the other. You cant say none are important. Especially when we have studies that show the effects of media representation. Besides BLM is protesting people being shot and otherwise mistreated by police. You can live a long time without a black community thats doing great economically. You cant with bullets in you. Just because they focus on something other than the economy theyre not saying if youre more worried about economy than people being killed  were never going to move.  Why do you think that is? Is it because in a group of  million people different people can focus on different things?gtif a news company only talked about black people killing each other and dying while never talking about the good i think a lot more people would call them out on their BS but because its a gay right organization some of yall think they cant possibly have bad intentions.What? I cant even tell what youre arguing here. Who said a gay rights organization cant have bad intentions? I asked specifically if all gay rights groups were supposed to be off limits to BLM. What group is focusing on black LGBT people? Who exactly do you think black LGBT people should associate with? If problack groups arent doing it and gay groups havent been doing it whats wrong with working with the ones that are fighting for LGBT groups and changing how they operate? Even your HRC link from earlier showed that they were working on increasing diversity. Whats wrong with a problack group finally coming along to make sure that they are represented?And do you put any onus on the black community and problack organizations that arent BLM to include represent and otherwise not marginalize the issues and views of black women and black LGBTs? gtyou can help LGBT black people without dealing with LGBT froups that dont care about black people.And you can help black LGBT while getting those LGBT groups to care about black LGBT people. The same way we have integrated ourselves into other organizations that have traditionally excluded us and the same way were continuing to do so now across various institutions.Also earlier your problem was BLM not focusing on all black people when they include LGBT. Now its fine?And you didnt provide a source of them working with the HRC...gtall those people look like theyre protesting not moving the focus freddie gray to randoms in the crowd. not the place not the timeWait what?  So taking out time to dance as in the second linked video is fine but taking out time to pray for LGBT people isnt?

His crowds of white nationalistsupremacist supporters is nothing more than another headline to them.This whole notion that Trumps presidency would just elevate us into a true progressive presidency is a childish old notion that people said about Reagan.

Hes addressed the nation during our hard times and helped shape the narrative of the political scene.People would be watching president Trump address the nation after a terrorist attack or an event like Ferguson. His remarks would gain popularity and credibility as they would be coming from the POTUS. More politicians would copy his remarks and rhetoric since it worked for him.

Hes saying that the change only comes when THEY are ready. gtYou then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable that can institutionalize the changes you seek and to engage the other side and occasionally to take half a loaf that will advance the gains that you seekHalf a loaf like his health care bill thats undeniably going to fail and leave more people without adequate health care than ever before?  Half a loaf like how he couldnt stop racial profiling and the incarceration of nonviolent small time drug offenders so he released a few prisoners after  years and asked the criminal justice system to please be more fair? Did the gay community take half a loaf when it came to gay marriage? gtWhen some activists at that meeting said they felt that their voices were not being heard Mr. Obama replied You are sitting in the Oval Office talking to the president of the United States.LOL because its not like anyone can sit down pretend to give a damn and give some condescending babytalk that basically translates into tough shit. Hes right about one thing though  nothing is going to get solved by yelling. But elected officials like him their stranglehold on the political process and worst of all their half a loaf solutions are certainly not going to change anything either  at least not for the better.,Blackfellas,d2focyg,15,t5_2xfe1

Just because you personally have been able to get a job that proves not a whole lot because you dont have access to the applicant pool etc.  If you feel it hasnt held you back thats awesome but I dont get where the hostility is coming from. gtWhile discrimination does happen it doesnt mean that everybody with a black sounding name will have a harder time getting hired especially in professional settings and there are plenty of hiring managers who arent overlooking applicants because of their black name.I dont think anyone would argue against that otherwise no people with Black names would be hired anywhere. But thats not the point people were initially making. According to this methodology I also have a Black last name and although m first name is traditionally American it is common among Black people. My thought is that although these are factual it doesnt ding the stereotype marker and hence doesnt activate discrimination.

Clearly more needs to be done and it should be a universal goal. There have been several pipeline programs over the years that have focused on increasing the number of underrepresented minorities who successfully apply to college and medical school. Despite these efforts only  of the  matriculants to medical school last year were black or Latino. The pipeline needs to start long before high school and college where they currently begin.

8542902,0,t3_4u3t8g,youre thinking about it wrong. Which is imo essential because you must understand an argument if youre going to debate it.The argument that blacks are violent isnt directly suggesting that gt of the black population is violent. Its INDIRECTLY suggesting it by saying that the percentage of blacks that are violent are greater than the percentage of anyone else that is violent. Meaning theres a greater likely hood that if you meet a crazed maniac its a black person. Thus justifying your fear of black people.Now the numbers prove that wrong but not the way you suggest. You have to control for things like poverty which yields a more violent population. You have to look at how violence is classified because like This cop has a clean record and has never been chastised before This person is a violent criminal is also an unproven statement unless you define and elaborate. When you do those things you find black numbers are roughly on par with everyone else. Theyre artificially inflated not directly inaccurate. Its often not that people get the numbers wrong its that they dont show what the numbers mean. Oh  of black men are criminals? Or do you mean  have been arrested by the police and charged or do you mean  percent have been caught in the act and confessed because those are two different data sets.,Blackfellas,d69fkl0,1,t5_2xfe1

8632259,0,t1_d6keibp,I dont resent immigrants for sending remittances back home if thats what youre talking about. Usually its a net gain for Americans.Im not sure what you mean by them not investing in the communities where they do business.Opening up a shop takes hundreds of thousands in capital investment. In the community. The sales tax they generate literally pay for services in the community.As small business owners they cant just get out of town any time they want. They man the cashier registers themselves most of the time. In Connecticut they live above the god damn store and their kids go to the same school!I have no idea where the idea they disrespect black people. During the LA riots people often said Koreans disrespected them because they didnt make eye contact or avoided touching them when handing them change. Eye contact is being polite and not touching is considered formal. Shopkeepers shouldve learned local customs but... not sure how racist that is.I can see why someone would shop at one store versus another and support blackowned businesses especially since banks dont give loans to black people even when their credit is good.Sorry I thought you were the same guy trying to justify his store being burned.

Without reparations closing the wealth gap is almost unachievable. Many white groups and Jews have benefited from reparations financially or propertywise  in modern history without it being called hand outs  or other racist dog whistles. Studies show direct financial recompensations with basic financial  education are more efficiently utilized than  other forms of aid that incur huge administrative overheads returning the wealth to whiteowned banks and corporations.

Single parent mother and in the upper middle class. The first issue was the day I graduated from middle school. I was stopped coming back from  with  white friends by a cop in the middle of the day. Without getting out of the car he told me to get to the back where he proceeded to accuse me of smoking weed. He somehow smelled this imaginary weed from his car but didnt smell it on my two white friends who told him they had been with me all day. Thankfully one of my fried s called his Italian mom how flipped a shit on the cop for being a racist. Things were okay after that until I started driving. I was getting pulled over constantly for stupid shit that almost never resulted in a ticket. The times I got tickets were ridiculous. Once while I was going to my car for being parked the wrong way on a residential street. Once for having my parking pass hanging from my mirror while leaving school which everyone did and no one but me got a ticket for ever. I once took my white girlfriend to the make out spot and the cops caught us making out in the car. Their first question when she was away from me was if I was raping her. No one else that I asked was ever asked that question. I had just turned  and worked at a dollar store. My boss had given me my paycheck in ones as a joke cause I said I was going to the strip club. They saw it am immediately thought I was a drug dealer I until I pointed out that people dont generally buy drugs with singles. I was once pulled over  times on the way home from going to a store for random stops. And somehow every time I got pulled over there was some reason they needed to search my car. This went on for years. Once my mom caught wind of it I tried to hid it she threatened to sue them for harassment suddenly it stopped. BTW I never wear hats I drive like a grandma my windows were never tinted and I was never arrested or associated with bad folks. I was always polite and the area wasnt bad at all. There were maybe  black families in the whole town. No big drug problems and in the  years my family has lived in the town my grandmother moved there decades before I did there have been made  homicides. There was other shit like schools and teacher assuming I was stupid and my mom getting  IQ tests and forcing me to take exit exams for grades I just started to prove I was good enough.I tried hard not to blame race for these things but in the end there wasnt much else I could  use to justify what was happening. Not as bad as what was in the article but my other experiences are more petty.Edit forgot the important part. The cops treated me like a criminal. Besides wanting to search my car every damn stop they also asked me to do things like put my hands out the window and kept their hand on the holster. They were far more militant with me than white people that I had been pulled over with. To add to the stupidity I always turned on my dome lights announced where I was reaching  and I dress like a banana republic model except Im   and was lbs soaking wet. They have gotten much better recently although a cop told me a I probably wouldnt get a gun permit anytime soon. ,Blackfellas,dds9eom,11,t5_2xfe1

11020058,0,t1_degz6pp,It started as an interest in African History namely West Africa but the catalyst was that the history books in school seemingly skipped over Africa besides Egypt and North Africa. This was coupled with the trend of making fun of kids that had family from Africa as primitive living in huts killing lions etc. I thought to myself that there has to be something in the books that can validate my damn heritage. So I started searching and I found dozens upon dozens of books articles scripts detailing African history. When I learned of Sungbos Eredo bigger than Giza pyramid in Nigeria right out side of Lagos I was shocked that no one even talked about it. My parents had no idea it even existed. Then I started reading journals about math science art etc in west africa and found a whole new level of appreciation of African culture. After that I just gravitated to Ifa because I was fed up with Islam no disrespect mulsim fam and wanted to find another way of viewing the world. I called up my babalawo and he gave me a run down of the philosophy of Ifa  One  god or creator or Ashe kind of like a will of the universe.   The various Orisha are not gods but aspects of the supreme creatorconsciousnesswill. People assume its idol worship but that is because they dont understand Ifa. It would be wrong to assume Christians worship the cross as the cross represents the physical sacrifice of Jesus Christ same deal with Ifa. You can still be a Muslim Buddhist Christian Hindu etc while studying Ifa because Ifa is not dogmatic and is based on universal principles. That is one of the reasons Christianity and Islam were able to spread in West Africa so well the native religions and spiritual systems are largely nondogmatic and do not shun other religions or new ways of thinking. All in All Ifa is a great way to connect with your cultural heritage learn some cool mathematics and think differently. I would say the philosophy of Ifa has had the most impact on my life so far. ,Blackfellas,deh3cxz,9,t5_2xfe1

11184841,0,t3_5znvf7,Hey Im sorry your going through panic attacks right now. The good news is parents kinda adjust to that new information over time sometimes. I did have trouble convincing my family that black people could have Anxiety issues and it wasnt just a white people thing which was kinda hard. If you decide to talk to someone professional about your anxiety its okay to wait a bit and see if your comfortable with that particular person before you give them the full run down. I was told stop drinking caffeine because it aggravates anxiety. You can try to practice mindfulness or meditation. Ive heard that helps. Im usually pretty bad about it but I use appscalm is a good one to try to regulate how often I do it. Dont know if this helps but they had me keep a journal and write down good things about myself for a week and track my routines to narrow down exactly what triggers me and how to best avoid it. You can also make your own stress box that is full of anything that makes you feel safe and happy. It doesnt have to be big and you can keep it some place private and if you feel like your anxiety is getting kinda high interact with it for a bit to try to calm down. Mines has tea craft projects letters from friends or familyetc. On the go he told me to have something to mess with so I can try to break my focus on the anxiety. For me that looks like a hair band pendent or something soft I like. Its something unnoticeable that can have meaningor not to you that make you feel safe. I know this is for kids but its basically the exact process.I also have trouble with new places. I use to sit in places for hours just watching people and not interacting until I became comfortable. Not sure if that was helpful but it made it a lot easier to interact once I felt I adjusted to the new environment.Also I would suggest not giving your time to those girls any more. anyone who wont be your friend if you dont do what they say is bullshit and your year will be best without them. I wish you the best of luck. It does get easier to deal with over time. Just try to make sure you make time to take care of yourself. ,Blackfellas,dezseoq,2,t5_2xfe1

11651774,0,t1_dggk4gu,Nigga please I love all black people period. But it pains me to see our race held back by any religion. I couldnt care less what wypipo go through but the fear of there being no life after death keeps our people under control. Now I realize even before Islam and christianity were introduced to our people our ancestors worshipped their own deities. I dont hold it against anyone who believe in mythologies in a time where so much of the world was still unknown. But it is . Far too many black people are brainwashed by these mythologies. I will say this I do respect the problack message of the NOI. Christianity by far continues to hold back our people. How can so many of our brothers and sisters worship the same god as the people who thank god when one of us is killed. Why dont you ask a fucking question about someones opinion before you TELL ME WHAT THE FUCK I MEANT?!,Blackfellas,dggqr5g,5,t5_2xfe1

Or maybe its just that that kind of couple naturally gains more attention? Im not sure. Ive seen WMBW families that seem to eagerly promoteadvertise their children lifestyle etc. They also never forget to mention the fact that WMBW have a much lower divorce rate than the other way around. And theres nothing wrong with that...just makes me wonder I guess. ,Blackfellas,dgmw49a,6,t5_2xfe1
