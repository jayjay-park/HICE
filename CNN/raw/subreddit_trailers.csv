199976,0,t3_1wdki4,Im down with a trailer being limited to two minutes. If you cant sell me a movie in that time then you failed and if it is a movie I already am planning on seeing then  minutes will probably show me too much and I wont be surprised when I see it in theaters. DARK KNIGHT RISES. That movie had something like a  min trailer released and after I watched it I was not shocked when Bane took over the CIA plane right in the beginning. Unlike THE DARK KNIGHT where the Jokers opening bank robbing scene was kept under wraps so when that sequence finished and the lines Whatever doesnt kill you simply makes you stranger were delivered I was left gripping my seat waiting for the next scene to begin.So in conclusion DONT SHOW ME TOO MUCH IN TRAILER.,trailers,cf17wqc,3,t5_2qog5

2706846,0,t3_2qywhg,I loved it and it got me emotional which is great.However I agree with the others that the last minute and a half would benefit from less footage from Episodes .  I realize you tried to match the visuals to the music so cutting more of Episodes  into the first half is hard so Id just chuck them from the last minute and a half  the robots and Trade Federation stuff is jarring when were about to close the book on Anakin.  Its all about the emotional impact no?  If so it would benefit from a clearer telling of Anakins story in the second half the video.  Especially seeing Anakins last moments.  I was waiting for that and the dialogue without the visual felt wrong.Also I had a hard time hearing the dialogue in some scenes.  Now like everybody who probably watched this video I know the movies by heart but I think if you could just dial up the volume of the dialogue a bit more it would be great.Amazing work.  I hope youre able to take the suggestions and make another go at it.  As all artists know its all about revision revision revision.,trailers,cnbraxa,1,t5_2qog5

3237477,0,t1_cocgycu,I mean if you think about it remakes and reboots are actually more honest about what theyre doing. Nearly every idea in a narrative sense at least has been done before. Humans have been making stories since the very early days of our species origins. There are of course exceptions. However most stories are variations on already existing ideas. Reboots and remakes from a certain point of view are just more clear about their origins. I dont find anything inherently wrong with a remake. Its like covering a song. There was nothing wrong with the original but an artist heard it and thought hmm I love this idea but I just thought of a way it could work in a different way. E.g. Layla Derek and the Dominoes Eric Clapton Both are fantastic directions for the same song to be taken in.I think the danger though is the exploitation of reboots to turn a profit for the studios. While Im sure just about every studio goes into ANY remake with this mentality some projects have directors and creators who have a legitimate vision that adds something new to the franchise. The bad remakes come from a solely monetary perspective. E.g. The Amazing SpiderMan. I like very little about that movie mostly because I felt it added nothing save for some superficial stuff Peter is very nongeeky Storyline of Peters parents that seemed forced in just to justify the movies existence.In the end Raimi is generally a solid director and this seems to be more of the good kind of reboot. The style of the effects in particular seem to be refreshing.,trailers,coxkkxh,2,t5_2qog5

3424293,0,t3_2za4o9,I understand if you dont like the new look as thats your own opinion but please understand this The new show isnt CGI. Its model sets with CGI characters. Gerry Anderson R.I.P creator of the original series hated using puppets and burned the originals. When he was asked to create a new series he was very excited but wanted it to be CGI which the studio was originally against. This series uses many of his ideas and reflects his wishes. I have watched every episode of the original series and many other Anderson shows. This looks amazing! A fantastic modernisation of the originals.Again I understand if you dont like the new look but you cant pass it off as soon as you see a lack of strings. Its immature and disrespectful to the wonderful Gerry Anderson.,trailers,cpileuj,1,t5_2qog5
