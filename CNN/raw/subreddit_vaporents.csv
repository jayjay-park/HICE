This technique has allowed me to get big clouds on the low setting.Look at this lady See how shes blowing across the hole rather than straight in?

10739,0,t1_cef0ekd,Really? Ive always heard that THC is absorbed in less than .s so its pointless to hold it in at all. Sort of relevant rant One of my biggest problems with prohibition is that we cant openly study this plant that so many people are using and not study purely to determine the risks but all the potential  myths passed around the circle. For instance Ive heard THC dissipates in air instantly which means second hand smoke wouldnt get you high however so many people claim to get stoned being in a hotbox but not smoking. However Ive also heard that THC can be detected in the air of a room hours after being smoked and that would mean it doesnt dissipate and does linger? But Ive tried to get high in a hot box and it didnt happen? Just hate not knowing somethings. ,vaporents,cefnoey,3,t5_2upjd

And I can fill up  carts with almost a g which will do me for  hours no problemI regularly use the pen in places that I would never smoke. Had a few puffs in front of a cop the other day!I think that the pax is suitable for you. I typically suggest against it. I do basically think its the apple of portable vapes and that simply there are better alternatives. Here is an interesting comparison of the latest solo davinci pinnacle inhalater and pax. The pax consistently comes off as the worst but it is worth noting that they may be biased as they cant stock or sell the pax being outside of NA. And there is no denying that the pax is sleek stealth and robust. But you will get a much better quality of vapour from the solo. And the pinnacle IMO looks awesome. I mean water attachment can do concentrates still small and stealth,vaporents,ceruoas,1,t5_2upjd

140122,0,t3_1voqsb,I love talking about my solo! D I bought mine three months ago and its just amazing. It is the first vape I ever bought but Ive had a lot of experience with others. I usually pack a bowl and let it heat up till  The first hit is a little on the weaker side then vape consistently on . Its good because I was in the same situation as you not wanting to spend too much and for its price it is a good model. It is super portable and easy to maintain. The only part you would need to worry about is the stems. They are glass but the quality is great and they do not break easily. Plus they are cheap to replace  bucks on eBay. I also bought a water pipe attachment to it. I could include pics if u want. But anyways it makes the hits a lot more smooth and moist. They are already smooth just tend to be dryish. Ive been using mine almost every day and it conserves plants like a champion. Probably more so than a MFLB. Others my try to tell you to get a desktop model but honestly for your price range it makes more sense to get a portable. Da Buddah is a medium quality vape you can try and also Arizers Extreme Q is pretty cool. Again those are desktop vapes and their quality is considered average. Whereas the Solo is a pretty solid price for a high quality portable. Sure you wont get huge hit that put you to a  all day but you can get the feeling you want for a portable device  depending on bowl size. Anyways sorry to rant. Im a huge fan of my Solo. Enough to spend time writing this review about it ,vaporents,ceue1k6,5,t5_2upjd

266505,0,t3_1trn7y,Ive been waiting for the right time and place to express my displeasure with Grenco Science and the GPen and though I may write up an entire review and blog it this will do for now. For any of you searching for a good pen I can truly recommend this is NOT the pen for you.Though my ordering and shipping experience was top notch and better than most the product itself is highly overrated and poorly built. I got the original GPen G coil plus the herb tank and one of each oil tanks. First off the battery is fine and looks great holds a decent charge whoo hooo. Nothing new about batteries...The G coil is ok for sticky oils but seems to heat unevenly and makes a big mess of the coil cleaning does little and after a short time I noticed a severe decrease in vapor production. Both the other oil tanks are poorly built and broke the first day I had them. The original by the coil popping down through itself yeah push down a little too much on it putting that rubber tip on and its done the other just stopped firing. Honestly the only saving grace of this pen was the herb tank which though not actually vaporizing and rather using a method similar to a toaster worked in a pinch.However not really something Id find worth the money.Do yourself a favor and stay away from the brand that bought rights to Snoop Dogs name just to sell more units save your money for a unit with some real punch.P.S. You CAN NOT use eliquid in any of the Gtanks short of the new hookah tip which Im betting is complete shit as well.Cheers,vaporents,cf8dsv8,2,t5_2upjd

328733,0,t1_cfesc26,Thanks.  A big part of whats causing problems is the fact that this subreddit is growing extremely quickly.  According to redditmetrics.com at least last time I checked which was a couple of weeks ago of all the subs with more than k sbscribers listed in rtrees list of cannabisrelated subs this is easily the fastestgrowing one in percentage terms at around  a week.  And even in growth of raw subscriber numbers its  behind only rStonerEngineering rwoahdude and rtrees itself which are all much larger subs.Naturally we mods are very happy to see this growth as it reflects the progress of vaporising culture in Reddits cannabis community and by extension the world.  But it does mean that we have a large proportion of noobs here with their many questions and lessinformed opinions and the hivemind can get a bit irrational  which obviously tends to be irritating for longterm regulars such as yourself.  Its a common theme among subreddits once they start to get bigger.  So us mods are considering various options for how to manage an optimal balance of keeping the sub both friendly and helpful to beginners but without driving away the old guard whose experience and expertise is vital for highquality discussion.  We already have some ideas which we expect to introduce bit by bit but yeah were all ears for any suggestions.,vaporents,cfeueej,3,t5_2upjd

335424,0,t3_1xx6i8,I just ordered my first vape a vapman. Its not so wellknown but I did quite some research before think Ive read  about it online. Its an extremely small portable vaporizer which you can attach to your bong It has quite a small bowl people say they fill it with ..g and is about x more efficient than smoking but thats probably with all vapos. I was doubting between a MFLB and the vapman but choose the vapman because of  its extreme buildquality made in swiss with only highgrade materials.  reportedly bigger hits and more efficient than mflb even though smaller trench. no electronic parts which can short or die better quality trench than mflb. Apparantly the trench of the mflb is quite sensitive and needs very careful handling. no hassle with batterieselectricity  good for festivals and such. ive read  reviews and not a single bad one check here and probably some more which I cant remember.Its essentialy a person vape where you need to cook the trench with a butane torchlighter for a few seconds and when its heated you hit it. The mouthpiece is also exactly the same size as the stem from the mflb so I ordered a mflbstem as well so I can use my vapman with a third lung for heavier hits or when multiple people want to vape. Because the vape has a bit of a learning curve you preferably dont want others to handle it if used incorrectly you can damage the unit  same as with mflb.I know reddit is quite in love with the mflb and I might get one later as well but the vapman fitted my needs better. Hope this might help you in making a decision.,vaporents,cffjc4z,3,t5_2upjd

348606,0,t3_1y2zdg,Actually when used with oil pens do vaporize and do not combust. They are what I like to call essential oil vaporizers. We understand that most combust when used with dry herb but not all. The Tvape does vape dry herb and it does a pretty good job at it as well. So pens are kind of a gray area it depends on how you use them weather or not they will combust. Some are more advanced than others for example the KISS cart from w Tech is much more than a hot wire connected to an ecig battery. But since they are vaporizers and they are used with cannabis concentrates there is a place for them on this sub.We have tried to combat the overwhelming amount of pen posts with the official pen thread that is stickied to the top of the sub. We as moderators have begun to filter out all the posts pertaining to pens and redirect them to the stickied thread. ,vaporents,cfgwfw3,15,t5_2upjd

755606,0,t1_cgq4xlp,So now its just your word against mine... I own a vapor genie and it hits a lot harder then my buddys MFLB which Ive gotten fairly familiar with as well. I much prefer the Vapor Genie over the MFLB and if you learn how to use it properly you can get really thick hits without combusting. I think the VG gets bashed a lot which is unfair because its a really cheap alternative which is still really effective once you learn how to use it properly.The EQ elbow packed hits pretty hard harder than a bag from a volcano IMO but I was specifically referring to hits with the EQ attached to a double perc bong like this Since the vapour goes through three layers of water so it gets cooled pretty effectively you can turn up the heat pretty far without combusting Ive gone up to  Centigrade but Im sure you can go higher and still have a pleasant hit.I really dont want to get into a shouting match over which vape is better. Weve both tried them all apparently and both of us came to different conclusions. I think everyone can get harder hits from their own vape because theyve learned all the little tricks to make it work better.,vaporents,cgq63kj,4,t5_2upjd

I know on college campuses the pax is the most reliably discrete in that it looks like a wireless internet hub or high tech device that RAs and campus police seem to ignore. If smell itself is the only problem and not appearance than pretty much any vape will suit you with respect to some lower end ones. With vapes you pay for what you get. Invest in an excellent vaporizer that you will be happy with. Waiting a little longer for something you want may be worth it.

897435,0,t1_ch68okm,Con of the volcano which all owners agree it doesnt produce eye searing hits with a small amount like a ... You have to have at least a . or more in there for it to really kick out a dense bag otherwise with half that you just get  bags of even vapor. Ideally with such a small amount which is common for personal sessions many want a hard hitting experience and you need something that can kill a load in  hits maybe . For example bong vs joint  bong load is  hitssnaps .g each totalling .g vs joint is a .g one which takes maybe  hits to finish. At the end you get to the same place but the bong is the more thrilling of the two if thats what you like. If they are too intense then you would probably prefer a vape that spreads out the draws more  but here is the catch for that vapes that only spread out hits over many like  hits and cant be done in less are lacking IMO. Why? Because a vape that can pooch a bowl in a single hit if it has an adjustable temperature you can just turn the temp down and make the bags less dense and this will satisfy those that like that. Conclusion? If you want both the hard hitting and slow hitting then you need something capable of finishing a load in  hits or even  but if you cant and wont ever be able to handle hard hitting then dont worry about this.Whereas the Volcano no matter what get  bags unless you crank the temp to the max which is just unpleasant. This doesnt say though that you wont end up in the same place in  minutes but I prefer to go from  in a little time as possible as it provides a more exhilarating experience.,vaporents,ch6ak32,5,t5_2upjd

Thats about the range you want though ending two temp positions higher than where you started.You should take hard sips of it more than tokes like drinking a milkshake through a straw not ripping hard like a bong. You want long drawn out sips too. While youre drawing a good hit you should feel it in your chest the way you do when you take a strong hit from a pipe or. In other words do what you have to do so that youre still inhaling from the stem when you feel that sensation. I tend to breathe in through my nose a little while drawing to extend how long I can draw. I get clouds up to and even past the  minute mark.You want the herb well ground but not powdery. If your bud is too dry put some orange or lemon rind in your stash for moisture. You want fluffy. You also dont want to pack it down all the way. Scoop some up with the stem until its filled but dont pack it down maybe a tiny bit but dont like push it down so you can pile more herb on top.This should give you good results. Another little tip is that if its too hard to pull you mightve packed your herb too tight but just lift up the stem a tiny bit to increase air flow and you should get through it fine. Not packing it so much in the first place is preferable though.Hope that helps. I love my Solo and it saddens me when people arent getting good results from it.,vaporents,chbu6zt,6,t5_2upjd

1115755,0,t3_26t0yv,The better of the  is the Volcano but the one you should get is the Cloud.I own them both so here I go.Ever since I got the Cloud my Volcano has been put away except for when friends come over.  So that is it the Cloud is the best for a loner stoner and maybe one good friend he can trust and the Volcano is durable enough for a proper sesh.  The Cloud is glass and kind of unstable on a surface when it is plugged in because the cord is heavy and the Cloud is light.  The new EVO power cord can be detached but how much heat does it lose?  Who knows it doesnt have a temp display.  It is a pain in the butt to pass around to people and I cannot enjoy my high when I know the Cloud is in foreign hands it is just too fragile.  Plus some friends will push real hard on the hydratube like it is going to leak or something and breaking the GonG part of the Cloud seems easy so you will constantly have to remind people not to fucking push with all their strength on the damn thing  Glass is fucking fragile.  My hydratube broke within a month of getting it.  I didnt have a stand for it and they are top heavy.The Volcano can also be fragile.  The mouth piece valve has broken on me twice from too many drops on hardwood floor.  It costs  to replace.  The bags can rip easily if caught on something and they certainly acquire leaks quickly if you are a heavy vaper.  .  My machines heat on button red sometimes gets stuck and wont turn on and I am not sure why but clearly these things are not bulletproof and can be fragile.It sucks the Cloud doesnt have a temperature display because it actually does help with getting the best vapor.  The temperature is critical because every type of weed you get is kinda different.  Depending on the strain cure and dry time some bud likes it around F and other times bud does best at F in terms of vapor production.  The Volcano temp display is spot on and it takes sec per degree F to heat up and starts at around FF depending where you are.  The Cloud takes about  minutes to get good and warm for a proper hit.  Or does it?  Who knows the damn thing doesnt have a temperature display!  But really about  minutes.The reason you should get the Cloud is because it is truly a vaporizer that saves you money by using less weed.  Sure you can fill the Volcano chamber with  gram of bud and then only fill one bag and then go back to it for a few more bags at a later time you dont HAVE to use all the bud in the filling chamber at once.  People will just argue that is gets stale or old or tastes weird well fuck it still gets you high and it a way to conserve bud with the Volcano.  But intuitively the Cloud is meant to save bud.  You can pack just a pinch in and get blasted.  You will save so much  you could actually go out and buy a Volcano in a few months with all the saved bud money and own both!The Cloud is silent except for the water attachment.  The Volcano is pretty loud and can get annoying to certain personalities.  It doesnt bother me because I am getting high off the damn machine so why should I care.  Douche roomies and parents probably mind.  Vapor smells they both smell the same.  GOOD LUCK!,vaporents,chv4cov,4,t5_2upjd

1124577,0,t3_26uee8,Hey I love my solo and would highly recommend it. Got it from vaporseller.com and recommend them as well. Now you may not agree with this but my recommendation is to be open with your children. My dad smoked every day of his life and I knew from a young age. This accomplished two things I knew it was not something I was allowed to touch so if I stumbled onto his stash I didnt dare touch it. It also made me very aware that the propaganda saying it will ruin your life was bs.  My dad was and still is the hardest working man Ive ever met. They need to understand that it is your MEDICINE and nothing more. The same as if you had percocets in the house you would want to make sure they know what it is and why it is only something that should be used by you. I dont mean to give parental advice on the Internet so if you disagree then to each their own. I vaporize daily and when my kids ask what Im doing I simply tell them it is my medicine and makes me feel better. They do not ask any more and thats the end of it. It should not be illegal in the first place and thats the only reason you would want to hide it. My view is that Id rather be the one to educate them about what Im doing than have them stumble on it later and think Im just a druggie or doing something bad. It is a medicine and I can attest to the life changing effects it has had on me. And the thing is my only side effects are that Im happier sleep like a baby and have an appetite. Without marijuana I dont think Id be functional right now. Good luck and feel better.,vaporents,chw4gs7,1,t5_2upjd

Would say there are better vape experiences to be had now.PAX Stylish portable device. Believe that it uses a conduction style vape system which is not as good as convection IMO.Solo Portable but not that discrete imo not as discrete as PAX or Indica etc. Is a convection style vape to my knowledge it is one of the best performancevapor quality portables out there.SSV Same as Da Buddha same company except its a bit more expensive is on an incline less chance of bud falling out of bowl or something and has a different whip system thats not hands free but has its advantages.ENano Newer log style desktop vaporizer. Really great performance. Pricier than DBV not as expensive as say Vapexhale. Can attach to a water pipe for direct vapor hits as opposed to a whip being needed. Wood insulates the chamber giving better more even heat and hits. Efficient.Vapexhale Cloud Evo Similar to ENano except its more engineered perhaps ? dont know too much about it. I do know its quite pricey at . You can attach what they call a hydratube and turn it into pretty much a single piece vapor bong which is really cool. Also it has an attachment for dabs that I believe doesnt require a nail you just stick the dab in glass.MFLB Very popular somewhat cheap portable vaporizer. Is very mechanical with the way you hit it with a glass straw and AA batteries that you recharge. Conduction style vaporizer very small. I dont really recommend these despite how popular they are.... you cant get big vapor hits out of it. Owned one and didnt like it but a lot of other people do.Firefly Portable vape new. Pretty pricey at . I believe its made by an exApple engineer. Apparently has really great performance. The design is pretty nice.Indica Another newer portable vape. It looks like a big zippo. From what I hear it is the best bang for buck portable vape. Very good performance and the price tag is pretty good for a portable at .Thats all the vapes I can think ofknow about right now.

1143194,0,t3_275smg,I own a pax and have tried a friends Solo and MFLB.  Of the three if you dont care about discreetness my vote is definitely for the solo.  I found it produced the purest uncombusted vapor of the three.  If you do care about discreetness I would go with the Pax its the only one of them that Id feel comfortable puffing on the street though I still wouldnt do so downtown.  Of just these three options I dont actually have any count I would recommend the MFLB on.  I dont think the price difference is large enoughthe MFLB low enough in price to justify purchasing it over an automatic self contained vape that does all the heating work for you.  MFLB is additionally much less sharable than the other two again I like the solo best for sharing of the three because I find it gives full clouds the easiest while my pax requires a sort of puffing technique to really build up a cloud due to the technique barrier.If price is a concern the FlowerMate Vapormax seems to be getting a good enough reception that I would still pick that over the MFLB.I will also say that from what I saw on FC forums the indica was getting better overall ratings than the PAX for more even heating greater ease to avoid combustion better battery life no need to fiddle with pipe screens for efficient vaping and ease of cleaning.  Personally for me the form factor for the PAX is still what wins it my vote as my portable vape since even vs the Indica its still the only one I might actually use relatively in the open and it still has good enough performance that I dont feel cheated for the price although I would feel like  for it is pushing it.  I got mine new locally for  and tax.Also since you never actually said whether you needed it to be portable I would say look at the desktop units.  I would still choose my Arizer EQ over any of these for pure clean and cool as in temperature tasty vapor and it can be got for  through ebay.,vaporents,chy7yku,1,t5_2upjd

1200214,0,t3_1whzgs, months into my PNP experience and overall i love it.  However i do not love the mouth piece which has broken twices.  The tip just snaps off and its hard to get the broken bit out of the rest of the mouth piece.  Have just ordered the glass lined mouth piece which i hear people are using instead so hoping that solves the problem.I understand battery issues could be a problem but what do u expect when its heating to these temperatures.  I got a car charger and since i have never run out of battery.The water tool is great but I brought this to be able to vape in public so I dont use it that much. Vaping in public is ok the smell does get notices during the first five mins of a new bullet but after that most people dont notice anything.Over all well built and fingers crossed no issues with the main unit.  Mouth tip design needs to be looked at.  Flavor draw are great.  Filling system bullets are ok and if you have the bullet holder reflling can be done very quickly.Keep on vapingedit   months later  with daily heavy use Yeah my unit has died now  wont heat up and just flashes at me like a toothless hobo.

1201045,0,t3_27v46t,Im couldnt tell you this is the BEST way but my friends and I have been using this method for a while. Basically you want to wrap a single coil fairly thick but play with wrapping your coil around different sized poles and install it horizontally. Push it as far down to the base as possible without making any contact. Then put your BHO inside of the coil forgot to mention make sure you wrap your coil extremely tight and vape! Hold it straight up and down for a max dome. It will leak through to the base but its easily cleanable and you can scrape up the leakage and vape it again! ,vaporents,ci4qi0j,2,t5_2upjd
1201820,0,t1_ci4tms9,ampampamp Induction heating sfw gtInduction heating is the process of heating an electrically conducting object usually a metal by electromagnetic induction where eddy currents also called Foucault currents are generated within the metal and resistance leads to Joule heating of the metal. An induction heater for any process consists of an electromagnet through which a highfrequency alternating current AC is passed. Heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses in materials that have significant relative permeability The frequency of AC used depends on the object size material type coupling between the work coil and the object to be heated and the penetration depth.gtgtImage i  Component of Stirling radioisotope generator is heated by induction during testingInteresting Induction cooking | Induction hardening | Induction heater | Eddy current Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcitmy oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecitmy.

I contacted them and they told me to send it in and sent me a shipping label for  day shipping they dont like to keep you without for too long. A couple days later they contacted me and told me they had to replace it and sent me a brand new one. The only thing I paid for in the exchange was the cost of ink and paper to print the shipping label.I think the warranty is worth it and was one of the reasons I bought it.

Also may be worth looking into the Elevape SV on FuckCombustion as well.Finally for ultimate portability check out a flamepowered vape like the Lotus or Hammer theyre even more manual than MFLB and Firefly but can hit really hard and you never need worry about batteries at all.,vaporents,ciqdqct,1,t5_2upjd

1570870,0,t1_cjcz2h2,Yea battery is good but gets around min vs Solos min since thats a bigger device with a bigger battery but indica has usb charging so with a battery pack youd almost never run out if min isnt enough and you cant get to an outlet. Theyll be releasing a stealth black version and a battery replaceable version in October as of now. Isome key differences from Solo is that Solo involves convection as well as conduction so it smells a little less in use but indica is capable of using twice as much herb if you want. plus Solo has glass but when you have a perfect indica I actually preferred its taste to the Solo even. I also love how the Indica has two temps lower than what the Solo gets and can still produce clouds theyre great heady highs. However it doesnt have a F F or F like solo but the lower temps make up for it!

Vapor production is exceptional for an herbal portable. The objections you raise are trivial compared with the Solos many benefits.

We have a disconnect in communication it happens on the internet But the solo is a conduction vape not convection...

1844061,0,t3_2fnqqs,So results I did a  blend with . grams of keif most of which was from some GDP. I used  mL of propylene glycol and  mL of vegetable glycerin. I utilized a doubleboil method just below boiling for  hour and then transferred all of the matter to two seperate  mL glass bottles. I then set the open bottles into the pot a bit under boiling probably  F or so for about  hours. I then let the bottles settle so that the keif sank to the bottom and then used a sterilized pipette to get the more dense cannabis extract from the top and then set out the hashy gooey remainder of matter onto a cookie tray to dry a bit and will then be used as an additive to slowsmoke in some bowls. Ive let the juice settle now and the color is looking great with nearly all of the kief matter seperated and this shit is POTENT. After all of my work Im left with  mL of some very very potent stuff.  drops feels like half of a joint of some grand daddy purp.  drops and Im couchlocked like an astronaut during takeoff. Ive been taking drop rips after an initial  drops to get me started every hour for the last few hours to keep a very stable very euphoric high.I will have some photos tomorrow when I can get some good daytime light.

Ive had a wonderful time with it so far and I dont regret my purchase in the slightest. I know that rvaporents doesnt really think too favorably of the MFLB and sees it more so as a cheap intro vaporizer. But with my experience so far it really hasnt seemed that way I think that rvaporents might be just a little unfair to it. Yes there are other great vaporizers out there and Im sure that there are better ones than the MFLB but that doesnt mean it isnt a wonderful vaporizer. It gets me extremely high I dont have any complaints about charging the batteries for it and I really didnt think there was much of a learning curve. Ive had friends use it and quickly pick it up on their first few tries.If you want the MFLB for around  Id recommend checking out Puffitup.com and using the coupon code BIGNEWS or PUFFEDUP. Itll get you  off which drops the price down to around  and they have free shipping. I purchased from them and have nothing but wonderful things to say about them. Their bundles are great and if you want to change one of them around hit up their live chat and theyll be happy to change it around for you.If you have any general questions about the MFLB check out rMFLB and look around the side bar as well as search the subreddit.

As far as the high from the o.pen the quality of the prefilled cartridges varies greatly  and you must not have had good luck getting potent cartridges. While the ones Ive had arent nearly as potent as straight waxoil would be its also a slightly different purpose I think. Its not something you take a couple hits of and get to where you want to be but something you kind of hit casually for awhile. That said you can also buy nonO.pen brand cartridges that are MUCH more potent like pure golds cartridges.,vaporents,cl8cnss,2,t5_2upjd

2469400,0,t3_2ntpzz,I love my EQ. Had it for a couple years now. I started off using the whip method but then moved onto the bag. Depends on your toleranceactivity. The bag is pretty darn efficient. You dont need to load the cyclone bowl very much. Smaller amounts will heat up evenly and allow proper air flow. I usually just let my ground up cannabis drop into the bowl filling it up somewhere under the halfway mark. No need to pack it tightly.Youll have to experiment with the temps to find what works best. One thing to remember is the change in temperature that can occur as the hot air from the heating element is pushed up from the fan or the whip. I like to pack a bowl assemble it on the EQ then let it sit and allow all the glass to warm up. I think it helps keep everything closer to the desired temperature range. I also feel comfortable running my EQ on the hotter side because of the possible drop in temp from the element to herb. These days I have mine at  C which is pretty toasty. I only hit the bowl once though I dont step it up in various temps and vape a bowl more than once. Lots of folks do that which makes sense. I just use fan setting  high temps a small bowl and a hefty bag.The bag is pretty intense by yourself and perfect for sharing with a friend. If you have a high tolerance like me the bag works great. Its very consistent.One trick to prolong the time it takes between cleaning the glass pieces.. After I have vaped a bowl even though Im not going to use it right away I  will quickly empty the cyclone bowl. The herb and glass are so hot that it will mostly all come out with ease. If you wait to empty your bowl it can get sticky and require a tool to scrape everything out. I have found that emptying it quickly will cause less resin and plant matter to build up. That build up actually starts to clog up the glass on glass elbow to bowl attachment.On that note of ways to keep your vape clean make sure you do! If you use clean glassbags then you will notice better airflowheat transfer and unobstructed vapor flavour!Have fun.,vaporents,cmgx0nh,2,t5_2upjd

You cannot put any more than .V a freshly charged .V battery comes off the charger at .V to it. Do you have any idea how much voltage you are putting to a . load at   watts? Thats  volts!! Thats more than DOUBLE what the part you are blowing up is designed to handle. PI x E and EI x R. P is Power measured in Watts. I is Current measured in Amperes. E is Electromotive Force measured in Volts. R is Resistance measured in Ohms . Are you familiar with those equations?  You would need to have a much higher impedance coil to put more than . volts to it. Wattage is a measure of power. Voltage is a measure of electromotive force. Voltage matters.

2638560,0,t1_cn2ykit,Look into the verdamper and associated health hazards from nichrome heating elements. I got as far as either choosing a ceramic heater ssv or a halogen light herbaliser. So the thing lacking as far as I can see is an all glass airway that has awesome accurate temperature control. So the advantage of the light is that it turns on and off instantly. Which means if you used the herbaliser bowl you could drill a small hole below the screen and insert a temp probe. With that you can then have exact temperatures of the air going over your herb. Then attach that to a glass tube. Point the light at the glass tube and house it.All glass airway instant heat up awesomely accurate temperature control. ,vaporents,cn2zqg4,1,t5_2upjd

3166741,0,t3_2wd0n5,Hey! So ive had the MFLB for about a year and the PAX for about a month...   Disappointed in the pax! It really does go through your weed ive modded it to reduce the chamber size and its still a nightmare. And the worst part is it doesnt get me very high! i cant break past a  with the pax and i really dont know why. The weed is cooked to shit and the vape hits are nice with loads of smoke but for some reason its just never enough for the amount of weed im putting in it.If you need a portable then imo maybe the pax just wins wins V the standard MFLB due to discreteness coolness  and ease of use  BUT if you can vape by a power source then get the ACDC adapter for the MFLB its a game changer! Instant vape smoke at variable and therefor perfect temps and it gets me high on half the load of the PAX. If your happy with the MFLB then dont waste your money on the PAX. If you dont own a portable already than maybe go with the PAX but only if being discrete is more important than getting the most out of your sticky dank.,vaporents,coq8c85,2,t5_2upjd

3224730,0,t1_cow6cra,Ill have to agree that the MFLB is a great package at  dollars thats a steal for sure. But ever since the Magic Flight Company changed their rules for resale its become increasingly difficult to find an authentic MFLB for under the MSRP of  dollars. Its not to say its impossible to find one that cheap but its not as common specially since a lot of the ebay listings are knock offs.The MFLB is great but I stick to my original statement that a lot of people have made their decision to buy an MFLB because others have it and talk about it all the time. Ive had this conversation before and there really is no definitive answer but rather its specific to each person. For me the Flowermate wins over the MFLB for various reasons. First I prefer the feel and the taste of vapor when it travels an all glass path or at least where the stem is glass. The flowermate has a tiny glass stem which can be stored in the unit making it easily portable unlike the MFLBs long glass stem. Again I prefer not to hit out of the wood. In terms of a battery I like how the MFLB can have multiple batteries unlike the flowermate but I also do not like carrying around batteries unless Im out on a tripthis is why I like the Air its the best of both worlds with an easily replaceable internal battery. In terms of the material although wood looks nice I really do not think its the best material for the body mostly because it catches peoples eye easily if taken out. When you hold a flowermate most people think its a normal ecig mod.But in all the MFLB is great vape if you can find one for . For anything more I would go flowermate or if you can elbow out the dough the Air is the best way to go.,vaporents,cow8wg1,2,t5_2upjd

Since it was a kick starter project there have been updates about twice a month which is nice and a video session of two something girls trying it out. The theory is that theyre building a paxkiller though. Their highest end model costs about  less than the pax and pax just dropped prices by .  I was on the wait list to buy one and was able to preorder it last week but the units wont ship until April. I think it will be great and Im excited but there are guys who have been waiting well over a year for it with not much to show for it yet so some people are getting frustrated with the grasshopper team. ,vaporents,cozxj2g,20,t5_2upjd

I would imagine PVHES make it easier to draw really fast because of the advertised  better air flow. You wont get more vapor by drawing too fast because youre making it harder for the Airs oven to keep up with you as it cools based on your draw.,vaporents,cp9xtj2,1,t5_2upjd

I rarely post on rvaporents simply because I am a rploompax mod and I am a rabid fanboy selfadmitted and if I were to post here with more regularity it would as you noted seem skewed and like I was marketing to an audience. That is the last thing I want to do for as noted several times I do not work for PAX Labs nor am compensated by them in any way. As noted in the review post within rploompax both myself and uploompaxmod received the new PAX  without warning or request and were both surprised and humbled to be part of the small subset of individuals who were able to try them out before launch. I am excited to have received that opportunity but have reviewed the device as honestly as I could given my own personal restrictions lack of device history because noone else in my life owns them not being a professional reviewer etc. I hope that I can continue to rarely post to rvaporents and hopefully not get permadownvotes for it... but with the persistent hatred and bile I receive daily amp incessantly from users like uCheebachiefer it makes it very hard to feel like rvaporents is a safe space where individuals can come to share their personal vape love and not be shitcanned just for being a fan.We all have our device favorites and we all have our reasons both personal opinions and verifiable facts why we feel X is better than Y... but to resort to unrelenting personal attacks via incendary commentary towards myself and others simply for liking a device and sharing information on it?

I think I like the regular glass stem over the thick one but the thick one is a beast I cant imagine breaking the thick one.I like to use finely ground bud and throwing a little kief in is always a fantastic time. I DO push my screens up a little closer to the heating element than they came stock in the stems because I like my AVB pretty dark.For the love of god make sure not leaning the stem forward when youre drawing or else you can run the risk of herb touching the heating element. Do you want to combust? Because thats how you combust. Also to everyone asking did I combust? Youll fucking know if you combusted. The goddamn stem will LIGHT up and youll be mad at yourself for the shitty taste youre experiencing until you clean your stem and screen.

You can read about this later when you want to start tweaking. I couldnt be happier with my flowermate mini.

4197099,0,t3_38rrr9,Would be nice to hear opinions from users of both units such as yourself OP Ive only used the ion once and the volcano on multiple occasions but I preferred the ease of use of the volcano since it was at a lounge scenario and its solid valve MP. An employee of a dispensary I belong to has access to both units owns a cano and said he has only used the ion once but has owned his volcano for going on  years and says it functions great aside from mild vapor leaking shared by both units most likely a byproduct of the bag making tech. Personally I would buy a volcano if I ever wanted just bags just because I know it will last me a decade and is as functional as the other unit. This all being said I think SampB need a new product to compete with newer vapes coming out that are multipurpose and still luxury IE herbalizer However that being said I am eagerly awaiting my VXC Evo on Monday which I chose over both options also have used the sublimator and verdamper sub wasted herb and the verdamper underheated so polar opposites this however boils down to personal preference quite obviously and intended usage. My previous vape was a UD RIP with a Solo for the meantime vape I bought from a friend so I am more akin to a log style using water filtration or direct draw as opposed to a bag system. Personally the solo cannot get me the airflow or clouds I want through water I currently am dabbing off an enail and intend to cut my oil usage down near entirely with the Evo where the UD could and my upcoming VXC should match it or blow it away at.In the end everyone has their own preferences and vapes that meet their own needs some like bags some like direct draw seems like you enjoy bag vaping so Id be quite eager to hear your opinion of the Ion the Volcano and also maybe the Q if you have tried all three as bags. It would give a good introspective for future buyers and cut back immensely on useless forum posts.,vaporents,crynyow,1,t5_2upjd

4320057,0,t1_csclgva,It wont charge anymore. I get a blue light and flashing green light but the yellow lights dont start lighting up. Last time this happened I replaced the battery and it started working again but not immediately maybe like a day or two later. That wasnt too long ago so I dont see how the battery could already be dead again. Its probably worth ordering another battery but if it doesnt work then that will be a waste of about . At this point the Solo is beat up quite a bit plastic breaking off and the heating cup is really wonky since Ive taken the thing apart so many times so I am willing to just try to save some money for a couple weeks and upgrade to the Air. I am really curious to see if a new battery would work again but I would be mad if I wasted money on one.,vaporents,cscll8b,1,t5_2upjd

Then You can tell me what do You think about to make a ceramic oval piece that perfectly fits into the ceramic heater and closes perfectly to the upper glass filter to make Ascent silicone staying away from my taste sense and lungs. If You have a better solution to offer please show me so we can discuss together I do medical use of cannabis to reduce muscular tone due to my quadriplegia so I want to vaporize cannabis with its aroma and nothing else with nothing more.You can contact me at paolos.ita AT gmail .COM. Privately Ill give You my address so You can send that new Ascent piece to me for free.Final words Ascent comes with a luxury package You dont need a call service to provide those basic informations on silicone or whatever burnoff we are going to burn nothing. BUT if well find a good solution You can put this new piece into the box and make it available for every Ascent. It should be a WOW thing!Thank You very much for paying attention best regards!!Please do your best for fast answering other way Ill send the Ascent back.Paolo Sita Italia,vaporents,csdzo53,1,t5_2upjd

That means a lot of the good stuff is actually going to solidify and get stuck on your piece. Thats what resin is as well it just contains tar from combustion byproducts.Using warm water will decrease your chances of the vapor condensing back to an oil but anything besides straight to your lungs is going to lose potency vapor density and flavor. When I was younger and didnt know any better I used to attribute the wispy hits when I was using ice to the decreased volume in the bong but it turns out it was literally killing the smoke.  gt however vapor is dryReally?

I set it down and he picked it up and crumpled it in his hand after reading it and then said come in Monday and we will exchange it for the new one in the color you want or we can refund your money he was actually incredibly polite  he let me amp my friend take whatever drink we wanted from his machine for free and even offered to buy me lunch haha the other man shook my hand with both of his and apologized profusely if it was an honest mistake I would actually feel pretty bad. I was already at about a  and didnt even think to ask for the receipt back. After looking at my vape more it seems to be legit actually the only thing odd about it is the box  which was opened and for a different color pax than I got. I can only find  other thing off about my pax even after looking incredibly closely at the details like how round the light X is the screen the mouthpiece the text on it color etc etc which is the mouthpiece is a bit rough sounding like its not lubricated enough... but that could most likely be fixed with lubricant. It very well could be a real one that just had a faulty battery thats not too surprising. Ill just have to see what this new one looks like because now Ive learned enough to actually tell if its fake or not based on the box.edit I also emailed Ploom with the serial and they will most likely tell me if its real by tomorrow,vaporents,ctpmx5a,1,t5_2upjd

This helps people medicate which helps with many problems people have including OCD as well as physical pain and enables them to receive treatment without the judgment and negative repercussions that other people wrongly ascribe.Why do you care if it looks like another medical devise?

5246615,0,t3_3musam,Ive made the switch to  vapor and I use an Arizer solo for everything. Its strong enough to hit like a desktop vape yet small enough to be portable although not the most discreet. It can also do wax and oils and can be attached to water toolsbongs etc. Has a power adapter and a good easily replaceable battery.The one thing you really want to pay attention to is the battery. Can it be replaced? Can you also power the vape via the wall.

I already own the Air and I was considering getting the Mighty or depending on how the Zion is until I heard the battery issues with the Mighty. So until thats all sorted out Im cool with the Air.Did you get the Bog Wood or Granadillo?

5273908,0,t3_3n8a33,If you have a Flowermate Id say a worthwhile upgrade for you would be an Arizer Air or Solo. A solo will most definitely get the job done and I can attest that it is very portable but you could pay a little bit ore for an Air which is the same thing in a more convenient package. A DaVinci Ascent is trash it very poorly maintains temperature and everything Ive heard says the vapor quality is poor. The Haze v is definitely looking to be a good contender and its likely similar to what you have in the Flowermate in terms of form factor however it comes with a great deal of accessories and unless you really need something for concentrates I wouldnt say its worth the price. Craftys are top of the line but theyre also incredibly expensive their customer service is shit and if it breaks which is somewhat likely according to the high number of incident reports youre fucked. If the Grasshopper were available Id recommend it now and Id say you wouldnt need to upgrade for another  years after you bought it. Unfortunately it might be another year before you actually get it. If you want something that will keep you incredibly happy for a very long time Id go with an Arizer Solo or Air and again theyre the same thing one just costs more for added portabilitybattery support.,vaporents,cvlsvd3,6,t5_2upjd

5290587,0,t3_3ngskl,Ascent is the only vape ive ever had. Had it about  year so far. Taste is really good and im sure the all glass path helps with that. I would hate to taste plastic or metal at higher temps. I use a few glass flowers as spacers and so quite economical too if that matters. Ultimately i got it as i wanted to stop smoking but didnt want to stop getting high a few nights every night a week and it has really helped  used in conjuntion with vaping an ecig! I dont seem to get much vapour production but it gets me where i want to go and then some.Absolute fav thing for me is that every few weeks the glass stem needs cleaning which means stem milk    which makes me beaked as a sea snake.It doesnt feel great in the hand which shouldnt matter but i wish it was more ergonomic. really small issue though,vaporents,cvnxnfl,4,t5_2upjd
5291646,0,t3_3nftmi,Checkout the Goboof Alfa. Its significantly cheaper than the Pax  and is very well reviewed. I just got mine a week or two ago and it seems to me that the build quality is quite high. Long battery life well designed conduction oven heats your herbs more evenly than a lot of other conduction vapes. Stainless steel vapor path helps cool the tasty vapor. Plus its designed and made in Ireland vs the Pax  which is made in China. Although personally I dont have anything against products made in China since China is actually where a lot of high quality products come from I did like that I was able to get a vape thats similar to the Pax  for a much lower price even though its made in a country thats more developed and probably has high safety standards since its in the EU. ,vaporents,cvo2il4,3,t5_2upjd

So from that evidence I can discern that its probably not a very strong vaporizer. Maybe its more stealthy.The Launch Box on the other hand can be as strong as you push it to be. It requires a technique to use though  my favorite is stacking hits with temperature regulation which turns it into beast.

5701463,0,t1_cx3qtap,The air has swappable batteries. For easy numbers each battery can hold about an hours worth of use. The solo does not have a removable battery but in my experience I could get almost  hours out of a single charge. The air is much sleeker and for a size comparison is pretty close to a pill bottle and half stacked vertically. the solo is a little fatter and slightly shorter. The air comes with short stems that help with stealth while carrying it around. The solo comes with a long bent stem and a long straight stem. In terms of vapor quality I found both to be comparable. Honestly the easiest breakdown is size and battery life. If you need an all day tank the solo is your best bet. If you want something a little more stealthy then the air is more for you. Both are easy to use solid vapes. If you have any questions on either definitely let me know I have tons of experience with bothJust realized I didnt really answer your question haha but in my personal experience I carried the solo everywhere. The long stems did make it a little tough to throw in a pocket but that being said I never had to leave it home because I wasnt able to carry it. You just need to be mindful of the glass. The slight inconvenience in size is made up for with the amazing performance the solo gives. Hands down my favorite vape so far. ,vaporents,cx3tlem,2,t5_2upjd

The melting point of nnDMT is below C and the boiling point not too far past that and you dont want to reach the boiling point anyway because it would pyrolyse like sugar in fact thats why a precise boiling point isnt exactly known it changes based on decomposition from heating! But I believe its around C. If youve had the fumarate salt which I dont think can be smoked thats around the range you specified.

Also why combustion really messes you up  all those nasty chemicals in the smoke from the burnt cellulose get added to the vapour.

5813697,0,t1_cxheuk8,Well the official amount .g to .g and really you should be using the finishing grinder if you arent. I have loaded my trench and weighed out the amount on an industrial lab quality scale and I get between .g and .g which considering the equipment and coincidence with official numbers Im gonna believe first. You should know the herb should not be touching ANY part of the bars at the top of the trench if looking at it from the sides the herb should be sitting BELOW the bars which are visible through the screen. Roughly  of the way to full. For increased efficiency load a little less as its mostly conduction and the IR heating is  or less of the efficacy. Finally you may want to get a new scale because it is not even close to possible for .g to be accurate. However most cheap scales have a margin of error of .g so there ya go. ,vaporents,cxhqrsh,0,t5_2upjd

There are other by products that make the cloud opaque for sure and you can tell how much more diffuse the vapor vs. smoke is by seeing how long it takes to disperse.Keep in mind there is a lot going on in the clouds and your eyes play small tricks on you.  Smoke is much more dense than vapor but in the proper lighting you may not see too much of a difference.  But when you dont see much of a difference there may be a larger difference then imaginable.  Humans see logarithmically so a small change in observed brightness reflects a factor of  obviously based from whatever base of logarithm.

Anecdote A while back the police showed up to my dorm due to smell complaints we had combusted in a flight box about  minutes prior. When they came in they confiscated all the weed and paraphernalia. Except for our AVB.You see  My roommate and I would keep our AVB in a coffee jar and we had over  grams of AVB which is a felony amount.

6140808,1,t1_cyniyce,gt No one here is criticizing your original intention and saying original presumes your intention changed at some point? the criticism comes from the blatant misrepresentation of information regarding this product.You absolutely are criticizing my intention you are accusing me of being a marketer and an advertising trying to deceive the community and claiming my opinions are not my own but were paid for.I did not misrepresent anything I clearly define knowing the people at Firefly and how I met them in my post.gt Very glad you ask youd know if you ever posted on here before I would post a review without wordforword sentences from a companys marketing material.The heating element technology is proprietary and is not available in any other vaporizer. Explaining how it works and what it does and the effect it has on cannabis is not marketing materials. It is a description of how the device works and what it does. Considering it is unique technology there is no other description of the technology that exists because that is how this device works.gt Suspicious how you claim to be such an avid vaporizer enthusiast who was just too shy to post here on his main but youre trivializing how people should post here. Assuming you are the enthusiast you claim to be you would know rather well how product reviews work as well as would have seen examples of other individuals being given similar opportunities.I am not trivializing anyone other than you. I asked the moderators what they would prefer and they suggested a review instead of an AMA. I also reviewed several similar reviews. Essentially youre mistaking my enthusiasm and writing style for marketing speak when it is my opinion. I shouldnt have to censor my creativity because you dont like how I write.gt Yet again you consulted with Firefly and they had something to do with the content of your post. Thats what this is about and that why youre being accused of being a liar. Isnt it funny how it takes you so long to make that argument up when you could have responded the first time with that information. You silly.They had nothing to do with the content of my post I was waiting for approval to reveal sensitive product details until a point where they were comfortable with me doing so. There is no conspiracy here. I did not lie. I agreed not to publish until they were okay with me publishing. They didnt alter the content of my post.gt No money changed hands no discussion of money ever occurred.gt Cool. Want a cookie? You still consulted with them your post is filled with their literature and they approved the post meaning it was a cooperative effort done between a company and an individual. If you had to get your post approved by the company its involving its not your review.I am not for sale. This review was my idea I wrote it and the only thing I agreed to was waiting to publish it.Once again I was provided an opportunity to be privy to sensitive product information. I was trusted with said information and agreed not to release it until I was given approval to release it. That has nothing to do with the content of my post. This is highly typical of most product reviews and journalism in general.gt Yes I know how tech reviews work. I also know the difference between an honest review and when someone is trying to sell me something. Nice try though you almost got away with it.You clearly know nothing about the tech industry journalism or how product reviews are conducted. Have you ever worked as a paid product reviewer? Journalist? Blogger? Didnt think so.gt No one knows who you are but you went with your friends and one of the executives of the company whose vaporizer you reviewed. Even if you expect me to believe that it wouldnt explain why you werent active on this subreddit under an alternate account assuming you are the avid enthusiast you claim to be with nearly  in vaporizers. happens every week in San Francisco and is open to anyone with a medical card. I have been on this sub plenty of times I just dont comment. This is true of  of the subs I visit. I did not know anyone at Firefly until I met them at Ganja Yoga which takes place a few blocks away from their office.gt You also cant claim to have  not known about this subreddit since youve been on Reddit for  years and posted here once to advertise the release of the Pax  but Im not providing any commentary on that Im only addressing this post and relevant discussion regarding your career relationships with multiple Firefly executives and content of your post and responses.I know about this sub obviously and Ive been here many times before. I just dont comment. I read rtrees too and dont participate there either.gt So you admit to minimizing them? Im at least taking my time to address every thing you say so I dont look like a jackass who ignores statements. You just admitted to minimizing the things Im saying I by no means need to say anything else for that is an admission of avoid whats really important in this argument.Why on earth would I reinforce false accusations.No youre not. Youve ignored several points Ive made in pervious comments. Lets go over you original comment and see how many points youve addressedYour first comment claims I am a marketing consultant hired to say good things about the Firefly yet I wasnt hired or paid by Firefly. FALSEI run a consulting company. TrueBut so what? I dont consult for Firefly I havent been paid by them and I dont work for them. In fact Ive never been paid to do anything in the cannabis industry.Fireflys office is in Washington not San Francisco. FALSENot only did you not understand that being legally based in another state doesnt mean jack shit you made it sound like I never visited their office because they arent in San Francisco. Well they are in San Francisco and another comment pointed out the founder of Firefly lives in San Francisco and even provided the office address to Firefly which is borderline against Reddits policies of posting personally identifiable information.I went after the Pax because theyre Fireflys competitor. FALSE Here is my Pax   The reason I mentioned my Pax  is because Im a Pax  user. You even found a post I made somewhere about the Pax  apparently. I dont work for PaxLabsPloom or whatever they call themselves now. The reason I compared the Firefly to the Pax  is because the Pax  is my main vaping device.You even questioned if I was a tech blogger. Which I was but Im not going to reveal anymore info for you to stalk me with.When it comes down to it almost all of your claims against me are entirely untrue and although you used logic to come to these conclusions that doesnt mean youre correct or telling the truth.gt The fact of the matter is if anyone looks at my reddit account theyll see that is mostly me trying to help people and if they look at your account theyll see a troll who makes fun of people with autism.gt Once you start losing an argument you have to make personal attacks huh? I said nothing regarding anything that wasnt relevant to this discussion but you found the subreddit my friends and I made in high school and are using that to support the claim that youre telling the truth even though youre continuing to ignore the content of this discussion and would rather question the content of my character. Congratulations youre so good at arguing.Youve been questioning my character and making unfounded accusations towards me based on my Reddit history all day am I not allowed to do the same?I spend my time and energy helping people unlike you. It speaks to your character that you think it is okay to make fun of mentally disabled people.Just like you thought it was okay to make wild unfounded accusations against me. All you figured out is I am who I say I am. Congrats that was already in my post.gt I am just a Redditor who also does not work for Firefly and this post was not bullshit. It was me sharing an unusually rare experience that youve decided to undermine through false accusations and bullshit of your own.gt It is an unusually rare experience usually Reddit weeds out advertisers a bit quicker but its all taken care of now.gt The only person who has done or said anything dishonest here is you.gt So now Im dishonest? Prove to me where I was intentionally dishonest and didnt use logic and evidence to back up these conventions.I just used plenty of evidence of things you said that were incorrect. Even when presented with evidence to the contrary youre still refusing to back down from your position even though Ive provided more then enough explanation to the fallacy of your allegations. The use of logic doesnt mean what youve concluded is correct. Facts can be spun just like you spun them in a direction that isnt representative of the truth.In this case all of your evidence was mostly false and the few things you got correct were things I was completely open and transparent about in my post in my interactions with the moderators and in the comments.Most of your evidence is false your conclusions are incorrect and yet you continue to post misinformation supporting a position Ive already proven to be untrue. Im pretty sure that is called dishonesty.,vaporents,cynn93u,2,t5_2upjd

So every time you put in the mouth piece you where over packing causing the herb to get mashed into the screens making them even harder to clean as well as restricting airflow. I think youll have a much more pleasurable experience now.,vaporents,cyr7zoh,2,t5_2upjd

6202142,0,t3_40j2m6,I cant say anything about the PAX but it looks like theres been some already on that. The Air is a taste fiend. Of all my vapes the Air is the one that brings out the flavors the most  Save the VapeXhale Evo. While it has some minor flaws its a very solid choice. Said flaws mostly personal Heat up time. This is actually really good compared to some but along with the time it takes to heat up there is a lot of mindfulness needed to maintain temperature for the Air. I.E. you breathe too hard you have to wait  seconds for it to reheat.  Ease of use. Dont get me wrong this thing is EZPZ to use. However the Air definitely needs some prevaping maintenance. First the herb should be properly ground and placed into the stem. If youre lazy about it you will not have a happy session. Luckily it never needs to be cleaned unless you want to clean your stems. The Air is a great device. Very portable never needs to be cleaned has had few warranty repairs so Ive been told from retail stores and because of its exchangeable batteries can always be ready to go for use.The only prevalent flaw in my opinion is how aware of the packed stem you need to be. It is very touchy and to be honest I have gotten tired of worrying about stems because I just use a different vape now as I have the option. ,vaporents,cyum8gk,5,t5_2upjd

Ill probably pick one up eventually if it lives up to the hype and once the wait for it will be at least somewhat predictable. As it is I think only  people who preordered have production units in hand so its really hard to say. If the first few people to get it are still singing its praises in six months then Ill probably pick one up to see if it fills an unexpected niche for me. Or if I can pick one up around the price I prefer off of a friend or ent exchange I probably will.

If you didnt notice recent news in the last few weeks Source was called out on using a Ti alloy on its wires when users found out that after ripping several carts apart their coils were soldered.  Which of course is impossible with Ti Grade  you have to crimp your coils with Ti .  So people demanded an explination from Source who is very activeor was till this all happened in rWaxpen.  Their response was to remove all mentions of Gr  Ti from the website and to start demanding their resellers remove the branding as well and then released their XL Orb saying we never meant to brand a dozen products with Ti  it was actually a placeholder for our Ti arguably less healthy to use XL orb.  Which is clearly bullshit.  Source wasnt able to convince anyone and they never so much as apologized instead telling us to get the true taste XL for their real Ti.  Which you could do.  Or you could go with the only wax company that uses safe components and has for something like  years now?  Wtech is a pretty great company Sam is really active on the sub and on FC and they are about  cheaper than Dr.DabberSourceCloud and all these other rebrands.

6343502,0,t1_czanzna,They both have very similar performance wed be splitting hairs trying to compare that. As for everything else though its close but Id go with the Flowermate V.S. Mainly because it has a very large battery life has a glass mouthpiece and it all fits nicely in a very compact package that looks like a power bank or ecig mod. Its very versatile because of this.The Xmax V pro is a very close second only because it has replaceable batteries which means you can buy extra  batteries and a wall charger and have enough batteries for around the clock vaping. I would almost say its a must to have an extra battery since the battery life of the Xmax is half of the FMV.SSadly the FM doesnt have replaceable batteries so once its out you have to charge it. And you would have to buy an extra glass mouthpiece for the Xmax since the stock one is plastic which is only decent I hear.Id say when you add up all the extra investment for the Xmax with the batteries charger and mouthpiece its price would be over that of the FMV.S just to match it. Lastly what is your price range? Id suggest the Arizer Air if you can spare at least  which beats out both the Xmax and FMV.S. I dont mean to make your head spin with too many suggestions its just something to consider if youre some one that might want to upgrade later. But if youre new and unsure about vaping the FMv.S is a great place to start.,vaporents,czaopb8,1,t5_2upjd

They all do fit though.Any issues with the glass stem? No issues with the glass but the plastic mouthpiece on one is cracking from tightening it too muchDoes the stem get resin even after I clean it? The stem will gradually accumulate resin as you vape no matter how clean it isDoes the stem smell after vaping if you were trying to hide it?I am used to the smell of vaping so I am not too aware of it but I keep mine in a airtight glass jarwhich solves this problemWhat do you usemethods do you use to clean the stem?If its really gooey ill scrape the resin with a small metal pick. if you want it to look pretty id soak it in some ISO Is it safe to purchase off of an eBay seller with positive feedback and reputation?I personally have no experience with purchasing one on eBay but Puffitup has genuine Arizer Airs for  with code AIR Has anyone here purchased off of an eBay seller? NAAny malfunctioningissues youve had with it?None whatsoever What would you change about the device? The small plastic oven cap is a bit cheap and falls off sometimes. The bit of herb at the opening of the filled stem gets a bit charred if on high temps.What other vaporizers do you have and how does it do in comparison? I had a V PRO Series  pen vape that worked but it was very poor quality in comparison to the Arizer Airlittle vapor small chamber bad battery. The taste is very clean and vapor production is much more consistent in the Air.How long does the battery last? I often switch temps throughout the session but Id say I can vape around  bowls on a full chargeHow fast does it take to charge?pretty slow around  hours from deadAny recommended accessories anyone should purchase with it?If you go with the Air replaceable batteries are great. Planetvape has high efficiency glass stems with slitted air paths and larger holes in the stem that help with the draw resistance. They also carry water pipe attachment stems. If you go for the GonGglass on glass stem a small bubbler is a great addition.What should anyone interested in buying a SoloAir be aware of?if you are worried about faulty products buy from a reputable seller.

6672760,0,t1_d08a1cu,The pods get mixed reactions. Some basic setbacks are you cant pack as much herb and they take longer to heat because the pod adds a second layer between the herbs and the heating element. If you are at home vaporizing while watching Rick and Morty then you are better off packing herbs in the chamber without the pods. If you are out hiking or on the ski slopes the pods are a huge win. Our shop is in Tahoe when it is freezing outside having pre loaded pods that you can use without taking your gloves off is a huge win. Different strokes for different folks. The good thing about the flowermate is you have the option to do whichever option works best for you. D,vaporents,d09iroy,1,t5_2upjd

I really wonder why vaporizers still suck in battery life... It must suck to run out of battery life after  minutes IMO  this means that you need  batterys with the Arizer Air to have the same battery life as the FlowerMate Pro.  Weird but looks like its true.

6694576,0,t1_d0bqs8k,Totally agreed. The hopper seems like such a neat piece of technology but the company just needs to get their shit together. Im still thinking Ill probably grab one once they have shipping and everything sorted out down the road.  What were the things that attracted you most to the hopper? Because I might recommend the Venus Apollo which I have preordered ATM if your primary consideration was that it would be a hard hitting convection portable. Ill probably be posting a review when I get mine so maybe keep an eye out and see if youre interested. Theres also the Zion though have been some recent delays and drama over there as well but my instinct would still be that theyre going to get you your vape much quicker than GH. Those are both a definite step up pricewise from the hopper though.

I also purchased a case for the pax  hydra titan  that has made traveling with it easier.I have a WPA for both and the carrying case for both. The PAX   fits in my pocket much easier than the haze v does. Smell wise the PAX  seems to have a little bit more smell than the haze v. I try to keep my pax as clean as possible.

Ill be thrilled to switch back to convection soon but I have to say Ill probably be keeping this thing for when I want something simple tiny and more or less guaranteed to work.

6734584,0,t1_d0fuvh8,Haha alright well if you dont  mind always being tied to a wall outlet when you wanted to vape a good desktop can vape circles around most portable vapes in the same way that a dedicated desktop PC will out perform mobile gaming platforms. Desktops can afford to be larger since they generally stay put and without batteries they can dedicate all of the space they take up to maximizing vapor production or doing cool stuff like filling bags for you. And if you were only planning to vape at home Id definitely recommend one over a portable.Portables are great for vaping wherever you want but the reason I was asking about details is because theyre all so different and since theyre so small they will sometimes compromise some features in favor of others. Details like size shape construction materials butane powered battery powered battery size temperature control of which there are several kinds conduction convection good in groups best for solo use etc. Are all things people usually ask about when looking for vape suggestions.

6830535,0,t1_d0qiv3u,It has two different pods you can put into the chamber but not two different chambers. The chamber is a ceramic cylinder that you can put just the herb straight in or use the herbconcentrate pod for a no mess and easy load. They are also good for keeping a few loads pre packed as I have heard. The FM with no pod is probably going to hold . grams on the higher but still usable end. Since you are new grams in a vape versus grams smoked tend to get you a bit further. Anecdotal evidence I had a friend of mine who smokes grams a day vape my FM Mini to himself packed the chamber with about . and he was absolutely wrecked when we bumped it up to high. Personally I cant recommend vapes enough but I will say try before you buy if you can. At least try some type of reputable actual vaporizer first not the Snoop pens or any of the like to get an idea of what you like and what you dont. I really wish I could have and as much as I like my FM Mini I personally wish I bought something better to begin with. Ive been eyeing up the Firewood v for its quick heat up times and convection something I absolutely love the idea of in terms of utter efficiency while remaining cheap. I have the Grasshopper preordered July th  was my pre order date and am excited for that when it comes lord knows when... Some entry level vapes that are just above the FM lines in price and generally revered reliability and efficiency would be the Airizer Air or the Airizer Solo if you dont mind size you will save money with the Solo Goboof Alfa Firewood V and if youre willing to wait indefinitely the Grasshopper.Cheers mate hope you find something you like and welcome to the community.,vaporents,d0qjidp,3,t5_2upjd

7227724,0,t1_d1zc3b5,gt So where to next on this journey...get that back porch sports car which is bad ass take a chance on a Boundless probably a lateral move at best go for the Mighty or see if the Air is  as good as a Mighty at half the price and easier maintenance?Lol its a tough call. The Mighty has very little drag resistance  more on the level of your Lotus. The Air has more drag resistance than the Mighty so you cant pull equally large clouds with it they are two different experiences the Airs drag resistance basically forces you to enjoy a longer vaping sessionThe Mighty is a smart move if youre seeing a smoother hit  the cooling unit is very special and does truly cool off the vapor before hitting your lips yet I still find SO many customers who wish to pair their mighty with water which is pretty funny since youd think their whizbanger patented cooling unit design would mitigate the desire for water.Also it should be noted that even SampB BampS? has directly told people The Mighty wasnt intended to be used repeatedly  for heavy use vaporizing and they recommend customers purchase the SampB Plenty or SampB Volcano for heavy use. Ive always felt that the Mighty was a bit overpriced  I personally would never pay more than  on the Mighty. But then again Ive also used and owned several dozen vapes at every price point thanks to my business.Its only a matter of time before someone ships me a CFX Firefly and an Apollo to start making accessories for it. I know its a cheap vaporizer but have you considered the Vapcap?  I have been really impressed by its performance. I actually sold my Lotus when I got my Vapcap  yes the Lotus can blow bigger clouds and pairs with water easier but the VCs clicking temp indicator REALLY helps prevent combustion  unless youre an idiot like me who forgets to wait for the cooldown click before reheating. For me the VC is more durable portable and stealthy than the Lotus for my needs.   Note I opted for a Titanium Woodie version of the Vapcap  more expensive but also more durable since theres no glassFor   Shipping Id absolutely recommend adding it to your arsenal. ,vaporents,d1zql49,1,t5_2upjd

7262346,0,t3_4euxhs,In my MFLB how fine your grind is makes a difference in how easily and well it hits. If youre taking in the hit and you feel that tickle in your throat thats the THC and the vapor too try to hold it in. Dont hold it in till youre going to pass out or anything. Ive found I get more effect if I dont just immediately breathe the vaporsmoke out. It also teaches you not to take big wasteful hits. If it was my first time but I somehow still had all my experience and knowledge? I wouldnt take more than  light hits and Id make sure to hold it in for a reasonable amount of time. If I do more than that I usually cant function at  but some people you cant even tell the difference. Everybody has their own preference and tolerance. There are heavy users that do multiple bowls with their breakfast.It all depends on what you have where you are what you plan on doing how high you plan to get.

7516268,0,t1_d2wf64c,I would think the smoother hits off of such a set up would be the result of condensation due to the rapid temperature change. All that would accomplish would be less vapor getting to your mouth and dirty glass. With vaping there isnt any tar ash etc to filter out. The water is there to condition the overly dry air coming from your vape and the crud left on the glass is just condensed vapor that could have gotten you higher if you hadnt used water. We make a trade off between efficiency and comfort when we introduce water but if you take it too far your just needlessly wasting herb and money. If you just run it through warm water and turn the heat down on your vape you will accomplish the same thing in a much simpler and more efficient way. Just bump the temp of your vape up as the vapor becomes too wispy to notice and you should have a very comfortable vape experience if you find your water negatively affects the taste of the vapor try using distilled water I prefer it this way. That bubbler should work very well for you for on the go but for at home you may want something a little larger you dont want to put it through too much water but this may be a bit too little. You can get similar attachments from DHgate for much cheaper but ordering from China is a bit of a gamble its well worth doing once you already have a satisfying setup and you want to expand but if you can afford it go with something from a reputable vendor for your first piece planetvape is a reputable vendor. Once you have a good set up and your ready to venture into the Chinese glass market this is the one Im using  I really like it. It comes with a glass dome and nail. I put a small piece of tubing off my Extreme Q whip on the all glass Air stem I assume it can be done with the Solo strait stem as well and put the stem into the glass dome creating a mm glass on glass female stem it works great. This is the most recommended one around this subreddit  if you go with the recommended one and you have the adapter from planetvape you will need this adapter too  Hope this helps!

The more you poke around the more questions pop up!Not a lot of people can speak on the dependability of the CF since it hasnt been out as long as say the XMax but I certainly dont see it breaking or dying on me anytime soon save for maybe a clumsy friend and a pool haha. Its a hard thing to decide because it can be an investment. Personally Id say chip in the few extra bucks and go for the CF. The vapor quality heatup time and efficiency are all above my Flowermate as well as my Xmax. If you want to spend as little as possible on a battery powered vape Id go with the Xmax. It certainly isnt bad by any means at all! It provides a satisfying well rounded vape as well as replaceable batteries something the CFX does not have.If youre look for true bottom dollar and arent scared of learning techniques and practicing Id check out the Vapcap as its only . Its a butane powered one hitter looking portable vape. Arguably the smallest out there.

Dabber products can be bought on DHgate and alibaba for real cheap I went and got a Wuptech cannacig vaporizer  from oilvapes.com which was really nice and stealthy but the battery left something to be desired for long sessions. So I got an Wuptech Omega   and alpha globe  from there and it was real nice  and had more coil options and stuff for cheaper than any dr. Dabber coils. Then I went big and got a Wuptech Omicron v  from puffitup.com and it makes every other one I listed seem so shitty its ridiculous. On low temp the hits are crazy flavorful and on higher temps the damn thing produces huge clouds that rival some dab rigs. Ive used it practically all day for  days now and havent had to charge it I got the medium mA battery. Its worth it to save again and get that in my opinion but I think if you dig around you can get a box mod battery that will power the same coils as the omicron it just might look differentpossibly be less concealable than the omicron.,vaporents,d45jm9f,1,t5_2upjd

Its apparently really good Im gonna be getting one for myself soon but we dont know about the last  years bit its a fairly new vape.  If you want something with a bit more of a proven track record then the mighty is right up your alley but its significantly more expensive.gtI smoke for antianxiety and I usually see people vaping for strictly THC. Are portable vapes good for other components of flower such as CBN and CBD? Those are really what I am searching for.Different temps  different effects.  Heres a useful little chart if you ever lose it its under useful links on the right side of the screengtI dont smoke too often usually on the weekends because of work how much did you see your use go UP instead of DOWN just because it was much easier to smoke throughout your daily life?During the week my frequency of smoking stayed the same  once or twice at night after work.  On the weekends it went up quite a bit were talking like  times if I dont have anything planned for that day.  However my overall amount of herb smoked went down big time.  I can make a  oz last me months where as when I smoked it would last me a few weeks.Keep in mind that with vaping its much easier to measure out your dosage and the high is much more functional than smoking.  You wont get that initial bum rush of a high that you get when you smoke.  Thats actually caused by all the chemicals that are released from burning which you wont be getting when you vape.  Itll sneak up on you a bit so just take it easy the first couple of times until you figure out your tolerance to vaping.,vaporents,d4d0ubx,3,t5_2upjd

8409098,0,t1_d5s2vys,I dunno about a particular discussion but airtight glass that is darkly tinted is really the gold standard.  A mason jar is great a colored one is better.  This article might be usefulAnother tip of mine especially good for vaporizing if your herb is dry put a small piece of thick orange or grapefruit peel in the sealed container with it to rehydrate it.  How long it stays depends on your peel container ect but check it after half an hour and go from there.  Only combine this with proper storage and with stuff you plan to use imminently the right amount of moisture is desirable and gives you satisfying clouds but too much  heat  mold.Depending how much you get and how long it lasts you this may or may not be relevant but I have a big jar and a small jar.  The big jar is long term storage and I open it as infrequently as possible to maintain freshness.  The little jar has what Im gonna use in the near future a week or so for me.

All our rooms doors are at the end of a long hall way so literally doors side by side. I always grindvapestorepackect. in my room and no one ever smells anything. Secret to my success i work with small amounts at one time. So lets say i buy g i take aboutg and put that in its own small airtight container. Then i use that for the next few days to work with until i pull from the main container again. Ive found and tested with my room mates as long as im not opening up the big containeri often do this when im the only one there then i dont have much smell outside the room. Its funny because in my case i can vape grind all that no outside smell but i open up the momma stash box and cats out the bag and i dont open windowstowel under doorinscents none of that crap.

8446534,0,t3_4vbssf,For the most part the typical  piece grinders you see floating around are space case knock offs. If youre just looking for a grinder for a good price just pick up any. If youre trying to find that quality experience with a knockoff youre not going to find it. No cheap grinder is going to compare to a real Space Case Santa Cruz Shredder Mendo Mulcher etc. The only similarities youll find are that they look similar and they both turn a solid nug into ground material.I bought my Santa Cruz Shredder two years ago and Ive never looked back. Cheap grinders dont compare in my opinion. They feel substantially lighter the kief catchers screens arent usually fine enough they dont function and grind as smoothly and in general I find I need less effort needed to grind up dense nugs with Santa Cruz Shredder as opposed to the free one I got with my Puffitup order.Personally I would rather just shell out the extra  and get a quality product thats manufactured with quality materials and QC.,vaporents,d5xcriq,5,t5_2upjd

8522272,0,t1_d669xd3,Hmm this is strange. I wonder if you may have a defective unit basically all any vape does is heat. I cant see you doing anything wrong.Id say that I pack the bowl pretty much full not every time seeing as I dont like to get faced every time I use it. Call it maybe  gram or so. I have packed it pretty tight on occasion like as in squished in pretty good and I havent noticed it draw worse because of it just more bud  more high.I have a pretty high tolerance and two bags has me gooned in my chair almost unable to move so I dont think thats it. My only thoughts would be that your Herbalaire isnt heating the chamber as hot as it should but its hard to say over the internet.

8550115,0,t1_d6a8yyv,That is what I described stacking hits. rmflbguide But its not like its anymore of a technique than hitting a joint or a pipe or a bong. All these things have a technique to learn its just that so many of us learned it so long ago that it became second nature to the point where most people forgot they had to learn it. First time someone passed me a pipe they didnt say anything and I inhaled like a Tobacco pipe. Nothing happened. Then they said hold your finger over this little hole again. nothing happened. Its simple but its a technique nonetheless. Just like the MFLB or really any vape Ive ever used. They all have their own method that is most effective with them. Davinci part your lips slightly around the whip inhale at an average speed.Davinci Ascent create a tight seal dont pull the mouthpiece out all the way inhale as slowly as humanly possible. Haze  move the mouthpiece to the sweet spot youll hear the air change pitch and inhale hard enough to force air through the chamber. Enano inhale at a speed that wont make you cough so hard you drop it like a jackass. Pax hold the very bottom so as not to burn your hand inhale slow and with parted lips so as not to burn your throat.Flowermate inhale SUPER gently shouldnt be forcing air AT ALL. Which is completely different from pipes and bongs and joints and most vapes.I could go on and on. ,vaporents,d6ac4k0,1,t5_2upjd

8572323,0,t1_d6cqrw3,Ha the clunky cable dial complaint...the actual dial has a velcro piece so you can tie it to something stationary. The length from there to the device is about  feet. So you have  feet of slack to move it around. The cord is a little thicker than the underdog and wont fray over time but also because it is absolutely more powerful and gets much hotter than the aircore which my friend has. I have compared them. With the temp dial you have to buy extra you can turn the heat down on the underdog from its initial heat setting not up. The Nano at  gets so hot its immediate combustion. So with the extra power from the Nano and the bigger bowl fixed glass stems they offer it destroys the underdog imo. Again have you used a nano? I have used the air core. Just the fact you say they are equally powerful shows you dont know what youre talking about. Look it up. The Nano gets way way hotter and is more powerful.,vaporents,d6d4evf,0,t5_2upjd

8992316,0,t3_53fsek,I have both the Solo and the Extreme Q and honestly they both are great vaporizers. Ive had the solo about a year and a half and I recently picked up the Extreme Q. The solo did a fantastic job at getting me and my buddies stoned for the year and a half. The Extreme is pretty good at getting me stoned as well. I feel the high quicker and it feels even cleaner to me. If my tolerance wasnt through the wall then I probably get beyond baked after a couple whip hits or a bag. It uses a lot more weed compared to the solo but its a desktop so that should be expected right?So i recommend both but if you had to choose just do the Extreme. Itll do the same job just in bulk. You can use the whip and really control how much you do with it. Cheers!,vaporents,d7sqk99,2,t5_2upjd

I would suggest waiting  seconds between draws to help the heater keep up. You can use all of the temperatures to find out which one you like best. Lower temperatures are usually more flavorful and higher temperatures usually produce more vapor. A finer grind and a tighter pack will help optimize the apxs performance. ,vaporents,d7w54m8,2,t5_2upjd

Great for relaxation highly recommended. Just a heads up though damania really boosts your sex drive. You will feel hornier than usual and it can really boost your sex life.Another herb recommend is passion flower  I grow my own vine and dry the leaves  passionflower is scientifically proven to be as effective for anxiety as some benzos without all the side effects.Mint is a great goto for flavor. I also add in high cbd hemp to my satvias if it is late in the day. The cbd helps tone down the head high and helps you sleep.

First time ingesting ABV.About tsp each of ABV ground in a Mr. Coffee coffee grinder and sprinkled on a PBampJ. Naturally felt nothing for a couple hours started feeling relaxed then looked over about  mins later and saw him sheetwhite and breathing very shallow eyes closed. Sweating like crazy and not seemingly able to talk.He was so fucked up. Kept saying he had to remind himself to breathe and that when he closed his eyes he saw TV static that was turning off one pixel at a time. I also fucked up sat in the corner and watched him in horror for a couple hours he said he needed space. Then we both fell asleep sitting up from about AM  AM and were a little fucked up the whole next day.Not fun. He doesnt ever wanna go near AVB again and would now rather use it to make amp give away edibles.I hope your tolerance is higher than ours have been using our PAX once or twice a week for a about year and a half or so.

9773254,0,t1_dahiprn,I tried it last night and it was awesome. I have nothing to compare it to other than using a Haze V last week and a PAX a year or so ago. I personally like it more than both of them. Easy to use. Easy to pack and such. Cleaning is a breeze. I am sure its very similar to the solo. It mostly sounds like the Air is smaller and more portable along with interchangeable batteries.  I dont have any spares yet but might if I use it more than I think I will. I typically only smoke  times a week. ,vaporents,dahrq2t,2,t5_2upjd
9776003,0,t3_5f7s5q,Haha literally me. If you keep your door closed and a window open you shouldnt need to worry about the smell if you cant crack a window just spray some air freshener.The smell should go away on its own after m if youre doing it before bed just leave the door closed. There wont be any smell by morning.For minimal scent Id suggest a convection vaporizer. Conduction vapes tend to bake in the smell so the vaporizer itself will be somewhat smelly. Puffitup has the Flowermate Swift Pro convection vape for  until tomorrow coupon code SW I think itd be a great option for you.Just to further my point this is the view from my room. The other door is their room. Less than  away. ,vaporents,dai3wqf,3,t5_2upjd

Ended up having to pass up drinking one of my favourite wines which I had to forcefully buy for tonight because I had to babysit some people at this shitty ass house party which wasnt In the best interest of the guests but only for the host to be able to post everything on social media. TO WHICH HE then asked if I was ok to drive some of HIS guests home. Me being the caring one I obliged. I barely got a chance to smoke up had to drink tonight as that was the flow of the evening which sucks cause I prefer to savour my liquor rather than to get drunk. But I finally got a chance to get home relax unwind as my friend sleeps in my room drunk out of his mind and toke up with my Air as I type this comment for you.The air literally has picked me up when I didnt think itd be possible. Please forgive me for any shitty English. I couldnt be bothered to care about cohesion or syntax right now. All I want is to chill out and vent out about my day of babysitting and sobriety. Hope youre having a great time with the Air! Edit Fuck right. You asked for tips. Keep both batteries on deck! Glad you picked an extra batty itll come in handy! Dont take too many cycles backtoback.

It was a bit odd to hold both buttons at that angle but having used it exclusively the other way it was expected. It seemed like it could be a little stealthier that way as my hand covers the glass window which did get warm but my palm was far enough away to not get burned. The orange glow might still be noticeable as my hand didnt cover it. Not sure I would use it like that often because it did have my wrist at an odd bend but definitely usable. Will keep trying it like this but holding it with my palm underneath facing the battery cover still feels more natural. ,vaporents,dbamoqk,2,t5_2upjd

10037736,0,t3_5jgc4g,I have a PAX  which I absolutely love I had it since Nov . It still works great and great flavor as well. Only thing about PAX is you have to clean it well. I try to do it before every fill sometimes every other. A cleaning rod will help. I use PAX for on demand I fill it and I get maybe  sessions from it battery is good as well. As long as its clean PAX is great. I bought a Firefly  recently. It was expensive than PAX and even PAX . I think vapor quality is better on Firefly it heats up quickly  seconds vs  seconds on PAX vs  seconds on PAX  and cleaning is way easier on Firefly. Things that I dont like about it is battery you will get  will die pretty fast. Technique is very important with firefly and you have to do slow breath about  second breaths. Another annoying part about firefly is a stupid loose mouthpiece that falls off quite often.  I never tried an IQ but love to.

10051977,0,t1_dbg3uo4,My first vape was the Volcano. Ive used my friends Pax and was dissatisfied with the quality of the high basically. Im in a situation now where I need to be discreet  not too much odor not too loud not too big to hide  which my beloved Volcano emphatically is not. I also need to stretch my supply as far as it will go. I really do like the taste of vapor and Im looking for a relaxed experience so a slow draw would be just fine. I like the idea of USBA charging for versatility with my existing portable power supplies. Cost isnt a concern fortunately. I think the FF is the device I want. In fact I ordered one earlier tonight. What do you think? Im not clear on what you mean by connoisseur model. Do you think Im in over my head or that the FF is the wrong choice for my situation? I seriously considered just buying another Volcano but it is anything but discreet. Id really appreciate your opinion. Thank you.,vaporents,dbhsqoe,1,t5_2upjd

10360554,0,t3_5jelv3,Bit late to the question here but Ive recently purchased the pillar.  This is my first vaporizer for weed having played with disposal nicotine free hookahs and ecigs before that.   Im very happy with it.  Only recharged it for the first time last night and Ive probably refilled it at least  times.  I feel like I get really good life out of the herb I put in it and upon removing its evenly browned.    Its a really nice smooth draw and produces impressive amounts of vapor.  It also feels really really durable.  Ive dropped it a couple times and theres not a mark on it.One thing to note though is that the advertised temperature memory feature doesnt work and after contacting the retailer I bought it from they told me they couldnt get it to work either.  Not a big deal just means I have to hold down the temperature button for  seconds each time instead of it just being where I want it.Any specific questions feel free to ask.,vaporents,dcifhaz,1,t5_2upjd

10384404,0,t1_dcl4il6,gt assuming you were interested in this product what would be important information for you personally to see?The ability to self reload nonproprietary  threading i.e. compatible with devices I already own materials composition that is actually accurate no quartz atomizer nonsense price point per cart.Would not hurt at all to also have lab tests on the heating materials as well as a tear down to show exactly what everything is made from trust me if you dont do the latter the community will and if anything looks even remotely suspect it can cause a huge stink see source vapes or recent drama over the teflon on the leads of the wax coil in the saionara. It could potentially cause irrevocable damage to your brand among people who might be your biggest advocates.If your cart was competent I WOULD be interested just most likely in the cart itself not the material in it.The problem with random sampling of that nature is most people dont actually know what good wax vapes actually are which is why you see such a fan following of brands that really arent that great like Kandypens Puffco Stok etc... You want good feedback find people like me Tamang Elmoe Opiniondevice and a few others on rwaxpen who are very discerning and have experience with a wide array of wax vapes and put a cart in their hand to test with their own supply.People like that will be able to tell you not only if its good or not but how it stacks up to the competition doing stuff better than what most people are aware of.,vaporents,dcl4x9q,1,t5_2upjd

10412443,0,t3_5g1xxl,Been combusting for almost a decade. My husband and I smoke daily several times a day with long sessions. But were vegan and health conscious so we are investing in a reliable portable vaporizer. Currently considering the Haze v the Boundless series and MightyCrafty for convection and DaVinci IQ Pax  and Arizer Air for conduction but open to more suggestions What is your budget? Would you be willing to save up for a better unit or do you want one with the money you have?We want to purchase it as soon possible and have it delivered ASAP as well. Hopefully will start vaping early next week. What is your primary concern when choosing a vape? Big hits? Efficiency? Flavor? Discretion? If there are problems you want to avoid at all costs what are they?I would say those aspects are rating in importance in that order for me. First is big satisfying hits. Then a good efficient herbsaving device. Along with those is good flavor weve hated the plasticy burnt taste of cheaper conduction vapes weve had in the past. Discretion is also important but not a total deal breaker. It would be great to be able to pull it out for a quick public sesh with no worries but thats not top priority.What is your typical partaking environment? Is portability a must? Stealth?Most of the time we are toking at home for multiple bowls in one session. However the ability to take it on the go use it in the car or on camping trips is important. How many will be using at once? Are you basically a solo toker or do you want a vape good for group use as well? How about parties?Definitely seeking something good for groups simply because of our tolerance levels and current use habits. Something that can be hit around  times on one bowl would be perfect. What is unique about your situation that needs consideration? Do you have a particular medical complication? Do you need a vape with low restriction on the draw? Do you need something with replaceable batteries?No specific medical conditions to consider. But we would definitely prefer an extraordinarily long battery life for our movie night sessions or removable batteries. What do yall think?  ,vaporents,dcobgmo,1,t5_2upjd

10782033,0,t3_5u8816,I cant tell you exact bowl size by weight. I put a nug in about the size of the capslock button on a keyboard. I bought mine from Ebay and the guy said a medium grind and a medium pack works best so thats what I go with. From there I set it to  and my wife and I pass it back and forth. Two people can get  hits each easy. The cycle is just long enough for it to stop being fun and when its over youre ready for a break. Then I stir it up a bit add a bit of keef then add just a pinch of fresh flower so that it doesnt taste burnt. I change the temp to  and the two of us go through the cycle again. By the end its really hot and tastes awful but the first few hits taste great and its nice to use essentially the same nugget twice. Then I dump that into a jar until after a few months we have an ounce or so then we make tincture for coffee or tea. The batteries are temperamental and I cant tell you exactly how long they last because it always seems to vary. Theyll last a few days but its just short enough for you to wish they lasted longer.

10851110,0,t3_5v1yc7,A lot of people shit on Pax for a variety of reasons. Its a great device. Maybe not the endall best ever but perfect for discrete vaping. I read all the time how it burns through so much herb and blahblahblah. It doesnt. Ive cooked an oven several times in a day and produced clouds each time. I recommend it. The concentrate lid works like a mofo. Easy to clean. Does not waste herb. All of these points can be debated and there is probably a vape that excels in each category but none appear as sleek simple and reliable as Pax. ,vaporents,ddz7r99,4,t5_2upjd

11203713,0,t1_df0q990,The reason is because thc is an expectorant. Coughing is expected. When you vaporize youre able to dial in the temperature so you have less carbon smoke and more vapor cannabinoids. I find that the first hit of the day clears out my lungs if I have bad allergies that day. This can be translated to your friends clearing out their lungs from combusting. As for one vaporizer being smoother than another it had to do with how fine the droplets are in the vapor itself. The finer the droplets the less likely your lungs will have a reaction of objects entering your airways triggering coughing. Hope this provides a bit of insight. ,vaporents,df1xd1k,3,t5_2upjd

11220413,0,t1_df3rz31,Out of curiosity how many stems have you gone through? Ive noticed that theres quite a bit of quality inconsistency with arizer stems. Some of the stems ive bought from arizer have been so loose they dont hold in when inserted other stems you literally have to heat the device to be able to pull out. And this quality inconsistency in the stem thickness directly affects the draw resistance. If youre ever bored enough and have the money to spare buy a batch of arizer gongs from dhgate where the prices are cheap and the quality control is bad. If youre lucky and you get a loose fitting one your arizer airs draw resistance will be significantly more free flowing. ,vaporents,df3titv,5,t5_2upjd

When it wasnt on time lots of people were still saying vaporware lul and when it was released they were actually happy that early units had a high malfunctioning rate. Take a look at Loto Labs Evoke. Introduced with little fanfare yet funded over  like the GH and taking just as long as the GH did. No hate posts here but no update posts either despite plenty of reasons like the founder taking a trip to Europe and spending lots of time looking for additional funding. The FC thread has  pages over . years.GH did some astroturfing. Less than a handful of comments but that was enough to create some dislike. I posted an IGG update and was called a shill lol.After some time they made customers pay for shipping to warranty their units which pissed off quite a few customers.Though they are current with orders they are still way behind on promised IGG perks Waterpipe adapter though on the horizon cases and oils front end which isnt possible anymore due to design change.,vaporents,df5u9gk,5,t5_2upjd

11491510,0,t1_dfxgd9f,I think this is it. The portable is the gateway vape start there then move up market. The portable market is a lot bigger than the desktop. It starts at a lower price point and its easier to put away hide take with you socially etc. Portables are for more established stoners if youve got to get it out and put it away constantly a portable is a lot less of a PITA.Another way to look at it is that almost everyone who vapes could use a portable but not all of those same people can really utilize a desktop.Demand dictates supply here IMO. You see less desktops being developed as the target market is much smaller. Personally my Plenty is my fave by far and the one Id keep if I could only have one. Then again Im not out and about as much as most people so I have a desktop vape kind of lifestyle.,vaporents,dfyk82f,3,t5_2upjd

11543028,0,t1_dg4bh4f,That makes sense I think thats how most people think of it  I know I used to  though its really a term from chemistry with a specific meaning and is better approximated by anything that produces smoke flame optional. So if Im cooking fried chicken too hot and the oil starts to smoke thats combustion even if it doesnt ignite. Typically add enough heat and oxygen to a combustion reaction that is only smoking so far it will ignite into flame. Like fanning a smoldering smoking campfire will cause flames to burst out  the smoking was already combustion more air just amps up the exothermic reaction.,vaporents,dg4ejtb,2,t5_2upjd

That being said the base size amount half grain of rice seems to work pretty consistently. With crumble assuming it looks more like thisThen you may be able to use a bit more as it isnt as dense as some other forms of concentrate. As long as it is full melt it will work well in the vapexnails. If you keep your dosing consistent you should be able to get the same level of efficiency and effects for the same cost. As always it helps to buy in larger quantities for better cost efficiency. ,vaporents,dg7sjv2,3,t5_2upjd
