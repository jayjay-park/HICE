8922657,0,t1_d7kd324,Zachtronics fills this niche of type of game so effectively. The only game Ive seen from a different studio is human resource machine. For everything else Zachtronics blows everyone else away.,shenzhenIO,d7kdf6q,5,t5_3ga4q
8928954,0,t1_d7kc31l,It started as just Zach but some projects need more than just one person. I think Zachtronics transitioned to a they at some point during SpaceChems development for music in particular.Part of TISs origin is Zach wanting to see what he can still do by himself IIRC though I believe that changes to a  or  person team by the time it released.Mind you this entire post is from vague recollection and may be a bit off.,shenzhenIO,d7l4n3v,5,t5_3ga4q

9157990,0,t1_d8cstj6,.fi I had ordered something from the US before.  It looked like it was properly annotated and they still charged me customs and VAT   its a pain too because it takes a few days for them to get the customs notice to you for you to be able to clear it.,shenzhenIO,d8cuc6b,1,t5_3ga4q

9200000,0,t3_56ce94,Most likely cause of your error is forgetting that when you set a basic output and then sleep it will still be transmitting that same value unless your very next instruction after sleep is to change the output.So if the first thing you do is check some logic and then set the output well youve already sent the value from last time step. Safest thing is to set the pins to  which doesnt trigger the games logic that a value has been set.,shenzhenIO,d8i61vw,2,t5_3ga4q
9207684,0,t3_56gjmh,Assuming you want square pixels x    lcd pixelsThose are each x real pixels with one pixel spacing between them. Also you could always use the  left over pixels to make a custom display in the space at the top or bottom.Edit I also assumed you wanted to fit the aspect ratio of the x pixel image that you have to use to make the custom LCD. ,shenzhenIO,d8j553d,1,t5_3ga4q

9233530,0,t1_d8iinxy,There used to be a time when the box art manuals etc. were as important as album art. The binder isnt about the functionality although having the documents printed will certainly makes some aspects easier it is about the presentation. A luxury car with wood trim will drive you from point A to point B as much as the economic vehicle but people still purchase the high end showroom models because of the way they make them feel. This is the same thing. You arent getting less of a game if you dont have the binder but it is one of those things that might make someone enjoy it all the more.,shenzhenIO,d8mf1gt,1,t5_3ga4q
9237838,0,t3_56wj95,Values output from simple IO pins will not count as inputs. If youre feeling sneaky you could probably take advantage of this somehow. Hopefully this clears up some of the confusion on why the DX acts like it does.,shenzhenIO,d8myphu,5,t5_3ga4q

9265704,0,t1_d8qegz3,It just feels intuitive that replacing a chain of conditional instructions executed every time a bill is inserted with a few arithmetic operations run once at the end lowers power usage. But I dont really know so Ill believe your judgement here. Good work sir then.EDIT I tried to modify your project but failed with the usual justonemorelineplease problem. Anyway when it runs up to the moment the second client arrives it uses less power  vs . So maybe dstdgt are worth considering even in the low power solutions. Though it probably depends on the number of clients and bills deposited.,shenzhenIO,d8qhsgm,1,t5_3ga4q

9274341,0,t1_d8rkchg,So the idea is that when buzzing you can stop checking the bus every time because with the nonblocking input  will wait for you anyway and youre already in the off phase. Why such small optimisations always look obvious only after you see them?,shenzhenIO,d8rl7hs,3,t5_3ga4q

9335416,0,t3_5892m1,My solution isnt terribly cheap or efficient but IMHO its simple enough to be readable. I made two cuts across the map so that I have a strip containing the  point box and two strips without. The upper left processor looks up the score for the middle band lower left does lookup for the rest of the board. The right processor passes off the relevant value and discards the other. ,shenzhenIO,d8zbyw5,1,t5_3ga4q

Empty blocks here do not imply that any statements put there will only show up at that place. That would indeed require a jmp statement.Consider this case        Conditional pattern    teq root    teq    teq    teq    Equivalent C code        ifroot        ifteq            ifteq             else                 ifteq                 else                                      else             ifteq             else                          else         ifteq         else             As you can see compare tests but it could be any statement or instruction show up in multiple different branches.I might remove the empty blocks to make it clearer. I agree it could look a bit misleading.,shenzhenIO,d942bkv,0,t5_3ga4q
9404556,0,t3_59dncb,ukrispykrem It is now rather cumbersome to see what your designs power score is after a successful run because you cant see what power the worst test used.The verification complete screen is also useless for this as it only shows your best score.You have to exit the editor and check the stats on the saved design to see what the score was.,shenzhenIO,d983e63,3,t5_3ga4q

9756694,0,t1_dafe543,It doesnt but especially at the beginning when you dont know the code well you may think to have a clever solution for a level instead of settling for a nonoptimized good enough solution but be unable to do it because you still dont have the parts to use certain commands.So basically at the beginning dont over complicate things and try simpler and good enough solutions... then later youll have access to all the parts to do some clever hacking ,shenzhenIO,dafqbjv,2,t5_3ga4q
