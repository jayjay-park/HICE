1547488,0,t3_2byhi2,I recommend Union Garage so often that Chris the owner should start paying me. But honestly everyone that goes there seems to come away wanting to tell others about it due to the lack of honest and well put together moto shops in the city. The shop is small so what they lack in options they make up for in quality of selection and knowledge of every product. You can always get stuff online but I try and buy my gear there when I can just because its such a nice place to stop in and talk bikes. In fact I often find myself making up excuses to ride over even when I dont need any gear. If you go on the weekend you are sure to see some killer bikes parked out front as well.It depends where you are staying in the city but I think its worth a short subway trip over to Red Hook. You can even double the bang for your buck and get a goodforNYC burrito from Calexico right down the block.,RideitNYC,cja91wh,6,t5_2tp6g

Once you reach the leader of the group assert your dominance then kill him and assume his identity.Congratulations you are now the leader of your own riding group...or meetup.com,RideitNYC,cqta90i,7,t5_2tp6g

3950001,0,t3_35pekg,Here are a couple of places that I used for practice when I started. The trick is getting there safely  I highly recommend going as early as possible on a weekend morning. Much less stressful. You can take surface streets for the most part. First is a parking lot at the very end of Columbia street.  Second is a smaller lot down the end of a long sloping driveway at th st.  hopefully still accessible  near industry city. Great for braking practice etc. That area is very quiet on weekends. Lots of side streets and deadends. And lots of old railroad tracks embedded at odd angles in the road surface so be careful. Its good practice. Good luck!,RideitNYC,cr6j8hj,3,t5_2tp6g

4910344,0,t3_3i566e,First thing you have to do is get your permit. Simple test. Next register for the MSF course. I used big Apple. Theyre awesome. They will teach you everything you need to know to get started on a bike. Even if youve never even seen one before. Seriously. Get those two steps completed then start looking at bikes and figure out what will work best for you. Then shop for insurance when you know what class bike you want. After that it all comes together and you buy your bike!,RideitNYC,cudhhwt,2,t5_2tp6g
6872486,0,t1_d0v7prn,I ride primarily in Nassau County and have the same opinions as you. I wouldnt say we have any crazy weather like OP mentioned but of course the occasional rainfall may spoil your plans if you dont like riding in the wet. Id definitely say its worth it as its more fun faster and IMO safer. Sadly there is a lack of twisties but Im sure if you looked enough you could find some I know theres some good roads on the north coast. ,RideitNYC,d0vb3yc,3,t5_2tp6g
7662033,0,t3_4jwh6f,Slight tangent about the bike covers... Having exposed headers on my bike the material melts almost instantly if I put the cover on right after I get off the bike. Anyone else have problems with this? It was suggested I thermal wrap the headers for  at my dealer Anyone have know of a cover that wouldnt melt catch on fire from them? I dont see myself waiting outside  minutes before putting on my current cover and going to work home etc.,RideitNYC,d3d4oc6,1,t5_2tp6g

11305349,0,t3_61bti2,Similar themed threads pop up every spring.Related to bikespecific crackdowns Id suggest a lot of the fault resides within our own wheeled community. Look fellow riders its easy to avoid the hassle with the NYPD. Here are some tips and the first  are not optional. Renew your registration. Get your bike inspected. Make sure you have insurance. Dont be stupid about where you park i.e. on the sidewalk in marked no parking zones by hydrants etc.. The rules apply to you regardless of if youre on  or  wheels. Also parking on the sidewalk and thinking youre protected if you throw a cover on is a fantasy.This isnt hard. ,RideitNYC,dfdg09t,6,t5_2tp6g
