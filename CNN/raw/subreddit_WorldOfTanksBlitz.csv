6872411,0,t1_d0v7nz0,The stats as is right now assuming I am reading it right.  Its that it has Ss  pen and  gold pen the DPM did get a big boost but its only slightly higher than the s DPM.  I cant quite judge the mobility of the tank from the HP etc.  But it does seem to be pretty mobile.  The terrain resistance numbers are very low.So I am guess it will get preferential but I am still wary on how competitive it will be.

7192771,0,t3_4dzj6e,I feel pretty much the same with regards to the new economy. I dont have any hard figures from my pre . games but currently on losses I either lose about k or even make a tiny profit whilst wins are around the k range. Its frustrating because credit grinding is much harder and wins feel like they dont mean as much. Theres no incentive to go all out for the win because they dont bring in as much credits and losses dont sting as much. The player has less control over their progress so it becomes a matter of time playedpayed instead of skill. Ive taken to no camo using only one consumable per game and small rations only for my tier s and s. The profit loss has stopped but it does feel like Im fighting with one arm tied against my back. Im sure WG werent trying to alienate their audience for short term profits and were instead offering more customability to players set ups but they need to make some adjustments.,WorldOfTanksBlitz,d1vrbdc,2,t5_31zi1

8392084,0,t3_4uekvz,That thing is from the PC version hence not entirely applicable to Blitz.  First off i dont know if anyone else has played the Conqueror but in Blitz its turret armour is unreliable at best its hull armour gets melted from basically anything even Tier s before the change.  The Conqueror is only a carrying platform for the mm which you have to go through a mind numbing stock grind to get. I loved every tank in the British Heavies because they had usable armour and pretty decent brawling guns which complemented their slow speed and armour. Even the Caernarvon gets the brilliant Centurion turret the Conqueror scraps all that gives you a really good gun and a tank that doesnt compliment it at all hence youll never really get to feel the full power of this otherwise brilliant gun. Did I mention to bad gun depression? Its got terrible gun depression when compared to its closest competitor the M. Whatever turret armour you have is unusable thanks to its terrible gun depression forcing you over hills and exposing your atrocious lower plate. Basically go get yourself an M if you want the best Tier IX gun tank. Unless the give the Blitz Conqueror the same buffs they did the PC Conqueror it will remain one of the worst Tier IXs in the game.The Chuchills in Blitz are actually quite good at their tiers the Chuchill  is a little iffy but the Chuchill VII and Black Prince can be quite sufficant in the hands of a skilled heavy tank player coupled with no artillery and smaller map size makes the Shitty Part of the grind quite enjoyable.,WorldOfTanksBlitz,d5qk3bm,2,t5_31zi1

9922940,0,t3_5hjw7k,I would like you to point to your stats again Please note all the red and black colors. Those are indicators that you dont do particularly well in those tanks in fact youre playing them badly. The first step towards the enlightenment will be that you admit to yourself that youre a bad player right now. Unfortunately your comments suggest that you think youre actually doing the correct things. Let me tell you you dont. Your playstyle is being in the front line with a heavily armored tank that doesnt require any skills  at least according to you. Well your actual play style is getting in the front connect  if youre lucky   shots barely do any damage and die first in your team and probably complain about the team afterwards in chat. Every tank class requires skills vastly different typically even a front line heavy with tons of armor. Youre undoubtedly reach tier   and Im really sorry for all my EU server friends if you happen to be on their team. You are and you will be nothing else just a big damage and XP piata. Youre at tier  in less than  battles. You visibly have absolutely no idea what youre doing. Go watch some YouTube videos how to play the actual tanks. It can be PC console or Blitz the ground rules are the same. Go back to tier  pick up the DW again and learn it. Its a fantastic little tank you can learn some angling. Go pick up the VKH and the VKH. Their Waffe gun is singing its so strong. Go play the KV if you really wanna learn how to angle a tank. Go back to the Panzer IV very good medium contender at tier . You played all these tanks veryvery badly. You heard that theyre supposed to be good and they failed you at least you think so. Let me tell you something youre gonna hate the Maus. If you load into battle with it and youre gonna see a TA or and Object  lets not even mention a Jagdpanzer E an Object  or a the US EE twins youre not gonna survive the first minute as long as you keep doing what youre doing now. The Maus lives or dies by the correct angling and in your hands its gonna die.Please please please try to actually learn from some videos and drop back a couple tiers try to fight up your way to at least  winrate in those tanks try doing at least as much damage as your own hitpoints to be at least somewhat useful.

And it has a very tiny amount of frontal armour that can bounce the occasional shot. Its top cannon does  alpha and has decent penetration so you can put a shot into just about everyone you find. Its a good tank if you use it correctly. It has excellent speed acceleration and traverse. You just need to use that to your advantage and adapt your play style to something similar to the comet.

10777962,0,t3_5u0sn6,Optimal stock grind path for Jpanther Track gt Engine gt  cm Pak L gt  cm Pak LThe track provides more effective horsepower than the engine. Not to mention a better track gives you better aim time after retargeting and makes you less susceptible to COD.  cm Pak L is the same gun as  cm Pak L albeit with higher penetration. If you dont have a premium account you probably need the gun early such as before the engine. With a premium account the APCR across the two guns is exactly the same. You can just use APCR to compensate to the lower pen.The  cm Pak L gun is useful. It does suck to lose DPM. However with the TD style of gameplay the massive  extra alpha allows you to make a greater contribution in battles. I dont think the poor gun depression and the mediocre mobility would allow a Jpanther to land two shots per opportunity frequently even with .s reload which is the value with  cm Pak L double ration vent instead of camo net. Hence I think the extra DPM is wasted. That is obviously up for debate and varies with personal playstyle. In any case if you are still relatively new to WoT Blitz a higher alpha gun likely works better for you.Jpanther gameplay is a very typical turretless TD gameplay. Take some time to explore it yourself and also check out some videos from others. Try to find every way to land more shots in each game.Optimal stock grind path for TWhat do you mean by ninety mm? If you mean the mm M gun FYI the abbreviation of dimensional units are only preceded by Arabic numerals. Ninety mm confuses the hell out of people.For T stock grind it is very much worth playing M to get the the mm M gun. As you commented the mm is absolute trash on T. I would grind M as a way to grind T. Otherwise the optimal path is mm M gun gt Turret gt Track gt Allison engine gt Continental engineThe mm gun is inferior to the mm in every way  low DPM bad gun handling bad accuracy. The mm was mainly needed for  mm for added pen which is now a relic of the past. So there is no rush to get the mm. Of course for an experience it is worth getting the mm eventually and trying it. Getting the mm on T also greatly helps T stock grind. So be sure to research the mm gun first before T. But thats about all the utility of the mm.Between the turret and the engines first we note that each engine upgrade only give a measly hp increase. You need the Continental engine as well as  fuel to receive a mobile T. But to get to the Continental engine you need a whopping sum of  XP. That is just too long of a grind. Hence I would get the turret first to increase view range.Speaking of view range it is actually sensible to run Optics instead of Vents on T. For view range again it is also sensible to run double ration instead of double fuel. You also get improvements on accuracy and DPM from extra ration. View range can be important for winning the game. But it depends on your playstyle. Some players integrate spotting as a part of their gameplay. Others dont or not yet. If you have been finding yourself benefited from view range then get turret first. Otherwise get track for a significant mobility boost and aim time reduction.As for being team dependent that is true for any slow tanks. You need to communicate with your team as to where to go. Obviously the gun depression combined with an impenetrable turret is your main asset. You prefer areas of the map that offers significant undulations. Explore the locations in each map where you can hull down and perform vertical peeknbooms. As a rule of thumb the only map where you would prefer to go to town is Himmelsdorf.You also absolutely need the mm gun to make an impact. k dmg in Tier  is low. So definitely work to improve it.Churchill VIIOf course Churchill VII is not trash. But it is probably not far above trash. Be sure to look up how much angle you need against each potential target. Use armorinspector for example.Churchill VII has the abysmal  degree gun depression. You are stuck with town and town only. If team does not go town you are sniping. Remember that Mines town is not a real town. It is not a viable option. Just snipe. Other than that sidescrape well. Identify opportunities to dump DPM.If you are still relatively new to Blitz platooning up and avoiding solo play when you play Churchil VII is a very sound idea.KVSKVS is played as a medium. You go up to drop your alpha bomb using your mobility and retrieve to cover immediately. Returning shots have a hard time penning you due to your troll armor as long as you are actually retreating. There is little secret to successful use of KVS. In between reload you are not supposed to expose yourself. Reset your camo. Come out in a way that your opponents do not expect and thus cannot defend. There is no need to put emphasis on sidescraping. When you sidescrape you are spotted. Therefore sidescraping is rare for KVS.How should you find opportunity to drop your alpha bombs then? You need a sound strategy in coordination with your team. Use the minimap to ensure you are among your team and within your teams range of cover fire. KVS has poor DPM and cannot shoot its way out alone. Also make sure you have been covering the basics. Bushka offers some good tips on that noteBoth KVS and Churchill VII are best played during the mainstream pm EST hours. You will be frustrated during say am EST because teams tend not to deploy logically during those hours. Great hours to farm damage if your tank has DPM though.HellcatHellcat gameplay is not particularly special. Try explore the rest of the Tech Trees for Tier  and maybe come back to it later. You may be surprised by how much better you have become at Hellcat after a hiatus.,WorldOfTanksBlitz,ddro386,2,t5_31zi1

11124110,0,t3_5ytl74,The British heavy line is not the best!!! Ive had a lot of fun with the fullyresearched Conqueror but thats the first tank in the line that Ive legitimately enjoyed since tier . The grinds to unlock modules on the British heavies are brutal and the performance boosts are marginal. Its a lot of fun when you finally get the Conqueror my goodness the gun is a laser beam!!! but even then your armor is pennable in almost every place from almost every angle.Russian line IS is probably the best. IS line is also solid noobs have a hard time learning to flank the Russian heavies. If you want mobility and accuracy try the TE line. Like I said British line is brutal and IMO not worth it. Both German lines suck they give up accuracy at the tiers when it becomes most essential have worse mobility than the Russian tanks and flat nonspaced armor.Id avoid autoloaders if youre looking for a true heavy. Neither of the autoloader lines give you the hightier armor to drive the tank like a heavy and those  second reloads really suck when youre playing on an incompetent team.,WorldOfTanksBlitz,deswpxf,2,t5_31zi1

11190078,0,t1_df08u1v,The Black Prince is certainly more durable than the KV but if you are looking for a tier  Heavy that is just as if not more durable then you should continue down for the KV. The caernarvorn is a good heavy but its armor is meh and its stock grind is absolutely atrocious. In addition the guns dpm doesnt improve much at all. Even when maxed out the Caernarvorn is painful to play and it only gets a little better once you hit the Conqueror.Its kinda an interesting switch between those two heavy lines. The less durable KV transitions to one of the heaviest best armored Heavy tanks at Tier  KV. Meanwhile the more durable Black Prince transitions to a more mobile but much less armored heavy tank.,WorldOfTanksBlitz,df0drnu,3,t5_31zi1

11541660,0,t1_dfy6w9z,Actually I think you have to unlock the equipment levels of each tank separately otherwise some people would never get those level  equipment on their tanks. This means youll need a whole load of spare parts for each tank. Therefore buying dozens of lower tier tanks and stuffing them full of equipment is probably a good thing and lots of people are already doing it. They have said specifically that the only time they will add spare parts directly to your account is when the old equipment is converted into the new spare parts currency. ,WorldOfTanksBlitz,dg48ywl,1,t5_31zi1

11780644,0,t1_dgvd2ha,As an SU you should definetely support the heavies. Your mobility and slow reload with the top gun will allow you to get easily overwhelmed by mediums and lights.However this is an iffy situations and depends again on team composition. How many heavies are on your team? How many mediums and lights? If you only have  Heavy and he decides to go the heavy route while everyone else flanks its better to go with the mediums and lights instead. This is because it is pointless to die simply because you felt obligated to cover the only heavy on your team who isnt bright enough to realize that it is best to stick as a team.If your team has  heavies or more then it is more likely that you should support your heavies. In the end stay with the majority of your team. If only a couple people are going one way while everyone else is going the other way it is better to follow the larger portion of the team for strength in numbers. Id go into even more depth but it would mostly be a bunch of word vomit that would stretch for  massively long comments and I dont really know how I would properly explain it. As you learn more and more about the game you simply begin to get a feel for how the game works and which way the enemy team and your team will typically go. Experience will help you out the most in the long run.Again if you havent already look at the video that VikkoTheTusken linked to you. Its extremely useful,WorldOfTanksBlitz,dgvdgsx,1,t5_31zi1

11791353,0,t1_dgwee05,The equipment pieces have been nerfed. Therefore  old equipment pieces is about as effective as  of the current pieces and some combinations are no longer possible. Therefore it is a sidegrade more than an upgrade. The compensation we receive is also abysmal. For someone with over  tanks many veterans have that many assuming every single tank is fully equipped and their average tier is Tier VIII then after . they will have enough to fully equip  tanks of their original . Premium tanks are not exempt from this grind as well you will now have to grind out equipment for premiums as well so they are no longer somewhat competitive right out of the box. ,WorldOfTanksBlitz,dgwl8h0,1,t5_31zi1
