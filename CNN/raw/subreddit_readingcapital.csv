5029003,0,t3_3ind5g,This chapter is quite a bit shorter than chapter  and seems to go more in depth about how one commodity becomes the universal equivalent for all other commodities as a necessity of exchange.I like how Karl Marx rehashes concepts over and over again in different ways. He demonstrates the fetishism of commodities by showing how in order to exchange commodities for each other on a market we necessarily become representatives of commodities. Our purpose in capitalism is to act as owners or producers of commodities or property and as agents of exchange. This relationship reduces humanity to producers and consumers.These first two chapters have been heavily focused on relationships. Relations between workers relations between values relations between commodities. He does a great job of showing how things interact and conflict with each other.Some commodity becomes a universal equivalent to all other commodities out of a need to represent the value of different pools of commodities owned by different people. I like the word reflection. This universal commodity gold for example still has its own use value but by becoming money it reflects the value of all other commodities. Im not sure if fiat currency was around in Marxs time perhaps he discusses fiat money in chapter  but it seems to me that paper money is a natural continuation of this because it is a commodity whose use value is to be a medium of exchange value within a particular society or country.Which makes exchange rates and the forex markets seem really really odd to me. Its like betting money on money. Whats the purpose? Determining the strength of the exchange value of one currency relative to the strength of the exchange value of another currency? These exchange values are determined by what? Theyre representations or reflections of abstract socially necessary human labor. Does that mean that forex trading is determining the value of one countrys labor output relative to others? When a currency gets stronger does that mean that the labor of that country is valued more than the labor of other countries?,readingcapital,cus6q7b,1,t5_39oyn
