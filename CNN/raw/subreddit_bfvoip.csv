The raids and Nightfalls are the main point of Destiny IMO just getting together into a sixperson team and taking on what is essentially a set of puzzles. Sure once youve done them lots it becomes second nature but therell always be noobs around you can help through their first time of holy fuck this is insane awesome. Plus theres all the sweet gear ... which Im missing a lot of still  my fault though not enough raiding.,bfvoip,cpmsfg2,1,t5_2wow8
