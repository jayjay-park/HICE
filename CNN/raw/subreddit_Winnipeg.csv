The restaurant industry is an interesting example where you have an unskilled and to an extent largely inexperience work force and look at how badly workers are exploited in your experience. I sort of wonder because its not ALL restaurants that are like this. Do you think the fact that theres a lot of people out there who figure they can ownrun a restaurant despite not having any experience in the food service industry? Basically a lack of knowledge about how things are supposed to run from the top down puts them in a position where they are exploiting staff because they have no idea how its supposed to be done right? ,Winnipeg,cexueu7,1,t5_2qtno

We should support places like siolam mission where they feed the homeless give them a safe place to sleep for the night and offer some medical services but support them with the understand we are providing basic needs and not solutions dont expect a solution from that it is an unrealistic expectation to have and you will just be disappointed. If people really want to solve this its time to get real and have realistic solutions the adults are generally past the point of return we should keep providing those basic needs as listed before because we are caring humans never loseforget that but start switching the main focus to youth so they dont grow up like that in the first place. There is many reasons someone might be homeless but there is demographics in Winnipeg we can identify where the majority of those homeless come from.TLDR adult street people are set in there ways regardless how much we do focus on helping the youth so they dont grow up like that in the first place is the only realistic solution. ,Winnipeg,ch1h0pa,12,t5_2qtno

I think a lot of people here dont spend much time outside Manitoba Winnipeg is isolated from other large cities dont have much perspective and thus buy into the myth that Winnipeg is worse than any other city in this country. Crime is the exception but I will qualify that by saying crime in Winnipeg is about the same as any other large Western Canadian city. Central and Eastern Canada have much less crime than the West especially the Prairies but Winnipeg is not much different than Edmonton Calgary Regina Saskatoon or Vancouver. I should also say I feel perfectly safe walking around downtown and the North End during the day. The supposedly notorious North End is no different than some of the poorer neighbourhoods Ive seen in Edmonton and Calgary.

The discussion him and I are having isI believe the decrease in crime is largely due to the amount of police we have he doesnt. To me a lot of the stuff he is talking about is great long term solutions but we need a short term solution as well which i believe is more police. He says the amount of police has nothing to do with it and I have asked him to show me. And yes it does support.If variable one is policeAnd variable two is crime If you take out variable one or change it in anyway and then variable two changes then they are connected.If you totally took out variable one variable two would explode up not down. I follow many laws not because I want to but because if I dont I have to deal with the police. The presence and threat of police does indeed prevent crime. ,Winnipeg,ckue8tp,2,t5_2qtno

2316188,0,t1_clxkm17, General building costs of moving up vs out on a building per building basis are substantially more.  We just completed an HVAC change out for a  unit building.  The total is close to . Million.  Thats close to  a suite.  A simple residential furnace wAC is K.   Had the building been any taller its  stories the cost would have been much higher as they would have had to use a helicopter to lift instead of just a big ass crane.  They also lucked out that there was enough room for the crane to setup in a more dense environment they couldnt have.  Not only that the high rise buildings are mainly built of concrete which while it lasts a while its based on renewable resources.  Single family homes of wood construction are more sustainable in that regard.  The damage done to the roads is mainly due to heavier vehicles.  The impact and damage from a car is x that of a bike.  A bus is rougly x that of a car and a semi is roughly x that of a car.   Cars may cause a little more congestion but provided theres enough capacity the roads crumble because of other factors.   If you want to keep the cars off the road what you should be advocating for is housing around jobs.  If people lived close to where they worked and played the traffic wouldnt be centralized and wouldnt cross.  you would essentially be creating a bunch of mini cities and only those that needed to get to the other ones would be using the cross connects.  It would be much more beneficial.  Look at rural towns for example theyre roads last for years due to the low usage.  In cases where theyre gravel maintenance is cheap and easy.  Its when the higher densities require different materials such as concrete that the costs increase.  The debt loads and deficits of many municipalities put Winnipegs and the provinces to shame.   The more densely populated the area the tougher it is to provide and maintain services.  Working on infrastructure in the downtown is much more expensive than it is in the burbs where there is room.  Walking downtown you smell the sewers coming out of the man holes that doesnt happen in the less densely populated areas.   Other services like cell phones become harder to provide with density.  Ever been to a jets game?  The wifi and cell phone service was atrocious.  A lot of it is mainly due to physics and wireless spectrum and the way it behalves.  It doesnt scale . Issues like disease control gets much more difficult.  With some many people in the same space sharing the same air it makes outbreaks far more likely and much harder to contain than low density areas.   Most of the problems stated have actually come as the result of higher densities energy usage based on surface area excluded theres no argument there I do those calculations day in day out. But if you want sustainable living think back to the pioneer days with the single family farms.  Ultra low density families spaced way out were able to grow their own food and deal with their own waste.  Higher densities mean trucking food in and setting up waste treatment plants.  These werent and arent issues in very low density.  For example You need a minimum  acre lot to have a septic field.  It deals with most of the waste produced by a family without causing any real issues besides healthy grass on the hill.  Theres no doubt that some things do get easier and cheaper with higher density.  But the generality is that with higher density comes higher costs. ,Winnipeg,clxzv7y,1,t5_2qtno

For funsies Winnipeg is km. The reason is because of exactly what you say. You can achieve density without putting up giant towers everywhere as long as you have consistent  storey buildings on every lot. I love density. I love apartment towers I wouldnt want to live in one but I like seeing em on the skyline. But a consistent patchwork of  storey buildings urban mixed use commercial on ground level this is how you build financially sustainable development.

2838454,0,t1_cnqpyxs,gtOf course transit gets congested during a snow fall. What city doesnt? Considering during peak hours the main routes are running ten minutes apart its pretty good. Winnipeg transit has installed a bunch of bus shacks. Many of them heated. I take the bus everyday into work downtown to avoid high parking costs. Yea its cold but thats part of living in Winnipeg. Cant change the climate. You dress warm and carry on.. I didnt say during a snowfall I said during WINTER that is the second time Ive had to repeat that and it was extremely clear the first time I stated it.. During anything above a light snowfall buses run considerably slower than scheduled and are busier than normal resulting in much longer wait times.  minutes may be the difference on the schedule but that isnt the reality. . Heated bus shacks are worthless when they can only shelter a pointlessly small percentage of the people waiting. Look at the lines outside the Cargill building at PM or PM.. No you cant change the climate but the point I was replying to was regarding jacking up parking rates to force people on to buses. If your argument is that parking should be very expensive and if its extremely cold and buses are running slow who the fuck cares dress warm then your argument is just flat out stupid gtWhat you have to realise is our downtown is small. The walkway system connects very little because our downtown is very little. You can get from the Richardson building on portage and main to portage and memorial without setting foot outside. Which is a pretty significant chunk of downtown WinnipegExcept the problem with the walkway system is it only connects a small number of buildings. The vast majority of downtown isnt connected whatsoever. Most people have to walk outside to get to a connected building. It is useful in the winter if you need to be somewhere but it isnt going to spur people to get out when its cold outside because they will likely still have to spend a large portion of their walk outside.gtYes the issues need to be addressed and they slowly are. Theyre trying a stronger police presence but that can only do so little.I dont understand your point here. Downtown isnt actually dangerous it has the perception of being dangerous. gtLike I said time and money. The issues at hand cost money and take time. No way around that.Which is why the original plan was ridiculously naive and I pointed out throwing government money at downtown isnt a solution. ,Winnipeg,cnqq8pz,2,t5_2qtno

Ill give you both are better here than in London England but we are not comparing Winnipeg to London in those two things and if we were the type of climbing would have to come into play since I am sure London has much better indoor climbing than Winnipeg does.

ScotiaLuxton is a great area with lots of walkable amenities on Main St as well as Kildonan Park on the northern border. Frasers Grove is probably one of the best kept secrets in this city IMO.  Houses are decently priced and access to the river and bus service on Henderson is great. St James north of Portage near Assiniboine Park is a great area.  Sure you are under the flight path for the airport but the area is beautiful and being within walking distance of City Park is a great perk.

Decide what you are comfortable spending and work within that. It becomes much easier to say no to aspects or make choices if you have a budget to adhere to. Just remember that your venue food and photographer will probably consume most of your budget. For the most part venues will either set a minimum amount that needs to be spent to receive the venue for a reduced cost or you pay more for the venue but you can get the food cheaper. We are holding our wedding for  at the Rustic Wedding Barn a bit of a drive but the venue was absolutely gorgeous and they didnt have any requirements for catering so we could use whomever we wanted.

First the class of the roadway for Murray Park is fine but I dont think Sturgeon or Silver should be classed as arterials they should be local collectors considering they have community clubs skate parks and soccer pitches all along it. Further every one of those streets has a design speed greater than the posted speed limit a practice that I am vehemently against.Secondly the residence are concerned because not a single mention of pedestrian safety is mentioned in the report. It is understandable for them to be concerned when they look for information and get a  page prelim design note the detailed design is not public because the bid op was for both detailed design and build report that says the word walkpedestrian a total of  times.

Anecdotally Im seeing for rent signs going up and then staying up. For months at a time sometimes compared to not being able to find listings.At what point does it become a renters market? What affect will all the new condos have?

No one would know the difference especially with the volume of trips. Even if they just added . Multiply that by thousands of trips over the year. The extra money they take if it were possible to audit them is absurd. A system like Uber eliminates that because the amount is not seen by the driver and is logged in the back end. Drivers cant bump charges up. Edit Think about how many votes the cab industry is worth. Beyond the  employees you have very large families. Often four or five voters in one house.

Russ Wyatt Transcona said the Jets will receive an estimated . million in refunds of the entertainment and business taxes this year adding he questions whether the team really needs that money any longer. Were struggling to sweep our streets we cant maintain our infrastructure but were funding a professional NHL hockey team Coun. Russ Wyatt notes.WAYNE GLOWACKI  WINNIPEG FREE PRESS FILESWere struggling to sweep our streets we cant maintain our infrastructure but were funding a professional NHL hockey team Coun. Russ Wyatt notes. Photo StoreThings have changed from  years ago when the Moose relocated to Winnipeg and I think its worth looking at Wyatt said.Wyatt said the combined refunds provided to the three teams is the equivalent of a two per cent property tax increase.I just dont think that in todays day and age we should be refunding the entertainment tax back to them.Wyatt said the financial arrangement with True North Sports amp Entertainment was done when it wasnt certain if an NHL team could be lured back to Winnipeg and whether the team would be popular.Things have changed in a big way and for the better Wyatt said. Were struggling to sweep our streets we cant maintain our infrastructure but were funding a professional NHL hockey team.Finance chairman Coun. Marty Morantz said he would have finance and legal officials review the agreements the city has with True North the Winnipeg Goldeyes and the Winnipeg Football Club but he cautioned that the arrangements were likely longterm in nature and its unlikely they can be terminated or amended any time soon.aldo.santinfreepress.mb.ca,Winnipeg,cvjr0mt,1,t5_2qtno

But I guess facts are also racistBecause anecdotal guesses are factual numbers.Yeah their are actual stats which will show higher unemployment rates higher crime rates and the like among the generalized Aboriginal population but how the fuck is segregation going to fix any of these issues? This is why yall need to learn about sociology and actual try to understand the reasons why this is the case... yall simplify this shit to the point where it is racist because in any case youre conjecturing Aboriginal people are naturally more like insert whatever characteristic traits you deem to be negative.Instead you should devote your mental energy to researching why this happens to be the case. Also facts arent racist but stats and the like need to be analyzed properly... guess what? The White population in the USA is going down you know what else is decreasing? The crime rates. Oh wait and this is also happening here in Winnipeg... the Aboriginal population is increasing and the crime rates are decreasing. We can correlate an abundance of factors which really dont mean shit. The actual reasons behind stats is what you need to figure out... but if you jump right to because their race youve obviously spent little to no time actually researching this topic and therefore either just play devils advocate and ask question speculate or just dont bother diving in the discussion... but what youve done is treated your poorly researched thesis as the factual correlation. Im sure youd agree that the reasons for the general crime rate decreasing in Winnipeg is not because of the increasing Aboriginal population in percentage and Im sure youd agree the reason for crime rate decreasing in the USA is not because the White population is decreasing in percentage. ,Winnipeg,cwzy79f,-1,t5_2qtno

Traffic was doing fine just cruising along at about KPH. Even at that speed it felt a bit fast the conditions were horrible. So some jerkoff in his wheeler decided to make his own path in the left lane. I wasnt thrilled to be going so slow but I could still see the traffic in front of me. Buddy blows by in his semi and I cant see shit. All I could see was white to the point that theres no way anybody else could see anything either. Ive driven in some stupid bad conditions but I have never had no choice but to just keep going because some asshole blinded me. At that point theres literally nothing you can do. You cant stop because theres cars behind you that cant see and theres cars in front of you that you cant see. Eventually the blowing snow cleared just in time for me to see the snow bank I was about  feet away from. I hate slow pokes as much as the next guy but when everyone and their dog are doing  in an  zone theres obviously a reason why.

Its a flippantly ignorant response to a reasonable question. The answer is nearly everywhere to a point thats sustainable. If that means that people have become accustomed to a level of service that isnt sustainable then that service level has to be gradually reduced to a point where it is. Thats where you start cutting. And my god if it werent so surprising to everybody that resources arent infinite you may have to actually be realistic about what we as a province can afford. And funnier yet is that our entitlement isnt just with the debt we a a province are accruing its the entitlement where transfer payments are concerned too. In one breath the NDP brags about our growth as a province  something theyve had nothing to do with  and then in the next castigates the federal government for assuming too much growth in the province and clawing back our entitlement. Imagine.Anyway adults can understand the idea of a scarcity of willingness. Socialists not so much. The nice thing is that theyre about to find out most people want it.,Winnipeg,cyc56kf,4,t5_2qtno

6191307,0,t1_cytcvlq,Hey no problem at all! I know what its like to endlessly apply for jobs thinking that you are perfectly qualified and never hearing back. Its super frustrating.To try and answer your question while I cannot say for sure because Ive never really participated in a formal hiring process I seriously doubt that applying for multiple positions is negatively affecting your chances of being hired. Each application is separate and I believe that when you are being interviewed it will usually include the directorsupervisor that you will be reporting to one person from HR and sometimes another supervisor or director. Of course this may vary from department to department. They arent going to know how many positions youve applied for or interviewed with and they arent going to compare whatever cover letter you used for that position to other cover letters. I think that the most important things to do when applying for jobs at the University is to make each cover letter unique tailor it as best as you can to show how you meet the stated job requirements dont just replace the position titled and use the same cover letter for every job and also try to tailor your resume a little. Also keep your search broad. If a position looks mildly appealing to you apply for it. Youve said that you have your Masters in Science which is great! But dont just look for jobs in the Faculty of Science. Look for admin jobs in all the other departments as well such as enrollment services grad studies especially there if you have a Masters degree etc. Honestly the individual Faculties dont hire much but the supporting departments do. Obviously avoid the bookstore or food services because those wont be what you are looking for. Also another quick tip is to look for maternity leave or temporary positions. Those tend to have less applicants especially internal ones. I know there may be at least one posted in the Faculty of Graduate studies right now. Mat leave or temp positions can give you at least a foot in the door and if you do well can lead to other positions. For context I have a Masters degree as well and got an Admin Assistant job when I moved back to Manitoba mostly because I had experience working for the department I was applying in. Its not as easy to get in without an internal connection but its certainly doable. Just be sure to really nail down your cover letter and be sure to submit one with each job obviously but I dont think I need to tell you that and address it to the person that is listed below in the job posting. If you are unsure if you should address the individual in the cover letter as Mr. Ms. or Dr. you can usually find that information on a small application the UofM has released for download which can be found here ,Winnipeg,cytdx4v,3,t5_2qtno

6208741,0,t3_40mt9i,First rental complex to be built within Exchange District National Historic SiteWORK will soon get underway on what is believed to be the first rentalapartment complex ever built within the citys Exchange District National Historic Site.Retired Winnipeg photographerturneddeveloper Albert Cheung plans to construct a new sixstorey  or unit apartment complex on a surface parking lot he owns at the end of Market Avenue in the East Exchange District.Work on the .million project which will be called  Market is expected to begin in March and should be completed by September of next year Cheung said in an interview Thursday.CentureVenture Development Corp.s development manager Loretta Martin said although a number of multifamily complexes have been built in recent years on Waterfront Drive theyre condominiums not rental apartments. And the two HO apartment complexes at the north end of Waterfront are outside the boundaries of the historical site which covers a block area containing about  heritage buildings.Cheungs project is one of the first approved under the new cityandprovincefunded Live Downtown Rental Development Program. The aim of the program which was launched in December  is to stimulate the construction of  to  rental apartments in the downtown by offering property owners a rebate on any increase in the city and provincial property taxes that result from the redevelopment of their properties.Martin said although six projects were approved during the programs first intake period which closed last February three of them arent ready to proceed. So theyll become part of the second intake period which begins today and ends in September.CentreVenture president and CEO Angela Mathieson said the programs first proposal call resulted in an uptake of nearly  rental units. Its hoped the second one will produce at least  more.The Live Downtown program which is overseen by CentreVenture replaces the former cityprovincial Downtown Residential Development Grant Program which provided  million in grants and tax incentives to downtown apartment and condominium developers.Although that program targeted both rental apartments and condos the new program is geared exclusively to rental apartments because there is still a demand for more of those types of units in the downtown Mathieson said.Although the primary objective of the program is to increase the number of rental apartments in the downtown a secondary objective is to facilitate the redevelopment of some of the areas nearly  surface parking lots.Over the next several months our team will be reaching out meeting with surface parking lot owners to let them know about the benefits of the program Mathieson said. We would like to see more surface parking lots turned into vibrant new places for people to live downtown.Cheung has owned his surface parking lot and an adjoining onestorey building since . He spent about  million upgrading the existing building and turning it into office space. But he couldnt have built the apartment block without the help of the Live Downtown program.I wanted to redevelop it the parking lot for a very long time but the economics werent there he explained.But thanks to the  years of tax rebates he will receive under the new program he can now afford to proceed he said.Under the Live Downtown program property owners are eligible to receive property tax credits for a minimum of  years.But that number can go as high as  years if they build within targeted areas within the downtown build on surface parking lots and include covered parking spaces in their development.The downtown areas being targeted are the East Exchange District and the area south of Portage Avenue that isnt within the sports entertainment and hospitality district SHED which is covered by a separate taxincrement financing program.To qualify for the rebates the projects must also include at least five rental units and devote  per cent of their buildings space to residential units.For the first five years at least  per cent of the apartments also must be set aside as affordable housing units in which rents are set at median market rental rates as defined by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.For  the median monthly market rents range from  for a studio or bachelor suite to  for an apartment with four or more bedrooms.Mathieson said downtown Winnipeg is undergoing an incredible renaissance due in large part to its growing residential population which now stands at more than  people.Live Downtown and previous housing incentive programs supported by our government partners have been absolutely critical to the downtown housing industry and the goals of our corporation she said.murray.mcneillfreepress.mb.ca,Winnipeg,cyvd7y9,9,t5_2qtno

In my opinion just my opinion so dont get your panties in a bunch theyve done a pretty good job at keeping the economy humming along in pretty uncertain times. In terms of spending increases and debttoGDP numbers they are in line with our former conservative government in Ottawa. The Pallister conservative plans that Ive heard dont seem to add up.

Applicants were asked to consider the ways cities and towns plan for their future at a time when the economy the environment and the patterns of urban and rural life are experiencing dramatic change.The judges noted a couple of reasons why Winnipeg made the cut.One was how the city pursues economic growth by systematically connecting industry and education. The other was how the citys indigenous and cultural assets are leveraged.Greg Dandewich senior vicepresident of Economic Development Winnipeg Inc. said This years topseven finish is evidence that we continue to be a global leader when it comes to integrating public and private enterprises with education and training initiatives in ways that consistently resonate with intended audiences both here and around the world.In alphabetical order the  Top  Intelligent Communities areHsinchu County TaiwanMontreal QuebecMuelheim an der Ruhr GermanyNew Taipei City TaiwanSurrey British ColumbiaWhanganui New ZealandWinnipeg ManitobaThe  Intelligent Community of the Year will be announced on June  in Columbus Ohio which was the  winner.,Winnipeg,czwms2f,5,t5_2qtno

I lean more towards a dealer since they were saying a  year old picked him up the night he went missing. I was a pretty normal  year old that grew up in that area and went to RE and I didnt hang out and party with any  year olds. It seems really fishy.

Just promote the hell out of yourselves in a tasteful way and put as much quality stuff out as you can.  Im not in the business but its pretty simple from the venues perspective.  If they think you can bring in more money then the cost of having you there then they will have you.  If you got a bit of a following and are able to promote yourself to some extent and bring in new customers to a place while at the same time not taking away from the place youll have a easy sale.Overtime you play any event promote your social media sites.  Something simple would probably be enough in the beginning.  We are going to do a draw Free CD and TShirt to the winner.

This is a caring family doing everything they can to bring a lot of attention and taking multiple courses of action IMMEDIATELY therefore increasing the chances of the missing person being found tenfold.  Once a week or two goes by the chances of finding a missing person diminishes greatly and you wouldve seen the media attention start to dwindle as well.  I know his uncle Brent Sayles and he is they type of person that is a real gogetter and not the type to sit idley by without doing EVERYTHING in his power to get answers and that is exactly what the family did which is why there was so much attention.  Advertising works people picked up on it and the attention grew and built on itself once people heard the story.

6787381,0,t1_d0lm1av,If you look at that document you would see that roughly  of it is composed of either FireParamedic or Police employees. Then you would have roughly a page of city council and accessory staff. A number of pages of Winnipeg Transit. Then you have everything else which would be composed of two groups the workers and their managers. Im sure if you were to go into it you would find the vast majority of the management positions would be on this list. Most of these positions arent even managers. They could be positions like engineers or HR people. Then there would be the workers. While I would admit that there are workers who make greater than k most of them have been working for the city for years or work some god awful shift. Also I would also guess that the proportion of front line workers making above k is significantly less than any other group in the city.Even look at the budget. Roughly half of Winnipegs budget goes to Police fire and paramedic services with all other city services fighting for the other half of the pie.And as far as wiping out the city pension good luck.

6851762,0,t3_49jufq,Right now I live in neither I live in a fairly closetourban but notdowntown neighbourhood.Heres what I see as the advantages to both.  Ill let everyone else opine about the cons to each.DOWNTOWN All bus routes tend to be more convenient.  It seems to me that  of buses pass through downtown so your chances of getting a direct bus places without transferring are higher. Entertainment  Its so nice to be able to walk from concerts the orchestra etc. The Forks  Right now its mostly shitty and touristy but it looks like thats going to improve quite a bit in the near term. Boutique shopping and restaurants.  It seems like many of the most interesting new spots are now opening downtown in the Exchange or on Broadway though many are open notsogreat hours.  Theres also a few little antique stores furniture stores etc. downtown I like. First Fridays  going to the Exchange for FF always makes me see the potential of the area though I know its not like this that regularly. Proximity to other neighbourhoods.  Downtown puts you sort of midway between West Broadway the Exchange Osborne Village etc. so it feels like other things are within shooting distance. Walk to work.  This is the big one.  If you work downtown its AWESOME not to have to commute.  Walk stop at Fools and Horses for a hipster coffee cruise into work  minutes after you woke up. BURBS Detached homes!  And not character homes full of bad wiring and absestos and crumbling foundations.  If you have lots of kids want to be in neighbourhoods with lots of other parents want your own private yard space to food and make an ice rink or whatever worlds your oyster. Commute!  Okay so gas is expensive and cars are expensive to maintain and the time you spend driving is worsespent that time at anything else.  But still honestly?   minutes sitting in the car alone with your thoughts and the radio for company?  Actually pretty nice. Asian groceries!  Okay so this is mostly for the southwest suburbs but for all that downtowners brag about ethnic foods the vast majority of ethnic grocers are in the southwest suburbs. Fewer pettycrime concerns.  You wont worry about having your window smashed for your Hoobastank CDs and . in small change when you live in a suburb.  I mean Ive never had my shit stolen while living in an urban area but I acknowledge that the chances are higher in my neighbourhood than in Island Lakes. Dog parks!  In fact dogs in general.  Large private yardslots of big and underused parks and schoolyards and places to take your dog plus in some areas private dog parks. Isolation.

6959256,1,t3_4b0wzl,A Progressive Conservative candidate accused of using her office at the Old St. Vital BIZ to conduct her campaign may not be welcomed back to the business group if she is unsuccessful in the April  election.Brent Konantz the business improvement zones board president said former executive director Colleen Mayer should probably have been asked to take her leave sooner.St. Vital PC candidate Colleen Mayer answers questions from the press on allegations about using Green Team employees to plant flowers at her home residence outside a seniors complex in St. Vital.Back when we were informed that she wanted to run we should have put her on leave and let her go about her business Konantz said following a BIZ board meeting on Thursday.He said the board is in the process of changing its policies regarding leaves. What we would like moving forward is that the executive director be the executive director.Mayer won the PC nomination for the St. Vital constituency last May but did not leave the BIZ until sometime in January. Her contract came to an end in December but she stayed on for a few weeks to handle some duties until an interim executive director was hired.Mayer is accused by a former BIZ intern of holding campaign meetings and carrying out other political activities inside the nonpartisan business groups office. Elizabeth Dickson blew the whistle on Mayers alleged mixing of work and campaigning after she was terminated last month. She has since negotiated a settlement with the business group but not before filing a complaint with the provinces commissioner of elections and going public with her story.Mayer has said Dicksons accusations are the allegations of a disgruntled former employee. She said the BIZ was aware of her candidacy and was supportive. She could not immediately be reached for further comment late Thursday.In a Free Press report on Saturday it was also alleged that taxpayerfunded BIZ staff planted flowers on Mayers property last year causing the province to tighten its rules governing community beautification projects.Mayers current status with the BIZ seems to be in dispute. She has described herself as being on leave from the organization. Some board members appear to agree with that interpretation. Others dont.I think everybody believes it will be problematic bringing her back Konantz said.He said BIZ members have not complained to him about Mayers alleged use of her former office for campaign work. But they have raised concerns about how Dickson was treated he said.Konantz largely dismisses the use of government resources to plant flowers in Mayers yard as a misguided decision by a former employee. He said the decision to plant the flowers was made by the former BIZ employee.Meanwhile the BIZ board is to hold a special meeting on personnel matters before its next regular board meeting on April  Konantz said. Weve taken the totality of all of the allegations seriously he said.Yet he also hinted that the Old St. Vital BIZ would just like to see the whole issue go away.I think everybody is really hoping she Mayer wins the St. Vital seat Konantz said with a laugh.It lets us off the hook.,Winnipeg,d15601g,2,t5_2qtno

7070979,0,t3_4cdieq,Going by the error given by your PS and your troubleshooting it sounds to me like the DHCP server in your WIRE is failing or crashing for some reason after  weeks. Am I correct in that the internet stays working on the laptop but just the PS and DS are offline?Quick test Find out what youre currently getting for an IP address probably ...x. The next time it happens try going into the settings on your PS and set the IP address manually to the same thing. Does your internet work at this point? if yes its just the DHCP server. You can leave it manually set and itll keep working although if you have a lot of devices frequently connecting and disconnecting to your router you can potentially run into IP address conflicts. Im not overly familiar with the WIRE devices but I have a feeling that there might be a setting somewhere on the WIRE home page for DHCP Leases. If so you may find a setting for increasing the lease time i.e. how long until the PSDS can keep the same IP address before it has to request a new one from the DHCP server.If no its something else upstream like a node saturation problem or signal loss between you and the note etc. and youll probably have to call MTS.,Winnipeg,d1hux5t,1,t5_2qtno

7285066,0,t3_4f1we6,Some quick notes Ive been keeping on my phone during the election. Some might be good talking points.This election is utterly so boring and unimpressive. There is no innovation. All the leaders were talking about Dead cats on tables.  It is hard to take Manitoba seriously.There was much more important issues in Manitoba that affected many more people.Very little policy innovation for middle class. Housing price regulation. Land transfer tax is a pure money grab.  Why would anybody want to move here? I think liberals had something in the platform but was only for first time home buyers.No talk on net neutrality.Environmental policy was down played. No talk about fixing drinking water problems.It is sickening to think people do not have access to basic clean water. It doesnt even have to be centralized. How much does reverse osmosis cost?Better education with real life skills for people in poverty. Negotiation skills on wage.  Financial management. Debt management techniques.  Insurance scams. Ban on payday loans.More government automation.Fire government workers that coast.  You know who you are.Option to be in control of your own personal health care data. Ranked voting.Remove the notion of a central leadership. People that care about humanity can actually work together and create great things. Why do we still vote for a face people should be voting for policy. We have the technology to make this happen.Higher taxes on the  percent.,Winnipeg,d269hig,3,t5_2qtno

Tomorrow wet snow slush  Yea!!!Things have cooled down so crews can get in and deal with hot spots etc.  As stated in the Free Press today there are lots of crews being brought in.The danger?  The wind changes today from the  west and North West.  And is windier than one would like.  The cool wet weather will help. If it were hot and dry  look out!Paul and Bruce are now standing down  they are on call.   Our sprinklers are all primed gassed and ready.It is absolutely unbelievable that no cottages have been lost so far considering the intensity and size of this blaze.On a very sad historical note  we did lose our historic station house at Winnitoba.  There are a lot of memories and stories of Friday nights waiting for families and Sunday nights waiting to go go home. It was a social centre for us for many many years.I think thats probably how most of us learned any patience in our lives  waiting for  trains at the station. Apparently a helicopter pilot saw it start to burn as he flew over and on his way back could only see one post standing.Things are far from over but they are better. This fire aint out yet !!The bridge at K will need replacing and there is work to do on parts for the road from heavy equipment.There have been all kinds of emails volunteering to assist on  getting the road in shape.  In truth we will likely contract a lot of it so we can claim either from Ins.  or elsewhere.However that said there are many areas where we are going to need volunteers and one of the most important is going to be to assist folks on Nora with getting their properties back in shape and cleaning up.We will be organizing that i due course.Thank you all for your kind remarks for Paul and Bruce and their fire crew.

And that isnt an argument for privatization its just the facts.The same could be said about Hydro. Hydro is a dog right now. Its horrendously managed and its a bloated mess of a company. It too shouldnt be privatized but the partisanship that has caused its situation needs to be done away with. The board has been altogether too meddlesome and the company has been used to buy aboriginal votes in northern NDP ridings.

Theres not really anywhere in my post where I lay blame on anyone. As I said in my post the effects of depopulation forced assimilation etc are noted in Indigenous populations worldwide not just in Canada. To ignore the deleterious effects these issues have had and continue to have on Canadas Aboriginal populations is disingenuous. To act like the problem is a lack of assimilation given the Canadian governments long history with assimilation policies is astoundingly ignorant. And while I do not have any solutions I do know that part of the solution is not spreading around myths and misinformation about Aboriginal peoples and acting like you know more about the issue than you do. gtYou sure seem like youre angry at me and Im not sure how its my fault that this little shit is the way he is...Im not angry with you I just think youre being disingenuous.

8803705,1,t1_d7625bc,Most of the costs associated with new development are related to transportation infrastructure. Your suggestion only ensures that a neighboring municipality receives all the benefits of the taxation while the City shoulders all of their infrastructure costs.Which is exactly why developing policy is difficult.

It can only have a negative effect. So higher taxes on new homes will lead to a lower growth rate than expected but money will already have been invested in to infrastructure that wont be used because there will be fewer people than expected. Leaving the city worse off than it is now. Also I suspect an influx of new citizens will positively affect the whole city bringing in more money that is spent locally providing revenue for the government and local businesses.

8841204,0,t1_d7ahoe8,Sure but all of thats within the context of a citys collective priorities. I dont disagree with the thesis of your argument  that major projects will almost always face opposition  at all. Its the amount of opposition that matters. The idea that a small subset of people have the solutions that will improve the city whereas all the other rubes are merely at work to maintain and perhaps add marginal and incremental improvements to the status quo is where I take issue. Because we dont actually know that. Were expected to take the word of people looking for very specific improvements to improve a very specific way of life and that our city is in fact better because of it. And Im saying From whose perspective? Does a family living in Whyte Ridge benefit in any capacity from a Rapid Transit line if they dont use transit? Do the citizens of Crescentwood benefit from increased densities in their singlefamily neighbourhood if they dont want it? Does a family living in East Kildonan benefit from cycling infrastructure down Henderson if they would never use it?Those are all pretty niche ideas in this city. As such theyre long down the priority list for most people and force a lot of opposition. Thats why they dont get prioritized. On the other hand the citys road repair budget has been increasing year after year on a relative basis. That isnt coincidental. Thats what they elected their politicians to ensure. They most certainly arent interested in their politicians telling them that they should be biking to work in the winter because of some dubious correlation between their taxes and how difficult they make life for themselves.,Winnipeg,d7al5hk,0,t5_2qtno

They use a mathematical formula to determine where you stand in admissions ranking using your GPA and LSAT score and they only take as many students as they think will have jobs in Manitoba they dont churn out s of grads every year. It is around . This means there are no interviews no reference checks no nothing. After  credit hours they let you drop  from your calculated GPA for admissions too which is nice.

But the fact that you are so comfortable with making such a broad statement and then calling me a princess and using demeaning terms like getting my panties in a knot is ridiculous.I initially responded to your statement with legitimate concern and you turn to name calling and assumptions about myself and my family.

When you hire someone to perform research generate entirely new knowledge and pass that knowledge onto others what they do suddenly becomes a lot less tangible and quantifiable. Yes the can gets kicked around a lot to decide someones worth but it is better than a Dean simply deciding that someone is not valuable because they havent obtained an arbitrary number of citations or because they intensively teach a small number of students instead of lecturing a huge number of highfeepaying undergraduates.I would imagine that the Senate needs to approve highlevel central admin positions.

I assume its because the street was cleared by one private company and the bus stop by another. So we have a not my job problem thats inconveniencing alot of people and slowing down our transit.

Then you would need the regular moped stuff. lights. front and rear brakes of sufficient power. Motorcycle helmet. registrationinsurance. class  licenseSo technically yes but practically no. I think based on the same thinking that those internal combustion motors you can add on to a bicycle are not legal either but the electric version might be because of the ebike category.

10290466,1,t3_5nb9dt,I am concerned that this kind of ticket stretches the definition of what the Highway Traffic Act was intended to cover.The exact wording of the section is as followsSecuring of loads on motor vehicles and trailers       No person shall operate or permit to be operated upon a highway any motor vehicle or trailer unless the load that the motor vehicle or trailer is carrying is firmly bound sufficiently covered or otherwise secured or loaded in such a manner that no portion of the load may become dislodged or fall from the motor vehicle or trailer.Where load not required to be covered       Notwithstanding subsection  where the loose material of a load consists of snow earth or mud the load is not required to be covered by a tarpaulin.The key issues is what is meant by the word Load?  The HTA does not give a definition.Googles quick dictionary definition would be a heavy or bulky thing that is being carried or is about to be carried...synonymscargo freight a consignment a delivery a shipment goods merchandiseThe synonyms are interesting because there is a Regulation to the HTA called the Cargo securement regulation.My argument would be that the section isnt meant to cover the fallout of weather on top of your vehicle but rather things you intend to carry  the example of snowearthmud indicates that it is something you are intending to carry to another place not stuff that falls on your vehicle during a weather event.It would be fun to defend in Court in any event.

A grocery store cannot operate if its water pipes are leaking unintentionally onto their neighbouring business.  Its the same thing really.

10902456,0,t3_5vqv3j,One of my businesss uses two in line water heaters and we absolutely regret getting them. The piping in the location is no bigger than a home when you consider the space of the infrastructure and the water takes far too long to heat as it needs to purge the lines of cold water and then come up to temperature. I accept that my homes gas water tank may take up to  seconds to reach all areas of my home with hot water. However I find with the tankless the water flow eventually cannot keep up to demand and the hot water though piping hot when it arrives cuts out when you arent going full blast. So blended water tends not to draw through the heater as good as full hot. We will never use them again and the costs associated with retrofitting to a different water system are far to high and impossible with space. I vote no.,Winnipeg,de4ieex,3,t5_2qtno

These are things that to a degree are well within your power to control even if its hard as all hell.  Even with a medical condition that usually only accounts for lbs of excess weight gain.  If you are the size of Whitney Thore who blames PCOS but medically it doesnt account for her being lbs you really need to take responsibility for getting to that size. I could however get behind reduced rate access to government run fitness facilities and access to group run fitness programs.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  For example give medically identified overweight people access to the same rates city employees get about year for basic facility access.  Also get them access to a mental health expert for their eating disorder and dietitian to help them identify and fix their unhealthy eating choices because nobody is getting that large without eating a lot of calorie dense foods. As an overweight person myself  lbs I can understand what is needed to do to lose weight and it starts with personal responsibility not legislation.

Tenure has freedom of speech implications but calling out the sessional system is a basic justice issue she didnt talk about.  And it is true that free higher education is a subsidy for the middle and upper classes who presumably already benefit from objective gpa based scholarships.  Not that those people arent good but they also usually have come from solid homes with economic resources.Its pandering to one of the NDPs core groups the our interest is actually the commongood professional elite.

Unless you are VERY careful youve likely done something against one regulation or another And the government will come knocking if someone complained.It happened to my parents once! It was fucked. The government employee even admitted what my parents were doing wasnt a big deal but because the neighbor called them the government employee was obligated to fine my parents if they didnt repaint their house in the dead of winter.I mean you need SOME rules though right? Thats fine. But when they start micromanaging you it becomes excessive. Smoking inside? I get it. But Im gonna do it on my balcony and if someone complains about the smell Well its weird how Im not allowed to complain about the smell of BBQ or perfume  cologne or the gross smell that gets left in the elevator after someone who is very drunk uses it. NOPE. EDIT Oh! Back to the paint thing. My dad put up a HUGE tarp over the front of the house so he could work and not be freezing to death. NOPE. Neighbors didnt like that so the government made him take it down.,Winnipeg,dgdxcsw,-1,t5_2qtno

11721971,0,t3_66yfh6,Depends on what your budget looks like. Expect a shop to charge you more than the bike is worth to get it in a running condition again.Typically you would see people doing this kind of work themselves because it requires little in the way of specialized tools and little to no expertise. For example you say the tank is grimey which means you need to clean that sucker out. The carb is also probably gunked up which means youll need to disassemble and clean it as well. You can do nearly everything you need to with a decent wrench and screwdriver set. It would certainly be much cheaper to buy all the tools you need than to take it in to a shop for this work.,Winnipeg,dgoprqa,3,t5_2qtno

11752879,0,t1_dgs6sen,Its my first time in university. And by bad grades i meant just not good enough for computer science or engineering.i know im mathematically inclined and thats partially the problem   i find casual interest in it and its more enjoyable to study on my own rather than sit through a lecture. the parts that seemed too easy and required memorization i skipped over and i wind up glossing over foundational details. I feel like I have a clear picture of what I did learn vs what i failed to learn so I can avoid repeating the mistake as long as I take more time off from my job and less personal time too. ,Winnipeg,dgs7vbv,1,t5_2qtno

In that ONE gallery there is a large amount of information regarding Canadas mistreatment of First Nations. Theres also MANY other past mistakes in that Gallery NOT dealing with First Nations including a section on the Winnipeg General strike the mistreatment of migrant workers today the Chinese immigrants Japanese interment camps and many more. All of the other galleries deal with a miriad of Human Rights education including what is happening around the world today.
