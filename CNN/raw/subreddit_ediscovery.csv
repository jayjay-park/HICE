4001914,0,t1_crc9ruz,Hello to you both! My company uses Nuix to precull and process. The investigator license is cheaper but it doesnt allow for legal export. Thats the only difference we found in our testing and adoption. As far as your questions goes...You could go into the filter pane under all items theres a system checkbox. You could cull everything from there. The other way is to flag the immaterial times and exclude those. Both of those along with the DeNIST youre doing should get you going in the right direction. As far as file extension goes you  should be able to advanced search on the file extension field. Nuix is really easy to use once you get the hang of it.As far as the metadata goes youre likely going to have to derive some fields to get the same results. Also if you arent already using support.nuix.com Id see if someone has already done some of that legwork for the LAW fields. Id suggest checking that out. The searching on the site isnt the best but it might point you in the right direction. I hope this all helped. ,ediscovery,crcg72x,1,t5_2qvxe

7413970,0,t3_4122jg,I am going to throw GoldFynch out there www.goldfynch.com. Newer cloud based software from a company thats been around for a few years. Just launched their product. It was built from scratch for smaller shops and solos. Built in Iowa actually in response to a lot of mom and pop shops asking why they couldnt just Google their own documents. Disclaimer I am closely associated with the makers of GoldFynch. ,ediscovery,d2kx4ol,1,t5_2qvxe
