5380404,0,t3_3oh75d,The Face StealersIn the days when the Mogol Empire was still thriving four young adventurers set out to search for the fabled Great Bozk Worm in the Bozk Desert whose teeth are said to be made of solid gold. Bazaars in the towns of the Mogol regions sold what they claimed to be teeth from the worms of the Bozk but a young Mogol named Yvan wanted to be certain. He wanted a photograph so he and the world could look upon the sand worms and at last know of their existence with certainty.After a week a rescue team was sent in search of the young men expecting to find the worst or nothing at all. If they had stumbled upon a sand worm chances are they were swallowed whole and there would be no bodies to find. What they found however was entirely unexpected. After two days of searching they spotted Yvan the expedition leader who was seated with his back to them his three companions seated crosslegged and facing him. A small pool of water was fifty paces away. As the rescuers came closer they realized that the three companions facing them had no skin on their heads or faces. Their eyeballs were missing maggots falling from the sockets. They looked to have ghastly grins on their face and bits of hair still clinged to their skulls. As the rescuers walked slowly toward Yvan his back still to them they saw the skinned scalp and face of each of his companions laid neatly in front of him. He seemed to be studying them arranging them neatly beside each other.When they finally came within earshot of him he muttered something inaudible. Jon the Mogol in charge of the rescue party walked closer. What have you done boy?They made me. Yvan turned around. His eyes were gone. Dried black blood clung to his cheeks like warpaint. Infection was spreading in one of the empty eye sockets black jagged lines like tendrils marking the infected veins.Who? Did you kill these people? What the hell happened to you?They needed us.A stirring in the shallow pond nearby. A creature rose from the water dripping as it glided over to them tattered robes clinging to its skeletal blackfleshed body. Yvans eyes protruded unnaturally from the creatures face as if they had been carelessly glued or were held there by tape. Perfect! the creature laughed maniacally as it stooped down to collect the scalps and faces at Yvans feet. My sisters will appreciate their flesh. It is not often we have the pleasure of dressing up with such exotic parts! These others with the weapons will do for my cousins I suppose.The rescuers had their guns drawn pointed at the strange creature. But they were frozen paralyzed with fear. Three more figures glided over from the pond and the first creature handed them each one of the faces which they draped over their heads giggling like children. Jon turned around and ran and didnt look back. He jumped into his buggy and drove back to his Mogol town hearing the screams of his fellow rescuers as the creatures set to scalping them one by one.So was born the legend of the Face Stealers of Bozk Desert. It is said that when they wear a human face that persons soul is captured and trapped within the creature. Villagers in the area say that at night they can still hear the laughter and voices of those who have been lost in the desert. The voices of young adventurers searching for Sand Worms forever searching.,createthisworld,cvzeo3a,3,t5_398z9

6555161,0,t3_45ed1e,First of all have you consulted the new players guide? If not consult the new players guide Its not complete and honestly after two maps were still trying to figure out the way to do things.. Thats actually a very good question and Im not sure if anyone knows. Previous maps have had scales listed on them. For now Id say you should assume the continent is roughly the size of Asia. Your claim is probably a lot larger than it looks on the map.. The strips of land at the top and bottom of the map represent Arctic and Antarctic regions. So your country would be pretty cold but it is your country so dont be afraid to take a few liberties with the climate if you want to.. Again this isnt something weve decided for certain but if weve achieved the Middle Ages now then you can safely go back a few thousand years.. Thats about right. My main reference point was the Kaiju in Pacific Rim. But we can still allow for a variance in size between Titans.. Correct. Magic exists. People know magic exists. Use of it lies in the hands of an elite class but its something mortals can achieve.. In the past gods have had no direct interaction with the world. You might have magic users empowered by their gods but you should avoid having the skies crack open.,createthisworld,czxcv11,5,t5_398z9
6574916,0,t1_czze4bk,In this world of magic it would be perfectly doable. The combatants enter the arena and challenger could use a Shadow Art called Block Senses to remove the sensory input on a couple of his opponents thus depending on his skills with magic he would be able to reduce the number if able bodied opponents from five to two or three. Then he could use another Shadow Art called Extinguish Light to make the room pitch black then follow it up with Clear Mind which heightens the users senses. With that he would be able to see and hear his enemies and easily be able to get the drop on them and eliminate them all while the other ones are without any of their senses and eliminating them would be a breeze. This would all of course rely on the challenger being particularly proficient in The Shadow Arts to the point were he would be able to perform them faster than his enemies and in quick succession to easily gain the upper hand and be able to eliminate his opponents before they recovered. Playing to ones strengths is the key to victory in the Trials. Another example would be if a challenger was faster than his opponents and of a smaller and lighter frame it would be easy for them to employ a fighting style that would allow them to quickly evade their opponents attack and deliver an attack to a spot such as the throat that would allow them to eliminate their opponents easily. While no one is given a direct advantage the goal is to play to your own strengths and give yourself an advantage. That is why some Initiates spend more time learning various fighting styles while others condition their bodies to take a beating and others put their focus on being a master of The Shadow Arts. The Initiates spend about  years training for a fight that they know is difficult and that is five years to find out what they can work best with and how to leverage that against their opponents. ,createthisworld,czzefn2,2,t5_398z9

8463016,0,t1_d5z8miz,Interaction is super important and thats why I want a small scale world. Setting is one thing but if we have a small scale and dont go all imperialistic then we can have any setting and still tons of interaction. The problem with a large world in any setting other than modern is that it just takes too damn long to travel between different parts of the world. If we have a smaller scale world and are actually situated next to each other rather than spread out with almost a countrywide gap between us then we will naturally interact more with each other. And Ive definitely become more interested in societal interactions Ive been talking with udontfearme about the spread of Chayanism and potential societal shifting between Ewda and the Ebohesan states. Things like that are what I enjoy most. So if our nations are smaller and more tightly nit we can think about these sorts of interactions! though if we do end up more tightly nit in anything other than early time periods thered need to be some sort of agreement about imperialism so that the world isnt as mottled with war.Edit all that said Im actually veeeery much leaning more towards NeolithicBronze now the more that I think about things.

The disease is fatal to people from the other side of the world but people native there will be immune to it.Steam technology will not be functional on the humid side because the disease will infect the fuel water and raise its boiling point throwing off steam engines and making them unusable.

9931212,0,t3_5gfgx2,Starting a new top level comment for the time jump. I had planned on doing this whole bit in one megapost but I decided to split it up.Oksana and Vesk had departed from the village with the blessing of the chief and a load of supplies. They set out on an expedition northward to the coastline whence they had first turned in. Along the way they passed the remains of their ship stripped of what they had been able to haul back to the village. It made a strangely alien carcass halfsunk in the delta. Like something from another world.In the few months on Dashao Oksana had felt herself changing even more than in the year prior. Some things stayed the same of course. She still held tight to her scholars pendant and often reassured herself by using her tentacles to stroke the tattoo on her back. Her identity was still her own. But she was certainly adding to it.She looked more like an Amphin trekker now with her belt of pouches that she had received from the chief. The obsidian dagger stayed always at her side and she was getting better in her use of its finely exact edge. She also kept the whalebone sword on her back. Wielding it proved to be envigorating. It was a finesse weapon she still relied on Vesk and his machete to hack through the jungle but she found its blade made short work of some of the smaller nasty critters they encountered.As time went on however her movements slowed. Her midsection swelled. There were approximately  eggs growing inside her and it was taking its toll. Her movements on land became clumsier and she required more energy. She hoped to return to the water.When they finally made the coast she was overjoyed. She leapt into the ocean and floated off. The stresses on her body disappeared. The water felt more of a home to her than it ever had before. They spent a week there in that small bay swimming and singing with each other free from the demands of either ones people. They slept in each others arms floating through the deep.Then one morning Oksana awoke to feel a stirring inside her. She nudged Vesk.Its time. I need to travel into the deep.,createthisworld,db228po,2,t5_398z9

11165906,0,t1_dew2oxh,excuse any spelling mistakes or grammar errors Im still feeling kind of sick and I dont know if I can do more tonight but I just wanted to get this response outEarlier in the day a message got out to the next Valkaran fort up the Hieresmos River. At first the radio operator who received the message wasnt sure what to make of it why would Baratais attack Valkar? As far as he knew they had no grudge against each other the scientists debacle is still more or less unknown to the average Valkaran. However when the Nirene base wasnt responding to any of their messages the people at this fort got worried. By afternoon they sent a messenger dragon out a young recruit that isnt big enoughold enough for combat so does other things like scouting and message delivery and the cadet came rushing back with news about the battle. Word was sent via radio upriver and the main headquarters for the eastern half of the island up at Bhryteum was notified. By late afternoon two storms of dragons  total and most of the soldiers at the forts upriver came down to the fort that had first gotten the message. Messages were also sent out to the forts at Nicopicea and Calios to send most of the naval forces stationed there to go to Nirene at nightfall. At the southern Hieresmos fort a few of the generals met and with a map of Nirene in hand planned their counterattack.At dusk a small group of scouts and demolitions agents were sent into the city. They confirmed that the Baratians had made the fort into their base and went on to find where the damaged airships were being moored. An agent snuck in and began setting timed explosives in the three moored airships. She was extremely cautious and slow setting the first two but less so with the third. By the third bomb she only had a minute or so before the others went off she would have had more time if she hadnt misjudged the timing of the guards rotations and other crew movements. Besides the army would start its counter attack any minute now.Who cares if they see me theyll see my work any second now. She thought as she finished setting the last bomb. She crawled out from under one of the airships and was spotted by a Baratian a few meters away. They stared dumbstruck at each other for a seemingly infinite moment before a wicked grin curled across her face. The storms came. She got up and sprinted toward the window she had come in from while dragons roared their deadly breath outside. The other scouts as soon as the dragons showed up started jumping any soldiers at the northern entrance to the city. Soon a fire fight broke out in the north and then cannons and other artillery descended upon the occupiers from the coast. The fleets from Calios and Nicopicea descended upon Nirene from the south east and southwest. The battle had begun again.,createthisworld,dexn6k3,1,t5_398z9

11607586,0,t1_dgboieg,Ya Gilgarlis voice never made it to Serqeymurn scattered by the ocean breeze. The Hedeshi admiral remained transfixed at watching the carnage unfolding in the center at those brave or perhaps foolish Uric warriors swarming his mariners and suffering the death they brought from above. Some Uric men attempted to scale the great ships hulls but they were simply pushed off or swiftly cut down soon upon reaching the top.The skirmishers onboard laughed as they carelessly tossed their javelins and darts for no matter how wantonly they aimed them they would always find their targets. From the decks of the ships the deep blue water around them was not visible only a floating mass of ships men blood and bodies. For the Hedeshis this was not a battle as they had expected but sport fishing.Gilgarli having clearly noticed this as well threw the remainder of his forces at the Hedeshi fleet in desperation adding even more confusion to the center. This was the signal that Serqeymurn was looking for and upon seeing this he heaved up the booming orange banner sporting a black crab waving it rhythmically in the air. Just as ducklings follow their mother the rest of the fleet relayed this banner signalling that they had understood the command and were able to execute. Now the sleek assault frigates from the flanks heaved themselves forward and towards the mass of Uric boats in the center. The oarsmen rowed in unison even among the separate ships guided by the echoing chants of Kil! Sang! that accompanied the backward and forward motion of the oars. The polished bronze sharkshaped rams broke the water in front of the ships splitting it into violent frothy wakes that trailed behind them fast serving as a reference to an observer to the great speed as which they moved. As they loomed ever closer to the flanks of the enemy fleet the Uric could only watch in terror.Soon the frigates long afternoon shadows draped over the Uric boats giving them one last mortal reminder before the rams made their first contact. The sharp iron heads smashed into the thin wooden boats sending limbsized splinters as well as limbsized limbs flying all around crushing the canoes frames just like a ram crushes the frame of a canoe. The density of the Uric boats meant that those who were rammed were pushed deeper into the mass causing further destruction as boats were crushed flipped or submerged by those around them. Deadly splinters and fragments flew around like a flock of frightened seagulls with too many targets to miss any. Giant wooden shards flung into the Uricka impaling them before knocking them into the water. One such shard flew into a mans chest knocking him onto the boat behind him and directly on top of another Uric soldier the force of impact driving the shard to impale them both.It was clear now that the battle was over and it was a disgustingly onesided Hedeshi victory. Projectile death rained in the front while splintering death rained in the center all being compressed by the ramming vessels from the sides. Soon the desperate and dying screams of the Uricka would be silenced by the embrace of the ocean below. And so Serqeymurn ordered the fleet to disengage the fleet was done.The plain grey flag echoed through the Hedeshi fleet and so the slaughter finally ceased.,createthisworld,dgbqa6b,1,t5_398z9
