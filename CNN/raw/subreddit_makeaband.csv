3090154,0,t3_2vjfm7,That was a good song when I was listen though singing pops out.  I really have minor proficiency on piano keyboard trumpet but think I could possible help fill out your stuff.  I personally have written less than  full songs for piano and even those I feel are missing a bass or something else I always here additions to established works that I think could work. I think we might make an interesting duo  whomever.Edit If I write the song I can sing it pretty well but I dont have a superpowerful voice or high range really only have two octaves from lower d to two ds up.  Regardless I consider myself a vocalish.,makeaband,coiajwj,2,t5_36lcx
