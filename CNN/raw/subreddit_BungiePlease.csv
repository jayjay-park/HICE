5302847,0,t3_3nmzmv,Something I thought about too! Lets hope Bungie follows through with this!,BungiePlease,cvpi17k,2,t5_3a713
5306601,0,t1_cvpscdk,It can be difficult.  But thats why you must become legend...,BungiePlease,cvpza48,1,t5_3a713
5363404,0,t3_3oh071,I could see why certain people would want them in the game but I dont think they can implement them to make them fun. Destiny isnt the type of game that requires a shield as a weapon. Especially since you already have an element shield on you anyway.Like I said I can see why people would like them but I cant see how Bungie would make them fit into the Destiny universe.,BungiePlease,cvx8hl2,1,t5_3a713
5424407,0,t3_3pbkyf,Agreed.Id also like preset weapon and armour loadouts so people cant dominate with a certain handcannon that I dont have or armour with an amazing perk.Basically I want Halo  mode.,BungiePlease,cw50vsl,0,t5_3a713
6191417,0,t1_cyso3nv,Well youre wrong there. The reset time does change for the rest of the world that doesnt observe Day Light Saving Time. Yes I know its going to be a hour sooner or later depending the time of year. But other things can and will change too. Like when Bungie extended Xur stay in the tower because of some punk kids. Then the times theyre going to do maintenance. It doesnt really happen too often or on a set time table. It would be nice to know exactly how much time you had left until it started while doing some activity. I guess I must be talking about a very small group. A filthy causal player that lives outside of the US and Europe. One who doesnt wear a watch or has a wall clock hanging in his house or apartment. Someone that doesnt live on his smart phone thats if he even owns one. And if they do maybe they dont understand English so they dont get on Reddit Twitter or the Bungie forums. Maybe someone that likes playing the game every so often but not enough to go looking for info online. I think it would of been nice if it was added at the beginning.,BungiePlease,cytedc6,1,t5_3a713
