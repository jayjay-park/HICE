1373979,0,t3_29u3f7,Not a definite one no. In fact there are probably several schools of thought on this one and its surprisingly common to see foreign words in German having more than one possible gender  e.g. das Nutella or die Nutella.One school of thought says that if there is a German translation the borrowed word should normally inherit that words gender. Hence das Baby because it means the same as das Kleinkind.According to another school of thought if it reminds you of an existing German word or has an ending typical of a particular gender use that gender. Hence das Model despite it referring to a profession by analogy with das Modell.Sometimes this can lead to disagreements. Is it der Blog or das Blog? Either is acceptable. Blog is short for weblog and the German for log is Baumstamm which is masculine. On the other hand log is itself short for logbook in German Logbuch or Bordbuch making it neuter.,German,cioikll,3,t5_2qq51

1440400,0,t1_ciwe0ov,Yes in my opinion motion versus location is a better way of describing it.I always told myself that dative describes the stage upon which the action takes place.gt Ich laufe in der Kche  I am running in the kitchenThe kitchen is the environment in which my running occurs.gt Ich laufe in die Kche  I am running into the kitchenAt the beginning of this action I am not in the kitchen. At the end of this action I am.But things get fuzzier when the usage of the preposition is more abstract or idiomatic.With the phrases in die Kche and in der Kche each phrase can be taken at face value as a descriptor of the action. However with Ich bin stolz auf dich there is a necessary relationship between the verb stolz sein and the preposition auf.I.e. you cant really say that youre stolz in something or stolz an something and still be using the prepositions in an equally idiomatic way. The auf in Ich bin stolz auf dich is not really describing physical circumstances so it cant just be swapped out with another preposition.Thus the auf and its corresponding case must in this situation be memorized.,German,ciwtwzy,1,t5_2qq51

1947554,0,t3_2gxz0p,I just finished my German ALevel this year! Here are some of the resources I used Newspapers are quite good for reading around the topics and learning new words and constructions. Good news sites include Deutsche Welle Zeit and Der Tagesspiegel If you search in them the topics youre studying you can find relevant vocabulary that probably isnt in the textbooks. Dont aim to try and understand all of it or look up every word! Online dictionaries! Dict.cc was my fave but there are lots of others. Has a chrome extension which is useful when reading articles. To learn vocabulary I found spaced repetition software was really helpful. Its basically flashcards but computerised and scheduled for maximum efficiency. I used Anki to input my own words as I went along  a day and it improved my comprehension levels a lot. I didnt watch that much filmTV but ZDF has some OK programmes. A lot of English shows and films are dubbed in to German so it might be worth trying to find your favourite film in German to watch. I liked having on the German subtitles if possible because if they were English I knew Id just read rather than listen too. And finally Id recommend finding some German music you enjoy listening to!

The structured way you approach or your professor makes you approach this topic with is very clever and seems to be teaching you a good feeling for the language as well as an important set of rules to verify it with.You can decide for yourself whether you want to do the declared advanced questions. If you give the test a try check them out with the knowledge that B are in passive voice The subject is done to what the verb says and that B is in simple past.You can do as much or as little of the quiz as you like but I just thought you might profit of some work where you have to identify the fitting case yourself. I think you can do this because you have found out the right positions for the objects and subjects in your examplesentences which I think you constructed yourself.

Germans just seem to perceive the preterite as being irregular because theyre not as familiar with the preterite forms.As an English speaker itd generally be theoretically much easier for me to just use the preterite all the time because  its more similar to English usage  you dont have to worry about whether to use haben or sein to form the perfect and  its physically less effort syllablewise  why do the work of saying habe gefunden when you could convey the same meaning with fand?

4117779,0,t1_crpn3sz,You got the right idea about it yes it would also depend on what kinds of verbs you are using in the sentence and what tense the sentence is written.Mchten is a modal verb and modals take the second position and the other verbs move to the end. Essen gehen is a verb phrase so they stay in this order as they move to the end. With verb phrases like this one you could also write the sentence to exclude mchten and the verb ordering would be similar. Gehen is the main action in this verb phrase so gehen would take the second position and essen the last position Gehen Sie mit mir essen?The meaning here is now a more direct suggestion i.e. Are you gonna go eat with me?Note the word order as I demonstrated above works for sentences that include a modal or use a verb phrase however if you have a sentence without a modal and you use two or more verbs that are not part of a verb phrase the word order and grammar rules are different.

The reform  didnt only change rules for writing EsZett it also changed the way compound words are written so we write kennen lernen instead of kennenlernen. It made the capitalisation of nouns uniform also it changed some cases of written e into . Were also more likely to stumble upon tripled consonants than we were before.I tutorteach German and learn it at the same time so heres my opinion. In my highschool we were taught both spellings but our books were still written in the old spelling. Our teacher allowed both spellings tho so it was a personal choice of everybody needless to say everybody chose newer spelling. German is more accessible with the reform. Thankgod that it makes writing all those horrible French words easier I could NEVER EVER remember how to write Portmonee in the old spelling.

4155677,0,t1_crtwrag,German Standard German is based on the Hannover dialect.  Austrian German and Swiss German are not.  Also the definition of High German has nothing to do with Germany but the German language continuum.  See the Wikipedia page on Hochdeutsche Dialekte section Begriff especially the second and third paragraph. Here is the English wiki page on High German languages which says the same thing in the section Classification.  Another quote from the English article  gtThe term High German as spoken in central and southern Germany Upper Saxony Franconia Swabia Bavaria and Austria was first documented in the th century  Thats a tad older than Germany and more Holy Roman Empire.

4433452,0,t3_3btzsb,Both are correct and they illustrate two different types of passive in German. is Zustandspassiv. In Zustandspassiv sentences I like to think the past participle is functioning more like a predicative adjective. This type of passive focuses more on the noun and treats the participle like a modifier of the noun. So in the sentence The house is sold were focusing on the sold house.  is Vorgangspassiv. Depending on which dialect of English you speak it might be a universal thing idk you might use to get for this same purpose as in The house got sold.

5169708,0,t1_cv91gex,So tackle them in order. Look at the table for the indefinite article You see einer is used in two places both for the feminine gender.

Youll see this in other places e.g. adjectives the flection can change according to the way of usage.BTW in general you should learn all grammar tables by heart. Start with the definite article derdiedas and the indefinite article ein etc.Memrise doesnt teach it that way AFAIK. Its a good idea to read up on German grammar somewhere else.

In English .... You cant do this in German ever!  As said the rest of the sentence is correct and sounds natural too. Just one thing about your explanation  gtThe beer is the subject and uses the accusative case  The beer isnt the subject you are! Probably you meant to say its the object.

That can be done either by paying for a subscription which sees you until level  and through tons of content then expansions need to be purchased or by buying individual regions with ingame currency. The latter can be gotten either by buying with real money or by grinding deeds achievements which reward that currency. I think most people end up spending real money on the game eventually simply because theyre hooked.The game is based on Tolkiens books not on the movies which is a great benefit as the books are a lot more complex with many blank spaces filled in by the creators in a way thats mostly compatible with the books lore as far as that is possible in another medium.ETA If you do decide to try it Id recommend playing through the starting zones once each with five characters of the five different races and different classes for maximum fun. If thats not your kind of thing play a hobbit. The Shire which you will be brought to after a short starting zone is awesome.

Its automatic on Hello Pal when someone writes a message.I also started using Lang. Thats like an online journal thing where natives can correct and add comments about your written work. Although Ive done corrections I havent posted anything yet but thats because I want to write about more personal topics.Also I try my best to have more German friends as most of my day is spent with people who can speak English. I do my best to think in German. Im a part of an active Stammtisch where the only language that everyone would understand besides English is German so I feel encouraged to speak it there. Other than that I have also changed the language settings of a few programs to German. In the past I listened to a lot of German radio going to sleep and waking up as well as podcasts. Nowadays I hear it anyway in the car train bus etc. So I try to read more news in German and am currently reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in German.

7830139,0,t1_d3vt78q,Hah Im actually taking the test on Thursday too.  I really thought there was no way I would pass it on my first try so I registered for this one too.  Its far too late to get a refund so I figure I might as well go take it again.  Maybe I can get all s this time!Here are some of my tips for you.. Know the exact layout of the test.  You are preparing so this might seem obvious but you would be surprised by the people that show up to this test.  You should know for example that every ad in the first reading section will be used and there will be two Is.  Also you should know that the speaking section goes formal informal formal formal informal formal informal.  Some of this stuff isnt that important but the fact that you know it means you know the test too.  Even though I dont need to take the test again I can still tell you things about the actual makeup of the test.. For the writing have some good general phrases for introduction transition to graph description introduction to graph desc transition to opinionbenefitsdrawbacketc section conclusion.  They are grading you on our creativity.  Get some generic sentence that you can throw in there so you arent wasting any time.. For the speaking part its extremely stressful and you often have a lot to say in a really short time.  Make notes in the order that you will talk about them.  When you start speaking if you can try not to listen too much to yourself.  Just focus on your notes and go down the line.  I made plenty of grammatical and a few pronunciation mistakes but I did my best to forget about them right away.So the topics let me try to remember.  I honestly forgot basically everything as soon as the test ended because I was so focused during this part. Nope I completely forgot as soon as the test ended.  I remember that my  was about the world record in the m and I needed to give my opinion for why people are running faster and faster.  And my  was about a friend that was thinking about buying a new violin because her teacher said he violin wasnt good enough.I know that  proscons and  graph descriptionreasonsfuture are probably the most important parts on the speaking test.  Here is what I had for the  on my testGraph time decreased steadily since the sReasons better equipment better facilities more time for trainingprofessional athletesFuture I think we are pushing the limits of the things I mentioned before but there still might be room for improvement. a possibility is that we will start genetically modifying people and end up being faster.I actually kind of ran out of time on this problem but I spoke really quickly at the end and I think I got most of it out there.  I talked with some other people after the test and a lot of them couldnt really even answer this question.  As long as you dont see a topic like that and draw a blank you should be able to pass the test.Like I said though just make your notes in order and spit it out when you hear that beep.Also give this sit a quick read A lot of stuff from her site helped me a lot with the test.,German,d3w6awa,1,t5_2qq51

Sorry I typed this up too fast I meant that I read German well meaning when I read a German passage out loud I sound good at least this is what I was told when I lived in Germany and also by my German professor when I took the proficiency test. I understand what you mean though. I was forced to speak German when I lived in Germany but since I am not forced anymore Ive forgotten a lot or just dont put in the effort. And the only reason that I believe Ive plateaued is because for the past four years I havent really made an effort to keep up with German Id just sporadically go over my study sheet its not like Im doing all the things that Im doing now I was actually learning French and Portuguese but have now decided to commit to just one language because at this point Im a Native English speaker who understands three other languages really well but Ive decided to commit to one German obvs and attempt fluency. ,German,d43stgc,2,t5_2qq51

If I make mistakes correcting you theyre not on purpose.gt  Bis Montag nach Freitag arbeite ich am MorgenI think this should begt Von Montag bis Freitag arbeite ice morgens und im Vormittag studiere ich.In German if you do something every certain day every Monday Tuesday etc or the same time every day then you can just add s to that time and make it lowercase to use as an adverb.  If you do something every Monday you do it montags and if you do it every Thursday you do it donnerstags.  If you do something in the evening you do it abends and if you do it in the morning you do it morgens.  Lastly I think im is the preposition you use with times of the day im Morgen  im Vormittag  im Abend.gt Oft habe ich nur wochenends frei aber manchmal habe ich dienstags abends ein bisschen Freizeit.To my nonnative ears I think this would sound better asgt Oft bin ich frei nur an Wochenden  Oft habe ich Freizeit nur an Wochenenden aber manchmal habe ich dienstagabends ein bisschen Freizeit.As for the second part of the sentence Im not sure what to do about diestags abends.  I put them together as one word because two adverbs of time together looks strange to me but Im not sure if you can.Also adding s to a day or time of day means that is habitual so saying dienstags abends would mean every Tuesday evening.  You say manchmal so its only sometimes therefore I think the final version should be Oft habe ich Freizeit nur an Wochenenden aber manchmal habe ich am?  im? Dienstagabend ein bisschen Freizeit.gt Der Name des Buches dass ich lese ist Mad Ship von Robin Hobb How do I say The name of the book that Im reading is...?This is minor but in proper writing you always use a comma after conjunctions and clauses so this should be gt Der Name des Buches dass ich lese ist Mad Ship von Robin Hobb.As for your question I think what you wrote is fine but it might sound more German to keep it simple and just say Ich lese ein Buch genannt Mad Ship von Robin Hobb.Everything else looks good hopefully a native will make sure I didnt say anything wrong.

8369284,0,t3_4u8ixd,It will depend who you speak to. People from the middle and upper classes are more likely to speak Standard German with just a few very minor differences in pronunciation people from the working classes are more likely top speak either a variation on that or if youre unlucky a dialect of Low German.The dialect native to Hamburg is called Hamburger Platt Hamburg Low which itself can be subdivided into GeestPlatt in the north and MarschPlatt in the south. An example of Hamburger Plattgt Vrjohr Summer Harvst un Winter. Plattdtsch is de Spraak fr elk Johrstied. Kanns jmmers bruuken kanns allns mit moken.Which as far as I can make out Im unfamiliar with Platt myself translates into standard German asgt Frhling Sommer Herbst und Winter. Niederdeutsch ist die Sprache fr alle Jahreszeiten. Kannst du immer gebrauchen du kannst alles damit machen.In English Spring summer autumn and winter. Low German is the language for all seasons. You can always use it you can do anything with it.People will by the way often argue over whether Low German is a dialect of German or a separate language in its own right but thats mostly a political argument. Scientifically theres no real difference between a language and a dialect.Some people will also speak a mix of standard German and Hamburger Platt this is called Missingsch most of the grammar is Low German most of the vocabulary is standard German.TLDR If the people you associate with are middle or upper class then basically yes. If theyre working class maybe not  although theres nothing wrong with speaking a regional language variant.

You have a Nebelmaschine fog machine at the club because it looks cool. Nobody would want to have a Dunstmaschine. You can marvel at the Nebel covering the landscape.

So Mauer is more for brick walls but a Wand can also be from bricks. They are synonyms.

English actually doesnt really differentiate between nouns and adjectives.In this case erfahren is indeed functioning adverbally but for pedagogical purposes I think it makes the most sense to refer to it as a past participle so as to point out the cause of the confusion  namely that the past participle in this case functioning as an adverb of the verb erfahren looks the same as the infinitive.

10939869,0,t1_de7u2k7,Final e is often removed. The most common instance where this happens regularly is with verbs in st person singular. You will hear ich seh a lot more than ich sehe. Another instance where dropping the final e has already been regularized is Dative. In older or fancy German or in some fixed expressions like zu Hause you will sometimes encounter an extra e added to a dative noun. It has gone out of common usage in spoken German a long time ago and mostly disappeared from writing in the first half of the th century.In lots of dialects Im sure about the southern ones all the variations you posted are completely standard the final e and many other unstressed e had been dropped there centuries ago and is only being reintroduced by replacing dialect with standard German. Poems tend to take some liberties in selecting individual features of language varieties such as dialects to fit the rhythm or make things rhyme.So basically whenever you see an apostrophe its probably there to indicate a removed e. sist is a little special here. It should be s ist however the author decided to move the accent because its pronounced like a single word with a voiceless s! so theres just one syllable. However the glottal stop is still there before the i.,German,de8dcrw,3,t5_2qq51

11266681,0,t3_60rabk,No it doesnt come right after the verb every time Maria kauft mir einen Apfel.Maria buys me Indirect Dat an apple Direct Akk.The only thing fixed is the verb in the second position. You can move the other blocks around as you pleaseEinen Apfel kauft mir Maria is perfectly fine too. It stresses that shes bought an apple and not anything else.Mir kauft Maria einen Apfelworks too.There is a rule about the order of the complements When Why How Where. But all you really need to know for now is that the verb comes ALWAYS in the second position or a part of it at least and how to place the verbs in past tense which you will be learning soon. Thats a lot more important.Genitive well yes. It is not used very often and yes you can use von but youll see it written and hear people using it.

11309196,0,t3_61d8j9, lsen is correct in this context since you are solving a puzzle face would translate to Seite  Ein Wrfel hat sechs Seiten.  to describe a x cube you would say Ein vier mal vier Wrfel with mal being the German word for multiply. It works with basically any constellation of traditional cubes not as much with special cubes like a Megaminx. to rotate translates into drehen you are correct with that. Furthermore if you want somebody to scramble your cube you use the verb verdrehen. algorithm is just Algorithmus orientation would be Richtung its corresponding verb would be ausrichten and to permutate would equal to vertauschen or an den richtigen Platz drehen but platzieren would work just as wellNotation for algorithms are based on the English expressions so you wont have much problems there.

11460197,0,t3_63ixbb,gtMy first question is whether or not yall think its feasible to learn German well enough to comprehend university education in that amount of time with perhaps a few weeks before lectures start of actual time in Germany.Given that you already have a foundation in the language yes I think thats enough time. It will require a lot of dedicated study probably at least an hour a day that would include lots of immersive content televisionradio primarily but also reading complex materials.gtMy second is what yall think would be the most effective way of doing so. Im looking into studying German online through the Goethe Institut and I could study the summer after I graduate from high school.It certainly wouldnt hurt to do that but I dont know if its necessary. No formal course except maybe an hourperday intensive study course for State Department diplomats will provide enough time to teach you a language on its own so the vast majority of time spent studying a language must always be independent. Taking a formal course can be helpful if you need extra motivation like having inperson clarification of topics or cant find answers online  fortunately there are lots of materials for German though and of course to have direct access to native speakers. Though if youre planning on doing an online course the benefit of these is definitely diminished.Or you could do what I did and just go visit Germany after high school. Honestly thatll probably improve your German much more than a course in the US would. And let me emphasize that I think you can achieve fluency without total immersion by which I guess you mean being in Germany itself? because Im speaking from personal experience. I studied German independently throughout high school starting right before sophomore year and had very little access to native speakers. Mostly I learned from Germanlanguage media after learning the basics from grammar books. When I visited Germany for a month after graduating high school I was fluent enough to be mistaken for a native speaker quite a few times which by the way is not always a good thing  but thats another story haha. Its not like Ive got any special talent  I just put in a lot of time and effort so you can definitely do the same.,German,dfv0813,3,t5_2qq51
