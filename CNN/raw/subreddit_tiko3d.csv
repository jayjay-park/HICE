10261645,0,t3_5mxvow,Youre not stupid the Tiko doesnt work as promised. Ive done the same print  times and every time its come out differently than before if at all.Dont be discouraged about Kickstarter though. Ive backed  projects and only a few have ever failed. Yes youre taking a chance but for every Tiko theres a Pebble watch or Doodler out there.,tiko3d,dc77oww,6,t5_37t85

10920818,0,t1_de6ejf7,Right the idea is to use the Tiko to make an entirely new motion system from scratch and hopefully reuse some of the guts from it to make a much better open printer.,tiko3d,de6emgr,2,t5_37t85
