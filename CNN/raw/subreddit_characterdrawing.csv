598155,0,t1_cg895fe,I actually found that picture of the guy in black armour when I was trying to figure out what a paladin was and what universe he belonged to So far what I have drawn looks quite good guyish.Youve explained what he looks like quite well and say hypothetically what would the texture of his armour be like? smooth and clean or kind of jagged and evilish? since salvaged it from an anti paladin Im not sure what an anti paladin is and maybe if I knew a little background about them I could flesh it out better ... and would his sword be overly exaggerated like a fantasy sword or more realistic also when you mentioned some things like the tabard I assumed you meant this the green cloth over his entire body but I drew it kind of like a long piece of fabric that starts from the belt since it is a fantasy character. gt The tassets are ribbed and come down to half the calfcould you kind of explain what ribbed implies or perhaps a reference and traditional medieval tassets start from the breast plate and barely come down to half way past the thigh so I was a bit puzzled on what you meant.Sorry for all the questioning I want to get it as close as possible.,characterdrawing,cg89icd,1,t5_2v4r3

In terms of what they all have in common I think most of them have been out to prove something about themselves as their overall goal.  Redemption of some sort.  Probably reflects something about the player...  ,characterdrawing,cmlvbpx,2,t5_2v4r3

6321868,0,t3_4253ps,Thought as the requester Id drop in here and do a little backstory of this character and his purpose in my campaign.As the intruders forced their way deeper into the swamp spreading their poison and stealing its trees both the local druid circle and the Spirit of the Swamp became more and more desperate. The Spirit itself felt the slow death of the swamp its physical form slowly rotting and his spirit side fading yet it could not find the ones causing the swamp its pain. As its time began to run out quicker and quicker the spirit made a desperate gamble and turned to the Great Unborn One and the corruption for the power to save the swamp and ultimately its own life.Such power comes at a cost however and that cost must be repaid in blood. The spirit needed a new host and it just so happened that the youngest druid fit best. Luring the druid to a remote spot the spirit committed its first sin and gored the druid with the horns of its physical body before falling into a deep slumber while its body changed. When the spirit awoke it could no longer change into a spiritual form and its new physical body was replaced by the corpses of itself and the druid and where flesh once existed all manor of carnivorous plants. The Spirit would no longer passively exist responding to threats the spirit was now a hunter of anyone who would harm nature.In order to seal the contract the spirit returned to the sacred tree the druid circle called home and slew them all. The spirit now resides within the hollowed out tree various corrupted plants feeding on the corpses the spirit feeds them. Skeletal remains of the druids lie where they were originally slain and the head druid and those who originally poisoned the swamps skeletons remain crucified on the tree itself. The had failed nature and such failures will not be tolerated. As for its new master the Spirit knows it is just a pawn in the Unborn Ones schemes but the Spirit has its own plans outside the will of its master. With the corruption it has created the Red Moss and this newest creation allows the Spirit to corrupt other living beings to its will. In time the Spirit will gather minions and power eventually ascending to Godhood itself where it will break free of the Unborn Ones chains. But first nature must establish itself as the predominant force yet again and a purge of the living who threaten its existence is in order.,characterdrawing,cz886jr,1,t5_2v4r3

6857295,0,t3_49p22n,These guys were from a campaign that I ran a while back in a setting of my own creation. All you really need to know is that it takes place on a continent where dinosaurs rule the Earth and theres a strange mineral called poronium present that grants unusual powers.Ill give a quick biography of each of the characters here. Farenthrax is a naiad. These amphibious creatures are distantly related to gastropods and have societies both in and out of water. They were given their name by the first human explorers to discover the continent.Most of the other races use magic by exchanging poronium to their gods for power but not naiads. Due to the porous nature of their skin they internalize poronium much more easily than other races and have developed a form of magic they call channeling which changes energy concentration. Because of this natural self reliance they tend to see the gods as parasites feeding off the fruits of mortals labor.Farenthrax is an outcast from his society due to the fact that he is unable to utilize channeling. He left his home city and has become a wandering scientist studying unusual phenomena and creatures in his travels.Koliko is a Rex a species of large plains dwelling pack hunting saurians. He was raised in a raptor village by the local sage. After the murder of his adopted father he left on a quest for vengeance. Though physically intimidating he is easy going and friendly.Astrid is a Valkyrie a race of creatures that superficially resemble humans. When a valkyrie is young they may undergo a ritual which allows them to grow wings. This ritual was reserved only for upper crust individuals and served as a status sign. However upon arriving in Creta and discovering poronium a side effect of this ritual was discovered The Winged are unable to use poronium at all. This has thrown their society into chaos with various groups rebelling deeming each other heretical etc. etc.Astrid was a member of an upper class family. At the age of  she was supposed to undergo the ritual but decided not to and fled to a nearby human city. There she was taken under the wing of a crime boss named something that escapes me at this moment. After double crossing her he fled. Whilst searching for him she found the strange medallion that she wears in his former home and is on a quest to find him. At least if the strange properties of the pendant dont kill her first...Clara is the name of an adolescent brachiosaur which was only agreed upon after intense argument within the group. She imprinted on Koliko who then named her Clara. Clara has been infected with Poronium. This gives various abilities increased strength speed and it makes the crest on her head glow but it also puts her at risk for poronium withdrawal which causes the individual to become extremely aggressive. For now though she simply follows the group around and lets Astrid ride her.,characterdrawing,d0tl034,2,t5_2v4r3

9013605,0,t3_53q8hy,Heres my most recent commission Juniper Alva Sparks. I was requested to draw an elf that subverts traditional elf stereotypes this gal being a headstrong mercenary who sometimes loses her temper and wields a great sword instead of say a bow.To get away from how we usually think of elves I decided to make her armor rough and patchy rather than the usual elegant refined armor youd see on an elf and I tried to give her a taunting expression. I was also told that she decorates her black armor with red sashes so I decided to make these inconsistent and unorderly as sort of a visual metaphor of her freespirited nature.

10575309,0,t1_dd6hhtw,I definitely agree with you technically and you for sure shouldnt be downvoted for that. There should be no way for him to have learned that way. I honestly am still fleshing out certain flavor details. Maybe he made a pact upon witnessing this patron? Maybe he saw some ritual he wasnt supposed to have and the patron adopted him? Im not sure yet.My group is kind of playing with a loose definition on magic and as long as you can come up with some sort of mildly convincing plot device and dont change any of the rules of the game we can use whatever flavor we want. For example I had a Gensai who was s djinn so he floated and was translucent but he still could be seen and set off traps and such. So thank you for the hole in my plot device!It was mainly a way of justifying me using spells from the warlock class for my Eldritch Knight for my lvl    and  exception haha,characterdrawing,dd6rdpo,2,t5_2v4r3

That might allow her opponents to easily grab the mace and yank her towards them. And it doesnt help that shes a gnome a halfling a chibi a snot so big brutes can easily counter her.I cannot see much use on the chain even if I assume some fantasy movesets in mind.Sorry for the nitpick cool art nonetheless.,characterdrawing,ddj25n6,1,t5_2v4r3
