7984849,0,t3_4ojbrx,Im no expert but much of what you describe sounds like obsessivecompulsive behavior. In addition to medication are you undergoing any cognitive behavior treatment? I have a close friend who had OCD Im not saying yours is a disorder that depends on how much you feel it disrupts your life but it sounds pretty significant and CBT techniques helped her overcome many of most crippling obsessions and compulsions. Its by no means an overnight solution but know that there is hope... ,SPD,d4dkmhv,3,t5_2ug5f
11546292,0,t3_64s6ni,I say screw what people think of you and tie it up when youre out. Or you could try wrapping your hair with a head scarf.Fabricelastic headbands can help with wispyfacebrushing pieces.Im not sure what kind of hair style you have that would make it look weird to be tied up. Do you have any reference pictures you could share? Not asking for a pic of you if youre uncomfortable with that but if any celebrities have that style or if there are any wigs that youve seen with that style that you could share a pic of here.Im in a similar boat kinda. I had my hair super uber long for many years and it was always in a braid. Then I got it cut and it was shoulderish length and I didnt know how to tie it in a flattering way. Eventually I just went with headbands and a teacher bun. Then a few years ago I got a pixie cut. It was awesome. But then I moved and couldnt afford to get my hair cut anymore so I started growing it out again. Headbands have been my best friend. I even decided to do low pigtails at some points. Kind of s but it wasnt as cringey as I thought they would be.,SPD,dg4rw63,2,t5_2ug5f
