As early as  June  Stalin himself wrote though blaming local inefficiencies and not the Moscow plan In spite of the harvest which was not bad a number of districts which had a good harvest were in a state of ruin and famine. This was the same week he received a letter from Chubar and Petrovsky describing famine conditions and urgent need for assistance confirmed by personal inspection tours.At the same time OGPU was reporting despondency constant talk and provocative rumors of famine migration in search of food Party members resigning in protest rather than carrying out requisitions mass peasant resistance to collections grain thieves being shot and killed by Kolkhoz watchmen. In August Stalin complained that in two Ukrainian regions about  district committees have spoken out against the grain collection plan describing it as unrealistic and that the Ukrainian Party was shamefully trying to compromise between the complaining peasants and the orders from Moscow. Simultaneously his Politburo issued the notorious SevenEight Decree decreeing that Kolkhoz property was State property and that there must be draconian punishments without exception for anyone caught stealing it.The Ukrainian party stuck its neck way out to the point of overruling certain Moscow orders substituting its own plans and reporting their actions only after the fact. They protested slowwalked creatively reinterpreted orders... the Moscow Politburo responded with acid threats about capitulationism kulak theories antiParty and antiBolshevik behavior. On October  and Old Bolshevik ampndash a Muscovite actually ampndash reported on a climate of fear and cowardice among local Party officials who expected expulsion from the Party if they reported the truth and that the few strong communists who send in reports of local scandals were being ignored. His remarks were reported to higher authorities along with a note describing them as antiParty and impermissible.By the end of October Moscow had had enough with delays and failures and sent out enforcer squads led by Molotov Ukraine and Kaganovich Caucasus to struggle with the class enemy who sabotaged the grain collection and the sowing now defined to include not only kulaks but opportunist elements in party organizations. Kangaroo courts were rapidly established and over  sentences handed down. Over  Kolhkoz officials and  Party members were sentenced for counterrevolutionary offences in addition to the sentences for simple theft of grain. In one widely publicized case in the Caucasus described as a Kronstadt event a sortie of the adherents of Kronstadt a local Party official was executed for secretly releasing  grams of grain a day to collective farmers in excess of the prescibed  grams.From  November through  December a series of decisions taken by both the Ukrainian Politburo under Moscow pressure and then the USSR Politburo directly took the final and fatal step of depriving the peasants of their seed grain. The Ukrainian Party was no longer able to offer any resistance ampndash when Kaganovich this time came out from Moscow senior Party officials who had previously tried to moderate the predation and at least protect the seed grain now mouthed the prescribed inanities about secret grain stockpiles and local officials corrupted by kulak influence. There was another round of show trials deportations and purges. Blacklisting of farms and whole communities considered to be hotbeds of kulaism was enacted it meant sweeping through taking everything of value and leaving the inhabitants forbidden from leaving in what was now essentially an impromptu death camp.Finally between January and February Moscow began to acknowledge reality and reports from Ukraine slowly and cautiously acknowledged the reality of mass starvation ampndash typically bracketed with doublespeak about kulak rumors the need to carefully check reports to ensure they were not provocations and surreal conspiracy theories about grain hoarders deliberately starving themselves in order to be able to point to their distended bellies when the requisitioners came around. The trickle of food aid you mention that began in February was mostly sent to top up failed collections of seed grain and it coexisted with continuing requisitions and threats of expulsion for households who maliciously failed to provide seed. Simultaneously and preemptively the authorities held a propaganda spectacle celebrating the successes of Kolkhoz Shock Workers in contrast to the tens of millions of unemployed dying of hunger in the capitalist world and featuring denunciations of sabotage and praise for fathers who denounced their sons as grain hoarders. The affair culminated in a published denunciation of backward farmers who want to receive from the state elevators grain which we honestly gave to the state to feed the workers and the Red Army ... who did not fulfill their grain collection plan and have found themselves without seed and have only themselves to blame.To omit all of this and to focus only the haphazard and inadequate distribution of relief loans from February  on ampndash even while requisitions continued! ampndash to ignore the way that Stalin refused to even consider asking for foreign aid because it would have been embarrassing ampndash to portray the famine as a natural disaster to which the remote uncomprehending Politburo reacted sluggishly ampndash this is utterly dishonest and contemptible. It is pure Stalinist apologetics. And making hay out of the unfortunate exaggerations of Ukrainian patriots or the reasonable but mistaken conjectures of pre historians like Robert Conquest ampndash this is a typical denialist distraction tactic by which noone should be fooled.,ShitWehraboosSay,ctcn7pp,6,t5_37urc

Other areas  western and northcentral NC northern Alabama parts of Mississippi outside the black belt  were initially moreorless supportive of secession or at least a majority of their voters but grew warweary after military reverses and hardships on the home front and became havens for deserters.Youre right the very poor were almost certainly the least enthusiastic about the cause. Speaking generally your typical  volunteer was a middling farmer or better young literate politically aware with a real stake in the society for which he fought. However thats not to say the poor were unrepresented  Glaathaar shows that a number of these patriotic early volunteers were completely propertyless immigrant laborers from Savannah and New Orleans  just that they were underrepresented among volunteers. I rather suspect the reluctance of the very poor to fight on both sides was the impetus for the draft. However both armies were largely sustained through the duration of the conflict by the  volunteers. They made up the hard core of the armies supplemented by the latewar draftees who numbered less than  of both armies whom they often disparaged in rather classist terms describing them as ruffians shirkers drunkards and such. As McPherson argues in For Cause and Comrades major source for this entire argument when the shit hit the fan the volunteers generally stayed and fought while the draftees and bounty men shirked.,ShitWehraboosSay,d077c90,4,t5_37urc

With only a few hundered thousand cant remember but the figure   comes to mind serving as strafnikis. Whilst these type of units did exist the image portrayed in the film is that it was much more commonplace than it actually was. And that furthers the myth that those type of attacks had any significant impact on the war. It is questionable if they produced any outcome but dead Soviets. Just a pedantic point on my part  order  was only in effect between julyoctober  and the Smersh departments came about in . The ones guarding the strafnikis before that were Blocking Detachments commanded by the Special Departments which were run by the NKVD. Failure to advance or retreting would also not mean death for each individual soldier but for their commanding officer andor anybody found to have been causing panic Anecdote i remember reading about a tanker sent to a penal company. They were told to advance against german defenses and quickly got pinned down in a minefield.  The mission was just so the commanders could find the location and types of German guns  never meant to workAnyway this guy apparently fought well  after a while their luitenant ordered a retreat.  They fell back the tanker was told afterwards the liutenant had recomended high for a deceration which he got and of course got out of the penal company as a bonus.

The Chinese Peoples Volunteer Army was a large force of PLA veterans who volunteered to fight in the Korean war for North Korea. They were a primarily infantry based force equipped with contemporary small arms and man portable weaponry. They demonstrated discipline and skill when they managed to infiltrate several thousand men behind U.S. and U.N. lines and combined with their unexpected general offensive caused enough disruption to force a general retreat from North Korea. Despite heavy casualties they then maintained a front line against U.S. and U.N. armies until the cease fire was put into effect in . Compared to the other armies the U.S. has fought they were one of the most comparable to the U.S. in terms of training discipline and equipment.

7759570,0,t1_d3n2sn5,If you look at the difference between the way the Soviets produced tanks and the Germans did its night and day. The Germans had hundreds of tank designs with similar purposes built at the same time Hetzer and Stug are a good example of this. As well as building hundreds of prototypes Ive been studying tanks armchair for years and recently picked up a book detailing a good majority of them I was pretty shocked put how many they built.The Soviets however rarely built a tank that had a similar function to an existing vehicle late war there was a bit of overlap but even still they were producing far less variety than the Germans and I cant think of many vehicles at that point that werent based on the IS T or T tank.The Americans were closer to the Soviets a bit more role overlap and dozens of Sherman models but they had the logistics and good reason to do it in most cases diesel Shermans lend leasing models they didnt want to support and generally broke up tanks in a way that ensured most units had comparable variants.,ShitWehraboosSay,d3o7bxg,2,t5_37urc

7769034,0,t1_d3p96sf,From this thread gt Soviet logistics would have been shoestring but Japanese defenses were even more lacking at the time. As ucckerberos points out the attack on the Kuril Islands was difficult for the Soviets  and probably would have resulted in an initial Soviet defeat a la Wake Island  but the situation on Hokkaido would have played to Soviet strengths as its larger area would have allowed the Soviets to use force in numbers in a way they could not in the Kurils which offered limited landing areas and poor maneuver terrain.gtHokkaido had been all but stripped of men and supplies and moving soldiers and equipment back to Hokkaido would not have been easy as demonstrated by Task Force s strikes on July  and . These sank eight of the  large rail ferries used for transport to and from Honshu the other four were unusable because of damage.gtThe Soviet plan for an invasion of Hokkaido was simple and intended to deploy elements of the First Far Eastern Front from Sakhalin. The lead division would seize a beachhead around a port with a single rifle regiment. The rest of that division would follow then two more divisions would land at the captured port. From there followon forces would quickly outnumber the Japanese.gtWithout specialized landing craft the Soviets intended to purposely ground trawlers freighters and other ships on beaches. The invasion of the Kurils allows a glimpse of other methods of assault  small boats sent from minesweepers destroyers and trawlers.gtThe Soviets estimated the Japanese had  armed men on the island  in fact there were only two divisions and one brigade and they were oriented toward the eastern side of the island against a possible American invasion. Japanese airpower was almost nonexistent as was the Imperial Japanese Navy.gtMarshal Vasilevsky the theater commander sought permission from Stalin on Aug.  for an assault on Hokkaido. When Stalin failed to reply after several days Vasilevsky sent a second message on Aug.  saying he intended to attack on Aug. . This was likely premature as pacifying Sakhalin would have taken probably another week. At midday Aug.  Stalin ordered the operation suspended indefinitely.gtAs Richard Frank concludes in Downfall The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire The Soviet Navys amphibious shipping resources were limited but sufficient to transport the three assault divisions in several echelons. The Red Army intended to seize the northern half of Hokkaido. If resistance proved strong reinforcements would be deployed to aid the capture of the rest of Hokkaido. Given the size of Hokkaido the Japanese would have been hardpressed to move units for a concerted confrontation of the Soviet invasion. The chances of Soviet success appeared to be very good.And to answer your second question the Japanese knew they were kinda defeated but wanted to try and force a conditional surrender with the military government being left unchanged.So of course it would come as a bit of a shock when they found the Red Army yolostomping the Japanese garrison in Manchuria. The involvement of the Soviets in the north would mean a much harder fight in order to secure their conditional surrender because if the allies and the soviets both attacked the Japanese would be fighting a twofront war on their own soil much like Germany but far far shittier.,ShitWehraboosSay,d3p9zen,16,t5_37urc
7772586,1,t1_d3pnf9v,The author you just called a Nazi collaborator was one of the leading political activists for the restoration of Latvian independence when Latvia was occupied by the Nazis. He was fired from his post at the University of Latvia by the Nazis and he was later imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp.What a Nazi collaborator that guy was eh.The Soviet figures were censored or rather their archives were only opened up after the collapse of the Soviet Union.By your own admittance youre clearly a Slavophile and youre inherently biased to favor Soviet sources over the Latvian and German ones.

About  of ethnic Latvians with most of them actually being Latgallians a subgroup of Latvians and even less Estonians were to be removed from LatviaEstonia. Latvia barring the Latgale region and Estonia were considered to be culturally halfGermanized similar to Bohemia. If you werent aware of this Latvia and Estonia were essentially a part of Germany and Sweden for  years. Most LatvianEstonian names are Germanic which sharply contrasts them from Lithuania or East Slavic countries.Lithuania Belarus and Latgale which was a part of Russia and Poland were deemed to be so primitive that they didnt constitute any threat so the people of those territories were not to be destroyed but simply deported or left aloneisolated.Germanization entailed exactly the same thing the Soviets carried out in Latvia during the Soviet occupation and almost succeeded. Latvians would be wiped out culturally and assimilated youre right on that count.The part you dont realize though is that neither I nor most Latvian WaffenSS soldiers were Nazi supporters. The Latvian officers and leading political figures were all dreaming of regaining independence in the same way they did after WWI  by driving out the Soviets and turning against the Germans afterwards.

8053429,0,t1_d4l90cp,Yes but the Lebensraum also included Sweden that was not even in the war Norway and Denmark that got occupied but treated even better than our people. Is there an explanation to that? Or if you read the article you sent the death tool is set at around . million people that died directly or indirectly to the Nazi war crimes. Which is barely  of the people that got occupied. If their plan was to cleanse the land why would they not completely just slaughter everyone? Plans are one thing reality is another. Nazi ideology bad Germans not so.My point is not that the Germans were misunderstood or well I guess or that the Nazi war crimes are overdone or that they somehow were equal or less evil than the communist crimes. What I am trying to say is that the idea of the Nazis invading Soviet to slaughter everyone and install their Lebensraum is kinda not true. They occupied Norway and didnt kill anyone basically. They did kill a lot of us but that is because we fought back. Hard. It was a brutal war war is brutal. What I CAN say is that indeed many people saw the the German invasion as liberation or at least..equal to what they had before. How do you expect the people to react after they get their land taken away by fucking a kolkhoznik in american term it can be..community owned farm land? But actually dicator ship starve because they are not able to farm anyways and get put in jail for  years guess for what? Times was hard poor and little food under the communist. No toilet paper so people used the morning papers to wipe their butts after poop in the woods. Our neighbors that did it got the two oldest sons in jail for  years for daring to use a page which had Comrade Stalin on it. After that the whole village started purposely cutting out Comrade Stalins images before using it to wipe their butt. There is many stories like this. So when Germans come and bring food jail or shoot the corrupt leaders of your area and finally get rid of those annoying jews  that work with them that live down the road many did indeed saw it as something much more positive. In some areas it turned out to be worse the Nazis would kill many many innocent civilians that were not collateral damage but many would have their life improved and lived quite decently with the Germans without getting genocide or starved to death like under Comrade Stalin.,ShitWehraboosSay,d4la4vn,-3,t5_37urc

8141612,0,t1_d4v69ix,Yeah following subsequent research I definitely was off about some stuff in there and it turns out that a lot of the Tiger sightings that I found there ended up being King Tigers and going back to the Zaloga interview he did say that the Americans ran into King Tigers way more often than Tiger Is on the Western Front. Zaloga also describes one of his three times as And then there was a single Tiger company up in the Bulge that was involved in some fighting. which could lead to multiple encounters. He even said It definitely could have happened there are certainly lots of gaps in the historical record both on the German side and the US side. I think the idea that the US encountered a lot of Tigers during WW is simply due to the tendency of the US troops to call all German tanks Tigers. I have to defend Zaloga because I think he has said nothing wrong. Hes basically saying Tiger I encounters with American troops were actually very rare Ive only been able to find  separate instances where they were definitely in the same area of operations and reports are  confirmable. There were probably a few more but not many Thats an accurate nuanced way of looking at it. Moran parroted this but in a way to sound entertaining and interesting to people who arent necessarily interested in the nitty gritty of doing history. He said In northwest Europe between DDay and the Fall of Germany American tankers saw Tiger Is only  times. Moran has taken Zalogas openended trendfocused statement and turned it into a more absolute statement. I dont like absolute statements in History but at least he still qualified tankers Tiger Is and northwest Europe.Unfortunately Moran was talking to a bunch of WT and WoT players who have no idea what nuance is so that whole thing quickly becomes US soldiers of all types only saw Tiger Is or Tiger IIs three times ever through the entire war like Italy and North Africa dont exist. ,ShitWehraboosSay,d4v8w80,2,t5_37urc

8157541,0,t3_4qzd4a,I dont know if spiteful is the word but it reads p. clearly as an awkward synthesis between illinformed Cold War era speculation that them backward Slavs copied the German geniuses and later actuallywellinformed treatments of the subject that say no thats basically just made up bullshit.Also hilariouslygt One conclusion is that the MiG is a design benefiting from German research but conceived designed engineered and produced by the Soviets with an undefined amount of German assistance. Indeed all the development work by German scientists was overseen by an appointed Soviet personality whose Slavic name was to take credit for the formally allSoviet design.Source  not only says nothing whatsoever about this mysterious appointed Soviet personality but specifically says gt Claims that the successful Soviet pistonengined fighter designers Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich the lead designers of the MiG bureau were heavily influenced by the FockeWulf Ta have been discredited. Although the abortive latewar German jet had swept wings and bore a superficial resemblance to the later MiG the two aircraft are very different in structure and general design. The Soviets did seize plans and prototypes for the Ta but the majority of FockeWulf engineers were captured by Western armies. Currently most sources acknowledge that the MiG is an original design and that Western aircraft industries benefited from German aerodynamic research just as much as Soviets.While I dont have access to  the Yefim Gordon book an Amazon review notesgt Another reviewer complained of no mention of the German Ta  project as a supposed starting point for the MiG. This was dismissed as a myth by the authors in the introduction. Im willing to accept this at face value since the authors usually have no qualms about discussing the foreign origin of Soviet products like the RollsRoyce NeneRD that powered the Mig but I wish more detail had been provided.So I think its safe to assume that both of those sources are irrelevant or worse to the claims theyre being cited for.Of course since its Wikipedia whoever inserted that fraudulent information in violation of basic norms of scholarship will face no sanction whatsoever but if you call them a dweeb or remove their bullshit without obtaining consensus youll get banned.,ShitWehraboosSay,d4x8od1,11,t5_37urc

See if you find an article thats in a bad shape and if you can improve it. Improving in wiki lingo means adding sources and citations copy editing tagging such as fact or dubious or removing dubious information thats already been tagged. Thats how I got sucked into it  I saw a hagiographic account on Arthur Nebe and could not believe what I was seeing worked to reduce autrocities committed was reluctantly persuaded by the resistance circle to volunteer for an Eintzatgruppen appointment so that he could stay on top of the doings of SS and similar garbage. I had to do a double take  was this the same Nebe of the gas vans??? So thats how this story started... Hope these tips are helpful.

8536399,0,t1_d66oezq,The usual claim is that Japan was willing to surrender. Usually they just avoid the question of surrender terms altogether. When they do talk about terms they usually pretend that the condition the Japanese attempted to add to acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration in the August th communique ampndash with the understanding that the said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler ampndash refers solely and unproblematically to some ceremonial Constitutional Monarch role. And they often claim that this was the longstanding negotiating basis of Japanese policy going back long before the bombs and the Soviet entry when in fact it was something they were driven to literally only the night before in the famous Imperial conference.So tldr the usual bullshit story is that the Japanese by early  only cared about retaining the ceremonial role of the Emperor and wanted to surrender on that basis but the evil Americans wouldnt accept it because they were warcrazed or racist or wanted to sadistically destroy Japan to make a point to the Soviets about their military might or something.,ShitWehraboosSay,d68m7ai,6,t5_37urc

If I had the time I would try to write an equivalent where America stayed out of the European war militarily and it fell to the British and Soviets plus the resistance movements to defeat the Germans and Italians.

Between these two extremes New Zealand declared that as Britain was or would be at war so it was too. This was however a matter of political choice rather than legal necessity. Canada issued its own declaration of war after a recall of Parliament as did South Africa after a delay of several days South Africa on  September Canada on  September.

France was just so busy teach America they forgot to fight Germany.But yeah France did invent a crazy huge number of technologies.  They and the PrussiansGermans were in an arms race for longer then the Cold War was going.  So just like how the Soviets copied a lot of stuff from the US and vice versa the Germans copied a lot of stuff from the French and vice versa.  France was also the only nation that was a world class naval power and a world class land power for a long time.For an example of how influential France military technology was look at the US civil war.  Its often noted how the Civil War was different from the Napoleonic Wars with Cavalry charges and bayonette charges being much less effective.  A huge part of that that muzzleloaded rifles were way more common thanks to the French Minni ball.  Another huge part of that was the proliferation of  pounder artillery known as Napoleons.  These were named after Napoleon the rd not the great conquerer his grandson because they were an imitation of a common French weapon of the time.Or look at how during the world wars torpedoes became such a huge thing.  Know who saw that coming?  The French jeune cole.  The germans were just taking French concepts and rebranding it as their own with the whole raider warfare concept or as it should be known guerre de course.  But the enemies of France Germany and Austria were under blockade so France never put those ideas into practice and instead we have the ridiculous notion that ideas invented in France were German!Or artillery!  Everyone faps about tanks but WWI and WWII were really wars defined by artillery more then everything else.  And far and away the most influential piece of artillery in history is the French  model.  It served in both world wars extensively and it had the basic concepts that every later artillery piece copied.Plus the FT tank the tank as we know it an army that was way more modernized then Germany great fighter aircraft in both world wars... just so many things I cant list them all.,ShitWehraboosSay,dduekrt,2,t5_37urc

11118518,0,t1_derzmop,gt The balence of power was definitely not in favor of the AlliesIn the air the balance of power favored the western Allies overwhelmingly.  Now I know you are going to say but boots on the ground are what you need.  But the airpower matters a lot when it comes to boots on the ground.  The massively successful soviet offensives were conducted when there were few German fighters around and the Soviets could recon while the Germans couldnt.  In a war with the western allies the Soviets would be in a even more dire air situation then they had ever been against the Germans.On the ocean its no contest.  Not only do the Soviets not have much surface navy to speak of but they also dont have uboats to force the western navies to patrol all the oceans of the earth.  This means that allied forces can provide a massive amount of supplies to any port on the planet without being interfered with.  It also means that thousands of ships are available for supporting land operations.  And because there is no enemy navy to worry about there are possibilities that werent available against Germany.  For instance there were hundreds of destroyer escorts which could be used as high speed transports.  They could assemble flotillas of these and sealift tens of thousands of troops long distances on short order.  Or park a dozen cruisers outside any port but Lenningrad.  The  inch guns on a light cruiser are popguns by naval standards but by land standards that is a heavy artillery battery except its capable of accurately maintaining fire on target while moving too fast for counter battery.  Oh and it can go back and resupply itself in the middle of the night.But then there are land operations which are supposed to make everything else not matter.  And to be fair the Soviets did have a very impressive army at this point.  But this army would be called upon to do the impossible.  They needed to defeat a massive professional and mechanized force that had every kind of equipment it needed in amble supply.  And they needed to do this both completely and quickly.  Time was not on the side of the Soviets.  In  they suffered a famine and that was even with the postwar demobalization.  They were being heavily outproduced in war materials even as the Americans were giving them raw materials.  If the Soviets had tried to fight a war of attrition they would have ended up in the same situation Germany was in during the late war having a large army but without equipment to supply it.  If its a war of industry they are way behind.  If its a war of attrition they start out nearly exhausted.,ShitWehraboosSay,des9x49,19,t5_37urc
