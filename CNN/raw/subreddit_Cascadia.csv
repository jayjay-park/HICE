After all there are lots of animals science doesnt know about. I also dont think everyones grandpa is lying though now that you mention it Cascadians are notorious bullshitters! Grandpas have been telling stories like this since the dawn of time and in every culture and I think a more plausible explanation is when people see something they have trouble identifying for whatever reason they unknowingly distort their memory to fit it to something they already know of. Sasquatch stories are well known but in other regions they have other legends and people claim to see different equally unlikely things.That being said I would love to be proven wrong!

377919,0,t1_cfjxdqv,No rightwing libertarian and patriot types are obsessed with the idea of national collapse. I only suggested that because there are only a few scenarios in which I can see Cascadia occurring and those circumstances need to be examined if you take the idea seriously. I say it is predominantly left wing for several obvious reasons... first off all this subreddit is simply one long list of liberal news events occurring in the Northwest minimum wage hike death penalty suspended free stuff for illegal immigrants etc. Next there is the fact that the Cascadian concept itself originates with radical ecologists. These ecologists were different than todays they were not all left wingers. Most were libertarians or luddites. Others and I knew these guys were hardline conservatives. A lot of people with socialist or classwarfare ideas came into the ecology and antinuclear scene and tried to redefine it as some Marxist struggle. Also from firsthand experience I only see the tricolor being raised at way extremist leftwing trash like the occupy thing which still makes no sense to me. In my day a group established a clear message a goal and a strategic means of achieving that objective aka a plan before undertaking an action. If selfdetermination is the primary objective then I would argue by our modern political construct that Cascadian separatism is rightwing in nature.,Cascadia,cfjxqlz,-5,t5_2s4dh

Try and make them as happy as possible Be efficient. Think long term not short term. ect.

Just without the negative ones like hate anger jealously ect. Similar processes just not repeated with meat and built through a blind evolutionary process that favors its own individual survival and prosperity. Just because they have some core programs and little behavioral apps running wouldnt make their lives and experiences any less real than ours as we have the same things running but we know what benevolence is and can experience it.Not to say Im  on board with that idea. For starters we dont have the tech yet to make a sapient feedback loop. Also the monkey part of my brain is naturally paranoid of the inhuman especially the intelligent inhuman.

2726840,0,t1_cndxf1r,gtSource? I could be wrong but I was under the impression that cows and humans have evolved symbioses with certain microbes to the point where the only environment those microbes thrive in is within their respective digestive tracts. The quantities are also not necessarily the same. There could be a small amount of these microbes in the grass that the cows eat after which they are introduced to the stomach and multiply into a large colony.In researching some things earlier I came across a discussion of methanogens and their presence across species. While I cant find a specific breakdown the presence of Archaea the bacterial genus associated with methanogenesis and the associated methane was only found in  of  test subjects. Source That said Archaea is omnipresent in the environment and will produce methane provided conditions are right low oxygen. Which leads to the second point.gtHow can you be so sure? Those are pretty big differences.While I couldnt find a mathematical abstract on the subject the important factors are heat which relates to bacteriological activity and anoxic conditions such as in marshes Ref gtAgain Im guessing it happens much more inside the cow. As a function of time yes.gtWhile thats a very attractive source of energy if your alternative is say coal were doing pretty good with renewable energy sources in Cascadia. Instead of going back to burning stuff we should be trying to remove those kinds of energy source.AFAIAC chemical energy derived from biomass is the future. There are too many great things that come from chemical processing we simply cannot make another way. Whether its lifesaving drugs lubricating oils or liquid fuels. Methane is the basic building block of all organic chemistry get enough of it and you can make some pretty neat stuff.gt Right there are no  efficient chemical reactions which is a good reason to limit those reactions. Most land is suited to a few cattle especially after you remove the trees. The problem is big herds of cattle and removing treesother parts of the ecosystem for ranching. We should stop looking at this as a Cascadia or North America or USA level though... ltSNIPgtI think youre taking this in a different context than I am.

This is the biggest problem I have with the idea of communism is the lack of choice.As hard as it would be we would try to balance communal needs with individual needs and the needs of one individual with the needs of another. I dont have an exact idea how this would be done but hopefully itll be figured out. Everyone has fundamental rights which need to be respected.gtAs far as money goes its simply a placeholder it allows someone to convert a large heavy asset into something that can be subdivided without destroying the whole. Frankly it kinda rates up there with division of labor as a fundamental concept of human organization. At the same time it also acts as a relief valve... people can acquire unlimited amounts of money instead of acquiring physical possessions to the detriment of others. I.E. someone doesnt have to acquire and hold  acres of farmland they will never farm when they can sell it for an equivalent value therefore those who farm may own and subdivide it as needed.We believe that in an economic system with money one persons eventually going to end up with more money than the others. Then theyll use that money to take resources that other people need. Theyll gradually increase their wealth and people will get pissed that now theyre hungry. However some people might be willing to suck from the teat of this rich person in return for making sure that nobody else gets those resources by using violence. Thus a statist and capitalist system has returned. Yes money has historically been a concept in practically all human civilizations but communists and certainly us anarchocommunists believe its a tradition that has run its course and belongs in history rather than the modern day.,Cascadia,cntc6iu,1,t5_2s4dh

I think everyone wins except for a very small portion of the population and I think nearly everyone would be happier with the compromises that PNW radicals liberals and conservatives would come to if they were only deliberating locally between locals about local issues.If you want to save the environment if you want to improve the ethics of our economy if you want to free yourself from paying taxes to a wasteful federal system if you want less pressure from that system telling you what to do and how to live you can have it with a smaller and more local government.By accepting progress in baby steps we can start making it now.

While individual National Forests have been working on their own Forest Plan revisions for some time there is an effort now to revise the Northwest Forest Plan NWFP. The NWFP applies to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands in Washington Oregon and Northern California that are known to contain Northern Spotted Owls. The plan sets management priorities and direction on issues like timber targets land designation matrix latesuccessional reserve designated old growth etc. plant and animal surveysmanagementprotection etc.The NWFP has been in place since  and has undergone some revisions and received some amendments over the last  years. The NWFP has led to better ecosystem management compared to the preceding timberbeast clearcut years but theres always room or further improvement. The current revisions could have a huge cumulative impact on millions of acres of public lands as well as local economies for generations to come.

That such a secession movement be focused on bioregional awakening. That the movement be a decolonization movement questioning and deconstructing the thinking of domination of Nature the Earth and ourselves that we have inherited from settler culture. In essence it becomes a resistance movement that includes paradigm shift within us as well. Solidarity with indigenous people in their struggles and acknowledgement of the sovereignty of the indigenous nations within the bioregion. Inclusion and active dialog with minorities and marginalized communities as part of the human landscape of the bioregion. Confronting and resisting the current socioeconomic systems of the oppression. Focus on building birthing a decentralized Alternative Infrastructure of Resistance and Resilience A.I.R.R.. That the movement be focused on decentralization and community autonomy within a bioregional network. Securing and creating culture of stewardship of the social commons such as education health and infrastructure and natural commons such as water air forests ecological communities minerals soil and the Earth. Denouncing of Nationalism and Cascadia as a single nation but acknowledging that many indigenous nations exist within that bioregion..

9588909,0,t1_d9utt5d,I wouldnt sweat it too much.

9590583,0,t1_d9v03ze,What? YOu guys would have to pay tariffs on stuff produced in California. There arent too many diverse farms in washington and oregon. Eventually you would be importing food and as your businesses leave because it would make no sense to distance themselves from the largest country in the world you would fall into a depression so large that boeing leaving seattle however many years ago would seem like nothing. Any seattle resident knows what  a scare that caused. Trust me without california you would not last more than  years.,Cascadia,d9v8hn7,2,t5_2s4dh
9591218,0,t1_d9v978p,gt Can I ask your reasoning for advocating incorporating the crown into Cascadia?I believe there are four distinct founts of sovereignty that are natural and important in Cascadian history and culture the British monarchy the illahe the first nations and the people. I believe that each should be incorporated via lieutenant representation as coequal holders of important reserve powers in the Cascadian state. The stability of having mediating institutions with a longterm perspective brings a measure of stability to constitutional monarchies that is missing in most republics. Research shows that hereditary and other unearned individuals are much more hesitant to use reserve powers and are more likely to look at longterm preservation of institutions above shortterm political expediency. So thats my reasoning.gt And are you from the States if you also dont mind me asking? Yes.gt Im Canadian and I guess my impression is that Americans dislike the Monarchy.This country was founded fighting against an unaccountable monarchy that was threatening customary freedoms that Americans believed were rightfully theirs. The founding fathers decided to enshrine a republic and Americans are fairly used to the idea but weve just seen some of the downfalls of it fairly recently. Of course while my passport may say United States of America I have basically never considered myself American so my opinion on republic vs. constitutional monarchy may be unduly influenced by my Cascadian identity.,Cascadia,d9vbbav,2,t5_2s4dh

10565386,0,t1_dd4xrvf,gt So ... how do you think teachers can draw attention to the fact that their compensation isnt competitive?Honestly thats not my problem.  But I would say the same way everyone else does.  Almost  of workers arent in a union.  Im pretty sure they still manage to have their compensation concerns addressed.That said Id be happy to let them strike all they want if it werent for labor laws that make it illegal to fire them.  If I dont show up for work I get fired.  I dont see why teachers should be any different.

An even greater chunk of the population beyond the . are sympathetic but not directly participating.Also if were talking strictly Cascadia I would think it would only take . of the Cascadian population.
