5188831,0,t3_3m2oks,I took it as a L the semester after I took PR. I was glad to have gotten it out of the way and theres no need to wait until closer to the bar but youll be fine either way as long as you do some practice questions.,thelawschool,cvbg09k,2,t5_3a1q0
5196804,0,t1_cvbpven,I think there is a difference between the emigration here and the emigration due to the admins banning a rabid vocal hate group though. Nobody here is ranting about freedom of speech and suing reddit. The only real similarity is people leaving to have a subreddit they want to participate in but thats as far as the comparison goes imo.,thelawschool,cvcepow,2,t5_3a1q0
5248666,0,t1_cvil3jn,Please dont do that. It would be making a way bigger deal out of it than it likely needs to be. I used to teach elementary school and this is the type of situation that would drive me crazy. Tattling. Im sure it bothers deans of law schools even more especially for something petty like this. Just say something yourself if something similar happens again and I hope things start looking up for you! ,thelawschool,cvinit1,5,t5_3a1q0
5266968,0,t3_3n3jlo,Has someone tried posting another thread advertising the presence of this sub yet? Id guess they just allowed the first one and that they would like ban future posts would be interesting to see.,thelawschool,cvkwwtc,2,t5_3a1q0
5401351,0,t3_3oomsg,I dont know what people are talking about about L year being easier. I have law review clinic and a job on top of classes. I am easily devoting more time to law school related things than I did my L year and am nowhere near as productive.,thelawschool,cw22z4u,2,t5_3a1q0

6246658,0,t3_414edf,With my friends sure. With random acquaintances not so much  I wont volunteer but Ill be honest if Im asked.

8709398,0,t3_4z9vsq,Literally no one will care or remember what you say if youre cold called in class. Everyone is too busy worried about getting called on themselves. The worst thing you can do is panic in silence while frantically searching through the way too many pages of reading notes you took. Just give your best answer and listen to the prof because theyll likely guide you to the correct answer if you give an honest try. Also dont be the obnoxious gunner that hijacks and derails the discussion to prove how smart you are. Hint if you raise your hand and listen hard you can hear a collective sigh from your fellow classmates signaling that you in fact that obnoxious gunner. ,thelawschool,d6ub77k,10,t5_3a1q0
