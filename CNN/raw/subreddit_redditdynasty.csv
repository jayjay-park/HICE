2802185,0,t1_cnmkmnr,I think in this instance it was just Bobby trying to come up with the best compromise to a problem he had been seeing numerous times over his past three years as a commissioner and that we were butting up against here. You still get a benefit from having submitted your postround  selection and you dont have the sweat someone else snagging your guy before your round  pick.,redditdynasty,cnmljsa,2,t5_2t919

3570733,0,t1_cpyw81l,I agree with the home runs being a key to success. Your team is pretty stacked in that department. I dont think I drafted enough of them. Im hoping a guy breaks out with power and I can snag him off the waiver at this point because I dont really see any of my guys breaking out for that much more than projected.I worry about your pitching a bit. It looks like your strikeouts are a bit low and maybe a little bit high in ERA and WHIP. It all depends what your projections are. I think I would rather have the HRs and pick up pitchers than count on picking up power though.,redditdynasty,cpzahst,1,t5_2t919
