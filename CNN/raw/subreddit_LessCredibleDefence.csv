It would appear to me that we are trying to broker a renewal of the old TurkishIsraeli alliance.  Israel will supply Turkey natural gas form its new coastal fields and we will supply Turkey with state of the art weapons.  Turkey will become a counter weight to Russia Iran and the Sunnis respectively.Thus enabling us to pull back and be the grey immanence behind the alliance.  We may or may not keep a presense in the Gulf States but I expect our boots on the ground to be minimal within the decade.In concert with this I see us trying to establish an alliance between Poland and Turkey and possibly Romania to stand off Russia.  You can expect us to sponsor Turkey and Poland into  century economic strength as we did South Korea and Taiwan and for the same reasons.  We want them to pay for the lions share of the alliance costs.If we succeed at establishing these alliances we will draw down our commitment and prseense in the Middle East and pivot our forces to Asia to be the off shore balancer against China.

The Royal Canadian Airforce likes to have a  engine aircraft for safety amp relibility purposes when conducting sovereignty patrols over the arctic. So it rules out a lot of single engine aircraft even though the F is a single engine plane it just goes to show how powerful Lockheed Martin has been in the sales and marketing of its plane. Saab Gripen EuroFighter Typhoon Dassault Rafale and others have been considered to replace the aging CFs. IMO RCAF should buy Advanced Super Hornets as they phase out the older CFs. The cost saved in using a similar aircraft that the pilots and ground crew are already familiar with and the improved capability of the Super Hornet over the CF is enough for Canadas needs. The money saved could be spend on unmanned aircraft to fill the gaps. EDIT  Regret even bothering to post my opinion.

These included a specially designed gurney to move the detainee upright quickly in case of choking the use of a blood oximeter to measure detainee vital signs placing detainees on a liquid diet so their emesis would be soft and less likely to cause choking or aspiration pneumonia if the detainee were to vomit and having a tracheotomy kit not visible to the detainee present in case a detainees airway had to be surgically opened in order to preventdrowning.OK... so the tapes were destroyed. The gurney too? If not.... where is this apparatus now? Isnt it about time to show and tell? From what Ive read it wasnt as well designed as it should have been as the detainees were apparently able to move their heads  indicating that the head restraints werent nearly as robust as they should have been.

This gurney is a table which is pivotted around the middle. It has restraints for the detainees hands and legs. What head restraints is unclear.

8557658,0,t1_d68z2f4,Another idea is to mass produce Ford class superaircraft carriers and replace nimitz as fast as possible.In general I have several problems with the f plan.I wouldnt be focusing money now on procurement because there are still other things I would be focusing money on.  Finalizing the design for one.  Software for two.Just because the air force has poorly managed its fast jets doesnt mean they should be rewarded.In general I think longer procurement is better for the industry and is better for the air force.  What happens when the last F rolls out of the factory?  Do they just keep the plant open like the M factory?  Every part of this from top to bottom left to right start to finish has been designed to be too big to fail in every way.  I suppose they will be building spares for a while.This is just off the top of my head but the only things Im seeing in the next  fucking years are the b maybe drones and the possibility of a navy superhornet replacement.That looks like one big fucking dry spell that makes the dryest part of the dryest desert in the world look like the fucking amazon.,LessCredibleDefence,d6ba7db,-1,t5_2yyyd

9401073,0,t1_d97jnej,As explained elsewhere production of Izdeliye  export variant is running in Russia since years and they have been sold even to countries like Sudan or Syria not only to India and China. The weapon is fully operational with them. Re. Chinese replacing their Rs its actually so that whenever they have some Russianmade aircraft with Russianmade avionics system in service they seek for ways to adapt their own avionics systems and weapons to it. Thats how the SuSK became the JB nowadays equipped with a Chinese radar PL and PL missiles and the SuMKK is about to become J. Means something like the time of the R in Chinese service is defacto up. At some point in time all the SuMKKs are going to be rebuilt into Js and reequipped with between others PLs. gt But we know from official audit reports that the equipment suffered all sorts of issues. I have no such information of the Chinese military but extrapolating from the Indian experience I assume that it faced similar problems.There are no reports about such affairs like Chinese ordering Rs and Russians delivering them yearsold Rs just for example  like this happened in India about a decade ago. But who can know... Chinese are nowhere near as transparent in this regards as Indians are. That said I can only warn but really warn against any kind of comparisons between say the IAF and the PLAAF or the PLANAF. They are really not the same. The IAF is agesold air force with immense traditions and experience with its own combat experiences not only against Pakistan but from service of its instructors in many countries around the World too but also modern almost technocratic way of thinking and highly developed and professionalized doctrine strategy and tactics. Modernday PLAAF is defacto  years old  though also a service the commanders of which still tend to think in the way they thought back in the s. Sure the Chinese are undertaking immense efforts to change this from bottom up it could be said theyre training several entirely new generations of new commanders pilots and other personnel. Theyre training almost like mad in just one of PLAAFs four major annual exercises  stylized very much after the USAF Red Flag  they fire more AAMs and PGMs than the Russians have fired in all of their wars of the last  years theyre studying researching watching and listening... but they lack any kind of fresh combat experiences and it appears they are extremely slow even in exploiting experiences from multinational exercises. Means it takes them time and while they have the equipment no doubt about that  thoughtswise theyre nowhere near the IAF. And the PLANAF is even further back in this regards than the PLAAF is.,LessCredibleDefence,d97nh5w,2,t5_2yyyd

A saturation attack with highvelocity lowaltitude cruise missiles is still harder to defend against.Everyone who gets a boner over these things seems to forget that flipping a long range ballistic missile at something no matter where it is is not something that either the US Russia and a handful of other countries are going to take lightly.  A few years ago the air force considered putting a conventional warhead on an ICBM as part of the Prompt Global Strike program.  The technical capability to drop a bomb within a few yards of a target after a little trip through space is certainly there so why is the USAF spending millions of dollars developing some pieinthesky bullshit hypersonic cruise missile instead?Because they know that if they launch a fucking ICBM no matter whats on the tip of it at least five other countries are going to shit themselves and warm up their own missiles and those are going to have nukes on them.  The exact same thing would happen if someone launched an ASBM.EDITTLDR  Frankly if China squirts a ballistic missile at one of our carriers losing that carrier and its battle group will probably be the least of our worries.Other than that hes right you know.,LessCredibleDefence,ddku43d,14,t5_2yyyd
