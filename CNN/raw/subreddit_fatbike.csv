452216,0,t3_1z6ild,Theyre really nice but damn expensive. Now some of the big names in cycling are getting involved in fat bikes Im hoping theyll bring the low cost alternatives. These small companies are great but I cant afford any of their products.,fatbike,cfrnyx2,3,t5_2uzci

1074988,0,t1_chobkpl,Its fantastic! I tried a Specialized Fat Boy Expert and its pretty similar though that one obviously had better tires and a carbon fork which probably made the ride a bit smoother but Ive got more gears and paid a fraction of the price and still get to run over everything.,fatbike,chqha9b,2,t5_2uzci

2376759,0,t1_cm5gtyx,Youre welcome dude. Only other tidbit Ill say is the screw likes to loosen after a lot of riding. Once you fidget with the mount and get it pointed where you want remove it and tighten the horizontal adjustment screw. That way it is a set it and forget it thing. Then when you hit a large bump your light isnt searching for raccoons in the trees or spotlighting the ground a foot in front of your bike afterwards.,fatbike,cm5h5h0,1,t5_2uzci

2633895,0,t1_cn2c09o,Incredible writeup and trip no doubt. This sort of gowherethetrailisnt riding is what first attracted me to the fat bike.  I wish the fatbike industry were pushing as much this way as it is towards bikes for wellgroomed packed singletrack.,fatbike,cn2dtxx,1,t5_2uzci
2785494,0,t3_2rz915,I was considering putting a  wide tire on the front because my Bluto will manage that and running a  on the back given that is what the back would allow. I figured the wider tire would kind of push the snow down a little and allow the back tire to get by on less width. ,fatbike,cnkp8ga,2,t5_2uzci

4397773,0,t1_cslchpe,Triples made more sense when we didnt have wide range rear cassettes. Now that you can get an x cassette there is no reason for a triple. That is all the granny gear youd ever need. Triples are heavy and hard to adjust which is why the industry has moved on. ,fatbike,csld3v6,2,t5_2uzci

5698418,0,t3_3t68ju,The only drawback is if youre in a competitive riding group.  There are guys Im faster than but there are also guys who are right at my fitness level on a level playing field.  If I bring my Bucksaw to a long climb up a mountain pass and they bring their B theyll be dragging me.  Overall worth it though most of the time we are just out to ride and as long as you dont care about pure speed the Bucksaw is awesome.  ,fatbike,cx3fzgw,3,t5_2uzci

I like what Salsa has to offer but there arent any dealers near me so sometimes it comes down to convenience.I have another Trek bike and they have always done a fantastic job standing by their product. I had a wheel crack and they replaced it right away. They even gave me an upgrade. I think the ride is important but other factors such as the warranty the dealer and a few factors are equally enticing. ,fatbike,danqq7f,1,t5_2uzci
