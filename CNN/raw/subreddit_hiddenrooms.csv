It was very painful and murder on my bandsaw blade to sacrifice beautiful old books but I am glad they are being enjoyed in a new life as opposed to just rotting away in boxes somewhere.My wife actually teaches the art of traditional leather book binding so we still create more than weve destroyed with this project.This is the type of books she teaches how to make.This one uses old wrecked Pianola rolls for embellishment.,hiddenrooms,dcqzfnn,2,t5_2v033
