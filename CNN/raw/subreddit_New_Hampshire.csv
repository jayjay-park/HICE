5004581,0,t1_cuoax11,Its not the inspection that they are trying to rip me off on. Its the repairs. First garage said I needed rust repair on the muffler that was going to cost . I asked them to show it to me. I guess they werent expecting me to ask because when we took a look and he pointed out the rust spots I asked if they really warranted a repair. It wasnt like there were holes there was just  SMALL spots of rust. He started saying that now that he was looking at it it wasnt as bad as hed thought.The other garage was just straight up dishonest with me. Told me I needed a new air filter. I twist my hair and act clueless. Oh can I see how bad it is before I make a decision? They bring me a dirty air filter caked with dead leaves. I knew it was BS because my boyfriend and I replaced the filter by ourselves  months earlier and the car hadnt been through autumn so there was no way it could have accumulated that amount of dead leaves. It was also a  different brand. Really? I ask marveling at the dirty filter. This was in my car? Yup he says. I get up and briskly walk into the garage with him yelling Maam! while chasing after me. I pick up MY air filter on one of their tables. Because this is the one I put in five months ago. Mechanic starts questioning a younger mechanic and then says he got them mixed up and he thought mine was one they had and were going to put in. Younger guy looks confused and then a look of realization flashes across his face. I popped my air filter back in informed them I did not want any work done and drove out of there.EDIT The first garage said nothing about the air filter and the second garage said nothing about the muffler. Also they wanted  for the filter.,New_Hampshire,cup8n5p,1,t5_2qyw6

I enjoy the white Mountains personally. All the little towns and what not nice mountain roads to drive on. But someone else said... not ideal in winter. ,New_Hampshire,cyr422e,1,t5_2qyw6

A little in Manchester but a farm would not be in that area to worry about that. No real wildlife dames in southern nh. Central and northern deal with more snow and up north you deal with skunks and raccoons more than in southern nh. Portsmouth is pricey but there is an opportunity there for fresh food sales and its near  to Boston if you ever expand.  People make more and push more for that. The Merrimack nh area near Nashua also is near a major thoroughfare to interstate  which leads to Boston and a future potential market.,New_Hampshire,db5wwj7,2,t5_2qyw6
