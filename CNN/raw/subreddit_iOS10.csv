8067622,0,t3_4ppcez,I am pretty sure the is todo with how iOS  suggests apps. They probably just dont have text to say Siri Suggestion yet is my bet. It changes for me what app appears at the bottom depending on daytimelocation and usually actually knows what app I want to open. This is similar to how in the iOS or ?? betas it didnt properly know display for handoff and the suggestions for location.,iOS10,d4mvl0h,1,t5_2v397

8251675,0,t3_4sf4g4,Opinions of iOS  seem to be drawn right down the middle between people with Touch IDD Touch and people without. I was already pressing to unlock so it doesnt really bother me but I can see how brutal it would be for people without Touch ID to adjust. And as far as replying to messages its a D Touch on the S. Hopefully they find a middle ground. ,iOS10,d590k4p,3,t5_2v397
