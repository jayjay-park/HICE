2204331,0,t3_2kcn7q,What about Persephone? Shes the daughter of Demeter another option who was tricked by Hades to eat six pomegranate seeds trapping her in the underworld for  months out of the year. Demeter would become sad when Persephone descended into the underworld in the fall and her joy would return in the spring with her daughter.I also think Cassiopeia is beautiful and Cassie is a nice nickname.,Whippets,clk0voq,7,t5_2rh1s

6198135,0,t1_cye4otm,My whip took to her crate very quickly. I only used to close the door at night. I got rid of it at home once she was trustworthy enough. However at my parents home when we visit she still does have one as well as a normal bed. She will sleep during the day in the normal bed but at night she puts herself in the crate out of preference! When shes in the crate I know its time to give her a biscuit and close her in for the eve. She chooses her bedtime and its surprisingly consistent.,Whippets,cyu5tzy,1,t5_2rh1s

11005988,0,t3_5x1f2e,Hey i got my first whippet and first dog  weeks ago! So were in the same boat. Shell be  weeks this weekend!.What kibble does your pup eat? My puppy enjoys the blue bits training treats. And biscuits. I cut them up so i get more use out of them.I suggest watching larry khrons YouTube videos. I just putt a video up yesterday about how Ive been training my whippet nd minimizing her chewing on things.If shes not interested in the treats your giving her try throwing them or rolling the treat by her to entice her going after it.So far weve got her doing conesitlaydown drop it fetch down quiet no stay etc.One thing that stuck with me in my research before bringing my pup home was its not what it is its what you train them to be so if shes not liking the treats your giving. Make her like them. Dont give her options! because then your leaving room for her to become picky and stubborn. my vid.       ,Whippets,defhxhp,1,t5_2rh1s

11322947,0,t3_61ledj,One of mine is very cuddly when she wants to be and doesnt like it if she cant be in the same room as me another one of ours is the complete opposite and rarely comes for cuddles he would rather take himself up to bed and stay there all day. The other one whippet x setter likes to cuddle up to me in the evening. If im home alone during the day tho I dont really see my dogs as they r all asleep in their room we dont have kids so the dogs have their own room. They are all a bit boring really and would rather sleep. ,Whippets,dfffr9h,3,t5_2rh1s

11606058,0,t1_dgbfxqy,The entire purpose of a shirt is to keep you warm and make you look good. Whippets do that too but thats where the comparison ends. Im not entirely sure how I feel about the issue myself but I know that aesthetics should never be the top priority. Thats not me being preachy. Its just common sense if youre gonna be spending the next  years together pick a dog you like being around. If that dog ends up being a colour you like then great. Its fine to have a preference. If someone just has to have a pretty blue dog and nothing else will do then I can see where uHeffa is coming from  Im not sure Id trust that person either. Im not saying OPs that kind of person. I dont their comments indicate that. Not that its any of my business anyway.  ,Whippets,dgbk1is,4,t5_2rh1s
