But behind that is the knowledge and wisdom that well fuck it hes right.And if while doing that you get all up in his grille and deserve to have your lights knocked out he is just the guy to do that.,longmire,cjo3tg4,7,t5_2u5g0

5080597,0,t1_cuy9kpc,Yes. He is incredibly interesting to watch everytime. He needs more screentime.Thinking back when he demands an apology from Walt that was one example of Walt apologizing to someone he had wrongfully accused. Walt also had to do that with doctor lady in this season. You could probably argue that one of the themes of the show is that Walt or anyone can make incorrect assumptions and maybe this is just another example. It would explain their humanization of Nighthorse just as well so maybe the writers are way ahead of me on this. ,longmire,cuyekmj,9,t5_2u5g0

5627503,0,t3_3s6l5b,Just discovered Longmire on Netflix a few months ago. My husband and I just love it and are only midway through season . The landscape is just gorgeous. I was surprised to learn it is filmed in NM instead of WY. We live in CO currently and watching the show only makes me want to plan a roadtrip to NM!  So happy to learn it has been renewed for season .  Just love the snarky looks Vic doles out when she is annoyed with someone cracks me up every time.  Robert Taylor is perfect as Walt Longmire dude also looks great in a cowboy hat!.  I think overall the casting has been spot on. LDP as Henry is my absolute favorite. Also glad we are seeing more Matthias in Season .  ,longmire,cwun8uy,9,t5_2u5g0
