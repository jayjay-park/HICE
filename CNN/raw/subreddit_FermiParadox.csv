And given our history how we have treated less develop cultures it does not bear well for us humans.You can believe what you want and I believe what I want. The thing is Id like to not regurgitate the same utopian newage hippienonsense since the s over and over again. We are not actually threatened by selfdestruction we dont need a unified mankind to go to space and we wouldnt look at aliens as if they were Gods.There is no such thing as the Prime Directive from Star Trek. The hard truth is just that we are most likely alone. Looking up at the stars and dreaming of aliens is not productive when actually we should be the ancestors of the Lifeforms seeded throughout the Milky Way.,FermiParadox,cw1486m,1,t5_38g9n
