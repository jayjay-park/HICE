6272385,0,t3_40jd3i,Hey all. Im new on Reddit so still working things out....Ive been around RD all my life so Im happy I found this reddit...Anyway favourite place to eat would have to be Mongolie Grill. The food is great but the real gem is the ceasers. They have the best ceasers Ive ever had. Ive been going there for a long long time. EDIT I was told a few years ago that Red Deer has the most restaurants per capita of anywhere else in the world. There certainly is a large number of places to eat at. I wonder if there is any truth to the statement... ,RedDeer,cz2llfq,1,t5_2rscz

6630058,0,t1_czy2j86,Sorry for the late reply... But no I havent even attempted making a map.

And after about  weeks of playing it I lost that spark. ,RedDeer,d053sib,1,t5_2rscz
6808770,0,t3_48yt9a,It all depends if its a simple situation with a T and maybe some RRSP  then you should do it yourself with a software or even a free app on your smartphone I think from TurboTax. In case you got rentals investment income or some other weird things  find a local mid size accounting office that has enough expertise but also doesnt charge arm and a leg like big accounting firms do.  I like Pivotal LLP used to be Heywood Holmes but again it depends if you need a professional advice or just file your one slip from work. ,RedDeer,d0o2jyc,3,t5_2rscz

8588323,0,t1_d6f3nij,Im not at all arguing that certain types of crime are way up. They absolutely are. All Im saying is that of the three primary categories theyre referencing BampE AutoTheft Robbery only Robbery qualify as a violent crime. So to use the other two property crime to paint the city as dangerous is misleading and intentionally so.,RedDeer,d6f4nt0,2,t5_2rscz
8793424,0,t1_d74ovtf, well not sure where to start but Ill try. Almost every time Ive visited my doctor I felt unnecessarily rushed. Every time I try to talk to him about my concerns Im being quickly dismissed and told how based on my age I shouldnt have any of those concerns even though Ive explained to them s of times Im experiencing these symptoms and I would like him to help me in more depth detailed blood work check my hormone levels properly refer me to a specialist and so on. Hes extremely stuck in his ways and has extremely poor knowledge regarding mental health issues resulting in me feeling worse each time I visit with him. Some of the nurses have zero social skills. While I understand that working with people can wear on you you still need to maintain a level of professionalism even empathy  even when you cant help them at the moment. Ive witnessed them being extremely rude snobby and short with patients who are in obvious paindiscomfort and are simply asking why its taking so long to see their doctor. We all know that the appointment times are a joke as Ive never seen my doctor before more than hour has passed my scheduled appointment plus waiting in the exam room for an average of  min.Anyway these are just some and not even the worst complaints that I have about them. ,RedDeer,d74umna,0,t5_2rscz

10511689,0,t3_5qbjnw,Dont sign a contract it voids your ability to negotiate once your promotional offer expires. Just say you want the promotional offer without the contract. I havent been on a contract with them once and just renegotiate everytime the offer ends. It may take some research as to what the competitors will offer you for switching but I am currently getting Telus  for .month.,RedDeer,dczm164,2,t5_2rscz
