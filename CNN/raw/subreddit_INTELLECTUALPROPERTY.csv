Now if you set that same camera up in a subway station and have random pedestrians just come up to it and push the button then each pedestrian would own the picture. Not you.,INTELLECTUALPROPERTY,cjk9adm,1,t5_2qp5u

5391410,0,t1_cw0r11z,Thanks for your comments. Some thoughtsgt You seem to be implying that the Examiner is getting reversed  of the time at the board.No I know that the odds of being reversed at the board are lower but still much higher than they should be.The  metric also includes cases where prosecution is reopened before a board decision  either during preappeal or during briefing. Im counting those as a win for the applicant because the examiner has been forced to change position based solely on the applicants arguments noting that claim amendments are almost never permitted once the notice of appeal is filed.It makes sense to use this  number because it reflects the odds at the applicants critical decision point whether or not to initiate the appeal process. Applicants make that choice only when  the application has been rejected twice  the applicant believes that the examiner is objectively wrong enough to withstand the expensive and lengthy appeal process! and  the applicant doesnt believe that working with the examiner will provide a fair resolution. The fact that applicants are apparently correct  of the time is a rather stark metric.gt As its been described to me by Examiners when given a Clear Error it must be given in writing. Then the Examiner has the opportunity to respond either orally or in writing back to their reviewer the person who gave the error. If they cant convince that person to withdraw the error they may then ask the TC Director to review it.On the one hand this review process is fair  but on the other hand its logistically impossible to apply it to a meaningful slice of the PTOs output.The OPQA has about  employees The USPTO issues . million office actions per year. Theres no way that this cumbersome review process can be applied to anything approximating a statistically significant section of the output. According to last years Office of the Inspector General OIG Report the OPQA only reviews about . of the PTOs output  fewer than one office action per examiner per year.This logistic problem exerts enormous backpressure on the OPQA to  not identify errors  to raise the flag of clear error only in the most egregious cases. And as a result the average quality of office actions degrades to... well a little bit better than clear error. Literally the PTO provides no incentive whatsoever for examiners to do better than that. And accordingly applicants must resort to appeals to overcome bad rejections.,INTELLECTUALPROPERTY,cw0taad,1,t5_2qp5u
