1330775,0,t3_29boxm,Im interested to see the next villain in the series seeing how every one of them is being taken out. Im just thinking about whos left that would actually have interest in reviving the Demon Clan. Maybe Merlin? I think its probably whatever is inside of Dreyfus.We also learned that Merlins apprentice Vivian is the Masked Woman and that for some reason shes been conspiring with Hendricksen to revive the Demon Clan. No idea why shes doing it thought we definitely need some back story on a lot of the Holy Knights weve really just met this arc.,NanatsunoTaizai,cijbv1t,2,t5_2xsk7

They may argue simply because Dreyfus wants to keep his cover or because he isnt fully possessed yet. I think that maybe he was fighting his possession and when Hendrickson killed him Fraudrin was able to fully take over. These are just kind of my speculations though I would actually be interested in figuring out the specifics of his situation though.

Here you have Wolverine surviving an atomic blast. Or a big ass explosion dont know.
