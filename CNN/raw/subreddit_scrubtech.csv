576006,0,t3_20ov5m,It just depends on the hospital I guess but my first thought is that they wouldnt let you. Theres too much risk involved shadowing a sterile environment. Surgeons can allow people because it is their procedure. Nurses usually can let someone sit at their computer or stand near them but surgical techs are completely enclosed in a sterile environment and they would not be able to talk to you or make sure that you arent too close to the field. So while HIPPA is a big part of it they may also be concerned about sterility. It carries a lot of risk for then since they do not know you. ,scrubtech,cg5qvpr,1,t5_2y62u

2422345,0,t3_2mg0k2,When I was new I dropped a breast on the floor trying to hand it off. Not a happy day. The nurse was kind enough to point out that unless it was going for culture contamination wasnt an issue. I was still embarrassed. ,scrubtech,cmb3zdd,2,t5_2y62u

10774298,0,t3_5u4fag,for some odd reason I refuse to believe any of my preceptors told me what call is. In case you dont know which is fine bcuz I obviously didnt most hospitals run . so call is like getting called back into work after your regular shift which can consist overnight. wow being full time amp doing that during training when I jst started was hard. am lap chole converted to open then starting your ap shift no one told me about that while I was in schoolclinicals!! some places require you to take like  shift calls a month but whats cool is that you get paid time amp a half when u get called in then  an hour on stand by have to get there within  min of being called. not too fun if u have kids your weekends can feel short,scrubtech,ddrahlj,2,t5_2y62u
