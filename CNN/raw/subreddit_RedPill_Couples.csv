259816,0,t3_1wzij4,So much of todays media is focused on making men appear stupid lazy  rapist abusers deadbeats etc etc. If we were to boycott or make our voices heard demand movies and tv shows to portray mens best virtues not subscribe to media that shame men perhaps we could start the ball rolling. gt The outrage and fury at the constant denigration of males is growing ever more strident and Its not just men who are angry. Mothers have sons and husbands too.gtWe have to start refusing to accept the lie that all men are pigs. We have to reject all those negative messages about heterosexual men families and marriages etc. Until we free our own minds we cannot free those of our sons.We turn the tv on and watch shows that blatantly shame men and dont seem to stop and think of the damage this might be doing to our subconscious. Since having swallowed the RP I have stopped watching a lot of tvmovies simply because of the behavior shown towards men really pissed me off and disgusted me. Its everywhere and its slipping through our guards the more we indulge in their crap. Much if not all now is specifically designed to brainwash uscommercials especially so I made the decision to stop putting that crap in my brain for the sake of my relationship.Ladies these shows just feed that self entitlement and make it seem ok to railroad your SO without any consequences. Its in your magazines newspapers radio etc so at the very least try to acknowledge this and do what you can to reduce the amount of men shaming media going into your brain so that it doesnt spill onto your daily interactions with him.Men. you too are being affected or should I say infected by this. You are being told and shown over  and over again that you are the slave to woman that you are not the leader or in charge of anything women are. Reduce your exposure to this crap and stand up to your rights. gt The time has come to stand up and say that we will no longer accept those things going on.,RedPill_Couples,cf7ot5c,1,t5_2ysak
