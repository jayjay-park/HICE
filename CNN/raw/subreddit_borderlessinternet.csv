9697894,0,t3_5dshrh,I disagree. The main reason I subscribed is Netflix I feel like it is still a good investment of money since I can occasionally use the foreign Netflix and always benefit from the securityadblocking features.Yes it sucks Netflix doesnt always work but this is due to Netflix it is takes effort to keep Nutflix working.Edit BI doesnt seem interestedinvested anymore in keeping Nutflix working so its game over from an unblocking perspective.,borderlessinternet,da8gzwc,1,t5_3cvzf
