10195501,0,t1_dbzo16h,Thank you so much for the clarification! It helps a lot with trying to figure out what is whatas a lot of information isnt really clear and theres a lot of overlap with some of the symptoms. I get the flushing but my skin will get almost purple splotches on my face so I look extra terrifying. Generally people will give me a wide berth when they see me. This last episode happened at the movie theater and I could feel the head pain and the heat on my skin but didnt really realize how bad everything had gotten until I went to the bathroom. The head pain is pure agony I used to think they were cluster headaches but once they get started around my eye they will then travel slowly up and around my skull and last for a good  hours. Ugh. Last time I also had to deal with vomiting and diarrhea. Like which one goes first. Fun. Thanks for sharing your symptoms. Im grateful to finally know the cause and at least Ive had far fewer episodes this year than last year. ,mastcelldisease,dbzpsiv,2,t5_3547e
