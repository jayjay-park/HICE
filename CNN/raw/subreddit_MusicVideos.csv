667191,0,t1_cgftmd7,Thank you! I really appreciate it.Its from an HBO TV Series called Looking. The reason I created this was mostly just to work on my editing skills to see if it is something I wanted to pursue. I really enjoyed the TV Show and I love Lana Del Rey so I thought I would mix the two together! I used Final Cut Pro and I chose scenes that I felt fit the moodtheme of the music. I really enjoy quick cuts that go with music and so I hope that showed in the project. Thanks again for your kind words!  ,MusicVideos,cgg3xe0,2,t5_2qi5b
