640625,0,t3_20j24x,When there is a situation lets say sleeping arrangements and theres limited space so sharing is necessary and theres always someone who thinks theyre entitled to not having to share space and get it because no one else will fight for fairness. dont get me wrong Im stubborn too but how can you justify keeping something to yourself and making everyone else more miserable because you think youre better than everyone else. rant.,isfp,cgd38n0,3,t5_2r39d
788655,0,t1_cgtrxjm,They are huge on the extremes but you can certainly be a lesser S while having quite a few N traits. The types arent set in stone even remotely. He is certainly an ISFP if he was an INFP I probably wouldnt be able to communicate with him at all but shows some INFP traits as well. He certainly can have his head in the clouds more than most ISFPs and is a bit more on the thinkie side of things than most ISFPs. His job focuses on both number and pattern manipulation as well as design and its the perfect mix for him. If youd like the more proper term than verge he is an ISFP with a highly developed intuition side. ,isfp,cgtx9z8,0,t5_2r39d

5029758,0,t1_cus7o1a,I know. Its hard to explain but even if Ill do things I love and can get my mind off things I quickly sink into lows when Im alone with my thoughts.

5898177,0,t1_cxsj28x,I also used to be an extremely angry person because I always felt like people were out to get me or that I  was being restrainedput in a box.I dont recall what triggered my transformation but I just had enough of being angry. Maybe I just grew up and matured. Maybe my attitude changed and I subconsciously realized it wasnt worth getting worked up over small stuff. I always realized that consciously but could never convince my subconscious.Now I can only think of three times Ive been angry in the last seven years or so. All for perfectly legitimate reasons.I find it fascinating because Ive heard this quite a few times on this subreddit. I dont typically think of ISFPs as hotheaded or angry but it actually seems pretty common but it seems equally common to grow out of it.Edit To OP...Going with what I said above it may have had something to do with being so into my values. I think Ive always been an accepting person but I think part of it may be better understanding people with different values and their motives better. Instead of feeling attacked that they dont respect my values I think I put myself in other peoples shoes more now also leading me to put up with things I sometimes shouldnt.,isfp,cxss9d5,3,t5_2r39d

7685855,0,t3_4kiwo1,I use Facebook pretty regularly mostly just to lurk though. I usually only post something on there if I have something witty to say or have a cool picture. Ive had an Instagram for a little bit now but havent really posted much on there. My issue with the selfie posting thing is that I feel like nobody would really care to see pictures of me and I dont care much to take pictures of myself anyways. Im not super self conscious and Im generally pretty happy with myself but I definitely do have some discomfort with having my picture taken because I just feel weird seeing myself for whatever reason. That is something Im somewhat trying to work on though making a conscious effort to put myself more out there to feel more comfortable with myself. I actually really like Snapchat and use it occasionally to talk to friends. I enjoy looking at their stories and seeing what the people I know are up to. I do tend to have the pattern though of mainly just taking pictures if I have something funny to send. I very rarely post or even comment on Reddit because I feel like I usually dont have anything new to say that someone else hasnt already said. Im sure a lot of us can relate to that feeling. So I mostly lurk on Reddit but Im on here pretty frequently. ,isfp,d3fu1an,4,t5_2r39d

8998663,0,t1_d7tgzgv,gt The way I see it is that if youre going to spend a good portion of the rest of your life doing something you should enjoy it or at least not despise it. Thats exactly how I feel. Sometimes I feel like Ill never be happy with a job unless its something I created. I hate the idea of working so hard for someone else unless it is for a cause or something. I just want to feel like Im in control of my life if that makes sense. Out of curiosity what majors did you jump around with? ,isfp,d7ti05e,1,t5_2r39d

10418938,0,t3_5o50qp,Wow reading this is incredible. My mother and I have a lot of tension I finally lost it and told her she has no sense of self. She took the mbti test and shes an ISFP. Knowing this is common for the type helps and understanding that it comes from empathy makes so much sense in context now. I owe her an apology. ,isfp,dcp1zno,3,t5_2r39d
10449096,0,t1_dcsf7xd,Would you be surprised if I said that I read every single one of the comments? I really dont like leaving anyone without a response most of the time Ill drop at least something like a thanks for your time.You see these SeSi NeNi are always turning up Ne Si but I just dont resonate with them.For INFPs its Se. Im quite hesitant. I have trouble living in the moment. I am often unaware of sensory information in my environment I could not draw you an accurate picture of the house where Ive lived for the past two years. Im relatively unassertive to the point where at times I structure my life to avoid situations where I have to use force  thats just me you have just described my experience with life.ISFPs from what I have heard have Ne as the point of least resistance so different possibilities can be sort of unsettling if Im understanding it properly which your post seems to reflect to me. ISFPs may not enjoy brainstorming or may be unnerved by hypotheticals which have no bearing on reality like what if I were a cat? or what if I drove off that cliff right now? ISFPs are more go with the flow which an INFP tries to do and fails.  this I just wont feel. Cant resonate.Youre also quite succinct and INFPs are usually very longwinded.  here you might be right I notice that as well. Despite all that I keep getting Ne Si. To be honest while making these posts I understood a little thing about myself. Resonating with something is much more important to me than a test result. Im not here for an overriding rule of what I am and what my life looks like I am here to better understand myself and find something that makes me comfortable and calm. I make the choice to forget tests. ,isfp,dcshzgf,1,t5_2r39d
