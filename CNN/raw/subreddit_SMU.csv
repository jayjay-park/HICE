My recommendation would be to leave SMU no matter how many classes you have to retake. Both UTD and UNT have good art programs. You may even consider moving farther away. I suspect your credits from SMU will transfer especially if they know about the reason for the transfer. Best wishes. ,SMU,cezc0rs,2,t5_2rpt9

When it comes time to get summer internships and OCI take jobs at the big firms in SA. Alternatively take an internship in Dallas or Austin and you can always request to move to their SA office later.Some of the Big Law jobs with offices across Texas and specifically in SA            Akin Gump            Jackson Walker            Norton Rose Fulbright            Dykema            Strasburger Price  and a ton of others,SMU,d22wxvh,1,t5_2rpt9

11345016,0,t3_61t3yl,Hey man Ive lived off campus at two different apartments Chase Crossing which is off Royal and Lakeside at NorthPark which is right off Walnut Hill. Im moving into a brand new place called Domain at Midtown next year which seems like a sweet deal. Im a little farther from campus than a lot of students but my commute is never more than  minutes. You can save a lot of money if you get away from the park cities without sacrificing quality of living. ,SMU,dfhxrgw,2,t5_2rpt9
