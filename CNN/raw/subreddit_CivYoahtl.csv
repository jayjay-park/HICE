5385390,0,t1_cvzzpy0,Thanks for this! I was having some trouble keeping everything from last night straight.On the not agreed upon bitsgt Possible knighthood? Waldenherz has a law of knighting in which once you are your town can gain autonomy.Thats Wanders shtick and it makes sense for them seeing as how theyve got a weird sorta pseudomedievalfeudal theme going. Doesnt make much sense in the context of Yoahtls more Mesoamerican tendencies imo. Some form of governmental award might be good though  Qua mentioned earlier how a wakina was similar to a knight talking about how the current wakina arent yet so maybe have that?Were doing a republic more than a feudal aristocracy though. Knighthoods giving autonomy to your personal estates sounds slightly outofplace.gtPretty much everything in judiciary decisions.I would suggest something similar to MAs judges but we start running into population issues again and anyways Ive never been a fan of the Augustan legalitybeforereason mentality. Perhaps letting it be dealt with on a citybycity basis would be good with appeals to the Alcuahtl for retrials?The others I have to give some more thought Ill be back in a bit.,CivYoahtl,cw01lj9,1,t5_3aa8l

6969560,0,t1_d16brbv,I currently see three solutions to this growing and more evident problem. The first solution being we rebuild the current walls to be far larger. This is the probably the least realistic of choices as tearing down the current walls would take far too much work and then rebuilding them even larger would be more tiring. Or we could keep the current walls and add a second even larger wall to the surrounding area.The second solution is to move into the lake. I have already seen some expansion into the water and seeing as the walls arent built in that area it is a possibility. And with the expansion of lakes throughout Gimmel would there truly be any harm in removing one?The third and final solution is to build another city. Yoahtl as a whole is already comprised of a number of cities with different people and different cultures. The addition of another would only benefit us as a whole.Thank you Klasikrok for once again asking a fantastic question.,CivYoahtl,d16c41l,1,t5_3aa8l
