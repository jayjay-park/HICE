Right now chivalry has trouble getting outside viewers because watching the streams can be challenging to keep up with. Dont lose out on the early rise rush of people.  Hopefully I can get into the beta and give better feedback. Wink Wink ,MirageAW,d0wcp0b,3,t5_3cpvy
6921153,0,t1_d10ghmb,As of right now micro transactions are not on our roadmap we have a progression system that will allow you to get a lot of new items and should remain engaging for a very long time were not ready to reveal it just yet but stay tuned.We may do it one day but not for launch nor right after launch and even if we do the progression system will be a lot more rewarding for those that dont want to pay.,MirageAW,d10u4fi,3,t5_3cpvy

8121216,0,t3_4qgs6y,Good Diary.  One thing that Im less enthused about is that the video made it seem as though hitting F automatically makes your character start giving this death speech.  Some of the funniest moments in Chivalry happen when people dont know the F is coming.  When I just stop fighting because I got outskilled aka NEVER and I think the other guy is gonna finish me off but he swings and then explodes in unexpected fashion midswing.  Or timing it so that right before you make a move that will obviously result in your death you explode right before the enemy hits you and gets that The fuck just happened? feeling for half a second.  Those are the moments that people love.What I think would be best is if F killed you perhaps instantly to allow for easier comedic control and then the death speech was a special voice command that also puts you in a kneel that can be interrupted.  This would allow for the largest combination of comedic situations and give the player the most agency to use these.  It would allow for things like. Someone kneeling so the other guy puts his guard down but then the kneeler interupts his kneel and kills the guy.. Someone kneels and explodes halfway during his speech.. All the cool things that you could do before in Chiv when kneeling wasnt an option.. Someone starts kneeling but the nonkneeler in the duel explodes himself before the kneeler can finish his quote.etc. etc.,MirageAW,d4swbj3,6,t5_3cpvy
