And this story is set in an alternate universe during the event Secret Wars so its not entirely in continuity. The trade also includes issue  from the  volume.gt Captain Marvel Captain Marvel Vol.  Rise of Alpha FlightThat is the current volume and the collected edition should be out in august. There are two issues omitted from this list  of volume . Those two are tieins to a larger event happening in the Marvel Universe Infinity. As far as Im aware theyre only collected in trades which also include a bunch of other unrelated tieins. So I think its safe to skip these two issues.,comicreadingorders,d26lzir,3,t5_38hgl
