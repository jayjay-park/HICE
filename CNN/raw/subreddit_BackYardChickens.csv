2098452,0,t3_2ixx2e,What kind of mites? We one had a bad case of these mites that would take up residence in their feet and it made them very scaley The skin on their feet was flaking off. First action was to keep their areas especially clean. Everyday we would remove any feces and cover the floor with wood chipsif available or diamateous earth. For topical treatment we put oil in a spray bottle and sprayed their feet at night. This oil would coat their feet and essentially suffocate the mites. Its a long process but after a month of due diligence we had alleviated the problem. ,BackYardChickens,cl6k5p1,2,t5_2sdri
2110759,0,t3_2j1uyl, . Hens are normally very quiet except when they make the loud Egg Soung....or when they making the Alarm Call. The alarm call sounds like the eggs sound but much louder quicker pronounced and sometimes it sounds like their voice is breaking with fear. . The best breeds for your climate are going to be the Heavy Breeds in particular Brahmas chicken with feathered feet Cochins more feathered feet and fluffy Australorps Orpingtons Icelandic Chantecler Russian Orloff Wyandottes or other breeds with a thick downy coat and tiny combs and wattles. Small combs and wattles are key in climates where frost bite is a danger. a. We would need to know what the average lowest temperatures and what lengths they stay low are.  For example anything lower than  for more than  days per winter warrants that you invest in a very insulated chicken coop with well designed vents to ensure that moisture does not accumulate and cause frost bite and potentially a heat source of some type.A lot of people in bitter cold places build coops right out of their garage essentially having where the chickens roost in a small coop with a doggie door for them to enterexit into the backyard. These people would clean the chicken coop like they would a dog kennel just with a kittylitter scoop and can to filter the manure every  days. I would recommend that you build the coop on the southwestern side of your yard with full sunexposure...if you plan on having a coop. Southwest exposure with no shade throughout the day...it is key in ensuring that the coop warms up it absorbs and retains heat throughout the day.I helped a friend design and build a coop for a a usda zone. They built the coop on the Western side of their yard without any shade from the trees or house on it from sunrise to sundown. I designed the coop to have a black metal shingle roof a high vent on every side of the coop with a vent pipe at the roofs highest point. Here is the neat part!I recommended that he look for used BLACK jugs. He found several white and yellow radiator jugs which he spray painted with a weather resistantproof black paint. I then instructed him to fill all of the jugs full with a little room at the top and cap them tightly. He then stacked all of the jugs neatly and securely against the South Western and Eastern sides. He secured the jugs with a network of black nylon ropes. When the sun hits these jugs it warms the jugs and water within nicely. At sunset this passive solarheating system discharges heat for hours into the walls of the chicken coop providing free safe heat....as long as you have sun. He also utilized my technique using compost heat to warm his chicken run. Right at the beginning of winter he builds a very bioactive compost heap on the floor of his chicken run and alongside the northern wall of the coop.He then covers the compost heap with lots of straw and ensures that the bioactivity remains active by turning the compost pile and tending it with more material making sure it never dried out or got too wet etc. He gets a great deal of free heat that emanates from this compost for at least  days. He often has to build up a new compost pile after that using fresh manure leaves grass clippings hay and straw and ensuring it is damp. You just have to make sure it is well covered with straw to insulate the bioactivity and you have to make sure you turn it a little to make sure it does not get too hot to the point of becoming anaerobic or combustible. If you are looking into using a lightbulb or heater please make sure that your coop is professionally built and you have an electrician install the heat lightsource. The number one source of danger for chickens in the winter after frost bite is fire due to heat source.  . I would recommend that you start with a minimum of  and as high as . Chickens are highly social and  or more is the magic number.  . I am from the US and I do NOT refrigerate my eggs. I simply leave the eggs I want to eat in a clean bowl on my counter out of direct light and in a cool spot. When I gather eggs I simply dust off what stuff I can. If there is poop or otherwise on the egg I either take a damp cloth and gently remove what I can or I scrub a badly soiled egg and give it a light coat of mineral oil. For extra eggs I coat clean eggs in a light coat of mineral oil and store in a dark and cool pantry. I wash dirty eggs coat in mineral oil and store the same. This form of storage with monthly turningyour eggs can last for up to  months....without refrigeration. Yes I have tested this. The key with fresh eggs is to not wash them if they do not need it. All eggs are laid with what is called the bloom. It is a natural layer of protection that preserves the egg easily for up to  days without refrigeration. You simply have to make sure you do not have wild temperature swings or direct sunlight.   .  Cleaning coops depends on how often they get dirty. Chickens that do not spend a lot of time in them due to lots of room to range often have cleaner coops. It also depends on size of coop vs how many chickens. I would say clean the coop as needed. About  days you can remove the top thin layer of litter and the poop and add several handfulls of pine litter. . I grow the majority of my feed growing Amaranth fartichokes buckwheat etc. For people needing feed you can estimate how much you need by calculating that each hen will need at least  cup of feed per day and a handful of scratch to help supplement calories for body heat. I do not know how much your local feed shops charge but my feed ranges from  per bag of quality layer pellets or protein crumble.  . I cannot stress enough that you need very good ventilation for your coop. If you have a good idea of how the winds blow you can cut and install vents on those sides of the coop. Make them high enough that they are above the chickens heads at night. You then want to ensure you have a vent pipe installed in the top of the coop. This ensures that when air enters the coop from the vents on the side of the coop it escapes out the ventpipe carrying moisture laden air with it. This will prevent deadly frostbite. Make sure you invest in predatorproofing the chicken coop and runhardware cloth not chicken wire and look into a good water dispenser that either has passive heat or a heating feature for the winter. You would be surprised how difficult it is to knock empty a water dispenser frozen solid and refill it in freezing cold temperatures. I actually have winter waterdispensers chicken water dispensers that I handpainted black with safe paint. The black surface causes the sun to heat the water dispensers up nicely which gives the chickens notcold water. It also helps prevent icing of the dispensers ,BackYardChickens,cl84f0n,0,t5_2sdri

2562339,0,t3_2p1gkp,If the intestines are hanging out the best thing you can do for the chick is to put it out of its misery. You can either quickly cut its head off with scissors or use the CO baking sodavinegar method to make a sort of gas chamber. Start with an airtight container It absolutely MUST be airtight!! and put another smaller container down inside of it leaving enough room so that the chick and the smaller container will both fit sidebyside inside of the larger container. Picture of the Setup Here NSFW Place the chick inside and then add an ample amount of baking soda into the smaller container. Pour some vinegar slowly into the baking soda container careful to not let it overflow and then QUICKLY close the lid to minimize the amount of CO that escapes the container. Then walk away. Dont stay and watch. The chick will gasp for air. However they usually pass within a couple of minutes.When I had humidity issues with my previous incubator I had a couple of horrible hatches where I had to euthanize quite a few chicks for deformities.  I couldnt bring myself to use scissors but this method made it slightly more bearable.,BackYardChickens,cmt1aau,2,t5_2sdri

A big recommendation I have which prevents chickens from scratching the crops down to the roots.....is placing a chicken frame over the crops. It it like placing a door frame with chicken wire or hardware cloth over the plants and whatever grows through it mowed by the flock.This allows your crop to regenerate much faster as well as allowing the chickens to graze in a particular area for much longer due to the plants not being scratched and pecked into oblivion.  ,BackYardChickens,cnxvxh3,1,t5_2sdri

3528760,0,t1_cpu6lom,They may not probably wont even but I can tell you from experience that its much cheaper to block it off in the first place than to pay for unexpected damages. Id be particularly concerned about the lines running from the unit to your wall. If there is any insulation on them I think I see some theyll remove that for you and possibly eat it. They will definitely scratch around the units and may kick dirt into the lower parts. They will peck at shiny surfaces and any insects that happen to land on it. Although the airflow out of the top may scare them off they also may take advantage of times when the unit is off to sit atop it and poop into it. Also it looks like the slab the visible unit is sitting on is hanging out over the dirt line on the side away from the house. The birds will definitely dig under there and use it as a dust bath. If the slab is not fully stable they will erode even more of the foundation and this could be a huge problem. My parents dog hiking his leg on their unit eventually killed it so they ended up spending over  to replace it because they never got around to putting up the  tpost and chicken wire fence that they had talked about.,BackYardChickens,cpui40u,1,t5_2sdri
3559358,0,t1_cpxsvv5,It sounds to me like they got too hot. Chicks with too much heat on them will drink more and eat less and often die of heat exhaustion which could somewhat mirror respiratory distress or starvation. Any weaker chicks would be more susceptible which is why it might not have affected all of them.  Keep an eye on the formation of chicks in the brooder. At the perfect temp they will roam around the entire length. If its too hot they will crowd around the end far away from the heat source if its too cold theyll stay cuddled under it and wont venture far out. Put your heat lamp at the far end of the brooder to give them a range of temps to choose from.  Also Ive had lots of luck with nipple watering systems. I introduced them at  days old and they took to it wonderfully. You dont have to worry about drowning and it stays clean!,BackYardChickens,cpxzpuk,4,t5_2sdri

4622626,0,t1_ctcimxl,You sir have won this bet. Double OmNom So if you live in my area Ill give you eggs! Alternatively I have some extra chicken nipples i could send!,BackYardChickens,ctd98xn,4,t5_2sdri
4646781,0,t1_ctfxa6o,tldr Yes thats what Im saying. She can sometimes become a poormans rooster and rarely even sire chicks.Bear with me if you will and consider first what were more familiar with Us sweaty furry mammals. You know how humans are said to be anatomically female? That is men still have not just nipples but fully functioning mammary glands that are capable of lactation testes that develop from the same structure that would otherwise become ovaries in women the glans closely resembles an enlarged clitoris and the same tissue that would become labia in women forms the skin of the scrotal sack in men. Have a close look at your nearest scrotum and you might even notice a subtle seam running down the centre. Whats that for? A zip!? Nope its a cleft that would become literally an invagination in a girl embryo and ultimately a vagina.All of that is possible because almost all of our body plan is encoded by a single X chromosome in each cell along with the other  chromosome pairs in the rest of our DNA. The Y chromosome is very small and doesnt do much by comparison except act as a hormonal switch.The presence of a Y chromosome in a normal male changes the hormone ratios that are expressed in utero and in the born baby and makes men susceptible to those hormones causing those same structures to become manparts form an adams apple etc. In other words the rest of your DNA codes for what makes you human and the Y chromosome basically just functions as a hormonal switch but it doesnt actually code for any of the body plan.By way of illustration of just how unnecessary that second chromosome either X or Y is theres a disease called Turners Syndrome that occurs in  in  girls where theyre born with only a single X chromosome. No second X to keep it company no Y chromosome at all. Similarly theres a mutation called Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome where an otherwise normal XY baby is born with a sort of immunity to masculine hormones. These are genetically male people who grow up to appear outwardly female. Theyre producing male hormones and even have partially developed testes where the ovaries would be but theyre not susceptible to the hormones that would effect male development. Theres an awful episode of House featuring this one. They dont appear like Turners Syndrome girls do because the Y chromosome is still doing some work for male structures and clearly the androgens are still having some effects which prevent worse physical deformities. But no amount of hormonal treatment will allow an XY person to form a uterus ovaries nor carry a child. Now lets consider reptiles and our feathered dinosaur friends. They can pull this sexchange trick due to two major differences between them and us mammals. First rather than X and Y sex chromosomes they carry W and Z. The Z has your basic chicken body plan and the W acts as the hormonal switch. But rather than WZ being their males WZ codes for their females and ZZ codes for male. Remember though that one of the sex chromosomes in the ZZ male is largely dormant. A single Z chromosome is doing most of the work. This means a hen is actually carrying almost everything she needs to be a male already.Now I already said that an XY male human can never become fully female and pregnant no matter how much hormone treatment you give him. Why are birds different? Because of an adaptation they developed long ago. Actually if memory serves its arisen more than once in reptiles. Most snakes some lizards and all birds have an atrophied nonfunctional right ovary or testis. Its present but shrivelled and doesnt really do much. In birds this is generally interpreted as a weightsaving measure that became useful not long after their scales mutated into feathers allowing easier flight. In snakes it just helps them be skinny. Some snakes similarly have a shrivelled lung on one side too. I suspect the vestigial ovary came long before and its usefulness for flight simply took advantage of the existing trait rather than the trait arising to enable flight but thats another discussion entirely.That shrunken ovary is a little bit like male nipples or everyones appendix. It could work but its not needed so if theres some mutation with it it rarely has any deleterious outcome for the carrier since it wont affect survival. If youll forgive the phrasing this is something of a playground for evolution since chance can experiment randomly without drastically hurting the chances that the mutation will be passed on. And it turns out one of the mutations that can occur is that a female chicken which still has a single male Z chromosome is producing some male hormones which can cause that shrivelled ovary to develop some of the spermforming cells. Its a little bit ovary a little bit testis and in affected birds is consequently referred to as an ovitestis.Most of the time shes got a rooster in her business which keeps her hormones normal and her laying. If he gets himself eaten while valiantly fighting a fox while the flock escapes though the sudden loss of his male hormones will tend to cause the dominant hen to start acting more roosterly. You might argue that this can occur in allfemale human households too. In extreme cases and where she possesses an ovitestis rather than a vestigial ovary the sudden shift in hormones can cause a cyst on the functional left ovary to flare up or cause one or some other disease damages the left ovary. Now shes lost the main source of her female hormones is in an environment which is encouraging her to be more male anyway and she has that ovitesis producing sperm and male hormones. She becomes a poor excuse for a rooster. Male and female reptiles and birds have much more similar reproductive structures ignoring ducks for now because theyre freakin weirdoes so theres no actual barrier to the naughty bits fitting like there would be in mammals. Cloaca to cloaca rubbing happens sperm is transferred and one of her girlfriends lays a fertile egg. In finding sources for this I didnt read how much more likely if at all that fertile egg is to hatch a male but my guess is that its a lot. This set of circumstances requires a lot of lucky coincidences but theyre obviously common enough to apparently have helped important populations survive and get a man back in the house to carry on.,BackYardChickens,ctgah4n,14,t5_2sdri

6593617,0,t1_d0181o6,All Frontline is the same dosage strength. I routinely buy Frontline for large dogs NOT Frotline plus plain fipronil. Frontline plus has an insect growth regulator that I dont know if its safe for chickens or not and dose all my cats and dogs with it since its more cost effective. All the vials are the same strength and the same cost but the large dog has more medicine in each vial so you can break it down into size appropriate dosages for your animals using a syringe.I found mixed reports on Frontline safety for chickens but one of the Serama Facebook groups I participate recommended it. I used a very very small amount  like  drops  on my tiny hens neck skin. Throwing away her eggs wasnt a concern since she wasnt laying at the time but now that she is Im saving them all for hatching anyway. I wouldnt eat the eggs for quite a while if you decide to use it its more of a treatment for pet birds.

I say use the fan because those superglues can put out some HARSH fumes and birds have very very sensitive respiratory systems. Otherwise you might go outside to find shes passed out on the lawn. If you dont address the problem now shell start inhaling whipped cream cans and then computer dusters and you know what they say junkies push junk.

All the roost bars are in the shielded area with room to walk underneath.Any poop that falls on the ground becomes part of the deep litter. I scrape poop on ramps and roost bars though and toss that directly into compost.To keep the litter healthy just sprinkle garden lime if it ever gets damp. I keep a sack of Sweet PDZ around just in case of an extended rainy spell.Whenever I have fresh loads of leaves or grass clippings I remove some of the old chicken litter then and mix in the new stuff.

Just a few minutes ago one of our smallest chicks had a mucusy poop that when examined had a good chunk of red in it.  Pretty much matches the picture for coccidiosis exactly.  Just put in a  teaspoon of Corrid into a gallon of water.  Hopefully that will take care of it and we wont lose the smallest one as well.Doing some reading on it coccidiosis in chicks as young as we have is rare but not unheard of.

There are so many worse things the industry does and the instant crushing of male chicks is not as bad as how they slaughter pigs turkeys meat birds etc.Its startling to see the first time but if youve ever slammed your hand or finger in a door youd know the pain comes after blood flow returns. These chicks are usually under a day old. Their bones are soft and they die in microseconds. There is no pain or realization that they ever existed at all. They arent thrown away either. Read your pet food bag. Chicken meal literally ground up chicks. There is no way to save roosters. Fact of the matter is they are mostly useless to the industry and even many backyard farmers!

11085653,0,t3_5vvy5y,New chicken keeper with a question Or a few regarding hawks here. A hawk early this week has killed one of our ladies in our yard ate the head then left the yard as I came outside to check up on the chickens. This hawk is really ballsy as it would let me get within  meters of it before moving to another part of the yard to see if it could get to the corpse or another chicken and didnt leave our yard for real until I got a pellet gun and shot at it probably missing. My family and I immediately locked them up and built a closed pen around the front of their coop. Every morning and afternoon since the same hawk is spotted sitting on the fence to our chicken enclosure or in a tree within our yard watching the coop. It leaves when we walk into the yard for now.I know a territorial predator that avoids livestock is thousands times more useful than an empty spot in our ecosystem waiting to be filled so how do I give the bird a good spanking to know that my babies are off limits without causing injury to the bird? After shooting some cardboard and having the pellet go through it I am concerned that it might injure the hawk rather than harass it should I ever manage to land a hit. Would this be a likely case? Unfortunately the pellet gun was the only thing that scared off the hawk since it wouldnt leave even after being chased down and yelled at repeatedly. I am considering investing in a lower powered pellet gun like an airsoft rifle with plastic BBs but wanted to know what you guys thoughtuse for extremely persistent predators.PS I dont plan on shooting the hawk on site with pellets ever this is my last alternative option should a predator once again refuse to leave my yard just because Im chasing it.,BackYardChickens,deojru3,1,t5_2sdri

11295042,0,t3_6125x9,Clean with water and hydrogen peroxide apply Neosporin. It will heal fine.Honestly that looks very very similar to a handful of injuries Ive seen caused by cockbirds in the past and I cant say there many other things that can cause wounds on both sides like that. Its definitely the right placement and size for a rooster injury. With that said I agree it would be pretty weird for a bantam to cause that unless he had very large spurs or was very aggressive. I suppose it could be a predator but Ive never seen any predator wounds like that so I cant say which sort.,BackYardChickens,dfc9yyh,2,t5_2sdri

11538356,0,t1_dg3ot4y,Thanks for the comment and your experience. We can charge dozen pretty easily here and our girls dont go through as much feed as yours do it seems like. Maybe because were in a warmer climate and theres more foraging to be had year around but weve gone through time when I buy  lb bag for a month or so.I guess well see how it goes. Were doing it more for the love of it too Oh and the chicken poop.... we had the  girls get in our house on a nice keep the doors open day. That was a mess.,BackYardChickens,dg3vi9h,2,t5_2sdri

11592269,0,t1_dg9ag1d,Raccoons are incredibly territorial. This means that theres only one raccoon with the coop in its territory at any given time. The most effective raccoon strategy is to frustrate that one raccoon by having a completely secure coop then let it keep all the other raccoons out of its territory.Youll probably have to kill this one since its already tasted blood but a kill all the raccoons strategy is just going to keep continuous waves of interested raccoons flowing into your yard as they move into the empty territory.,BackYardChickens,dg9zpyb,3,t5_2sdri

11692102,0,t3_66scf7,Absolutely it will. Looks like you have a window for ventilation so thats a good start. Put up some perches and nesting boxes and youll be set. It looks easy enough to clean provided you use a good bedding I like pine shavings. I have a similar layout. I ran perches along the top and have one wall dedicated to nesting boxes.,BackYardChickens,dglbgfl,2,t5_2sdri
