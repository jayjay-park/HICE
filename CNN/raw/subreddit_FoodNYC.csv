5151369,0,t1_cv6webs,Agreed. If youre going to buy a  wine and not want to pay the  tip perhaps you should just spring for the less expensive wine. Regardless Im with you on the reasoning that it doesnt make sense to tip so much.  But as pitiful as it sounds Im not going to be that guy who doesnt tip on wine when everyone else does. ,FoodNYC,cv6xlfn,3,t5_32xtn

11176625,0,t3_5zf59l,Howdy! Having a wedding in July this year and opted to get the wafels amp dinges truck.  Our venue is in BK gowanus and the dinges team quoted me a bit over  for .hrs of serving time for ppl.  This includes unlimited wafels toppings and ice cream.  Ive always been a fan of the wafel truck and I know theyre a guaranteed crowd pleaser.  Other options I looked at were CoolHaus truck Van Leeuen  and Big Gay.  The other options didnt have as attractive pricing or brand recognition so we went with WampD.  LMK if you have any questions as our wedding is going full food trucks for catering  ,FoodNYC,deyuw76,3,t5_32xtn
