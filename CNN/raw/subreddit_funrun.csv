3604449,0,t3_31iipk,Ive thought about how they can enhance this.  You know the notification has a Play button on the left.  What about another button on the right that shows ignore and when you press it it sends a notification to the person who sent you one saying not interested or something of the like.,funrun,cq34srs,2,t5_2tx4r

7434778,0,t3_4h0s8s,If you dont want to buy all the cheap stuff then dont. I didnt buy the cheap stuff for a really long time. I just saved up for stuff I really wanted and opened my boxes as they came. I started buying cheap stuff after I had an avatar that looked the way I like.  I dont save my boxes though. Now whenever I get one I buy as many items as I can first and then open my box so I have the best possible chance of getting something good. ,funrun,d2nac3m,3,t5_2tx4r

10398546,0,t1_dcmg8nk,Yea lack of coins is super frustrating...even worse for a player like me who wants to play a lot of games quickly so I like to leave the game after I cross the finish line...but if I do so then I cant open any reward chests  I wish they would just give the gold to us automatically instead of having to open those chests. Ive just come to terms with that I just wont have any gold uniaobu,funrun,dcmqpih,1,t5_2tx4r
