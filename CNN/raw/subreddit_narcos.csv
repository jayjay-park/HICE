I thought this is exactly how I felt at the end of breaking bad. The show makes you fall in love with the villian but you have to remind yourself of the awful things he did. I was sad when they showed Tata crying. Then I remembered the thousands of wives parents children etc who cried for the own loved ones who were killed at the hands of Pablo. I didnt feel bad for Pablo. I only felt bad for his family and their loss because they now share that pain. Its easy to get caught up in the show but Pablo was a truly evil person even if he was good to those closest to him. I felt it was appropriate to show the real footage of his bombings etc after he was killed. It was a nice reminder.,narcos,d7uqhyo,1,t5_2xopf
