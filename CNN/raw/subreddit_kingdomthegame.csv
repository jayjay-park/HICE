5454517,0,t3_3prau9,There is actually an artificial time limit. If you dont destroy the portals by day  Its basically impossible to win and by day  it is impossible with how many mobs the portals spawn when they are attacked.,kingdomthegame,cw8v7bl,1,t5_3af97

5484827,0,t1_cwcqabn,Thanks for the imgur tip i edited my post I just did my GIFs a few minutes ago and i was playing on the new patch . Assigning archer to locations would be great like you place a flag on the floor and  archer will stack up here Or another solution would be to let us create horns allowing us to call all archer around to follow us for a few seconds or so at a price of some golds.. We should be able to upgrade shops too to let us buy more than  bows it will keep us from having to go back to the base to buy bows every  mens after a big attack,kingdomthegame,cwcqkev,1,t5_3af97

8605341,0,t3_4xp0nw,Yeah and its extremely annoying when youre trying to expand but you cantt because theres ONE tree that everyone just ignores. ALSO after having them build something outside of the walls they just stand there waiting to get attacked!,kingdomthegame,d6h9g6c,1,t5_3af97

8773981,0,t3_508drt,I just started playing and actually felt quite good after the first two or three islands because I had destroyed all portals on the map before setting sail.So I thought I left each island as a peaceful town free to prosper and expand to their liking. Until I learned that the portal eventually regenerates... welp off to the next island!,kingdomthegame,d72ex9i,3,t5_3af97
