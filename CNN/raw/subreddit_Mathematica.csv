985544,0,t3_25bfc1,Preamble I realize this is your final for some class and I have probably helped more than I should have. You really need to improve your coding skills and use of Mathematicas Documentation and take advantage of office hours before you post a question like this on an online forum. Regardless I hope this is helpful to you in learning something.Alright this is gonna take a while your code reads like a... well lets just say it leaves much to be desired so Ill go line by linegtSubscriptU r  Piecewise   r r lt   r gt I prefer using a Which functionpiecewise might be the cause of the nonrectangular tensor error and use SetDelayed vs . By using SetDelayed we will postpone solving for ur until later. I have changed your variable names for my own convenience. Make sure to include underscores when you are defining your function i.e. ur  vs urgtur  Whichr lt     r  r gt  gtjm n  BesselJZerom n gtkn  j n gtSubscriptJ   BesselJ kn rI have altered these  lines into  I removed the first instance of j because it was not necessary. I have included N to evaluate kn numerically. fnnN is equivalent to Nfnn if you are curious. Using N is vital since we are only passing integers to k these integers come from the summation and we want k to return a number instead of some unevaluated Bessel function.gtkn  BesselJZero n  Ngtjn  r   BesselJ r kngtAn  IP SubscriptJ  SubscriptU IPSubscriptJ  SubscriptJ IP is not a function in mathematica you need to express these as integrals. You have also neglected to include r in your integrals which is bolded in Step  on your assignment. I have included the B integral but it will drop out at t because of the argument of the sin function I will discuss this later.gtAn   Integrater jn r ur r     Integrater jn r jn r r  gtBn   Integrater jn r ur r     Integrater jn r jn r r  gtuSolnM r t    SumAn Coskn t SubscriptJ  n  M gtur t  uSoln r tI dislike the formatting of this function and have doen it in my own way fyi I have hardcoded M instead of making a fn of M. This doesnt really matter though and I could have easily done it in another manner.We see that Sinkn t Sin at t. But will not  if t. I dont really know if this matters this is more of a math question.gtur  t   SumAn Coskn t  Bn Sinkn t jn r n  gtRevolutionPlotDur  r   PlotRange gt  Dat plot range is pretty narrow...gtRevolutionPlotDur  r   PlotRange gt  ,Mathematica,chgbbi1,2,t5_2r6uw
1492691,0,t1_cj3cvfc,Well Maxima is slow and sage only works as a virtual OS with linux. Matlab is actually my most comfortable platform for computations. I have to use a symbolic software for theoretical physics project I am currently a part of in my research centre. Ill have to do things like plotting fields special functions with approximation methods quantum computations and things like that. They do not involve numbers but are hectic symbolic mathematics. ,Mathematica,cj3dthj,1,t5_2r6uw

2564238,0,t1_cmta3qn,OP said the dependent variable is LifeExp. Then OP listed six independent variables Expend MalHeight MalWeight HIV Vacc Primary. But it seems like OP forgot to count Year as an additional seventh independent variable. This seems to me to account for all the variables. ,Mathematica,cmta8ga,1,t5_2r6uw
