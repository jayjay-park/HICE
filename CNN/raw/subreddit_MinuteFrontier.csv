6461412,0,t1_czmqksb,Speed is a huge factor in every build but for world  generally speaking if you hit a wall in the km area you want to check speed and then check passives.  Youll want to have the animationimpactbonus for the weapon you prefer plus either INT or POW.  Finally look at things like Priest Vampire and Monk which provide passive healing.  If you post your statsbuild goals we can try to help more,MinuteFrontier,cznnj1z,1,t5_3bo33

8684515,0,t3_4yn2du,Youd be missing out not to this is my favorite by far.  Ive gained about  levels while watching the Rio olympics.. now that theyre over with I might taper off.Long story short its not terribly difficult to catch up.  Plus theres probably more updates coming since we cant currently max out some passive skills.,MinuteFrontier,d6r6uz4,1,t5_3bo33
