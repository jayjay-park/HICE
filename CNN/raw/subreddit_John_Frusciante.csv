654392,0,t1_cgaagc3,Amigo I like you struggled to understand the popular or perhaps infamy of this album and stuck to his later works for a long time. I finally realised that this music is not intended to be background music but actively listened to. This Find a couple of hours to sit back relax and really listen to it. I doubt it will become your favourite album but it is worthy of the time to get familiar with where his head is at this juncture of his career. P.S. Remember how young and  its kinda handsome he is in relation to these songs  especially My Smile is a Rifle and Pussy Glued to a Building on Fire. ,John_Frusciante,cgenk7g,1,t5_2tqu0

3405953,0,t3_2z83ns,If we pretend Red Hot Chili Peppers are not my favouritend most favourite band then it is ONE OK ROCK for me. Theyre a jrock band singing mostly in Japanese however they also incorporate a lot of English in between the Japanese particularly in their later work.The most accessible song for a newcomer would probably be their arguably biggest hit The Beginning at least internationally Id assume. Their music is absolutely fantastic to me and I have a lot of favourite songs which is what makes them my favourite band after RHCP. For an idea of my favourite songs by ONE OK ROCK it would probably be Yume Yume C.h.a.o.s.m.y.t.h. and Yokubou ni Michita Seinendan however I still have around  other songs contending as my favourite ONE OK ROCK song.

6094563,0,t1_cyi8the,Niandra Lades was recorded on a Portastudio as was WuTang Clans debut album and Bruce Springsteens Nebraska. Those are classic great sounding records.As far as TRWFOTD the Yamaha was top of the line at that time.  Theyre obviously not what we would consider to be hifi or professionally quality but theyre great sounding recordings that benefit tremendously from listening through a great stereo system.They are home recordings but theyre amazing home recordings. There are so many records made in professional studios that suffer from some expectation provided by culture and using the best technology. Most modern technology hasnt surpassed the analog gear of the s and s in terms of sonic quality IMO. They dont sound as good as they should or can. And I think since alot of musicians are taking recording into their own hands we can see how Johns recordings are superior to alot of modern bands doing their own home recording and theres a huge difference in the result.,John_Frusciante,cyie0la,2,t5_2tqu0
