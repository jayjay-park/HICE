1655735,0,t3_2db16a,I usually dont take of fence to off handed comments either. A good mental health joke is actually pretty funny especially if they are pretty accurate. My dad tends to think that I have my panties in a twist because something that aired on the radio seriously upset me to the point I was angry crying as I drove to pick my mother up.I have OCD. Properly diagnosed OCD. Take pills and battle with every day life OCD. Yeah it irritates me when some one says Im so OCD about.. But I shrug that off. So normally I dont get in a dither about things. So when I do get upset about it I feel it should be respected by my family.So what was happening was I was driving my moms car because I am crashing with them before my brothers wedding and needed to run some errands. I was on my way to pick her up to go to her personal trainer when that Sam Smith song was playing. After the song the on air personality did that normal about the artist chit chat. And she says Sam Smith has been open about his battle with OCD. Well when his next album drops that money should fix itI was absolutely livid and hurt that she could be so flippant about it. Like money changes the chemical airings in our heads and magically fixes mental illnesses or anything deemed lesser. I get so pissed thinking about it still. My dad made fun of me for calling and writing into the station to complain about it. But the Vice President of the station felt I had a valid complaint! I just bothers me that people can be so flippant about it then get pissed at you when you actually get offended like YOU are overly sensitive and not that they were WAY out of line.It doesnt help that my dad makes fun of some of my compulsions. I honestly cant wait to be home to my husband so that I dont have to try to bite it back when it get upset when I cant complete my rituals. I hate being told to just get over it when I start having a meltdown like them saying snap out of it! Magically makes my head go oh you are right! Let me just become rational for ya! Instead of sending me into a darker place because I cant just calm down and I cant just snap out of it. So I kinda get where you are coming from. Only you know mental illness instead of sexual identity. And I just joined your rant... To rant about two separate things... I am sorry I hijacked this...,JustAPaddy,cjnvab2,6,t5_31z6h
