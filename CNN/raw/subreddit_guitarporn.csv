I was the first Fender guitar to feature the now familiar Fender headstock. Leo Fender visited bandstands in  with the guitar to show it to professional musicians and get their feedback. This prototype has a hand cut pine body with hollow chambers to approximate a hollow body guitar.However when the guitar went into production Fender decided to manufacure it with a solid body. He also changed the pickguard and control assembly. In the  years since the Telecaster made its debut it has become one of the most popular electric guitars of all time.,guitarporn,cu51v9f,3,t5_2sft5

A good way to get an idea is look around the internet for gimmies like yours to see the badges pick up discoloration on any plastic bits and bindings.

8861717,0,t1_d7cyogy,Considering my pathetic woodworking skills that is EXACTLY why I chose a strat... lol.Ok ok here is the real story... Back in the s when I was a long hair thrasher dude... I had this Kramer that I loved... When I got it it had a crappy stock trem. So I saved up and got a Floyd Rose. I then took it to my local guitar shoppe notice the extra pe in the end because its fancy and paid a kings ransom to have it installed.Long story short the ... luthier ... completely Fcked it up. He drilled the posts too close to the pickup cavity and the first time I divebombed the trem BANGKRUNG!... The posts for the trem broke through and ruined the axe.I took it to my woodshop teacher the one that always looked a little stoned but was awesome with wood... you know the guy although a valiant effort the repair could not hold up and I was forever cursed with a super high action GodawfulIntonation guitar... Being a longhaired thrasher type dude with a long haired thrasher dude type job I could never seem to afford a new axe. I always seemed to be spending my money on ... uh ... other pursuits. So fast forward  years. Post military marriage kids etc... My son and I were going through the garage and I pulled out the pieces of that old Kramer... Great neck... perfect actually but over the years I had repainted it thrashed it taken it apart and most of the parts scattered to the wind but the body with that accursed bridge floated to the top of the schism that is my garage...My kid looks at it and says Woah cool dad look at this relic of the s. Did you play? so I told him a bit about my sordid past... He replies Cool you should fix this thing...Well one thing led to another and a year and a half later I am writing this post.,guitarporn,d7d1xw4,3,t5_2sft5

I need to start planning my build now  woods shape etc. Sounds like a hobby I would enjoy and also hate from time to time gt I already have some rasps which I used to make a forearm and belly contour on my tele build. I have several of the other tools as well so Im not far off which is very encouraging. Thanks again and I look forward to seeing any future builds you might have.I went home yesterday and looked at my bench and here are a few other goodies you should have you can pick them up piece by piece as timemoney permit... slotted straight edge for making sure the fretboard is level and adjusting the truss Fret Rocker Radius guage Fret Crowning FileSeveral six packs fine beer I recommend Hoegaarden or Killians RedBandaids.Many clamps...

8951796,0,t1_d7nhfmu,Absolutely. Say you knew you wanted a s Gibson Les Paul Classic. We have two of them that you could shoot out back to back. The  is cleaner and has a TP tailpiece but the  has more balls. That goes for a lot of the stuff we have other similar guitars you can play against.,guitarporn,d7nvfa7,2,t5_2sft5
9469333,0,t1_d9g8x1n,That sounds badass!I havent even seen my Ibanez in  years its  miles away but in good company tucked in its case next to a  Martin D  ESTDC and a few others along a corner of my Dads dining room.,guitarporn,d9gaues,1,t5_2sft5
9563666,0,t1_d9rw13h,I have it setup so that the TS feeds into the Morning Glory. Volume about  drive around  tone around  and the toggle switch all the way down. Works as a great progressive break up with changes in your attack and volume knob! I also keep a clean boost in front of it for single coils and an  mod TS after it that pairs really well with the double barrells TS side!I saw that you could adjust the volume is that only when the unit is on or at all times? My problem was that i use the spring verb in my fender and didnt have the flint on all the time. Sounded awesome! But i couldnt get over that slight drop. ,guitarporn,d9rx1qf,2,t5_2sft5
