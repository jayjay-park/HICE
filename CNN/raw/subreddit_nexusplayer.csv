4613843,0,t1_ct02mm8,Happens to me as well at the start of episodes or in the middle of them. Driving me insane.... Love this thing but if google doesnt start to actually develop it I might as well throw it in the garbage and just build a cheap pc to hook to the TV.. ,nexusplayer,ctc5lka,1,t5_341jx

5430926,0,t1_cw5s3rz,Yes but thats the easy part.  The problem is how to prevent the Nexus Player from updating to . again.  Unfortunately this is automatic and there doesnt appear to be a way to turn the update off.  I was thinking maybe block it at the firewall level but I havent had time to flash and test...The code name for Nexus Player is fugu and .. image with flash instructions can be found here,nexusplayer,cw5uu13,1,t5_341jx

5453691,0,t3_3pp7hf,The nexus player supports HDMI cec so it will work if you turn it on your TV.You will be able to use your TV remote after setting it up.My older LG didnt support it so I bought a flirc.

6059494,0,t3_3ye6wt,You need to tweak Kodis cache settings. Theres more pre buffering but only a couple of movies have minor stuttering.  I forgot the settings but do a search on this sub. Whats moonlight?Regarding your pi. Electronics are confusing. My  year old Briteview set top box is still my go to when Im trying to play media that my np cant handle.

6106310,0,t1_cyjq1bn,I havent felt the Roku remotes so I cant really say. I do know that when the Nexus Player was first released the cheap feeling of the remote was a concern. But like I said Ive used my NP for a little over a year and very frequently the remote has not deteriorated at all. ,nexusplayer,cyjq44e,3,t5_341jx

9335186,0,t1_d8z7yl3,The NP comes with the remote.  As for your other question are you invested in Amazon content?  If not the NP would be the better choice imo.  Or the Xiaomi Mi Box.  Same price and it comes with a bunch of free stuff right now.,nexusplayer,d8zax66,2,t5_341jx
9339263,0,t1_d8zt5xz,Hmm yeh my server is just my laptop which is also running windows . I may just try using my android phone to cast plex and see if that makes a difference. It could just be the iPhone app playing up.,nexusplayer,d8ztimz,1,t5_341jx
9452321,0,t3_5a2q5z,Borrowed the Xbox one tuner from my roommates xbox one. Searching for over the air channels with antenna and displaying channel info worked well. Had an option to scan for cable channels but no idea how well that would work. You get the grid lineup on the nexus player and have the UI shown for recording. Some shows even have artwork like dateline displaying the shows logo. I got an error when recording telling me I needed to attach a storage of at least gb to record shows. Understandable considering only gb of onboard storage. I was able to pause fast forward and remind live TV. Will have to get a  or gb flash drive and an Xbox tuner myself along with a hub and do more experimenting. As others have said if there was a Google or Nvidia K Bluray player with tuner more onboard storage and the Android TV OS it would be super compelling ever since Microsoft killed off Windows Media Center. Google would need to add IR blaster support to slave most cable and satellite TV boxes but i could see a compelling alternative to xbox gaming and Tivo dvr . The thing that would throw it over the top would be sling style sending live TV over the Internet to your Android phone or tablet. ,nexusplayer,d9e5ctb,2,t5_341jx

10616864,0,t3_5rk247,Everything is great with mine but the audio search feature has barely worked since about my first month. Thats been a real bummer. Maybe I just have a bad remote though. Does anyone else have issues?,nexusplayer,ddb1s5v,1,t5_341jx

I have children and they both have tablets my wife uses a chromebook we use a tablet exclusively for Internet radio I have a tablet and my phones on wifi at home and I stay home. I also only have mb speed so any extra push is better for me. Im just excited to be getting the best android TV box and arguably the best android device period. Kodi and video playback can eat me. I just want to game. ,nexusplayer,debtktz,1,t5_341jx
11128079,0,t1_detcv2b,Strange Ive only ever had the problem with the date and time and even then I never reboot so not an issue. Did you consider exchanging it? Too late now I guess. Definitely doesnt sound normal though,nexusplayer,detcwo2,2,t5_341jx
