Which part of the pie is for you yep. to be brief course developer  misunderstood sculptor LMS admin  unheralded cat herder. i might be biased but i am extremely positive about the field. were only getting started. drawback might be that we as a field re starting to demand more and more skills that it might be harder soon to be an elearning generalist,instructionaldesign,citiuzk,1,t5_2v93d

4811365,0,t3_3gq23s,Have been working as an instructional designer and elearning specialist in the DC area for the past  years. DC and its surrounding suburbs are good hunting for ISDs with masters degrees IMHO though you may at times have to qualify to obtain TSSCI clearance.That said many of the positions that become available are with federal government and military contractors. Its not that there arent other DC area industries in which IDs can find work but fed gov  military are the main thing here.,instructionaldesign,cu10glt,2,t5_2v93d
5499583,0,t1_cwelqfp,In my last position I developed for learners who insisted that content be available on tablets. Our LMS did not support tracking through tablets so we were forced to come up with a clumsy workaround where we put the content up on a protected YouTube site for tablet access then learners had to come back to the normal internal LMS site and take the quiz in order for the system to mark the content complete. It was not a perfect solution but we did what we had to with the tools we had. What I see happening is that learners are accessing videos and content on their phones through services such as YouTube and Lynda.com and they think Why cant we have that here...it cant be that hard? Well it is that hard because none of the companies I have ever worked for are willing to pay for the Cadillac LMS systems to make that kinda thing work... ,instructionaldesign,cwemgki,1,t5_2v93d

8812451,0,t1_d76wown,It all depends on your platform of deployment. This simple interactivity has been present in Flash for  years. Articulate Storyline could do this but youd need about  triggers and  motion paths. Adobe Animate could do this with Javascript AS or AS. And of course you could build it like he mentions with pure HTML amp CSS. But what will your LMS support and does your devteam have the chops to do it efficiently?Gamification is IMO a waste of development resources to artificially increase seattime.
