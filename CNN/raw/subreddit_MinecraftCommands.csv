4618596,0,t1_ctciof0,Yes this is how it works for all list types. It was the solution to being unable to detect certain data easily. We were previously required to fill in every single piece of data within a list which essentially made it impossible to detect a single small thing such as something within the inventory.So this must be taken into account when accessing any preexisting list data. For this very reason you actually cannot detect any specific slot for the Equipment tag. Whatever record you identify will be looked for in the entire list not just the position placed within    testfor e EquipmentidminecraftdiamondhelmetThis will return true if a diamond helmet is in any equipment slot. Equipment doesnt come with a Slot tag so you cannot specify a specific slot. Hopefully the lack of a Slot changes with . considering the dualwielding implementation.,MinecraftCommands,ctcr2gl,1,t5_2yjbi

5693478,0,t1_cx2teaa,The p will target the nearest player to the command block effectively modifying the KillsOffline score of all online players by that closestplayers score and not by the desired players score.If you want to cause players to perform an operation on their own score you must use execute to incite a sender bias    execute a    scoreboard players operation ac KillsOffline  ac KillsuSirc execute does not require the targets to be OPd. Triggers are essentially useless for this they are meant to be used as placeholders for commands to run manually in cases where the player cannot run them which would be tellraw clickEvents not any use with scoreboard alone. A trigger type just means that the objective can be used with the trigger command.

8198017,0,t1_d52arig,a was not the reason at least not in vanilla. If youre only looking at the last output textbox in the interface it will not be representative of the actual success of the command. You need to look at the signal strength instead.For example you being the closest player did match successfully while there was another candidate found by the selector but did not match the NBT data. Therefore the last output shows a failure message but the command block was indeed successful and will thus output a redstone signal.You should use a instead of p. By using p you only check the NBT data of the closest player. If there was a possible match farther away then youll never know because theyre not being checked.You should not be using testfor in a multiplayer environment if you need to target that same player afterwards. All it does is tell you there were targets but not who that target was. Use scoreboard instead to assign a label either in the form of a score or a tag    scoreboard players tag ataghasPumpkin remove hasPumpkin    scoreboard players tag a add hasPumpkin InventoryidminecraftpumpkinSlotb    say Players with a pumpkin in slot  ataghasPumpkinAnd finally vanilla command mechanisms do not mix well with mods especially server software like SpigotBukkit so be aware that any issues you come across is not necessarily the case in vanilla. I should also mention that instead of saying something didnt work for some reason you should provide error messages or unexpected behavior.,MinecraftCommands,d52azzx,3,t5_2yjbi

11613172,0,t3_65q4d1,With the command at the bottom of your post it actually says that there are unbalanced quotations not brackets. This is because of the Command tag. In that tag you have    summon AreaEffectCloud    ParticlemobSpellPassengers  idZombie idZombie idZombie  Here you have nested quotation marks Zombie. Because these are quotation marks inside other ones you need to specify to Minecraft that theyre internal by escaping them. To do this you add a backslash  before each quotation. This would change the command to look like this    summon FallingSand     TimeTileIDTileEntityData  autoCommandsummon AreaEffectCloud     ParticlemobSpellPassengers  idZombie idZombie idZombie    Also note that I added a quotation mark at the end of the tag. This is to conclude the Command tag.I think though that there might be a much simpler way to do what you want but I didnt understand what that is while reading. Are you trying to get a command block to summon the AreaEffectCloudZombies at a specific area when a player enters a specific area?,MinecraftCommands,dgcd2s1,2,t5_2yjbi
