And when I piece it all out life stuck with school office just doesnt seem significant or correlating to my beliefs. I started out as an atheist became a muslim apostated became a buddhist believed in hindu gods without necessarily being a hindu and at last  I became a survivalist. Its an intense journey. I tried the many religions in hope of bringing in change into my life. I felt tortured going to school and doing homework and all that stuff. Its all pointless. For what? Im definitely going to be an office slave in the future so thats even worse. I dont want that. When I actually got into spiritual I hoped that it can set me free magick esq. All this really weathered me down. I dont think about the future much. Now its all about being happy in the now. I actually managed to program my mind to be like that. Im getting close towards liberating myself from depending on the outer world so I feel justified about suicide although Ive been contemplating for a solid few years. Basically I think its an act of selfliberation. A proof of faith towards an intelligent universe and that humanitys perception of good and bad is skewed. ,SanctionedSuicide,clelwgt,1,t5_2wiyw

2733749,0,t1_cner2vy,Yeah the idea of connecting with people is complicated and it can have a lot of baggage surrounding it. Id say its usually a mix of both things but I think knowing you are understood by another is a really important one. And yeah even just walking or biking for long periods of time can be very helpful in during hard times. Its like if we lived thousands of years ago in a place that started having extreme and dangerous weather we would move on until we found a safer place.Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic medicine thats been used by aboriginal tribes in South American for thousands of years. Its active ingredient is DMT and its in kind of in the same domain as magic mushrooms and mescaline. In the past decade theres been a boom in tourism for it and this I think is both good and bad. I took it  times two years ago and I still think about it everyday. The strongest experience was the rd time where I had a death experience. The idea of ego death and feeling like youre dying was something I was aware of but I thought it was experienced psychologically during the trip but for me it really felt like my body was dying. My body felt heavy it was difficult to move I didnt think I was breathing I was though obviously my body was becoming cold from the inside out everything was getting dark. It was scary and I kept fighting against it until finally I knew I couldnt fight anymore and Id have to just give up and let myself die. When I did that and just let go it was the most incredible perfect and beautiful thing Ive ever experienced though actually beyond all those words. It was like I was a piece of air but less than that pure consciousness and I was more myself and complete than I ever was but not human at all. Everything human was gone and there was so much love. Everything was okay in this light which wasnt so much a visual light rather it was a state of being everything was okay. Then I saw this being made out of traces of blue light and they were smiling peacefully sitting in the dark in space and they motioned me to look left so I did and I saw part of the universe from a distance there were little galaxies and stars just like something out of the Hubbell telescope pictures. I should say that I had people around me and taking care of me and physically I was fine in no way was I actually dying. After I sort of came back after the letting go experience I felt really warm and alive again. If you want to know more you can PM me  My hesitation now is because although my experience was really great and healing too I didnt feel very grounded for about two months afterwards and I feel like I was picking up on stuff that I didnt understand for some time afterwards which now I think had to do with genetic memory though I understand that sounds really weird. Also most of the people involved where I was were very New Age and then some and that isnt something I resonate with at all and I felt a lot of intellectual disconnect with them. So yeah thats a bit long but again feel free to pm me if you want to know more. It definitely changed how I view death and made me much more accepting of it. ,SanctionedSuicide,cnetdbv,3,t5_2wiyw

3662090,0,t1_cq8ul90,gt I think that this line of thought is appealing but it seems to suffer from one major problem it makes suffering the universal deciding factor of existence vs nonexistence or what is best for someone and that seems unjustified at best and myopic at worst.You may be right that it isnt justified to base the worth of someones life based on the amount of suffering alone. However I believe its possible to extend the argument from dealing with happiness and suffering to dealing with utility and disutility in general.In Better Never to Have Been David Benatar is mostly arguing from a hedonistic utilitarian standpoint hes making judgements about the relative worth of existence and nonexistence based on the amount of happiness and suffering in each state. However there are other people who have argued that it is best never to be born with arguments based on other forms of utilitarianism.For instance in A Pareto Principle for Possible People Christoph Fehige argues that we are all harmed for being born from a preference utilitarian standpoint. I havent read the book myself but I believe I understand the gist of his argument all people have preferences and when a preference isnt satisfied people are worse off for it. There is no positive intrinsic value in a satisfied preference and so having a fully satisfied preference is no better than having no preference at all. Under these circumstances the best possible situation to be in a state of neutrality in which all of our preferences are satisfied  or more accurately that we do not have any unsatisfied preferences. The existent have many preferences and in practice they are never all fully satisfied so they are worse off than the nonexistent who have no preferences and a fortiori no unsatisfied preferences.A counterargument to Fehiges argument is that preferences in themselves are valuable the anticipation of a new videogame might be considered a net positive. What about things like the experience of euphoria? How does that fit in? In the general case though I think Fehiges reasoning is applicable. Quoting Schopenhauer from On the Vanity of Existence Human life must be some kind of mistake. The truth of this will be sufficiently obvious if we only remember that man is a compound of needs and necessities hard to satisfy and that even when they are satisfied all he obtains is a state of painlessness where nothing remains to him but abandonment to boredom.If Fehiges argument is acceptable then you could argue it is best never to be born from multiple aspects of utilitarianism.It should be noted that everything else aside both Benatars and Fehiges arguments have the attractive property of not logically entailing the Repugnant Conclusion unlike more conventional ones.gt Sure if you reduce to be or not to be to suffering alone then the  of nonexistence will trump the whatever of life every time but my question is what do you say of the people who go by some different equation?Id say to that person to do whatever they want with their own life  end it or continue it as they see fit  so long as they dont breed. Because I firmly believe that bringing someone into this world is a harm and therefore that its wrong.We dont even have to accept Benatars reasoning that every single one of us is worse off for being born for this. You could just go with the far less controversial argument of Seana Shiffrin who says that without a person Xs consent the only reason we may inflict harm on another person is to prevent a greater harm befalling them. For instance its acceptable to break a persons arm without their consent in order to prevent them from dying if you believe death is a harm. It is not acceptable according to Shiffrin to inflict a harm on someone without their consent in order to secure them a pure benefit like enhanced memory or greater intelligence.It is mostly uncontroversial to state that the potential harms of life cancer rape etc. are significant. It is wholly uncontroversial to state that procreation involves bringing someone into this world without their consent. It is also reasonable to state that we arent sparing a person of greater harm by bringing them into existence.Procreation is therefore an activity that involves the potential of inflicting significant harm on a person without their consent for at best a pure benefit. This is a violation of Shiffrins principle and should be considered immoral even if we accept that life isnt purely bad for people.gt But I think the more problematic part of what youve said is that these peoples gratitude is irrelevant. If you say that a formerly suicidal person would still be better off dead even if they feel incredibly grateful to be alive because were all slaves to our genes or whatever youre essentially saying It doesnt matter what you want or what you value. There is a right way of going about things and that way is to die.I am saying that. However I dont believe the comparison to the psychiatric dogma is fair. Both of us are adopting a paternalistic stance I know whats in your interests better than you do but whereas they will actively go out of their way to enforce what they believe is right suicide prevention Im advocating nonaction i.e. leaving suicidal people to their devices to end or continue their lives as they see fit without interference.To truly constitute the flipside of the current psychiatric dogma I would need to be going around killing people just as theyre going around saving people.gt I doubt that youll protest his right to go to the concert but doesnt it seem problematic to you to say Going to the concert is always wrong no matter what you think because youll damage your hearing if hes already told you that the hearing damage is a secondary concern?It does seem problematic. Again though Im not going to force suicidal people to die and Im not going to stop my friend going to the concert if he wishes. I just want other people to stop trying to convince others that continuing life is always the preferable option or that going to the concert is the best course of action regardless of the amount of damage it does to my friends hearing.,SanctionedSuicide,cq9pbwv,2,t5_2wiyw

4389055,0,t1_cskba7r,Well it must be of some comfort to you that you have this one person in your life who obviously cares a lot about you and believes in you. On the other hand and Im just guessing here you probably feel under some sort of moral obligation a burden almost to do the right thing by him and stick around?  I suppose if youre feeling miserable now and it seems wellentrenched then six years would seem an awfully long time to suffer. Unless of course you thought as your friend does that within that timeframe youll somehow emerge from your present condition cured and able to engage more positively in life. Far be it from me to comment on that but if you felt you wanted to achieve that outcome then it might mean working with some sort of health professional if youre not already doing so as there seems a lot to overcome. Other things to consider might be whether youll feel up to the demands of study and then negotiating the job market should your condition prevail and whether your friend is likely to be in your life forever. Id like to think things will improve for you but I know for many people myself included things dont always get better and I wouldnt wish a lifetime of misery on anyone. ,SanctionedSuicide,cskdsht,3,t5_2wiyw

I suppose its because all other decisions in life arent important if youre gonna die. So for about a year now my mind has had little else than suicide on it. Now that I have finally decided to do it my mind is actually feeling freed up to think about other things  like things I need to sort out before I die things I wanna do before I die. Before I made that decision I didnt think about anything else because I didnt think it was worth caring about anything else if I was gonna be dead soon.,SanctionedSuicide,cstm064,6,t5_2wiyw
4466043,0,t1_cstdyok,thank you for your thoughts OneRedSent. Yes Ive noticed Ive become very anxious about death lately. I have become scared. I will try not to rush things. I do want to make sure that when I do it I am feeling calm. Youre right its hard to make ourselves believe in something. But I suppose I was thinking about just calmly telling myself that Im going to a better place before I do it. I suppose it doesnt matter. So long as I can do the act calmly.Its strange because the last few days have been filled with some sense of freedom I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders now that I have decided to kill myself. Before the indecision was constantly on my mind. Now i feel freeer. I also realise nothing really matters any more in my life since its over so that is also helping me to feel freeer. but I admit I have become scared of the act itself and dying again. I will try not to rush things. I appreciate everyones input here on Sanctioned Suicide. it has been so calming and comforting to be able to talk with people who understand these feelings. thank you for caring enough to suggest I dont rush into the act.I will also think about trying to turn this new feeling of freedom into something good. Who knows maybe if I can live with this new found carefree attitude I might be able to live after all. and the indecision about suicide wouldnt return because I feel like Ive decided on suicide but I could I suppose keep postponing it and so enjoy the sense of freedom I get by doing that.,SanctionedSuicide,cstme3x,1,t5_2wiyw

Even though I dont plan on accomplishing anything in that time. Before my life was all about how many accomplishments I could fit into it.

The partial hospitalization program was supposed to last only a week they wouldnt discharge me until a month had passed. I hated every day there and I got into writing for something fun to doexcept Ive never been able to come up with original characters of my own that I dont hate so I have to steal someone elses. I dont tell well anyone about it since it feels cheap and dorky.Now that Im getting everything ready to finally catch the bus I really hate the idea of leaving that fic inprogress after all the work Ive put into it.

Suffering is intrinsically negative which has lasting consequences.of course bad is relative. suffering is bad because we are sentient being. that is our context. look beyond humans and sentient beings what about a rock. what would be bad for a rock would differ than for us. there may be nothing bad at all. if suffering depends on us being sentient so does bad. and thats a context. thats relative. the problem here isnt suffering its that were aware of it. gt Removing suffering equates to the extinction of all sentient life.yeah except still i cant be bothered to agree. i would also switch around the propositions in your sentence but thats besides the point.suffering isnt even always universally bad. i know this is pushing it but throughout religious history its been seen as salvation. i self harm physically i suffer and i dont think its bad.  what i think is bad is letting my wounds heal without interference which most people would qualify as good. in my daily life im confronted everyday to how relative good and bad are. there are no universal ethics imo. gtThis is critical to understanding and preventing harm. Sure one can say dont have kids for personal reasons because the planet is already overpopulated and we consume more than we produce but that kind of person wont be as committed to the grand total value in the universe.why must harm be prevented at all costs anyway? idk its a process of life just like any other that obviously isnt all good but that isnt all bad either whatever you take those to mean. harm can serve a purpose even if its one you dont agree with. we cant imagine wrap our heads around the grand total value of the universe anyway i surely cant be committed to it. what do you suppose it be?,SanctionedSuicide,cvh5gxx,1,t5_2wiyw

But the terrors of death offer considerable resistance they stand like a sentinel at the gate leading out of this world. Perhaps there is no man alive who would not have already put an end to his life if this end had been of a purely negative character a sudden stoppage of existence. There is something positive about it it is the destruction of the body and a man shrinks from that because his body is the manifestation of the will to live.,SanctionedSuicide,cwixmp6,1,t5_2wiyw

I know I did not specifically refute all of your ad hominems I figured those could be cleared up be rereading my post. It would be tedious very tedious and largely irrelevant to what either of us are talking about.And honestly I have no idea where youre getting this idea that I have people anywhere that love me or want to understand me. You did read those parts of my post where I pointed out that I have no friends Im chronically single and I have not felt close to any person in the past four years? I must admit I didnt make that central to any of my points its only really there to establish the context.   I also did not say that I specifically am oppressed. I said that there is a longstanding history of ignoring the voices of anyone who falls outside a very narrow group in power. This includes but is not limited to some of the groups I identify with.And I didnt complain that the OP failed to talk about identity politics. I observed that it starts from a specific kind of identity politics it relies on it to the exclusion of a vast number of other possible painful experiences. I think there is a problem when a very widespread way of describing a kind of emotional pain that many people can experience makes it impossible to say hey I come from a very different background but Ive felt sort of similar to that tooheres some ways that I convinced myself to approach the situation that maybe made it a little less difficult. If the response is to say that my different background shouldnt be mentioned and to take personal offense at the fact that I disagree with some points and resort to confusing unfounded assumptions about what my life is like along with namecalling something in this widespread culture that Im thinking about must be really problematic. This isnt about me. This is about how we maybe should react when we see one persons suffering turned into a weapon against others. When we see it over and over again.

6228396,0,t1_cyxkk6k,I dont think anything is safe from being harshly criticized but can it be defended? Does it get anyone what they want?Let me explain where Im coming from instead. I think thatd really help us more than coming up with a universal theory which is impossible.My opinion until a few days ago was that suicide needs to be legal for anyone for any reason. In addition resources could be available to those interested but I do not mean the kind of resources that we have today which begin by blindly trying to dissuade people from suicide nomatterwhat and then ramping it up to using force against them when they dont comply.I see that this is naive but I dont have a better opinion yet so we can kind of stick with that for our purposes here.The problem is that I think theres a lot of sick people out there and a lot of faulty reasoning around committing suicide. What we should be okay with here is sucide however we should try to help people going about it the wrong way. If theyre going about it the wrong way its also possible that theyre coming to the conclusion of suicide in error but that is tangential to the points at hand.One wrong way is doing what I did. What did I do? Lets summarize and ignore all the details I consider my being brought into this world as an overall negative thing to me. Its a terrible thing to happen regardless of whether others enjoy me. This doesnt mean I dont have good times and that Im suicidal every second of the day. Its simply that I dont think life is worth the pain it takes. I hope this changes as Im trying to do some new things but its really unwise to think that it would at this point and were going to die anyway. The prognosis is grim. I withhold the details to stay on point. In any case theres several modes of suicide for me at least. One is what you have above. Its rational logical and I updated when faced with new information. A second type is when things are so painful that its hard not to do something impulsive and what stops me is waiting for a better death or something else. A third type which was supposed to be the focus of this post  is to intentionally generate the conditions which cause the second type. The second type is not based on the reasoning of the first type however the third type is certainly based on the reasoning of the first type.The are in my opinion only two correct outcomes for me personally that I should get to the root of things and figure out how to live or I obtain my method handle my people and do things exactly the way I want and need to.You say you havent heard of the third type and I believe you. Im telling you that I see it frequently enough to feel that I need to mention it. I dont want to see people committing suicide because they no longer have a choice because of the conditions they created by being suicidal! For some people its not too late for them to fix their lives or jump of a cliff as they desire.I hope this is better. I tried.I mean how do you feel when you hear someone say theyre going to starve themselves to death? First of all Im going to be like no youre not. Second of all thats really not a guaranteed suicide method at all. Moreover its gonna maybe really fuck you up if you take it too far and youre gonna probably going to have to live with that. It might even stop you from being able to kill yourself if you really have the discipline of an ascetic or masochist or whatever. You get what I mean? I think its reasonable to say no thats fucking stupid. stop. do anything else but that one really retarded thing. theres so many better ways to kill yourself and so many better ways to live until you do die. Now can you see that this generalizes to even more extreme things? If were here to help and support people then sometimes one of those ways might be to help them with their thinking as were doing for each other.

6386132,0,t3_434xbn,Your older brother sounds kind of similar to me Im an older sibling had a hard time getting started in my life and lost a family member to suicide so I can tell how I dealt with the suicide in my family.I can tell you they will be hurt by your death probably irreparably hurt.  In fact according to this study recently posted here your death may cause him to develop suicidal feelings of his own especially since depression seems to run in your family as it does in mine.  No matter how carefully you prepare and try to prevent them from feeling the pain of your loss I can guarantee you that you will leave a hole they will try to fill with any number of addictions.  Even if your not very close to your family which was my case an immediate family member killing themselves will feel like a dagger in their heart.  They will feel guilty despite all evidence to the contrary and they will wish they had done more.  They might also be angry at you even if you feel they shouldnt be someone probably will be.  All in all I think this Cyanide and Happiness comic expresses this much better than I can.I wish I could tell you there was something you could do for your family but there really isnt much.  I dont think this should stop you but I think it is important to realize how hurt they will be.  As for me Im not really angry at my family member Im a mixture of sad and happy as strange as that sounds.  Im so sad for how their life was but Im happy they dont have to go through all this nonsense anymore.Anyway I hope you and your family are able to find the happiness and peace you so much deserve. ,SanctionedSuicide,czfjb8i,2,t5_2wiyw

And some of the job adverts that were posted there are shocking wanting a degree  years experience and offering poverty wages.Worse  the people who do manage to get a job will effectively be working to increase the wealth of the CEOs and shareholders that have engineered this horrific system.The idea of a decent job that I can retire from one day a place that I can call my home and the means to support a family if I wanted one are so far out of reach for me and a lots of other young people.A tiny number of extraordinarily greedy people have stolen our futures from us.When I kill myself one of the main reasons will be that I likely face a lifetime of only just getting by on meaningless stressful work that will make me miserable with little hope of a better future.When that day comes Im sure Ill be pretty upset despite wanting to die. But there will certainly be one happy thought...the thought that Im not going to be a fucking slave to this awful system any more...Im not going to be a compliant little cog in the machinery that enriches the few and immiserates everyone else.They wont get any more work out of me.Dont water the tree that your chain is tied to.,SanctionedSuicide,czjk6o6,7,t5_2wiyw

6859900,0,t3_49n0ww,Ive realized that the vast majority of people will never be able to completely relate to me. Ive only found one person who has ever been able to relate to contemplating their own death for as long as they can remember. Meanwhile I had another friend who said that he contemplated suicide at one point for some small amount of time but then turned around and found me burdensome for being more serious in my desire. I tried to just hint about suicide with another friend and she became angry at me for ever suggesting that it would potentially be preferable to be dead than unhappy. I often wonder if the people around me are suicidal and how theyd feel or if theyd even be surprised if they knew that I was. Everyone seems so happy and carefree but maybe its just a facade. Ive seen statistics that say that  of the population considers killing themselves at some point but yet I feel so alone anytime Im among peers. Theres occasionally been classmates that Ive seen whom Ive identified to potentially be depressed at least. On one level I feel like it might be amazing if I could find someone that I could frankly talk about suicide with irl. However I feel like itd be pretty mortifying if anyone actually tried asking me whether Im suicidal irl so I dont really want to impose that upon others. I feel like Ive deviated from your original topic but anyways. I dont even know. Ive joked about wanting to die before. I want to die with every fiber of my being. Im not sure why I joke about it though. I dont really want people to know the extent to which Im suicidal but at the same time I think that I might be subconsciously hoping that maybe they can relate and will say something so that I wont feel so alone. ,SanctionedSuicide,d0tvnbr,2,t5_2wiyw

6997116,0,t1_d193w6l,Hmm well my tastes run strongly towards historynerd stuff so your mileage may vary but here are some other ones I like I know Ive recommended this series before on this board but the His Majestys Dragon books by Naomi Novik are my goto comfort reading. Its like The Napoleonic Wars With Dragons the Novel. Robert Louis Stevenson somehow writes prose that just sucks me right in and refuses to let me go. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a favorite. Ernst Junger was a German soldier in the First World War and his memoir Storm of Steel is the kind of book that you might put down but the book doesnt put you down. Its incredibly vivid and immersive and always leaves me with this stoic determination to just get shit done  not happy necessarily but also quite calm and not panicky or crying. Hes also very interesting if youre interested in Heidegger or Nietzsche or that strain of philosophy at all. I strongly recommend the new Penguin translation there was an older one but it really sucks. Winston Churchills history of World War II is incredibly compelling to me even though Im aware that its very ideological. I love his prose and I can just let myself believe it for a while and escape into the world hes describing.  I really liked the new BBC version of The Three Musketeers for visual media. Its dumb but its full of very pretty people firing antique pistols full of beautiful filigree shit and waving swords around.  I also rewatch the original Star Wars trilogy a lot because my inner child still wants to believe in uncomplicated wars where there are good guys and bad guys and everything is darkest before the dawn but ultimately the good guys win.

As to what people say that would be irrelevant wouldnt it?Its interesting that you say you just have this persistent ideation. I think it can be very easy to call upon suicidal ideation when under pressure or stress and take comfort in it. It might be worthwhile to you to try to explore the value of your ideation especially if you say you dont have any psychiatric problems or reasons to feel suicidal...you didnt explain. But of course for many people who have contemplated suicide for a long time they do feel great relief at the thought of a successful suicide of it all being over.CTB means catch the bus and is kind of an Internet euthemism for commit suicide that comes from an old website.

7724858,0,t1_d3k9gk6,Paracetamol toxicity     gtParacetamol toxicity is caused by excessive use or overdose of the analgesic drug paracetamol called acetaminophen in North America. Mainly causing liver injury paracetamol toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of acute liver failure.Many individuals with paracetamol toxicity may have no symptoms at all in the first  hours following overdose. Others may initially have nonspecific complaints such as vague abdominal pain and nausea. With progressive disease signs of liver failure may develop these include low blood sugar low blood pH easy bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy. Some will spontaneously resolve although untreated cases may result in death.Damage to the liver or hepatotoxicity results not from paracetamol itself but from one of its metabolites Nacetylpbenzoquinoneimine NAPQI. NAPQI depletes the livers natural antioxidant glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver leading to liver failure. Risk factors for toxicity include excessive chronic alcohol intake fasting or anorexia nervosa and the use of certain drugs such as isoniazid.Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replacing glutathione. Activated charcoal can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the patient presents for treatment soon after the overdose the antidote acetylcysteine acts as a precursor for glutathione helping the body regenerate enough to prevent damage to the liver. Nacetylcysteine can neutralize NAPQI by itself as well. A liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. Patients treated early have a good prognosis whereas patients that develop major liver abnormalities typically have a poor outcome. Efforts to prevent paracetamol overdose include limiting individual sales of the drug and combining paracetamol with methionine which is converted into glutathione in the liver.    I am a bot.

This is also a major concern of mine. Its like Im in the middle.  I want to at least know what sex is like but even just one time can screw me for life.  And not just that but unwanted pregnancies STDs etc.  She can lie about these things too.  Its hard to trust people.  I hate that but its true.

No one is going to hand me a gun and tell me kill yourself I love you. I feel at fault somehow. Delusional perhaps.

Im going to tell my story in hopes of opening your eyes to see things from different perspective so that you can see beyond the wall theyve build around you. They basically said that if I dont have the abortion that I will never see another penny from them again. Theyve always paid for my housing and living expenses Im unable to work due to ptsd and continued to do so up until a few months ago. They gave me about  or  months notice that they were running out of money and wouldnt be able to help me anymore. It wasnt till then  years after the abortion that I realized that my family stole from me my only opportunity to create and have a family of my own. Note I say only because I have since decided beyond a shadow of a doubt that I do not want children  They convinced me that their approval of my decisions and their financial support was the most important thing to memy life. They convinced to the point that I didnt even see the other opportunities that laid before me. I would definitely do things differently if I could do it over again.  If I wouldnt have allowed them to control me I wouldnt be in the situation Im in right now. The one that has brought me to this subreddit. I take responsibility for my decisions but in the end they arent taking responsibility for theirs. And knowing that if I wouldve taken the other option the last  years that have been filled with pain solitude and misery wouldve been just the opposite really makes me sad. Especially since they dont give a rats ass what happens to me now. If they did they wouldnt just cut me off and say well youve never had to pay a cent towards rent in your entire  years of life and we know your still too fucked up from when you were sexually assaulted by  guys to actually work but were not going to give you any more money or help you out in anyway anymore so you need to figure something out now or youll be homeless. Im paraphrasing there. Lol but you get the idea. Im telling you this in hopes that after having read this that youll be able to the other opportunities and I stress the opportunities because even though they might be scary as fuck they still are very much so opportunities that lie before you. I honestly didnt even see the other options. At the time their way was the only way. But its your life not theirs. Living the life someone else wants for you is with out a doubt going to make anyone unhappy and depressed as fuck! Because while our parents play a pivotal role in our lives it is after all our lives. When we die it will be our lives that flash before our eyes not theirs. They might have brought us into the world and raised us and supported us but does that give them the right to control us and destroy us? Because by forcing us to do things we dont want to they are indeed destroying us. I really hope this helps. ,SanctionedSuicide,d61xyak,2,t5_2wiyw

8711830,0,t1_d6uh7cj,Yeah Ive read No More Mr Nice Guy as well. When he talks about being assertive and standing up for yourself he isnt talking about getting angry or ranting or yelling at people quite the opposite. What he tries to get across is that nice guys dont have a healthy approach to conflict or tension and can learn to handle things better.On one end of the scale many guys who are too nice will agree to things because they think it will make the other person happy that theyre agreeing. Only its not something they actually want to do so then they passive aggressively try to get out of whatever they agreed to do. Instead of simply saying Thanks for the invite but Im not really interested in tea with Granny this week Id rather have a day washing my car theyll agree to tea with Granny and then somehow something will come up so they cant go or theyll sulk the entire time or theyll be late or they simply wont show up without a word. Later this leads to an argument why didnt they show up why was their attitude shitty why cant they respect other peoples time etc.If this hypothetical guy had simply said from the start that he wasnt interested in going this time around and perhaps offered a compromise Next week Ill definitely be free if it was one he was willing to stick with then thered have been no conflict. Its fine for him to want to wash his car its not fine for him to be passive aggressive to get what he wants. On the other end of the scale self proclaimed nice guys have a tendency to eventually explode with all that pent up anger that they dont usually express which is equally unhealthy. Check out rniceguys for many many examples of Ive been nice all this time but NO MORE. It scares people away even if theyre not directly on the receiving end.The point is that you can be assertive and stand up for yourself in ways that dont involve raging at people or ignoring them. Many nice guys simply dont understand that other ways to handle this sort of situation even exist at all. Perhaps this is something youre also unaware of  no big deal it can be learnt. gt Respectfully I dont think its ever better to think of how what you writesay will make you look to other peopleHow you look to other people is  of what makes them want to be around you or not.

Like Camus I view suicide as the only important philosophical question and am both fascinated by and admiring of those with the constitution to do what might be the only rational response to the supernatural horror of consciousness. At the very least Im staunchly against reproduction and had a vasectomy last year. Ill likely kill myself but only when Im old and frail. Theres too many distractions to amuse me for now. My body is strong my mind is powerful.Everyone dies friend. Some sooner some later. But people go through their lives insistent that their struggles arent pointless. They refuse to think deeply about their condition and live as if in a drugged stupor never asking why they do the things they do.Free will is an illusion life is short and cruel and after a point we do nothing but decay. I find the only things which really give me comfort are building systems Im an engineer IRL with plans to start writing historical fantasy short stories as webcomics and talking honestly with people about lifes horrors. The depressives are often the only ones willing to engage in the latter.Going back to the original topic forcing people to confront lifes horrors via public suicide doesnt strike me as wrong. It shakes them out of their apathy makes them ponder what the difference between them and the corpse truly is. Scarring but in a good way.

8965927,0,t1_d7odj4j,Huh ha! I hope you dont mind reading tall    walls of text . Being brief on things like this is NOT my strong suit.This part is added after finishing most of below some parts are bound to be less well thought out than I would like. A weekend reset may prove fairer for my thoughts but as it is Im just going to send. This is a huge amount as is so...while it perhaps shows sincerity on my part apologies all the same  for anything needlessly wordy. Maybe sending as is somehow can help since you can note the wheres and whys of anything I didnt adequately address and reading that I can clarify more.ampnbspgtSo either you reject existence as long as that has any sort of pain or the acceptance of living is contingent on the acceptance of an undetermined amount of pain. So yeahI am VERY wishywashy. No denial about that. Cognitive dissonance CD plays a huge part. It might not be the only thing contributing but for our purposes to simplify things well say it is the only one for now.  Yes sir I can certainly see it is contradictory. I should say Im not absolute in my words. Even though I did say I was.....looks back. Hrm I said I was virtually absolute with them.  I mean there is still a marginal component residing within me that wishes to live. Something subconscious perhaps. I know thats kind of a nonreason since nearly anything cognitive can be attributed to Oh its just the subconscious. In any case Im writing this off as the survival instinct perfected through eons of evolution to account for most of that. ampnbspNow this is something I mostly agree withgtIts an overreach in my mind to say that any kind of pain meaningless or otherwise invalidates existence altogether.Would you allow the distinction that for me only pain meaningless or otherwise invalidates my existence? For it to invalidate it altogether I know that burden of proof is on me. I dont really have that therefore if I implied so much Id like to make it clear now that is not what I mean. Though not directly related David Benatar would have the best arguments for that premise. He wrote a whole book about it. Assuming you never really read his work the internet actually has a full copy of it and heres one fair critque of it Both are pdfs but unless your browser settings are different it should open in the browser vs annoyingly downloading. Since it is some ish pages I dont expect you to read even half of his book so Ill provide another critique that represents Benatars base premises relatively fairly. Please note both critques are rebuttals of source in the interest of fairness. I have yet to find thorough counter rebuttals and countercounter ones.I put best in quotations earlier because while I agree with a lot of his premises no philosophers words are without chinksimmune to skepticism. Plus disclaimer I have not thoroughly read his book the rebuttals counter rebuttals and so on enough yet. So...you know Im not solidifying my position by taking Benatars position.  Whatever I agreedefend is always in the works even though I sometimes say I have my mind made up because wishywashy...which is just hasty and foolish of which I can be quite prone to.ampnbspANYHOW if we are not allowing that distinction....at that level of argumentreasoningabstraction theres a lot of semantics biases on all sides though I probably have more of it some misinformation on my part and whole lot of other factors that is frankly above my pay grade ie I never was formally educated in lower and upper leveldivision philosophy. Such complex things I wouldnt know what constitutes as valid and sound. So...it might not be rational at the end of the day but it is a deeply seated gut feelingintuition. Something that I cant ATM at least perhaps more commentary on your part may help me think more explain thoroughly that would would satisfy the rigors of todays intellectual thought. ampnbspampnbspampnbspI had to look up nirvana fallacy NF. So were on the same ground Ill use following definitions of which Im guessing you may mostly agree with.gt Comparing a realistic solution with an idealized one and dismissing or even discounting the realistic solution as a result of comparing to a perfect world or impossible standard.  Ignoring the fact that improvements are often good enough reason.gt By creating a false dichotomy that presents one option which is obviously advantageouswhile at the same time being completely implausiblea person using the nirvana fallacy can attack any opposing idea because it is imperfect. I acknowledge that my words show pretty much all of that.No pain andor emotion is my idealized reality ATM anyway so yes I created a false dichotomy.  This isnt really a rebuttalargumentjustification but I said a lot at the heat of the moment ie I had emotions hijack me when I wrote it.  I bold it because thats something very important to understand about me along with CD I have a good amount of internal dissonance the weakness of one with a mental struggle a lot of fk what I said earlieryears ago. I even have fk what I say in the future. Id like to think at least Im not too disorganized in my thinking. Just too emotionally vested in some parts and to some things.When I think about it now and how I feel I dont exactly feel the same. ampnbspSo.it seems today as of me writing this depending on the improvements to life and I assure you its not as unreasonable as no pain at all I actually might just accept reality.  While I could accept that reality that can still be independent of my desire to die.Im not sure just how much of an influence it would have if I found a reasons accepted reality that there is pain and moved on with living. Would it do nothing or change my belief? It is valid to say it would be the latter but that would be speculation in the face of what actually would happen which no one much less I can really know. I would have to give life another try under those conditions see it see if it can somehow placate this death drive I have.ampnbspgt Life isnt perfect it certainly isnt free of suffering and its not likely to ever become free of all suffering. We could however if we really wanted to which we dont but for the sake of argument well say we might make tremendous strides to increasingly reduce suffering. At some point the bad stuff will become but a small price to pay for the good stuff. The imperfections that will still exist shouldnt invalidate our constant betterment.On one principle I mostly agree. I make an exception when more than several tries have been made. At that point. its no longer a small price. The human will to live patience and motivation is runs outends like most everything in existence. All of which of course are necessary for striving for betterment.  NF is a really good charge against something like a relatively well off socially psychologically etc adolescent who just broke up with their girlboyfriend not that Im condemning invalidating or belittling such reasons.

10963172,0,t3_5wk8p7,All the time. Casually suicidal is basically acknowledging that something bad happening in the future is inevitable. Therefore you live in the moment because you have no trust in the pattern of your life changing. So you assume that what happens next is going to be negative. Thus you plan ahead of time because you are unable to cope with the thought of spiraling back into depression the next time something bad happens. I would call it a form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and it comes from a complete lack of confidence in your own ability to cope and a negative life pattern you dont think you can ever escape.   I have not figured out how to get rid of the obsessive panic and fear. Possible AgoraphobiaReclusiveness. Still working on that myself.

I started looking for another job after the first year of being employed there and in the nearly  years I have been looking for a job the only offer that was made to me was for a temp position that only would have lasted  months and fell through the day I was going to turn in my two week notice. Ive fixed my credit and gotten some stability but the trade off has been what is left of my sanity and constant rejection from other employers including being turned down job offers from the  or so interviews Ive had at that time including AAA Insurance who left me hanging for over a month about a hiring decision and telling me to be patient when I inquired about the job has really put a damper on my ability to find work. And the only reason I am even looking for a better paying job is to try to be able to save to use Dignitas so I can have the guaranteed death I really desire. While I have rebuilt my credit I have also taken on  in credit card debt that is all due to emergencies that my shitty low pay from Walmart provided. You cant get ahead even living in an area with a low cost of living on  an hour and not really being able to afford shit other than bills and groceries. Thank you for posting what he had to delete.

11288810,0,t1_df5ubb5,Im sorry for replying so late. Ive been anguishing over how to tell my parents I dont want to return.The whole dropping  life has no meaningno security is how I feelfelt about my career choice. I chose it because I had no dreamone that I could accomplishand stuck to the idea like glue. So if anyone suggested that I try something else Id get mad. Its a little funny that I feel a bit better about dropping college entirely instead of dropping my major. Like a if I never tried to finish anyway its not like I actually dropped it mentality. Anyway Im sorry that the game holds that important meaning for you. I hope you come across another game even by chance that seems fun and worth giving a try. Heck if theres a fun MMORPG in the future were still around and youre into those types of games maybe we can give it a go together. Do you not get pleasure from food anymore? Snacking here and there can be a good alternative when you dont want to eat. Have snacks or food that you like in the house. I have animal crackers fruit dried sweet potatoes yogurts shrimp chips some instant rice bowl stuff etc. Its good that youre still eating. I dont have enough selfcontrol to starve myself lol so I eat. If you have a sweet tooth you could keep some red bean paste buns or ice cream in the freezer. Mm Id have to be born pretty to die pretty  Im taking care of myself to an extent like going to the lessons and showering after but I need to lose another  pounds to get to my ideal weight. Without moving more it wont happen and I dont know when itll ever happen.You dont have to take care of yourself to look good for others. Do the things you want to for the reasons you choose. Like if youre scared of losing your teeth make it a habit to brush when you wake up and right before you sleep. If you feel grimy then take a shower so you feel refreshed. Stuff like that.There are online classes for writing and creativity if you still want to try taking them. As for cooking classes the ones closest to me are within  minutes drives. I think theyre closer to where you live if you google cooking classes town nj. For convenience or starters you can cook at home. When I started cooking I looked up dishes I wanted to try. Im Korean so I looked for Korean dishes  maangchi  crazykoreancooking are my goto sites  and my parents do like it when I cook. You could surprise your parents sometime with dinner when they come back from work  Im sure theyd appreciate and enjoy eating it a lot. Is there any Chinese food you wanted you try making or wanted to eat?I personally dont like kms because it comes and goes with kys but its great that you have control over the phrase so that it comforts you instead. Wow youre already that close to a source! Im not saying this because I want you to die but because the goal is to find peace which I hope you do. Good job thus far and congrats. I think I might bring the college issue up Friday or Saturday. Best case would be Friday night where I can speak with my dad alone first. Im relieved that your parents are so supportive.You can ignore this part below. I wrote this first but it might not be appropriate if youre preparing to go soon. While a lot of thoughts might be running in your mind like the girl I assume some of the pressure is now off? These thoughts that are coming might be there to replace the worries you had about college. Not to stress you out more but since were still alive getting a part time job might take your mind off of them. But I havent ever had a real job so I dont have any good advice for that. Do you know anyone who is working or are there any stores nearby hiring? Theres probably also some online work you could do.Were also Asian haha so that and the generation gap are totally relatable. Yep. I wanted to try telling our parents about college together getting one obstacle out of the way. But no worries! Im really happy for you that it worked out okay and knowing that also gives me a little more courage. The rest of us in this subreddit also approve! Do your best with ranking up.

I have the option of checking myself in but I resist and keep mostly to myself because I was sexually assaulted during my last hospitalization and subsequently divorced.

Im just broken though because I was just kind of going with it since my dad was paying and him my brother and I were going. I didnt particularly want to but wasnt very afraid beforehand either so was just going with it. It wasnt until we were halfway to altitude in the plane that I started feeling nervous. It was terrifying seeing everyone in front of you one by one pretty rapidly go out the door and your turn is getting closer. No pause to think beforehand. Youre going as soon as you get to the door and are sitting on the edge. Then the free fall. Air was rushing up my nose really hard and making it burn quite a bit. My cheeks and face were being flapped by the wind. I was looking around trying to enjoy the view but it was kind of making the vertigo feeling worse. And I was feeling terrified. Then the chute pull. That part wouldnt have been bad. Ive been in a ultralight before. But the nausea started setting in. By time we were close to the ground I was dry heaving and trying not to puke.
