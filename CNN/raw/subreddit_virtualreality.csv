Though the field of vision is not as wide these have no screen door effect.  Also this is a relatively new tech.  In a few years they might be able to increase the field of view.There could also be VR technologies that dont require a HMD.  Holo projectors have made significant progress in recent years.

If it is done on the PC that is wireless connected to the Rift or whatever then it is just like the status quo with additional latency for the wireless part. But maybe the rift could have a small computer in it that would be able to implement the time warping?  I wonder if you had a Tegra K or something that hooked up to the Rift and you also had a PC if you could somehow share the rendering.  In the simplest case imagine there is just a static environment that you can look around in.  Maybe both could constantly be  rendering stuff but when you move your head quickly the nearer GPU could render it with a more up to date position or whatever.

Pretty sure its whatever your power supply pushes not just mA which is at least mA if youre powering over USB could be higher a lot of computers break the spec to let you run more peripherals on a hub as much as mA if youre using common cellphone chargers. But they are constant voltage and the resistance of your skin is two high to get that high. A really good connection will get you mA. Just simple Ohms Law.Sweat as long as it is still wet would help. Dry and it will be mostly lipids and salt which will insulate.Those electrodes do sound large. Mine were a centimeter square. I think you might be right about current density. This picture was a second test and it wasnt as easy as my first. My first were smaller still probably half a centimeter to a side buy I hadnt taken photos so I had to do it again.I just ran a test. Both cathode and anode need to be connected to the mastoid directly. It cant just be one on and one off which I was hoping it would in which case I would have made both anodes and put the cathode at the nape of the neck but that doesnt look like it will work now. It needs to be at the knob end of it where it peaks. Look at the Wikipedia page for help on locating it. I tried a number of spots around with a v and bare alligator clips and it was only a small fingertip of an area that was sensitive.Its a pretty small spot the mastoid. Find the point where your jaw meets your skull. There is a Vshaped divot where the two meet. That part of your skull is the mastoid process. For me its directly behind my ear lobe but I dont know if different peoples read lives can be in different places. Pressing my ear lobe flat against my neck I touch the mastoid through it.,virtualreality,ct7a5d1,1,t5_2qp9o

I quickly called two friends and we decided it was worth the  hour drive and got tickets. It was amazing and completely immersive. Before this Id only tried the DK Oculus and these guys were using the DK and its definitely an improvement. The graphics on the research facility map reminded me a lot of early Halo games. Theres a platform you walk out on and it instantly gets more humid and windy. The floor outside is metal and vented so you feel like youre on a shaky platform. Thats where some ships started shooting at us and when we dodged their shots theyd hit the platform and itd shake. The Dimension One map I feel is overlooked and really awesome. Everyone seems in a dash to do the Research Facility but I almost enjoyed Dimension One more. You start outside an Aztec temple and when you go inside you grab a torch. Then you go down a dark corridor and come across a giant head statue with a fire in it. If you hold your hand up to the fire its actually warm since they have a heat lamp there. The best part is where you head into an icy cave. It instantly feels colder. You step on a platform press a button and you feel the button go down as you go up. The platform youre on shakes and when you get to the top you feel the mist and wind coming off a waterfall. All in all it was impressive and these guys are on to something. They know how to create the illusion in the physical world to make you feel that what youre experience is real.

Then the only limit is how far the mics can hear and theres effectively no line of sight issues. Im sure its not simple like Im sure youd have to model the resonance of the room and such but I think its worthwhile.Another of my pains is more a software thing.

6100717,0,t1_cyj04m7,That was part of my point though I did not express it well enough. They have been around for decades. The open metaverse concept is a big part of what I think will happen though not at first. As a stepping stone to that the next few open virtual platforms such as project Sansar Mivvo and a whatever the big hardware teams like oculus come up with will provide the framework for a lot of existing uses social media music video games to aggregate into a more centralized interface or environment and some form of avatarbased identity to relate to your content experiences in those other spaces that will come to make up a true metaverse. Your home space or desktop call it whatever. We can do it well enough I think. It is simply a matter of time at this point. Iterations.I am not an expert. I have however spent somewhere in the region of  hours or so running a business logged in a virtual environment as an avatar since  though. I know what it is like to live essentially inside VR already. I work there I fell in love inside there we live together now coming up on a decade! and have made many solid friendships with amazing people all over the world there. I make the content I sell and assist customers directly in a working retail space facetoface as it were.I cant say that it will buy me a ferrari anytime soon but it keeps the lights on most of the time.Bottom line I dont think any of the things coming hardware or software in the next couple years will become the giant virtual facebook killer app feeding frenzy that Bob from marketing is trying to sell everyone right now. But the combined release of these things the money behind it already will be the things that start us on the path to the things which will hopefully become something much bigger.

6295632,1,t1_cz579m2,I dont care why Oculus the selfappointed shepherds of VR think other companies are going to ruin it. I care that VR becomes accessible and desirable.Sony was ahead of them on VR full stop and started years before their announcement. They had their project Morpheus prototype ready to go it wasnt thrown together overnight it was damned professional from the start. Other companies have been in this too. Valve was doing it. People tend to mistake the fact that Oculus did their initial development in the open for them being first in their field. The truth is they were influential in igniting public hype and interest again and proving the concept to early enthusiasts. So while its just great Oculus wanted to try to set the terms for VR I think its ridiculous to think they did it because they were worried about the PSVR being bad. Theyre worried about the PSVR stealing their thunder. Theyre worried about not having control over the market and its why they refuse to play nice anymore until they are a market dominant position. Thats why theyre shipping early without the Oculus Touch. Thats why they didnt partner with Valve to integrate with Lighthouse tracking once it was unveiled like other HMDs have despite it being drastically superior tracking tech. Oculus is not about providing you the BEST experience in VR. They are about providing you the best experience in VR that Oculus controls.Now from the numerous technical breakdowns and handson experiences the PSVR is distinctly equal to the Oculus in every way that matters for persistence and experience. At a technical level the Oculus will be using higher res screen. And the PSVR will be achieving a consistent fps via software instead of strictly natively. Otherwise they use the exact same tracking tech with Sony actually having an edge using a binocular camera both offer persistence in all their hands on testing with no nausea and will have access to many of the same titles available in VR. Both target the seated experience as well.And again the Vive is leaps ahead of both technologically and in terms of the experience offered so comparing to lighthouse tracking is meaningless. In the PC space its Oculus that has something to prove now. Unless the Vive is radically overpriced I cant see why one would ever get Oculus over the Vive when the latter accomplishes exactly the same seated experience with similar visual fidelity and a whole other dimension to the experience on top of that.Sony is only going to poison the well if you think that having accessible immersive VR is something on the PC elite are entitled to and that a superior resolution is the be all end all of the discussion.edit for examples And since people are always worried about terrible console graphics Driveclub running on PSVR again no nausea no issues after only  months dev time.edit for subpixels being relevant at this distance to the screen as well,virtualreality,cz58q2z,2,t5_2qp9o

6568679,0,t3_45m0wj,If youve not done much research and arent looking to do so at this time i would wait for the next generation but by then most HMDs that ill mention bellow will be on the market and youll get a better idea of software support and functionality that interests you. So far there is only one console based VR HMD announced its for the Playstation  called PSVR formally project Morpheus  which has no release but more info should be announced june  at E with a planned release date of this year.Lowest entry as far as i know if Google cardboard which uses various android phones. Google may be working on a better version soon so its a safe one to skip for now.A Low entry HMDs would be GearVR for specific samsung phones. Given its on a phone its lower fidelity VR and dose not support full positional tracking. There are also some overheat issues with older phones that may this a very bite sized experince. If samsung continues to support it future phones should be much better. No motion controllers.The only other midlow range VR headset i know of is for PC OSVR from Razor. I hear theyve improved since their last showing but im not sure by how much. I think their target audience is more hackersdevelopers similar to how early occulus HMDs were early on. No motion controllers but it may support third party motion controllers.stepping up from that to high end PCs is Oculus. This went through a few versions DK developer kit  gt DK developer kit  gt Cresent Bay better tracking gt CV consumer version . CV is what should be shipping in a few months if im not mistaken and is the first really commercial version with the previous ones meant for developers and hobbyists. Its still generation  and has high PC requirements so its not for everyone. It dose not support motion controllers at launch but the Oculus Touch motion controllers should be available down the road. A bit more PC intensive is the ViveVive Pre from HTC  Valve Steam. The first developer version Vive had limited developer release and this may still be the case with Vive Pre. Its features room scale tracking with small laser base stations you place around your room. I assume it will have motion controllers at launch but that may still be a bit off.And those are the main ones i know of at least ones youll likely hear often about. maybe not OSVR or Cardboard. Hope that helps some.,virtualreality,czyr7rt,3,t5_2qp9o

6966143,0,t3_4b4f9w,This is the second Mixed Reality experiment done in the narayana games office. In this video we have one wall with a greenscreen and a Logitech C Webcam attached to the controller.The Webcam is one of the better Webcams but still a Webcam which doesnt provide great image quality and even worse introduces rather significant latency. So any camera movements are immediately visible on the ingame screen but only with a little delay in the real world footage. This is also still using p for the game view recording which is giving us only x for the actual video as there are  quadrants so wed need K to get an actual p resolution in the final video.We have a lot more green fabric and will also be using a much better camera and lighting for recording the actual videos. Besides instead of putting everything together in OBS Open Broadcaster Software onthefly on the machine thats running VR well capture the game Window on a second machine and record the actual camera material directly on the camera and then of course do some rather heavy postediting.These are really just the first lowquality proofofconcept experiments.And damn I need a new haircut so badly and maybe take some acting lessons or something.

7796830,0,t1_d3seh4i,The other reason I could see it releasing the Vive from the baggage of struggling HTC. Name the company something like Vive VR and brand it completely as Vive and without any mention of HTC. Thus obfuscating its connection to the failing mother ship. The brand is already Vive in VR anyway in conversation. Of course all analyst people and informed fans would know it is still HTC but for lay man customer they see that its VIVE and no where in the packaging is HTC mentioned even once. HTC being that phone manufacturer everyone dishes so maybe Vive isnt so good either.Also they might want to highlight the success of Vive. Little bit like Google did with Alphabet. Separate the companies so they can separate and highlight the individual finances. Have Vive be its own subsidiary showing strong financial and thus by proxy giving good news to the parent by showing that atleast some part of HTC is succeeding and thus maybe there will be hope for the rest of it.Plus there is maybe just pure organizational reasons. Vive tech came mostly from Valve and it is also otherwise completely different from the other stuff HTC does. So it might make sense to separate them and thus a release HTC from having to manage this weird department doing completely different stuff from everything else they do b release the Vive team from having to think things like overall HTC company product portfolio time tables etc. as I mentioned earlier essentially being able to say to the team You do VR dont care what rest of the corporation does. Single Focus VR.The subsidiary would still probably leverage the manufacturing experts and capacity of the mother ship HTC but having them separate would release the design and RampD guys from having to deal with rest of HTC.Though I agree that they might sell some stock in the hopes that the VR hype gives the VR only subsidiary company really high valution without being hindered by the rest of the company and thus provide a cash surge for the mother ship.In the end Whoever knows well HTC knows but at least for now they arent seeming willing to tell the rest of us.,virtualreality,d3sf8i7,2,t5_2qp9o

So feet and elbows could be easily tracked in addition to HMD and hand controls with basically zero additional compute load.gtBut to do it with a camera youd have to add more LEDs. And this is a problem because camera based tracking is triangle analysis. Every new LED drastically increases the number of triangles that must be analyzed in order to recognize the unique signature of the HMD and hand controls and distinguish them from the triangles formed by the elbow trackers and every other LED point in the visual field.you can strobe the leds for the same effect.,virtualreality,d58hiew,2,t5_2qp9o

8355121,0,t1_d5lwmp9,Just thinking out loud Ive been thinking  dreaming about VR desktop stuff as well for a few years.I noticed your comment about unreal and beautiful environments in other places. I would think about maybe separating the two. I can  understand wanting to make the environment beautiful its very important that things look good or they dont sell. But maybe have the UI like a start menu app switcher and stuff separated from the heavy resources stuff. So it could work either with the default steamVR or some custom environment.There is an open source project for lightweight windows here Ive also critiqued the VR desktop  big screen apps in the past for not offering proper filtering. You need a good pixel shader filter for the captured desktop  window textures and at least mip mapping else the readability goes out the window. Basically implement distortion and multisampling with the right supersampling filter in one pass for the window surfaces. Lancos or something but Im not versed in filters.The other problem is that you could come up with lots of new ways to control apps and programs and the desktop but you are stuck with decades of windows apps that need to work well. Id also look into window skinning like windowblinds does. Replaces the close  minimize buttons and the window frames with D GUI and maybe replace  reskin the standard menu bar system as well.Id focus on giving great access to some part of social media first an integrated browser a VR version of chrome for example andor something that can congregate notifications feeds  like email twitter reddit posts RSS. But simply a well integrated browser that works in VR with any other steamVR app would be awesome already. You often feel isolated inside VR because you are stuck in the currently running app without any power to do something else easily. Not sure if that is just me but that is how I feel sometimes  like handicapped inside VR. If your app is a standalone app that doesnt run in parallel  overlay to other VR apps or games I dont think it would interest me much. Plus there are plenty other app out there going in that direction already. A true VR OS needs to be above the standard VR apps and offer benefits while being in VR. E.g. Im riding accross azeroth in VR and get a chat window notification.,virtualreality,d5lxyf5,2,t5_2qp9o

Sometimes when you want to banish a card from you discard pile the hitboxarea seems to overlap with the deck. Also one time i accidentally selected the wrong card by moving slightly while pressing. Seeing your opponent and his stats seems harder than it should be. Of course you wanna make the cards as big as possible to be able to read it but sometimes its a little tricky. Generally so far I didnt feel that much value added by VR compared to the comfort of the iOS version. Then again that might be the case because I didnt have a chance for an online match yet.Looking very much forward to what is to come from this. I played the Vive version.

More power isnt the solution to bad programing. The game has what...  years worth of code compromises to make up for. The only smart move is to redo the game from the ground up and thats what microsoft is doing.

Developers have to specifically design the engine to distribute the load across multiple cores and they usually dont design for more than two or four cores. More cores will definitely be helpful but even things like the Pentium anniversary edition that was released a few years ago A  dual core can hold up pretty well against a current i in games. I built a system for a friend with that dual core Pentium in it when it first came out and the only game hes had frame issues with is GTA V. He has a  and gets around  FPS on average at p with max settings. Again Im not denying that more cores will help because they definitely will.

I bought a Playstation Vita instead of a DS based on the promise of AAA consolequality games in handheld form and for the first couple years it delivered with stuff like Uncharted Golden Abyss LittleBigPlanet Vita and what is probably still one of the best handheld games of all time Killzone Mercenary. Then support just... ended. The AAA quality games stopped coming out and the few that did were stupid JRPGs made for the Japanese market or niche titles from basement developers who usually make games for cell phones which was utterly infuriating for someone who bought a PS Vita precisely because they were disgusted with the state of phone games and their low quality shovelware feel. Meanwhile DS games have an entire wall usually devoted to them in GameStops while Vita games warrant a shelf or two. I am not putting down  on what could be the VR equivalent of the PS Vita.

10151348,0,t1_dbuoqy3,Yes I remember them saying that you couldnt notice that most of the screen was blurred. Of course the latency you require is dependent on how big you make the full res portion of the picture.And yeah its useless for current resolution but with this simultaneous multi projection you can basically render multiple viewports at once in one pass. Thats a huge performance advantage of this feature. Its really quite ingenious of nvidia to include that feature. So Im very sure that would make foveated rendering practically free at least on geforce X hardware. It might even speed up rendering performance while still going up in resolution since the resolution for the majority of your field of view could be lower than it currently is. Of course it depends on the ratio of pixel shader load vs other scene dependent things like shadow mapping that might not benefit much from foveated rendering.,virtualreality,dbuplti,1,t5_2qp9o

11059319,0,t3_5xrwcv,ThiefThe Dark Project  between the obvious using Longbow from The Lab as proof that bow mechanics just work in VR using the Vive wands as a blackjack or sword are a natural. Plus with the slower sneaky style of movement walk in place or touchpad walking with the occasional teleport feels like it could work nicely. What Id LOVE to see it full body awareness so crouching and leaning around corners let you watch enemy movements plus ducking to stay in the shadows seems like a perfect match for VR.,virtualreality,delk0p0,2,t5_2qp9o

Also a standalone headset is able to optimize its design for VR instead of a phone like not having crap cooling and do could achieve much better performance for the same hardware.,virtualreality,deww33y,4,t5_2qp9o

11172370,0,t3_5zer6c,I dont think it will fail but I also dont see it igniting any time soon. It has to evolve AR amp VR will merge foveated rendering with high res wrap around lenses limitless FOV and aware of where youre looking no tether and a keen price will let it go mainstream     Thats quite a lot of tech to catch up and get cheaper assuming its not overtaken by chips wired straight into the old noodle feeding sights sounds sensations and smells straight to the brain RVR Real VRtm .,virtualreality,deydjk7,1,t5_2qp9o

11388306,0,t1_dfmtltr,We really need a breakthrough or something. Like some sort of material that can go from very flexible to hard or that exerts massive force in a matter of a few milliseconds with appropriate input and it needs to be cheap. Something that doesnt rely on current motor technology. Or a breakthrough in motor technology. Full body exoskeletons would be nice if they could be something a regular person could afford. Honestly if you could get truly full haptic feedback Id pay k for that as a consumer and feel that it was justified.How expensive even is a current fully featured exoskeleton?,virtualreality,dfmug8l,2,t5_2qp9o
11400056,0,t3_62nucf,One big problem with VR is the motion sickness caused when the visual field moves especially quickly or irregularly while the watcher stays still.  If your idea is filming from a gopro mounted on somebodys head every little movement of their head will move the visual field which will be profoundly disorienting and nauseating for the watcher.  Sorry but that will not work at all.  ,virtualreality,dfo6k3q,2,t5_2qp9o

11446952,0,t3_63b8b8,Hey guys!Great discussion going here and some solid advice! Ive set myself a budget of  for my first vr headset and am still not sure which one to get. Ive been reading some reviews on this site  and am considering the HTC VIVE or PLaystation VR.Does anyone here actually own either of these? What are your experiences?,virtualreality,dfti30y,0,t5_2qp9o
11475943,0,t1_dfwry31,Maybe saying forget its there is the wrong way of framing it maybe I should say not notice its there.  Going back to what I said about seat belts.  I dont think people forget that they are wearing one to the point where they would exit the car without unbuckling it first but neither are they persistently aware that its strapped against them.Saying that people forget they are wearing a headset isnt a testament to the inherent comfort of VR headsets it isnt but it is an expression of the immersiveness of VR in general and the human capacity to adapt to discomfort.  Have you ever gotten an injury that didnt hurt until you looked at it?  Its the same concept.Just because people can tuneout discomfort like the background noise of a humming refrigerator doesnt mean they shouldnt make quieter fridges.  The same goes for headsets.  ,virtualreality,dfwsl6m,5,t5_2qp9o

11576567,0,t1_dg7dyo4,well considering roughly  the worlds population uses facebook and that many many many many times more people use facebook daily than own a VR headset I somehow doubt that being linked to facebook will prove to be a real liability to Oculus.,virtualreality,dg87kj6,1,t5_2qp9o
