602972,0,t1_cg8mes4,Those you talk about are the main mission tapes. Theres actual side op tapes like mentioned above. The  minute monologue with Skull Face actually gives you his background ala Psychomantis mini the dying part.

2977477,0,t1_co6jw48,Definitely do release order. I tried to coax someone through Chronological and there is a number of reasons why you shouldnt. The big one is what has been said about the control scheme but there are also some major plot elements that have a lot more emotional pull and aha! to them if you just play it in release order. That being said if you want to play the original MSX games just skip those until youve finished the MGS series unless youre a retro masochistthose games are hard as shit.,metalgear,co6jzry,6,t5_2s3xo

5001149,0,t3_3jfo9k,If youre not going to emulate PSP for Portable Ops then the only three games that predate TPPs story are MGS Snake Eater MGS Peace Walker and MGSV Ground Zeroes. All the others take place after TPP and follow a different protagonist. Theres no important lore information hidden away at   just easter eggs  though I would  GZ or download a save to import into TPP for the personnel advantages. ,metalgear,cuotqwc,1,t5_2s3xo
5003134,0,t1_cuouqer,honestly playing them in release order is probably smart if you have never played the series before. There are things that happen in subsequent games that are supposed to be familiar to you already.Personally my plan having played most of the series already is that after ive played PTT ill probably go back and play through it chronologically to see how it all ties together from that perspective but its not really designed to be played that way so there will probably be some plot holes that dont get filled until after you need to know it etc. ,metalgear,cup2cz7,2,t5_2s3xo

5317883,0,t3_3ntg8r,gtLiterally the only biologicallyimpressive things that weve seen outside of gameplay where rations heal bullet wounds are nanomachines and those wont exactly help when transferring a head. Sure theres always the nanomachines that regenerate tissue instantly but for all we know Vamp is the only one they work on remember  he had crazy survival skills even before he got injected with the nanomachines. Bottom line is that perhaps the Patriots wanted a fully cybernetic soldier with a human brain but the researchers at Area  didnt quite know how to achieve that at the time. So they did the next best thing  they copied Raidens brain patterns onto a positronic brain recreating his thoughts personality how he saw right on wrong and of course his memories.Wait so we know that Nanomachines can do pretty much anything including heal Vamp completely let people fly and go invisible replace pretty much any limb on the body  but you dont think its humans had the ability to do a head transplant for Raiden? Rather you think the technology to literally copy the information from someones brain to a computer or to someone elses brain is more feasible because thats somehow easier to do than a head transplant?Nah. I dont think you thought out this theory enough.,metalgear,cvrf754,2,t5_2s3xo
