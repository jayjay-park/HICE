7521411,0,t1_d2wvtjl,Oh well in that case forge needs to go hogs instead of double basing. then use most of the hogs to hunt the enemy hogs while keeping a couple at your base to help defend. if you click forge to expand you just got to hope he gets a tank out ASAP while you defend. You could try to put some SGs into the chieftain so you can kill him quickly.

8009325,0,t1_d4gaxey,And again... The sources you provided are false they recorded their numbers without clearing their supply amounts. In addition the spreadsheet that everyone loves to cite in this conversation was also proven wrong. From simple ingame evaluation you can tell that what you say is proven is false. Just make four heavy supply pads and see how you can make  tank at a time with gaining about  additional supplies each tank. Then build a second base with  more heavy supply pads. You will see that you can now make  tanks at a time while gaining  additional supplies per each build time. This clearly proves that  supply pads give you double that of .  Now I will say that what you are talking about is actually true when you reach  supply pads. However supply decay based on how much supplies you have affects your supply rates more as it kicks in at about  supplies. Edit  In addition both of these supply decays were implemented in updates and not at the same time either. This added to confusion about this topic due to it making supply amounts shown in forums different from each other and starting debates like this... ,HaloWars,d4gbnet,0,t5_2sjgf

10474761,0,t1_dcvbrop,Yeah this is the same thing Ive been thinking.  Usually to give siege units their full range you have to make some kind of effort to grant them vision with other units.  Like in Starcraft people use vikings antiair ships above siege tank vs siege tank fighting for vision which will give their side the range advantage.  Id like to be able to set up my own siege and push them off the ridge with that kind of tactic but it doesnt work with full vision.There is still a functional fog of war you can see your units vision range and only drop new cards within it it just for some reason doesnt effect units shooting.  ,HaloWars,dcvf841,1,t5_2sjgf

Since micros are so efficient at randomly leveling cards the whole system is far too flawed.Warzone is far from perfect but they really should have either made a system more like Warzone or gone full CCG and done deck building with multiple copies of cards and maybe a crafting system to deal with an influx of commons,HaloWars,ddxdkoq,2,t5_2sjgf

10972802,0,t1_de9znaj,I wouldnt recommend countering with hornets. Its wayyyy to easy for them to switch into an infantry swarm with augments of vehicles  remnants of the scout army and keep you on the back pedal until their able to fully switch gears and resume the true offensive.Basically look at it this way. A scout rush wants maximum supplies and a few base buildings mini base main base to double or triple pump scouts while expanding their economy in this fashion.Those same buildings that produce scouts also produce infantry. Nothing short of a highly upgraded mid to full pop army of hornets would be able to defend against the infantry spam their already able to switch to.Key word DEFEND. Air mobility doesnt mean anything when they are forced to defend.My advice would be to instead build into a barracksraid camp and pump Cyclopshunters.The reason behind this is that it severely limits the enemies production capacity while streamlining yours.From a barracks you can build units to invalidate a scout rushes primary source of units the center buildings essentiallyPyros n snipers for the infantry Cyclops for the scouts.This will give you a much better advantage once their rush has failed to wipe you because it forces them to relegate back to a different unit producing building OTHER than the center buildings. Chances are good they had nothing but supply pads and generators at every location when they first attack you maybe an air padapex to make engineers.If you stockpile power and have a small pop of marines and a few Cyclops plus a turret at your base the scout rush will fail and you must IMMIDIATELY press forward and expand. I personally send all units to the closest enemy expo after all your army will be a counter to not only his standing army but any available army he could currently produce from his center buildings.Bonus if the scout rush folds into air then you focus on expansion and marines. If you can.EDIT case in point typos from mobile.In that video a well known highly skilled streamer is utilizing the scout rush. He is countered by early air and is put on the back pedal.Unfortuanately he switches to infantry tidal wave tactics and utilizes an early infantry heavy army to trade and stop the opponent from expanding with hornets. Had the defender built Cyclops  infantrysnipersPyros he would have been able to capitalize on his successful counter to a scout rush by expanding and crushing the streamers remaining army. Nakumura even says hes glad he didnt build into the barracks with more Cyclops which allowed him to double down on the infantry waves.,HaloWars,debrp2k,1,t5_2sjgf

11091734,0,t1_deoroxy,Maybe I really dont know cuz I didnt thought about the amount of sentinels I get before this play but in other instances when I correctly played this card the other sentinels came pretty soon after the first one. It probably got something to do with the sentinel to enemy unit ratio in the placement area and with the other player moving hisher army away from the area. I would imagine that there wouldnt be more sentinels even if I had vision on the area. If someone knows the ins and outs of this card like when to expect what amount of sentinels I would appreciate some feedback.  At least the play made me laugh quite a bit cuz even if it would have worked like I expected this was a pretty bad play and I felt like the one sentinel was my punishment for making it. ,HaloWars,dep8l51,1,t5_2sjgf

11366138,0,t3_6263e0,Depends on expectations. In charted at  the week it came out in the UK and has kind of hung around their charts but thats not saying much when games that have been out for like  months are already outselling it. In the US it charted as the  best selling game on Xbox for the month. It came out at the end of the month and I know a lot of ppl bit the cdkeys.com version. Digital sales arent tracked either so I dont think the US jumped on it too much. Its a very niche title. I checked the xbox Most Played list a few times out of curiosity and saw it around the low s which was a week after it released. So it hit around HaloMCC levels of activity but within a week it was off the top . In that time you had Horizon Dawn come out For Honor remain popular and NIntendo Switch come out. Its a niche genre on fading franchise on a second place console with a pc port on hated storefront.....Im assuming it sold poorly but there seems to be at least a few thousand active on Xbox with probably under a thousand on PC. Hopefully it comes out on Steam sometime soon bundled with a price cut. If the PC audience grows the Xbox audience has a chance to grow too. ,HaloWars,dfkbvym,5,t5_2sjgf

11750778,0,t1_dgru4sy,Apologies that was primarily meant to avoid an argument with the person I was replying to not to insult you.What most people seem to miss is that there are actually two different ranking systems going on. Theres csr and mmr. The former is your overalllong term rank which you see as your playlist rank. The latter is a short term ranking system that determines where your current level of play is. For Example You are onyx  amp your friend is bronze . You go to his house and use his account and after a game or two HW will recognize that you are playing at a level way above bronze  and it will boost his mmr towards your level almost immediately. However unless you were using his account for a week straight his csr will still be bronze.In your case it was likely something along those lines either his mmr getting him to your level or yours bringing you down to his.,HaloWars,dgrzao8,2,t5_2sjgf
11753143,0,t3_67ot5w,AS a Halo  Player I prefer the Halo  style. Although seasons are still inconsistent in h but they last like  months averageI think is better to get new dlc in middle season rather than start one with new dlc. I know this is an uncommon idea but I prefer to learn a new hero in mid season so I can decide if use it in the next season or not. also fixing things middle season is way better its boring to keep playing against strats that will get patched later on like triple kinsano turret rush or soAlso  placements matches wont be a problem if this is like halo . If you already were high onyx you will be ranked in onyx . Or diamond  you will get like diamond  aka not far from your previeous rank This will lead to less time to have your past rank again.Another thing is If i remeber correctly in H if you are champ and win a game you get more or less the same point as if you were other rank wining a game. This should be the same because it is horrible example to win  games to get  points and then lose  games and lose  points.,HaloWars,dgs8y46,2,t5_2sjgf
