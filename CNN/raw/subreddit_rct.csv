848516,0,t3_23tn13,I think the problem with Drachenfire is that it does not have a particular spot in the area. It just spreads everywhere which does make it seem so long and clumsy. My idea is that you turn around the station and let the first lifthill face in the other direction towards the doubleloop. The turnelement after the first lifthill looks good so maybe keep this and after that directly lead into the looping. The first looping should be higher than the second one so you dont have to slow the cars down as much after that and you also dont need a big second lifthill.,rct,ch0qayy,1,t5_2rzsl

878832,0,t3_246wqn,Id suggest polling the public before launching in to something like this. Many players especially the stronger ones will not be able to finish a section in a week. Distributing objects in a bench between NCSO and CSO is also very weird as people used to CSO will be missing a lot of objects that they are used to and will want and the same will be true for NCSO. You also have no idea whether anyone is actually interested. The park layout you suggested also sounds like it wont work very well seeing as the midway will simply be a long straight stretch of path and it would force everyone into tiny slivers of land connected to it. Furthermore the mod team may have been in talks about doing another official Redditland anyways. I dont mean to completely shut down your idea but I think a lot more prep work could have gone into this before you posted about it.,rct,ch46dfp,3,t5_2rzsl
934621,0,t3_24svr4,Well to start if you are going for realism you need to vary up your coaster types a bit. The coasters as a whole are just too massive and dont have enough breathing room around them. Youll also want some more flat rides and buildings. ,rct,chais2i,4,t5_2rzsl

2521864,0,t3_2oippr,first of all its important to actually make your own stations dont just use the default ones. they dont look as good and are unrealistic. secondly you need to make more buildings right now you only have entranceexit huts or stalls the only real building i see in here is your coaster station and a smaller one around a few stalls. try to use less brown and green too make it stand out from the forest right now the only thing doing that is a stretch of path. the coaster is lovely and i like how you actually took the time to put an MCBR on such a long coaster. the idea you have with the second station is nice but i feel like it could be done without adding a lifthill just make the station in some place isolated.,rct,cmnqu8x,1,t5_2rzsl

3340828,0,t3_2yevgo,I like this a lot. Definitely room for improvement but the scale is spot on. Your layouts are decent but actually could all use a few more inversions to be more realistic. Id look up real roller coasters to see the progression of inversions that is typical your twister and invert could use about  a piece or so. The forest is nice but forests grow in clumps and usually blend out to brush as it gets closer to development. Try working it down to shrubs as it gets closer to a path or ride. The wooden coaster does this well even changing to sand underneath. That said not everything needs to be sand underneath like the invert. If you threw in a few more flat rides and some buildings for restaurantstheatersfake arcades this would be incredible. Nice start.,rct,cp92una,6,t5_2rzsl

The box is about x pixels in size running on a x monitor just a blur of colours. The game is running but running in the small box. There is music.This is Steam versions of both games running on Win  bit. This just happened in the last week where Ive played at least hrs with no problems whatsoever except for some weird colours. Have tested other games on Steam and theyre all doing fine latest GPU and windows updates all installed. Game isnt being blocked by firewalls or security software.Have also tried deleting and reinstalling the games numerous times same issue.EDIT SOLUTION  for NVidia users Open NVidia control panel gt D Settings gt Manage D Settings gt Global Settings gt DSR Factors gt uncheck all options gt apply changes gt open game should run again like normal prior to being weird,rct,cpw1z9w,1,t5_2rzsl

5018805,0,t1_cuqxdfu,gt Your real life gforces are going to be much lower than what the game is designed forNot really the games limits are broadly accurate. Its a little less sophisticated the game has an abrupt cutoff above which G forces are considered too high whereas in reality the acceptable limit depends on the time for which the force is applied and the type of restraint However the limits are about right  if you exceed RCTs limits your coaster would be very intense IRL not that there arent coasters that exceed these limits.The main difference between the games physics and the real thing is the transitions between elements. The games transitions arent smooth but very abrupt a consequence of the need for adjacent sprites to line up no matter the track configuration. The transition into the heartline twist is so abrupt that its unlikely a real coaster train could negotiate it the elements always come in the same fixed sizes that arent always appropriate for the speed of the train and theres a general lack of heartlining throughout in other words just like an Arrow layout. An RCT design would probably give people whiplash IRL because of the near instantaneous transitions.,rct,cuqygnx,2,t5_2rzsl

9278100,0,t1_d8rzvm4,A dimetric projection isnt a type of isometric projection. An isometric projection is a projection in which all lines are equally foreshortened isometric means equal measure. Its popular for technical drawings because you can measure dimensions directly from the isometric projection.A dimetric projection foreshortens two of the coordinate axes equally but not the third. In RCT the two horizontal axes are equally foreshortened but the vertical axis is not.The reason for this is that the coordinate axes in an isometric projection make an angle of  degrees with each other. Trying to draw that on a screen with no alpha transparency causes aliasing so it is common in games to approximate it by a dimetric projection that gives lines with a gradient of .. These line up neatly with the pixel grid.Games using this projection are still commonly called isometric but it is important to remember its not quite that if youre rendering new graphics for the game or trying to invert the projection to recover information about the original geometry.,rct,d8s2dzd,3,t5_2rzsl

10628947,0,t1_ddav96w,Nice job on Tiny Towers! Note that Micro park is only  of the size of Tiny Towers so youll be building up rather than cramming rides into a small space. My biggest tip is to leave a couple squares that you can raise above the rides you have and use them to build rides off of and especially squares where you can build shops and stalls for the upper part of your path network so guests dont get too unhappy obviouy lowering the land back down and building something under it. Also the park value is actually pretty quick to achieve so youll want to space out your building of roller coasters. I think I ended with only  roller coasters.,rct,ddcamsd,1,t5_2rzsl

11192924,0,t3_5zptfg,Got introduced to RCT on vaction when I was . My family was visiting India and I was unsurprisingly getting bored since there was nothing to do at home and it was too hot to go outside. I told my older cousin that I was bored and he introduced RCT to me. Initially myI was hooked despite being hilarously bad at the game. My favorite memory was asking if you can charge for restrooms then listening to my cousin start laughing.A couple of days later one of my younger cousins came and also got hooked on the game. He was also really bad at the game and our collective brainpower wasnt enough to complete a single scenario. I remember trying Evergreen Gardens multiple times and completely failing because guests would keep getting lost while the idea of  deleting paths didnt make sense to us. We could constantly fight over the computer to play RCT until it appearently broke a few days laterI think our parents were sick of us fighting.Got a copy of RCT for my th birthday and it ended up being one of my favorite games. Me and my friends would try a lot of funny tricks to make money. One friend noticed that staff are paid at the end of each month so we would hire a bunch of staff as temp workers then fire them at the end of each month to save money. Another thing was directly connecting a ride exit to the entrance of a second ride and charging  for it. Unfortunately we did this on top of Leafy Lake and ended up with a bunch of drowned guests.We were also really bad at creating roller coasters. One day  we built a giant steel coaster which ended up having a  intensity rating. It was nicknamed The Exterminator and were incredibly happy when a single guest rode on it.,rct,df0pdro,5,t5_2rzsl

11286138,0,t3_610pxz,RCT vanilla Theyre all fairly straightforward in my opinion simple variations of the basic theme. I think Crumbly Woods is the least conventional of them as it asks the player if the unfavorability and reliability of the existing coasters is worth the space and demolition salvage you would earn from it.RCT CF Fiasco Forest and its not even close. Its clearly insane.RCT LL Urban Jungles conceit is just weird but offers a great tradeoff for the builder. Wacky Warren is also oddly executed. Thunderstorm Park is unusual but not overly so because weather vs shelter isnt an odd choice. And finally who cant forget the absurdity of Iceberg Islands or even Icarus Park?UCES The matrix themed park is quite weird.Also Fort anachronism is just weird and you might not even know it existed until now.RCT ewWW The Soviet park where everything is ugly but can be replaced with a shiny version is odd because theres no excitement difference between ugly and new. Eco Salvage makes you profit from buying land really! and Japanese Coast pushes the problems with height limits to the maximum unless you want to spend all you own on land.I never tried TT scenarios,rct,dfb9msl,8,t5_2rzsl

11348400,0,t3_61xnyd,While RCT doesnt have a sandbox mode the scenario editor essentially allows the player to build one so this game does tailor to both the strategist park management and the artist custom coaster building. If you fit into either of these demographics or both as I do you will not find RCT boring.A common opinion among RCT enthusiasts is that the scenarios featured in the original RCT are superior to those featured in RCT. However RCT contains the aforementioned scenario editor allowing players to create their own scenarios so if you dont find RCTs ingame scenarios stimulating enough you can always download more from players who have built their own. There are thousands of downloadable scenarios out there and most of them take at least an hour or so to complete individually. You will effectively not run out of gameplay.If building custom roller coasters with spectacular scenery interests you RCTs interface is not only easier to use than just about any game in its category but the basic ingame scenery is nonspecific enough so that just about any theme can be executed properly without deviating from the same six wall sets. If you grow tired of the vanilla sceneryits been  years and I still haventthere is enough custom content out there to keep you going for decades. Not to mention OpenRCT which further eliminates many of the limitations of vanilla RCT. I still havent made the switch theres so much left to explore in the original version.If you were given the game for free you might as well keep it whether or not you choose to buy Planet Coaster or another theme park simulation game. Youve been blessed with a copy of one of the most versatile simulation games ever made. ,rct,dfibjmm,6,t5_2rzsl
