11761300,0,t1_dgsyn6v,I loved that scene for precisely all the reasons you just mentioned.  He was stiff and expressionless a mediocre actor with a weird voice who speaks entirely in cliche.  And I really think that was the whole point.  He wasnt the Hollywood version of what we think of when we think secret police.  He wasnt scary looking.  His voice wasnt intimidating.  Hes not an evil genius.  Hes just an average guy.  And yet he represents something profoundly sinister.  Hes a perfect expression of the banality of evil.,TheHandmaidsTale,dgt68hs,128,t5_3fhbh
11762799,0,t1_dgssl74,I thought that Dont You Forget About Me during episode s closing was really smart and tastefully done. It felt like the right amount of cheeky and I like that it reminds the viewer that the show is both of a bygone and futuristic era.,TheHandmaidsTale,dgtccbu,41,t5_3fhbh

11774886,0,t1_dgumc2n,I saw Offred attacking him as a release from her anger about Moiras death and rage at the helplessness of her situation since we dont really get to see that much in other ways. I think theyll probably be changing the storyline of the resistance which Im really curious about. ,TheHandmaidsTale,dgupvf7,19,t5_3fhbh

11800439,0,t1_dgxe1s9,I am not trolling your questions just come from a really bizarre idea of what the point of this story is supposed to be i.e. missing the forest for the trees completely. ,TheHandmaidsTale,dgxmcnw,0,t5_3fhbh
