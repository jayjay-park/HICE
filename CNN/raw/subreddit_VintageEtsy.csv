Even if I was out at a brick and mortar shop if I were to overhear the shop owner saying his items for sale are just the bottom of the barrel I dont think  I would buy anything.It comes off as snooty and demeaning. There is no other way to slice it. Some people collect Faberg eggs and other people collect Pez Dispensers if you catch my drift? ,VintageEtsy,chpsbj6,2,t5_31rkk

I havent officially launched yet but Ive been thrifting for several years just as a hobby and now I figure I should do something with my collection. Ive noticed is definitely harder to find great stuff. Its still fun though. Hmm Im not sure how to post a pic of the dress?,VintageEtsy,ctkv7z5,1,t5_31rkk
