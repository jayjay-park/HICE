I give one to Student A one to Student B. I make them write down each others answers. Then I get them to tell me  some of their partners responses. This is a good way to practice listening and reporting information while minimizing TTT. If necessary I teach them phrases we can use to express our opinions agree and disagree. Then I open it up to group discussions.
