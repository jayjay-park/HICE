It was nice to be able to curse again especially after their last mission. But talking to Kyo like that was probably a big no.

Theyre a lot like people in that regard. As for if they can be seen that depends on what form theyre taking and if they want to be noticed.

Then again they did order pounds of meat most days out of the week In any case Kana took a seat at her usual table a table near the back with enough room for her rather large wolf to curl up next to her. Ah miss the usual? Inuzuka? She tapped the table with her long nails to get the waitress attention her face in a deep frown before a tight forced smile tugged at her lips struggling not to seem demanding or rude.

She flattens her ears back against her head moving a bit closer to the boy. Her attention is snatched away by the objects that Yogen had placed on the ground. What are you doing out here?
