153956,0,t3_1vusp4,Soulbound is an actionadventure game in which you play as the Beastmaster an intrepid explorer who dares to venture where others do not. While you have seen much of the world you are not the greatest of warriors. By taming monsters you encounter on your travels you can use their power and skills against their former allies.The game takes place in the abandoned city of Caladan the greatest of ancient states. What was once a city filled with light has now turned into a dark abyss. Thread carefully for your next step could be your last! ,indiegames,cevytmz,2,t5_2qrf3

1066524,0,t3_267ltr,Pretty cool! My only criticism is that as far as Ive seen the game stays the same all the way through I got up to trillions of health but the threats scaled with me so I was just doing the same thing as before.I suggest the health stations should gradually get further and further apart do they? and you should allow the player to make up the difference by being skilful and careful.For example it would be fun to mix it up by adding new abilities Id love to be able to collect a oneuse health potion that will restore my health to max or a shield that stops any one hit from killing me I go down to  health and the shield breaks. Or a way to jump over an especially nasty square.,indiegames,chpio7v,1,t5_2qrf3

8323835,0,t1_d5hcwq6,Thanks for the response! Im just starting to get into writing about video game so I really appreciate the time you took to write out a detailed reply. I agree with a lot of what you said but to give a little bit of context to what I wrote heres a couple pointsgtBut what about Ocarina of Time? Its retro but aside from graphics that game holds up amazingly well and is essentially the same game that Nintendo still copies to this day for all the Zelda titles up to Skyward Sword. The reality is that theyre just polishing the same idea with a new coat of paint.I actually would argue that is significantly more than just graphics that keep OoT from holding up in the way you described. I think that there are a significant number of flaws in the game that make playing through it today less enjoyable at least for me. For example the puzzles often rely largely on the novelty of exploring a D space so a lot of them felt more like glorified hide and seek than an actual utilization of my intelligence. Also much of the battling is based on just waiting for an opening so it feels a bit slow and dated. Not to say it isnt a masterpiece because it is. But I think that a lot of what made the game great was how novel the puzzlescombatetc. were and now that that format of puzzlescombat are so much more common I feel that OoTs puzzles and combat dont dazzle nearly as much if you dont consider historical context. Thats the point I was trying to make there.gtThe example of Mega Man and its dominance in the generation of D platformers  that wasnt a generation that is still ongoing.When I talk about the generation in which D platformers dominated I definitely didnt mean to imply that there arent good D platformers around now nor that the historically good D platformers arent still great. I was talking about the generation of video game design before D platformers existed when D platformers like Castlevania and Megaman were by far the most popular kind of games. I would definitely say that the generation of D platformer dominance is over but that in no way means that D platformers arent still greatpopular. It just means that there are a lot of other kinds of games that are just as greatpopular nowadays.gtWith that said I dont think the argument is supported by discounting games like Uncharted. AAA Studios certainly do a great job of story telling  Metal Gear Final Fantasy Zelda Witcher  all of these are very impressive games with amazing depth and story telling. Its just that they tell a pretty safe story.Thats a good point I certainly shouldnt discount the quality of storytelling in big budget game development. But its like you pointed out  most of these stories are fairly safe and as such they serve to make an already good game even better. On the other hand Ive played through a lot of indie games where the quality of the game rests solely or at least largely on the success of the storytelling. Gone Home Epistory Typing Chronicles Undertale etc. So I think the point is still somewhat valid albeit much more nuanced than I had put it.gtthe ones about introduction of controller schemes or use of environments isnt something that tells us anything about how good a game is  those are just artistic decisions to be made.This is the one thing that I really disagree with  I think that these two elements of game design are very critical in determining the quality of a game. Environmental cues can be a hugely important part of storytelling and environmental elements can play a huge role in gameplay as well for example strategically navigating the environment in a game like Metal Gear Solid or Hitman. And the way the control scheme is introduced can have a major impact on player immersion and on making the player feel like theyve accomplished something which I would definitely argue is far more than just an artistic factor. This video better explains my argument about control schemes  watch from  onwards gt I dont know how we discuss all that and arrive at the conclusion that its easier to analyze what makes a good game at a fundamental level.Upon rereading this I definitely agree with you  Id like to think that my examples throughout the first  of the piece were a little bit better than you claimed but I can definitely see that this last paragraph wasnt very well supported. Let me try to better explain what I meant to say.I think indie games have been a powerful force in diversifying the games that are currently available to players. That much is readily apparent from the examples that both you and I provided. I think that while we certainly were asking very general questions about game design and storytelling before indie games became popular I think that its also fair to say that there used to be more of a focus on genrespecific development. That is to say criticism of FPS games tended to focus on FPSspecific issues and were less willing to question issues with elements like the storytelling. That was my personal experience with video game criticism when I was younger  if your experience was different feel free to disagree. Id love to hear your take on this point because I definitely admit that my evidence is fairly circumstantial.That point aside I think that we can both agree that indie games have pushed the envelope in terms of developing games that reach across genres and that highlight elements of game design that werent previously regarded as seriously like storytelling. So I think my point there would be that this diversity of games has made us less quick to jump to genrespecific criticisms of games. Instead I think that we now rely on more general questions at least to a larger degree than before. For example I dont think that an FPS twenty years ago would have been as soundly criticized for not having a good story e.g. Doom. Whereas as you pointed out nowadays even FPS games like Uncharted have great stories and criticism of those kinds of games tends to value storytelling more highly than it used to. I think its fair to say that this is in part because video game journalists now have to deal with a much more diverse variety of games than span genres more often than they used to and that this trend is partly a result of indie development.,indiegames,d5i193x,1,t5_2qrf3

11459978,0,t1_dfukrc5,Obviously thats up to the dev but if you spent a year making a game would you want to just give away the assets? Its basic geometry. To help you out what makes it look good is that everything fits together. The colors arent detailed textures but the all work together. The scaling of everything fits. Pop open blender watch a couple tutorials and you can make that stuff pretty easy.,indiegames,dfuzbtz,4,t5_2qrf3
11698601,0,t3_66vdcq,If this is your trailer OP Id like to offer some helpful criticism. The intro is far too long. We also dont need everything the narrator is saying in text form.. The music choice seems quite off. If this is the official soundtrack then Im not sure what else to say but the game definitely doesnt seem like heavy metalpower ballad material. Something more spacey like a soundscape would be more appropriate. If you need royaltyfree music theres always You could probably cut off at least  seconds from the trailer and it would be easier to watch. Cut off some of the intro narration show just a brief amount of combat maybe pick something more actiony like ships blowing up since that grabs attention condense the end of the trailer and get a different song.Thats my twocents anyways. Best of luck!,indiegames,dgm1zm8,2,t5_2qrf3
