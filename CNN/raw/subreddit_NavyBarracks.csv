5685976,0,t1_cx1g2ll,Inspired by your words. I somewhat relate to your position feeling Ive never given my sexuality the chance to develop naturally. I consider myself on the gay end of the spectrum but often wonder if I would be asexual if I hadnt latched on to gay images at a early age. Thanks for sharing your story here.,NavyBarracks,cx1wf9e,2,t5_3amze

5966663,0,t3_3x4yts,Agreed.   No sense in giving up now.   This was a long way to come and Im confident that we can see this thing through with zero casualties.  Lets do this...,NavyBarracks,cy1rejm,1,t5_3amze
