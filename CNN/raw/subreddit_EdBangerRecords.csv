11345645,0,t1_dfi0786,timbre The way something sounds not as in tone but what distinguishes one instrument or sound from anotherpatch settings for a synthesizerrelease a setting on a synthesizer that dictates once the midi note ends how long it keeps going.   immediately stops anything above that means it slowly fades outAll those look relevant to what theyre talking aboutI dont see any words he used that wasnt to drive a point and the point was that he thought it had less energy than what hes used to from JusticeDont get me wrong I liked the Stress edit but they have valid points that arent riamverysmart lmao,EdBangerRecords,dfi0bt7,2,t5_2tnz5
11350629,0,t1_dfijqpi,Its hard to pick on AVD for one favorite but the tracks I like especially throughout are Horsepower OnnOn New Lands and Helix in no particular order.And yeah Id agree that the newly added synths dont mesh completely well with the Stress samples. Not that its totally the fault of the synths during the new bits its the composition as a whole thats not completely there.Im not really familiar with Ed Rec percussion and cant recall the sound from memory cant check atm. uZoleol is the Ed Rec percussion dude so he might know.,EdBangerRecords,dfikmva,1,t5_2tnz5

11437660,0,t1_dfsfq0i,Love that Hey Joe remix. In a way hes gotten progressively softer with his last few remixes. Dont Play No Game That I Cant Win is brutal Hey Joe while sharply contrasted in the mix is relatively softer with the synths then on Bonnie and Clyde he really dialed it down. Theyre all tasteful in their own way maybe well get a new track in the general direction of Arabest.,EdBangerRecords,dfsg4pi,6,t5_2tnz5
