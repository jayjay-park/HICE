8344266,0,t3_4tm6nd,The only spots Ive ever waded on the Big Manistee are at Tippy Dam.  You can park on either the north or south side.  As of a few weeks ago the water was very low could wade in a ton of spots yet still a fast as hell current.  Pretty much youve got a few hundred yards downstream from the Dam on either side to wade in.  Can also fish above the coffer as well.  Check out Green Cottage on the PM.  Amazing spot and Ive caught plenty of fish there.  Stop into the Pere Marquette River Lodge and theyve got maps and can explain a lot.  For the Au Sable theyve got maps at the Old Au Sable Fly Shop as well.  Both stores have some quite helpful and knowledgeable employees. As a first year fly fisherman Ive absolutely loved those rivers and had a blast on them.  Have always caught fish on all of em!  Thats how I learned wade able parts of the more popular fly streams so far. ,michiganflyfishing,d5kl5f4,1,t5_376h2
