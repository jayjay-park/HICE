11129789,0,t3_5yw8qx,Honestly Ive never really wanted a ton more power out of these trucks. I do have to say that Ive never driven a  truck only s. I drove my dads  with a stock w in highschool and honestly its plenty. Youre not gonna win any races but it can tow a trailer perfectly fine. My current truck a  with a m with headers intake and RV cam pulls just fine putting hp and lbft to the tire. Bunch of torque down low  rpm with not a lot above that. If youre gonna do an engine swap a mildly built w is gonna be your best bet. hp lbft is pretty easy to get with some gt heads and a mild cam. Youve either got to use a quarterhorse to tune the ecu or a carb conversion which will get you mpg. There are kits to swap in a coyote probably . swaps as well but youd get much more bang for your buck building a w. The extra few grand you save could be put towards gas. You wont be able to get stellar gas milage out of a bronco. Theyre lb bricks on wheels. You might see  highway out of a coyote swap vs  highway out of a w plus a good k in your pocket. As for brakes you can swap the f master cylinder booster and rear brake cylinders and itll stop really well. Its about a  upgrade and it stops like a modern truck. Past that I dont really know of much.Also that bronco while very clean is way over priced imo. You can find a very nice bronco in the k range especially somewhere like Texas where they dont rust out. ,bronco,detjvkc,3,t5_2tgg8
