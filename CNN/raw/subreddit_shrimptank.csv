1447106,0,t1_cixnqde,This is my Walstad method shrimp bowl. I am quite aware of Dianas methods. First of all pants do not absorb ammonia well trace amounts I will grant you. They will however absorb some ammonium through their leaves. Now when fishshrimp produce waste they create Urea which breaks down into Ammonium and Ammonia. While plants absorb the ammonium the ammonia goes through a cycle just like in any other aquarium. But instead of the bacteria living in a biological filter component they grow in the soil and among the roots of the plants. Walstads dont magically skip the cycle it just happens in a different way. Creating a tank with a lot of plants and a low bioload isnt skipping the cycle anymore than throwing a guppy in to cycle a  gallon would be. It takes longer but the incredibly small bioload may give the illusion that the cycle has been skipped.  I apologize if I seemed harsh but I believe that some of the things you are saying are analogous to Petsmart employees telling people that bettas will do just fine in a bowl. It isnt that it cant be done but it is a gross oversimplification and mildly misleading.,shrimptank,cixo5vx,1,t5_2v6xy

6222176,0,t3_40o96j,Its fully cycled when  ppm ammonia is fully processed in  hours.  That means after adding the ammonia  hours later theres  ammonia  nitrites and nitrates are so high off the charts they are toxic.  Then you do a complete water change to safely add animals.So wait you detect nitrates?  Thats good they you remove via water changes.It sounds like you have the first type of bacteria but not a full colony of the second yet.If you do anything to reduce nitrites in competition to the bacteria it will inhibit bacteria development.  Also high levels of ammonia will too bacteria like good water conditions too.  I would do frequent small water changes to keep levels reasonable until its cycled.  ,shrimptank,cyww72h,0,t5_2v6xy

6477744,0,t3_448www,Dont worry about lowering your pH. You want them to have a stable environment. Focus on just keeping your pH stable. Just having lots of wood in your tank will leach tannins and help to lower the pH.

6724784,0,t1_d0etc8x,Adding this separately rather than editing so its not missed after mulling everything over.If a couple huge water changes dont alter their behavior then Id suspect the high pH.  I do run .. here the highest end of the range but have heard another with troubles over .   is also the top end of the range Ive seen for them but not preferredhealthiest.  It might not sound like much but given the logarithmic scale of pH  is ten times as much alkaline so . is not close to . at all.  Your high mineral content will buffer it from changing too readily.  I might also cut in a great amount of distilled than you are in the future if the water changes with same parameters dont help and do daily smaller water changes to phase that in and add something with acidity to the tank to help maintain it.,shrimptank,d0ewg88,2,t5_2v6xy

The stock lighting was enough for Java fern and Anubias but they grew slowly and I wanted more of a jungle effect so I replaced it with a Finnex Stingray and started using COfluval mini. I think the baby shrimplets really appreciate the algae that comes with stronger light and they keep the plants free from algae. I recommend setting up the tank with plants and all and letting it run for  weeks or so before adding shrimp so you get a good growth of biofilm for them to eat. I find the the integrated filter easy to deal with I just  gently rinse the sponge every month and it is nice having a place to hide the heater. All in all I have had a good experience with the spec  as a RCS tank and would buy one again.,shrimptank,d9xhorb,2,t5_2v6xy
9671599,0,t1_da3ihh1,Whether or not a betta will eat shrimp totally depends on the individual betta although many do. Heres my experience Added one ghost shrimp didnt get eaten. Added  more once I knew he wouldnt eat them and then he ate them all. Later I added a single amano and she didnt get eaten. But I think if I had put a bunch of amanos in there they wouldve become food too  it just increases the chance of shrimpbetta encounters when you have more and once the betta learns he can eat them its game over.,shrimptank,da5871i,1,t5_2v6xy

10113090,0,t3_5kokix,Cherry shrimp have very fast life cycles and only live for just under a year. It more than likely died of old age rather than something you caused. Problems molting and genetic complications caused by mass inbreeding are also common. Everything in your tank sounds like its running fine.Unfortunately youve probably had a few others die as well. Its very hard to notice when the bodies get cleaned up almost instantly and they multiply like crazy. ,shrimptank,dbpqthx,3,t5_2v6xy

10156127,0,t3_5lfc63,I would ask him to pay or help pay for the shrimp. Even if he thinks he just turned off the light only he shouldnt have been messing with stuff that is not his anyways.I would just be firm and polite with him. Tell him that if you accidently ruined something of his you would  help pay for the replacement even if you didnt do it on purpose. Accidents happen but we have to be responsible for them. Sorry about your loss and good luck starting new! Hopefully your plants are just fine and a few water changes can get you back on track.,shrimptank,dbv94ti,46,t5_2v6xy

11365432,0,t3_624qrn,Note shrimp typically dont need a heater.Shrimp also dont need lights.  Plants do need light but many low light plants can grow with ambient lights.  Also a regular Cree LED daylight bulbs in cheap Home Depot clip on fixture does great and is the right wavelengths for plants and discourage algae.  You dont need a special aquarium light light is light of the valuable wavelengths.  Also check rAquaSwap ,shrimptank,dfk90g3,2,t5_2v6xy
