1848994,0,t1_ckbzsl3,gtBoth Cuba and Vietnam are not fully communist countries.Well communism is a stateless society so I dont think anyone claims they are. No state has claimed to reach communism that Im aware of. By communism I assumed you meant communist ruled ie MarxistLeninist. Which both Cuba and Vietnam are as is China arguably. gtCuba is run by two brothers Raul and Fidel.Yes the Castro family has a lot of influence in the government but theyre not absolute dictators. Its just like the US has important families like the Bushs and Clintons. Nepotism is endemic to all class societies. I dont think the Castro familys degree of influence is necessarily healthy but a dictatorship that does not make. gtVietnam employs capitalism much like china does.Sure its a socialist oriented market economy. Vietnam needs to build the material basis for socialism before it can have it which according to some theories means going through a stage of capitalism. Stalin for example tried to bypass it through direct state control over the economy with rapid industrialization. Vietnam is taking a more gradual approach and using market forces and foreign investment to build their industry in a less harsh way. If their government is to be believed they will eventually transition the industries to the democratic control of the working class. This makes them a communist nation. gtAnd both Cuba and Vietnam were propped up and set up by The USSR and China.Yes but both are independent now. Vietnam also had a really devastating civil warnational liberation.  ,MHOC,ckbzzd7,1,t5_31ykc

1978143,0,t3_2hcq3b,This represents some of the ugliest most ignorant classist thinking Ive encountered in the House. Fee paying schools ARE charities. They raise immense amounts of money for good causes as do their pupils and their pupils parents. They also provide untold benefit to academically gifted pupils who otherwise wouldnt have the means of achieving their potential. Plus they provide massive public benefit by reducing strain on state educational infrastructure sharing facilities with state schools providing better academic results and more rounded pupils than the state sector is able to and providing scholarships and bursaries so that those unable to afford the fees can attend.I put it to the House that none of those advocating this Bill have children of their own otherwise they would make the same decision that Dianne Abbot Janet Murray Ruth Kelly and other antiprivate school campaigners have made and admit their hypocrisy.If implemented and I hope that it will never be this Bill would further entrench the privilege of the rich as the resultant rise in fees would not affect their ability to send their children to such schools. It would however have a drastic impact on the scholarships and bursaries available to poorer applicants and price out the aspirational middle classes who have always been prepared to sacrifice the most to improve their childrens chances in life by sending them to such schools. Instead private schools will become the preserve of the rich elite with academically gifted middle and working class parents having to take their chances with a state system that as clearly demonstrated by the names mentioned above does not serve the needs of such children as well as the private sector that they would no longer be able to attend. The likes of Anthony Crosland have done untold harm to the education of our nations youth and seeing this kind of vindictive approach still being adopted decades after it was shown to be wrong rotten and to harm those it claimed to be helping makes me ashamed of the ignorance of certain members of this House and afraid for the future of our nations children as public schools would become the preserve of the rich. ,MHOC,ckrkedh,4,t5_31ykc

The PM in COBRA would have been fully in the picture and respect that the  police commanders on the ground would have assessed the situation fully and the same would apply for the use of the military in Military Assistance to the Civil Authority. That would only happen if the Gold Commander requested it nothing stopping the PM to request the CDS to stand units that were trained for the role required to stand to for deployment when the gold commander requested it.note this would not be the TA    National security would have been perfect grounds not to discuss this with other MPs about deployment of the cannon water cannons are slow to deploy if MPs had to debate them moving from one place to another the situation could have got a lot worse or allowed another situation to happen and if further loss of life had occurred trust between the Senior Police officers MPs and the law abiding public would have been damaged as a media blame game would have started.What I do find surprising with the whole incident was no reports of baton rounds being fired by the police if the situation had escalated to water canon use then it was because baton rounds were ineffective.,MHOC,cmbifh4,1,t5_31ykc

The Zapatista rebels refuse to accept anything from the Mexican government although many thousands in their area live in poverty. We also dont know much about the Zapatistas ability to remain safe and protect themselves from drug cartels and crime. Recent reports indicate that many of their poor migrate to big Mexican cities from economic pressure and Mexican journalist Jose Olmos claims they are declining.

3147380,0,t1_coo21fa,gtLegalising will I worry provide tacit support for drug abuse and instead create a worse effect  an increase of drug usage due to societies acceptance.Drug usage is not in itself I feel a bad thing. Suppose for instance alcohol usage halves and cannabis usage doubles. The overall effect of that is actually a huge net gain. What this bill does is state far more clearly than current legislation the likelihood of harm which then informs the ease of access. In conjunction with honest and clear education as the bill recommends this seems much much better than the current technique.And anyway your own strategy is selfdefeating. ConsidergtIf we can stop the substance from being created or distributed we can ensure people are not damaged by itBut you cannot stop creation or distribution and therefore you have no control whatsoever as to the damage caused. You cant use say taxes as a mechanism to reduce consumption or allow the free and open transfer of information around certain drugs in an open or more open marketplace. Instead you advocate making small dents here and there without protecting those people who already have easy access to these unregulated substances.Surely the current strategy is madness.,MHOC,coo80xq,1,t5_31ykc
3157188,0,t1_cop8erz,Well I shall explain my points in more detail thenThe removal of the  age means that people who are not adults will have the right to completely transform and disfigure their bodies. Teenagers are pumped full of hormones all day every day and are prone to rash decisions. The sexuality of teenagers is also something many find confusing. Most people have no idea what their sexuality is until the time at which they are an adult. If a person is going through a large phase in their life and has their physical gender changed during such a period in their life they may regret such a decision greatly.An adult has had enough life experience to make responsible choices and so  should in this members opinion be the age limit.In regards to the removal of previous lines many of the lines of legislation do not even impact this current piece of legislation. Particularly gregarious is the lack of a link to the legislation being changed in the OP and no quotes of the lines being removed. It seems to me to be akin to someone taking a butchers knife on previous legislation for the sake of it.In regards to my final point I do not think you should be allowed to choose a different gender. I think that people should stick with male and female. A future in which people modify their bodies in strange and in my opinion disgusting ways to create whole new genders is not something I want. ,MHOC,cop8npz,2,t5_31ykc

3260800,0,t3_2xgm2x,As I suggested to you on Skype either that supply and confidence deals can be arranged with parties and MPs not int the formal coalition agreement which would then add the seats of those parties MPs to that coalitions total for determining the Government. For example entirely hypothetical I know the CP would likely not have gone for it at the time the TLC making such an agreement with the CP would have put them in Government the first time around but not brought the CP into the coalition.Or my preferred more democratic more reliable but admittedly more of a pain in the arse solutionEach new Government must be approved by a majority vote of Parliament. Then rather than supply and confidence deals a coalition just needs to secure other MPs votes.Each method to varying extents would ensure that the most powerful coalition the coalition supported by the most MPs which  in representative democracy can also be said to be the coalition supported by the largest proportion of voters is the coalition that actually ends up in government thus creating stronger and more representative governments in future.It could also liven things up a bit for those who find themselves outside a coalition who may be able to get concessions and promises from coalition in return for their supply and confidence agreement or confirmation vote.

However especially in the case of the MHoC where private contracts were banned and with all parties pledging to keep the NHS free at the point of use it is certainly overly weaponised. In real politics I feel both the apparent calamity of Labour in running it and the apparent mass privatisation by the Tories in running it are grossly overstated and it needs to be cut down on.gtIn regards to the previous question what measures would have to be made to take the politics out of healthcare?Im not sure it can be its so important to the people. I believe in stability so a consistent course of action within the NHS is important for its success in between governments so I live in hope that parties dont chop and change at every available moment. It cant be wasteful but it must be wellfunded too.gtAdditionally can I ask about student tuition fees should they be changed?

Since its separation from the rest of Ireland  years ago Northern Ireland has built up a unique social cultural political nation. Thats why as its own significant that is its not just new lines drawn on a map like your example nation it has the right to decide on its own future as it is separate and unique. In your Scotland example youre looking at two randomly assigned places with no identities.

Perhaps it would be easier to simply give all homeless people free accommodation and support.If you were to join our party you could write a bill to introduce that and if the majority of the party supported it then it could be put forward to the house. ,MHOC,cptxuz7,3,t5_31ykc

This bill brings all schools under LEA control effectively banning private schools and other forms of independent schooling. The bill sets out a time table for this process which would conclude in .  This bill sets out how this process would take place via the use of LEIs invested with the legal power to move through the stages set out in Section . to place Independent schools under LEA control This bill sets out how this system will be policed via the use of LEIs as set out under Section . This bill has been fully costed in partnership with the Chancellor PM and rest of the Government.

3971440,0,t3_35ygv6,Opening speechMr SpeakerI present to the House a proposal for reform in how the UK distributes a portion of its allocated international development or foreign aid budget.It is an open secret that much foreign aid money flowing from developed countries to those countries less fortunate ends up in the hands of corrupt officials and does not effect those projects which would help the poorest on the planet. Where foreign aid is awarded to a countrys government rather than to local communities themselves it is difficult for the Department for International Development to track how the money is used and precisely how it served to improve lives in a meaningful way. This needs to change.The solution presented here is not original. It is commonplace in the voluntary sector  through grants  and is already used to some extent by the DfID albeit not as a tendered process. However by earmarking a specific amount in an open and transparent selection process where foreign aid money is used for specific projects in candidate countries we hope to ensure that a good portion of the UKs contribution is spent on effective projects and schemes to truly improve the plight of the worlds poorest citizens.I welcome the Houses comments in this reading.,MHOC,cr8z70v,4,t5_31ykc

4091268,0,t3_37gv4o,Mr. Deputy Speaker I will have to take my time in outlining why I am for this Motion. If it is permitted I feel that I will be writing at great length in regards to it. So I begin.The freedom of speech which is doubtless what the Communists will fall back upon is something which must be protected. It is an absolute  one cannot have the freedom of speech terms and conditions apply see in store for details. It is the mainstay the keystone of all liberalism  that people be allowed to say and criticise what they wish. A communist is allowed to be a communist attend rallies speak out against capitalism organise protests and such other things. I as a liberal am allowed to be liberal. I can criticise communist ideology and I do often I can use ad hon. if I so wish Which I have only done once and attack verbally their ideas pertaining to economic structures and such. Thus is the freedom of speech thought and critique  peaceful protests and demonstrations are allowed. They can present their case in a civil manner as is usually seen outside of city and town halls up and down the country and in journals and periodicals. However this is where the detachment from this and the Red Brigades and whatever vestiges of the Squadristi remain occurs. The Red Brigades pose a threat to people. They are dangerous. This House has been told by their commissar time and again that they are an armed group created to agitate people and fight an invisible enemy  anyone who is not a communist. This is not the Wiemar Republic we do not want a Sparticist Uprising we do not want people to feel threatened by an armed ideologically driven militia. They are as evidence has shown I refer of course to my hon. friends the Shadow Secretary of State for Business and Trade   statement armed and dangerous to the public. In short  they are the S.A. of the Communist Party. For these reasons they are a threat to the freedom of speech. Who would try to protest the Government if one of the Governments own Parties  has a militia on side? Who is to say that a rogue element decides to kick off the revolution early? We have already seen such a group the Mercia Free State try this and enact harm upon the right hon. RandomPhotographer  who is to say that it will not happen again? To conclude protest groups are a good thing. They point out problems which Governments cause on the ground as it were and criticism is important in any democratic society yes even bourgeois liberal democracy but militias are the complete antithesis of this. They are the bane of democracy and the living death of it. Why argue a point when one can simply point a gun at someone to make them agree? I thought the Communists were against state violence. ,MHOC,crmmoau,7,t5_31ykc

Even with citations statistics can be presented misleadingly and a simply citation cannot indicate the reliability or objectivity of a source. As such the focus of the campaign should both inform of the campaign but also strongly encourage following through on the footnotes and engaging in further reading. To this end I propose an amendment with the goal that any cited material is available to the public at no cost. It is a mockery of a law if a paper can hide behind  books and thus restrict access to further information indirectly. For copyrighted material this could be achieved by IPSO action  the sources would have to be provided to IPSO as soon as possible after the publication of the piece at which point a judgement would be made on which portions of the source provide the argument and its context. Those sections would be made available in libraries and online at no cost. The purchasing of the rights for such sections would be waived by this law.,MHOC,csns4ir,1,t5_31ykc

Its not the rejection of progress but the rejection of progress for progress sake. Therefore retaining our institutions and values is core to this. These values especially include community spirit and working for the country  society.There are also key economic principles which are important  the idea that its an individuals work and innovation that gives them the life they want not the state encouraging business and innovation making work pay and not intervening in a market that largely functions best on its own.

4571525,0,t3_3dnigl,Opening SpeechMy intention with this bill is to fight the exploitation of young workers in this country. In this current job economy young people are finding it hard enough to get good work and start earning. What makes the situation more difficult is companies and employers misleading or enticing young people looking for work in positions where they are exploited for their time and labour.Jobs with no base wage or commission only jobs leave young people with very little money in their pocket way below the minimum wage. Unpaid internships are also exploited as young people are in positions for sometimes up to a year without receiving any form of income. Its the modern day slave trade which companies think they can get away with because young people are willing and desperate to find any form of work they can in this job economy but it has to stop.Im proud to introduce this bill with my partys support that will make a strong positive impact to the lives and earnings to many young people. I hope that this effective action will be supported by all of those in this house who want to improve the working environment in this country. Thank You.uwwesmudge,MHOC,ct6unpl,3,t5_31ykc

4829287,0,t3_3gp6vt,Hear hear!The World Cup is a prestigious event which has gone on since  only ever being cancelled twice for the Second World War. Through its history countries from around the World have bid to compete for the honour of hosting the world cup. Sixteen countries have had the opportunity to host this event and this has not just been the winners. The beauty of the bidding system is that any country whether successful or not can host the event. However there is a difference between letting countries host the tournament despite being bad at football and allowing countries to host the world cup who have never previously appeared in the tournament. There are other more deserving countries such as Morocco who despite four bids are yet to host the Netherlands who despite two bids are yet to host and of cost our noble country England who have only hosted the World Cup once. All these countries treat there workers as human people and have common decency. This motion is exactly what we as a role model country should be doing. If we dont make a stand then countries will be allowed to get away with the poor treatment of workers. This motion is England standing up and drawing a line for everyone to see.,MHOC,cu39sdr,1,t5_31ykc

They are simply defending democracy and I would commend them for it. However this defence is misplaced they have chosen to defend the right of a convicted criminal who is serving jail time to stand for election to our House Of Commons. I think this is fundamentally wrong not because of the crimes the person committed but because they cannot fulfill the duties of a Member of Parliament. All elected members should have the option to take their seats it is a free choice to do so. However they should at least have the option to represent their constituency in the Supreme Assembly of the Land. Whereas prisoners have no option I see no reason why they should be allowed to stand for MP.

6894161,0,t3_4a68no,May I commend the Prime Minister for finally launching the great Press Inquiry.

Too long have we been plagued by downright false articles as an example.,MHOC,d0xrs2b,2,t5_31ykc
6897061,0,t3_4a68no,gt but the fact that people can fake whatever they like and it can be printed is a prime example of our desperate need to regulate the press and investigate the conduct of its outlets.This is possibly one of the most worrying lines a Head of Government could say. No it isnt It is a sign of a Free Press and a Free Society. The state should have no role in determining what is right and what is wrong the state should never be involved in what the press does and does not publish and it is disgraceful that the government would risk infringing on the Press absolute right to hold those in positions of power to account. It does not matter if it is true it is up to the public to determine if they trust the article based on the paper the source the article the context and any rebuttal given by the subject of the article.The Prime Minister and members of the Government need to take a step and think about what they are actually suggesting. IRL the Daily Mail published allegations that David Cameron once stuck is penis in a pig these are far as we know now are almost certainly untrue would the government have the Daily Mail censored for publishing a story like this? The book published with the allegations banned? The Prime Minister may have had libelous stories against him but surely he isnt so weak as a individual that as soon as someone publishes something untrue about him he runs off and cries and demands they be censored?If press regulation goes ahead I will reignite the Liberal Press and publish whatever is given to me weather I think its real or not and might even go out my way to find stuff that isnt true out of spite. The Content of the Press should not be regulated by the government. Even if the content was obtained illegally the Press still has a duty to publish it the Snowden leaks were obtained illegally but were a necessary and important revelation. Slippery slops is not a fallacy it is a legitimate description of what happens. Once society adapts to something and gets used to it it is easier to push something more extreme. Its how most progress in society happens but it is also how tyranny can form without is knowing.I would also note the worrying detachment of this speaker from his predecessors to put more and more power away from meta decision makers and more towards the partisan minority government that may not even have the confidence of the house this is not a attack on this government but it is a fact of our system that we do not have a queens speech. Before something like this would be done in the meta realm and I just more trust the Speakership in the past then partisan politicians who are victims of the Press.,MHOC,d0y3meg,10,t5_31ykc

I think this is a much stronger argument devoid of the necrophiliac element  the organ provision most of all. I would still argue that all of these postmortem actions should require the deceaseds prior consent. I just dont see individuals solely as a means to societal advancement. I believe that its only right that I have the deciding say in how my body used  requesting to be buried after a certain religious service being cremated and spread at a specific spot volunteering my organs donating my body to science etc. I dont think that sexual lust falls in the same category as saving lives. Neither do I think that economic benefits do. Life is too precious to be conceived of in terms of net societal gain  too many societies and governments that have thought in that way have led to mass rights abuses the cheapening of life and thus the massive loss of it. I also dont view necrophilia as a legitimate sexual desire not every want is right or should be tolerated by society. The push to banish all conceptions of morality or standards of correct conduct from the sexual sphere  an understandable reaction to hundreds of years of with regard to some persuasions repression  is I think mistaken. ,MHOC,d1uakj7,1,t5_31ykc

The conditions they face on farms are nearly always greatly inhumane not to mention that they are denied their liberty their bodily and reproductive autonomy and many of their most basic natural instincts and preferences. To say were doing them animals a favour by routinely breeding and slaughtering them is ludicrous.So youre saying that for a sentient being to have the right to not be killed they must be able to not consent to it?

For another thing ISIS is a great threat to Britains safety and the safety of our own people as well as the many others they have already killed. ISIS is ultimately a totalitarian evil and fascistic reaction to imperialism in other words they are a terrible group to support.

If you rented a flat and the building burnt down you could no longer stay in the flat but your landlord assuming no foul play would have no liability for not giving you notice.

This is nothing particularly against the RSP more just increasing dissatisfaction and questioning of the method of politics in real life compared with the absolute mockery of this game. Some of my actions in the RSP dont line up with what I would be ok with in real life so Ive been questioning why I thought it ok in the game. I personally believe that some of what Ive done has violated some of the core ideas around which I helped found the RSP and as such I need to do a bit of soul searching.I plan to do a full series of pieces analysing the history and methods of each party including the greens and rsp and criticising where there are failures. Because make no mistake the RSP has its failures as do the Greens. MHoC is united in its utter incompetence in playing politics.I may come back to the RSP at some point and I am still happy to assist in any cabinets or other things they would like but for now I wish to be separated from direct party politics.ucolossalteuthid youve been an inspiration since I arrived when you conspired with us to start the RSP.

8335106,0,t3_4tqrmx,Mr Deputy SpeakerNot publicised or promoted by this government the American Secretary of State announced a memorandum of understanding. In this memorandum we had several announcements which were positive but some which are wholly inadequate for the time spent at the conference.To take one example I will pick up on the research and development section of the memorandum. The first bullet point states quite simply there will be closer cooperation between nations. The second bullet point then mentions closer partnership when it comes to space exploration. It is my belief that these understandings are no more than vague and meaningless promises to excuse the waste of time the conference was. Where will there be closer cooperation what are we looking at? A rhetorical question Madame Deputy Speaker which the Prime minister does not have to answer but I believe that its right to use such a technique to highlight how lacking this section is and how inadequate such an agreement is for the UK and the conference as a whole.In the second section I believe we can see quite clearly how uncompromising the nations in this conference were and how we have failed to influence other nations to see our  side of the story. The first bullet point does not infer cooperation between nation states but demonstrates division amongst the international community  a division which the Prime minister and his delegation failed to cure. No comment on military interventions is in my opinion wholly inexcusable. When talking about security and terrorism the fact that a conference can come out and say we will have no opinion one way or the other is an example of the lack of backbone and solution finding which has brought us to this mess in the first place with thousands dying due to terrorist incidents. No clear plan on who we shall be providing weapons too is also disastrous. I thought that would be obvious to say but alas it seems I have to remind the Prime minister that providing weapons with no plan it irresponsible and shameful. If there is such a plan it should have been highlighted by the Foreign Secretary and the government before I even typed this question. One good point the stabilising of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia is a good one. However again we see a lack of detail and as we know through experience it is easier said than done. No clear policy on Palestine as a result of the conference is amusing as it is terrifying. The fact this government was unable to influence our allies to come to an agreement on the issue says much about our standing and the Prime ministers standing in the world.Health and disease control section has potential much like the education section. Alas there is a striking lack of detail and I would have hoped the nations involved and especially the government would have fleshed out a proposal to be put forward to the House.Likewise the climate section is adequate and has potential. I expect to see legislation and a plan to put this into action.So what weve seen from this government was an incomplete and disastrous conference which we should be ashamed of. There are aspects which have potential I shall admit that but because of this government failure to push forward giving us the details they shall end up as nothing more than posturing words and pitiful promises. The public expected and demands more and the Conservative party will stand by them and not bow down and ignore such an issue which Her Majestys Most Loyal Opposition seems to do. Will the Prime minister concede to the House that this memorandum of understanding shows our lack of influence on the world stage due to his inability to even breach the gap between nations on issues such a military intervention and Palestine and would he also admit that this governments woeful desire for detail is worrying and must be addressed promptly?This will be the second time Ive asked this question after being ignored by the Right Honourable Prime Minister two weeks ago. Since then may I add my queries have not been addressed in either a ministerial statement to the House or to the press. ,MHOC,d5jfyl0,6,t5_31ykc

There has been no mention on how the government intends to reduce cancer causes such as obesity. On Brexit the government has failed to outline what sort of deal we shall be looking for. Are we to remain a member of the European single market? How can the Foreign Secretary on one hand denounce our NATO alliance as imperialists when he will be negotiating our terms of exit with those very same allies?Labour and the RSP have a clear divide amongst them when it comes to Brexit its as simple as that and why they have failed to consider Brexit.

In addition we shall ensure that all permanent and longterm cover teachers within schools and academies are fully qualified teachers.

This attempt by the NUP  a rather poor one at that  to turn our population against certain groups of people and impose special restrictions on citizens of other territories is really rather ludicrous. Firstly before we even get to the whole morality thing writing in law which territories we want to restrict is a really nonsensical attitude to foreign policy  one which does not recognise circumstance broadly discriminates against regions of the planet and cannot be easily amended or changed in accordance to the current affairs.Secondly this scapegoating by the rightwing parties particularly the NUP and UKIP is really rather unfounded  especially when we already have rigorous fair and sound background checks for entry into this country in the first place. It contravenes with EU law meaning that it is incompatible and may even be ineligible to become law.Discrimination based on country and the illusion that all members of these nations should be put to special register checks and scrutiny is not a progressive step in society nor a way to combat terrorism.This bill is stupid illegible to become law and xenophobic Mr Deputy Speaker.

10510889,0,t3_5qhzoj,Mr SpeakerIt is days such as these that I hang my head in shame for my party has lost its way. Once we were the party of the working man the same worker that has had his wages depreciated by free movement of cheap European workers the same worker that has had his democratic power robbed from him by the European Union and the same worker that this government is plotting to ignore.We did not vote to leave because we want everything to be exactly the same. The British People want real change not VAT cuts on tampons. This governments clear contempt for the vote has lead them to design a intricate plot.Firstly we look at Norway and say well have what theyre having. Well have our laws faxed to us and our tax take plundered. Then when the British people realise that theyve been had theyll be forced to vote again and realising what a pathetic deal this government will offer they will probably vote to remain.Mr Speaker I challenge my honourable friends to convince me otherwise tell me what fantastic bounties of riches and reward moving from EU to EEA membership will bring us without talking about the rewards wed get from simply leaving.All the wondrous prizes were offered leaving the CAP controlling VAT.

10662111,0,t3_5skbyk,Opening SpeechMr SpeakerAs part of this Governments desire to end the divisive and elitist Grammar School system and integrate secondary education as a National Comprehensive system we must remove the practice of selection by aptitude or ability.The Educational Testing Bill second Reading incorporates important protections regarding personal Data for students and in furtherance of the comprehensive education system that this government wishes to introduce we are now dismantling the Grammar School system entirely.Grammar schools provide an educational privilege to the wealthy and influential completely out of keeping with a modern meritocratic society and as such are a legacy of the outdated and backward looking Educational Policy of previous Governments.The specifics of this bill are that Part  Chapter II sections  will be repealed entirely and replaced with the  sections of the bill. The sections after Part  Chapter II section  will be renumbered and all references to the previous sections either rereferenced or removed.We expect there to be opposition to this Bill based on the maintenance of influence and privilege taught by the archaic Education System of bygone years. We expect there to be claims of ...race to the bottom and ...class war. However if this house and this country is to move forward in to the modern world then there must be more than a casual tipofthehat to the changing needs of students and education.What is required is a radical rootandbranch remodelling of our education system fit for the st Century and beyond.Now is not the time for nostalgia now is the time for looking to the future of our Brave New postEU world. Keeping our Education system at the forefront of this is critical to building a new Britain ready to face the World. uAlanBstard,MHOC,ddfprq0,1,t5_31ykc

11354842,0,t1_dfj0yfv,gt These turbulent times you speak of are due to the impending triggering of Article  and the process of leaving the European Union. The terms of that are not clear yet  they will be decided by a referendum and as such there isnt much we the government can do. The people and the opposition know the governments stance on Brexit. Much more we cannot do.Regardless of whatever deal may be achieved in the end up I dont think my assessment that the United Kingdom exiting the European Union constitutes a turbulent time. gt Your second point is rather irrelevant if we look at actual government policy. One party might want the world but that doesnt mean it receives the world. All parties keep each other in check in one way or another that is how coalitions work.Regardless of Government policy now all three of these issues were official party policy or are currently around. My question was not will the Government follow through on these? rather how can we trust a Government comprised of parties that have such issues as these?gt Your claim that we dont care about Northern Ireland is a bold one. You might recall that many Tories  a majority of them I believe!  supported the implementation of devolution to Northern Ireland. You might remember that only last term the leader of the UUP a party affiliated with the Conservative Party headed the NI executive as First Minister. You can call us sectarian sure but we can call you sectarian in return too.Firstly I cant recall something I wasnt present for and your second point is rather irrelevant if we look at the th Governments policy outlined in this speech.gt I dont know where you got the  thing from but its clearly incorrect.The Queens Speech proposes an extra  to Defence to meet the NATO target that has already been implemented I asked if the Government was adding that  on top of the  already proposed.,MHOC,dfj1to5,7,t5_31ykc
11355052,0,t3_621m21,Mr SpeakerI congratulate the PM on his new position and on the formation of a right wing government. I must say that I am puzzled. I have read through this Queens Speech and I find that certain elements of it are daring and others are completely toothless. The government tells us that it will be open and conciliatory to all. A programme has been laid out that is both ambitious and gives the country a clear direction. This is a promise of decisive and strong leadership. Of course subsequently the government states that this is subject to change. Oh well I was almost impressed.The government has pledged a twenty five billion increase in infrastructure spending which is always welcome as long as you have the means to pay for it. Good politicians can make excellent promises good government can actually deliver them. gtIn order to accommodate the vast amount of forwardthinking investment my government will build a strong economy that works for everyone in the United Kingdom.I was actually hoping the government would pledge to build a weak economy and I am rather disappointed.The right always concerned with increasing their youth vote has now pledged to raise taxes on recreational drugs. A clear vote winner for Conservatives and a clear drain on the pockets of the youth.Value Added Tax will be reformed. Less expensive products will now have a lower rate of tax applied to it. Lets hope we at least get p off a mars bar.The government pledges to reduce income tax. It doesnt say by how much but it will be reduced. I would say to the government that I do hope these arent going to be token tax cuts. If you marginally reduce these taxes the chances are youre not going to achieve much except lose revenue.The government has promised to reduce many taxes and pledged further spending. The only means of making up for lost revenue thus far has been an increase in tax on recreational drugs. This worries me. How much will  grams of weed be costing us under this government?Corporation tax will be lowered. I sincerely hope we are not talking about a rate similar to the Republic of Ireland a race to the bottom is never one you want to win.Capital Gains Tax will be abolished and Stamp Duty will be abolished. This will be quite a loss to the exchequer. Thank lord you arent called the fiscally conservative party eh?I admit I missed environmental policies earlier. Possibly in disbelief. I applaud the introduction of greenhouse gas taxes but would be wary about raising the rate of carbon tax by too much.gtAll of this contributes to my governments overall ambition to have a balanced budget by the end of this Parliament which will assist in restoring fiscal discipline and make the United Kingdom a safer more prosperous place to invest and do business in.And you will do this by offering tax cuts and increased spending. The government is composed of true fiscal masterminds.gtMy government will be creating a Sovereign Wealth Fund to further guarantee Britains future and the prosperity of the British people as we open our arms to the globe.This isnt a bad idea.Im happy to see the government pledge to guarantee science funding at  but all these promises do add up and will drain the exchequer.A referendum on the single market isnt the worst idea I have ever had but whether there is public appetite for it is another question.More money committed to defence to remain at  of GDP. Oh an abolition of the minimum wage. Clear vote winner well done. Ironically this will probably increase union membership which is definitely what the government wants.I also applaud the government standing up for the people of the United Kingdom by sticking up the middle finger to any chance of Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland to having more self government and a right to self determination.gtGOVERNMENT PLANS TO INCREASE SPENDINGREDUCE TAXINFRASTRUCTURERESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTVALUE ADDED TAXINCOME TAXSTAMP DUTYCAPITAL GAINS TAXSCIENCE FUNDINGSOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDSECURITY INTELLIGENCE AND POLICECYBER SECURITYHEALTHCAREEDUCATIONgtGOVERNMENT PLANS TO INCREASE REVENUECARBON TAXGREENHOUSE GASES TAXRECREATIONAL DRUGS TAXVerdict  Fiscally Irresponsible,MHOC,dfj2oi9,3,t5_31ykc
