600396,0,t3_210npu,Very good point. To be honest i see this everywhere in the gaming industry. Players are becoming much more less intelligent because of the false nature of the games claiming to be at least slightly realistic. There has not been a serious city builder yet. I like to call them Capitalist simulators. Sim city is surely not about city planning. Its more about making your city grow. Though if you compare SC to SC..You can definitely see that in SC you have the freedom build a rural community. But in SC you are bound to one size plot. And your citizens will complain that there are no garbage trucks when you only have two houses.Its a debate that has been going on for a long time. And Im not an expert. I cant say i have the best arguments at the moments but Id claim that a majority of us dont want a Capitalist city growth simulation.So. SC has a lot of mods available. Great modding community. And people contribute with d models or BATs all the time. This gives your cities that personal aesthetic feel. Difficulty is not going to change a players dream to create a metropolis. It will just be slower so id suggest that continue with mentioning this kind of stuff to let people know that there is such an opinion and voice.I completely agree with you. And if this was a month ago i would have given you a thousand lines of text..One more thing fictional city building is a great way to share this kind of opinion of concept.,simcity4,cg8iobu,5,t5_2t3cp
600667,0,t1_cg8iobu,Well first of all SC is absolute rubbish if youre trying to make anything close to realistic. I like to refer to it as SimSubdivision because thats about as much as you can build.Anyway I guess my point is that most people dont seem to be trying even the slightest bit. Almost all the cities I see consist of a bunch of avenues crisscrossed in no particular order all highdensity zones and a plague of problems left unaddressed. And it makes my skin crawl to see some of these cities lauded as beautiful and efficient when theyre anything but. Its like has anybody even seen a real city? So to your point the game definitely makes it too easy for players to build seemingly successful cities. Just imagine if an FPS game made it so every shot was an automatic headshot  no skill or strategy required. Thats how I feel SC is on Easy or Medium. Playing on Hard really makes it so you do need to use streets instead of roadsavenues at first you need to strategize and prioritize and mostly you actually need to come up with a long term vision of what you want your city to look like and where you want things to go in advance.Anyway the only thing I would argue is that I dont regard SimCity as a capitalist game necessarily. I mean I suppose it is if you compare it to SimCity Societies where you the government hand pick every single plot. But I think a capitalist city growth simulation game would be more along the lines of building a mill town or mining town and you own the big industry and get to make a company town like the old rustbelt towns manage your workforce and so on. SC would actually be considered rather socialist these days considering that all the hospitals toll roads railroads etc. are publically owned. But considering the whole game is based on taxing private development I understand what you mean.,simcity4,cg8js91,6,t5_2t3cp

1528507,0,t3_2bq6x3,Sim City  was built for PCs like the second option that you listed. That should have the best compatability. If you can scare up an nVidia card from that time period youll be better off as ATI cards of the era did not have a stencil buffer and almost all of the props would disappear from the lots as you scrolled the screen. I am not sure if a proper fix has ever been introduced for that.Now with all of that being said there are several things that you can do today to Sim City  to increase stability on current gaming systems. Setting processor affinity software rendering managing your save games Etc.Edit I didnt know you had  Gb of plugins when I posted this. You should really move to  bit system with more memory and patch the exe with one of the  Gig patchers out there. Running out of memory is probably the number  cause of CTD.,simcity4,cj7vive,3,t5_2t3cp

5226151,0,t1_cvfvyks,Well Id overhaul the terrain to start with. Currently therere  HD terrain mods. Appalachian Terrain ModSudden Valley Terrain ModBerner Oberland Terrain ModNote two of them have depedencies. You can then further customize the terrain with water  beach and rock mods Once the terrain is tweaked to your liking you could start adding tons of seasonal HD flora This alone will keep you busy for a while. Moreover it will drastically alter the appearance of your landscape. As for other HD content like buildings and automata thats really a matter of scouring the LEX and STEX. Theres notable HD content from the French community for instance however its not particularly wide spread in its usage so if you really would want to make good use of it i.e. create close up HD scenes youd need to start lotting yourself.  ,simcity4,cvfxxq3,4,t5_2t3cp

7432716,0,t1_d2mtpls,I know right? Its one of those things you just figure out one day. Now I use it on all my flat cities. Those little bumps make everything look sloppy when you want a flat surface. Also using little microadjustments with the terraforming tools and the street squaresdrags protip all plop pieces will be the same slope and elevation as its neighbour you can create some pretty nifty little NAM pieces say for example a trench railway that tucks in neatly with the surrounding buildings and street grid London Underground District Line style or roads and railways that transition seamlessly into viaducts. This helps especially when you decide to connect your region via high speed rail using the high speed rail mod very streamlined just click and drag from the starter piece much like the ground light rail mod that comes with the baseline NAM and getting an absolutely perfect transition means youre not fussing in your head about how a train going  kmh is supposed to get over all those bumps and not fly off the rails. There are also numerous through train stations as in ones that you drag the rail through as opposed to the less realistic plop beside the track design of the vanilla multiplatormed and terminal stations and at least one design that Ive found for a viaduct railway station. I have on more than one occasion gone entire weekends without sleep designing spaghetti tangles of multimodal interchange points with railway lines flyover ramps airports and on and on. The holy grail of perfectly seamless and efficient transportation network planning will keep you on your toes and terraforming tools and neat little tricks like the street square thing will add to that level of realism.,simcity4,d2n1wpo,2,t5_2t3cp

Just having neighbor connections will help increase industrial demand though even if theyre to empty cities.If you just want to go for growth Id actually suggest just outright ignoring the suggestion to plan for a multicity region at the outset. My preferred strategy for large cities is to start by building poor and dirty i.e. no educational facilities and always always having a sufficient budget surplus before I build out services otherwise. The first things Id provide are fire stations and water  this enables higher density buildings and keeps your industry from burning down. Eventually so long as some corner of the city is undeveloped and out of reach of air and water pollution you can start providing education there and slowly redevelop the city for higherwealth RCI once demand rises.,simcity4,d4od3ky,4,t5_2t3cp
