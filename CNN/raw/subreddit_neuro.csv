28534,0,t3_1uf36j,HiSo hopefully I dont tread on the toes of any EEG masters around here but Ive been personally learning about the differences of active vs passive systems recently and thought I might share my thoughts on them. Full disclosure I am only a postbach but I have several years of experience on working with ch passive systems and my lab is currently transitioning to a ch active system.My limited experience with active systems has led me to believe that they can deliver higher quality data for less time invested. Passive systems take time and skill to get reliably low impedances and therefore good data. In our lab two skilled lab techs could do  passive electrodes in about  minutes. Ive only used active systems a few times but they are definitely easier to deal with than their passive counterparts. The time difference might be not as large for a skilled tech but for unskilled people you would probably get cleaner data and faster runs from an active system. However active systems do appear to have some drawbacks one should consider.  Most systems I see require a larger amount of time to prepare the cap by needing to insert the electrode into the fabric shell one by one before each run. They might also require more care while cleaning afterwards. And I think the largest drawback may be that fixing them is a much more involved process. Most electrodes on a passive cap can be replaced if they go out by our departments engineering team. I believe our new active systems will require us to return them to the company if they break and the process of fixing them can take several months. Clearly this is an issue if you dont have many other electrode sets to rely on.Now Im not sure if any of the above issues really would concern you but my advice would be to pick a system based on what your ultimate goal is. Another thing you might want to consider is if you are planning on using gel or a saline solution as a medium between the electrode and scalp. Im not actually sure if a saline solution would work with an active system and I can see a saline solution being advantageous to your goals if you just want an EEG system that works. Personally I think I would recommend using a passive system. There are many steps that go between placing an electrode and looking at output so I would start off simple and go for the more complex active system after youve found success.,neuro,cehoisw,6,t5_2qu9b
93043,0,t3_1v4arc,This is essentially the idea behind the vacancy hypothesis. Brain areas have a certain carrying capacity they can only hold so many neurons. If a vacancy opens up i.e. a cell dies then a new neuron can move in. Thus if you could reduce the number of vacancies you will have fewer new neurons being recruited into the brain circuit.There is evidence that suggests that indeed this is true. In fact I wrote an article on this very topic. In that study I used seasonally breeding songbirds. Songbirds have a brain circuit that controls singing behavior this circuit is called the song control system. When male songbirds are in breeding condition high levels of testosterone parts of the the song control system increase in neuron number via neurogenesis. Withdrawal of testosterone induces massive apoptosis. To determine if reducing apoptosis would in turn reduce cell death I placed a tube connected to an osmotic pump filled with caspase inhibitors into the brain of songbirds under breeding conditions.  I then withdrew testosterone.  days later I killed the birds and examined the level of neurogenesis. I found that the side of the brain with caspase inhibitors had reduced levels of neurogenesis. This essential idea has been replicated in other studies primarily in mice. EDIT a couple of words,neuro,cep0tvv,1,t5_2qu9b

I agree that it makes a lot more sense to group people by neurophysiology than by expressed symptoms. I think my thought process was kind of along the lines of If we figure out the pathophysiology that means were going to figure out the proteins. If we figure out the proteins that means were going to figure out which genes are associated with neurological disorders. I dont think theres a single gene that causes ASD or ADHD but there are probably certain combos of alleles that predispose and were going to find those. At the same time were also going to be getting a lot better at genomic sequencing. So people are probably going to be able to sequence their unborn babies and find out if they have the allelecombos that predispose to autism or ADHD even if neonatal testing isnt prioritized at all...But thats going to be a collateral discovery along the way while the focus is going to be on more precise descriptionsbetter medication. Which are badly needed.Which makes this whole thing kind of akin to the You cant do the research you need to know how to build a power plant without generating the knowledge that will allow you to build the atomic bomb argument.And before people jump into You cant seriously be comparing prenatal genetic screenings for autism to the atomic bomb mode I should point out I dont think those two things are equivalent. Right now Im just thinking aloud...on Reddit.So that probably means that the main issue is going to be whether its okay for parents to have the power to choose or at least select against genes they think will negatively impact the neurological makeup of their child.

988005,0,t1_chgkozx,Yes the real beginning of an action must be generated by an external stimulus because a proper action requires knowledge of the stimulus which requires previous exposure. Some simple things are also programmed in genetically like certain pathways that regulate appetite and bodily functions but these dont immediately have the capability to support goaldirected action.If you want to go all the way back to the true beginning of an action I think spontaneous activity in the infant brain is probably the first thing. Id like to note that this spontaneous activity would inevitably lead to some motor activity which would in turn provide the nervous system with somatosensory and proprioceptive information which would help the brain characterize its own outputs. Doing this could be among the first things that help the brain distinguish selfgenerated sensation from environmentgenerated sensation thus paving the way for things like agency and thought. This particular example is speculation  research needs to be done to discover the precise role of spontaneous activity in brain development although we do know it is necessary.,neuro,chgldsw,1,t5_2qu9b

After youve used Python for a while youll begin to notice just how... ugly most MATLAB code looks. I agree that to some extent this is fault of novice coders but there are also just a lot of boneheaded design decisions that went into MATLAB that tend to make code much less readable. MATLAB uses round brackets for both function calls and array indexing which makes it way more of a pain to see whats going on in a oneliner where an array is indexed by the result of a function call. Numpy has very elegant support for broadcasting operations over arrays whereas MATLAB forces you to use horrible hacks involving bsxfun. Pythons modular import system and use of namespaces make it relatively easy to build and maintain large software libraries involving many directories and source files whereas MATLAB searches the entire path for function and class definitions which not only makes the interpreter slow as hell to start but also introduces headaches when the same function name is defined within multiple source files. Its necessary to terminate every single line in your scripts with a semicolon in order to prevent the MATLAB interpreter from vomiting the contents of some huge array into the console.

3824775,0,t1_cqs8kpf,gt I like your approach but mine is more research based instead of argumentative fallacies.My approach is only research based. Which is why I know that study you linked is useless because the patients examined were on SSRIs. In fact you could probably take it as evidence that SSRIs cause gray matter volume loss. Though I am not so inclined because I have come to have a skeptical eye when it comes to MRI studies. A lot of experience has taught me that they produce wildly differing results are almost never replicable and are easily manipulated.EDIT To add further statement on that study even if you assume that SSRIs had no effect on these results which is implausible this study would still not prove that depression causes gray matter volume loss. A perfectly plausible and in fact more likely interpretation would be that those with major depression have a statistically different brain structure that predisposes them to depression. Again I think the patients SSRI use is the most important factor here. Also these patients were not your typical depression patients. Mean duration of disease was . years which is a long time and not typical even of those with major depression. Were talking about the worst subset of the worst depression.,neuro,cqs99k9,-4,t5_2qu9b
3879377,0,t3_34vh4q,I suggest this video Daniel Wegner book The Illusion Of Conscious Will frames the situation extremely cleverly. There is no metahpysicallibertarian free will but most people feel a sense of agency in their life. This sense of agency is related to feelings of deservedness of reward and punishment which is evolutionarily relevant. The feeling of freewill is relevant and prevalent though the thing itself does not exist.The debate over free will is semantic I think. Try to define free will more clearly and you will be able to answer the more specific question. Do we make choices? Of course when multiple options are available only one is ever followed. Are we independent of our environment? Of course not there is no clear boundary between environment and entity. In short things happen.,neuro,cqyhe2p,16,t5_2qu9b
3880289,0,t3_34vh4q,VERY few academics and philosophers believe in the type of free will that Sam Harris argues against in his book. Dennett calls this free will spooky free will one in which every choice is a little miracle. For free will as it is described the laws of cause and effect and the previous causal chain that lead to the state of the world at a given time. Believing that the idea of free will as its popularly discussed is poorly formed at the most basic level many philosophers argue in favor of compatibilism one where the world is causally dependent and deterministic and where free will is a perfectly reasonable thing to have in that your brain is an agent making decisions in the world. This idea that oh but it has no real choice in the matter of making choices is a problem that if satisfied would be an ad infinitum paradox. Your brain is hardwired to do things and just because those things would be predictable if you had perfect information about the universe at a given time doesnt mean its not making choices or doing dope shit.,neuro,cqyl4un,7,t5_2qu9b

5856106,0,t3_3vdmzw,Psychedelic research is probably more helpful in this case especially brain activity scans during psilocybin lsd or dmt use if there is any out there. The fact of the matter though is that our moment to moment experience including our visual field is all data being processed and organized in the brain. So to understand hallucinations better it helps to realized that what you look at at any one moment is not a  a physical object a certain distance from you but rather a simulated set of data constructed in whatever way the visual cortex in the occipital lobe has developed to process displayed in perception by whatever limitations these systems have fov depth color contrast movement form recognition etc. So since our regular visual awareness is directly linked to the processing of incoming photons filtering through the rods and cones in the eyes and since other external systems also need to be contributing to create a visual perception memory for example to understand and recall concepts of distinct forms and their relationships you could start to see sorry hehe how a hallucination can manifest itself in perception since theres nothing specific about our perception itself that constricts it to the direct input of sensory information. You can close your eyes and recall the basic forms of different objects or colors or sounds and so forth and if I remember correctly when you do that your brain also activates the areas that are in charge of processing that information. Memory obviously has to play the big role in auditory and visual hallucinations since as you yourself describe theres a disconnect between the way thinking works during hallucinations and dreams vs regular awareness and a hallucination itself since its not based on actual sensory data youre receiving has to be instead located as memory data thats being recalled in conjunction with whatever was happening at the time. Its really interesting stuff. Try for example sometimes to pay really close attention to a textured surface like a bathroom tile or carpet or anything thats grainy and youll find that staring at it closely will start to make the surface appear to be buzzing around and moving since our brains arent good at pinpointing specific details that way. So when you get lots of data like that you can actually observe your brain trying to make sense of it. But when you just quickly glance over something youre relying more on your implied knowledge to give it a concrete static shape even if its not a true representation of that object like with reading where you dont actually read each individual letter but rather imply the word by its shape.I think Dennett talks a lot about this kind of stuff.,neuro,cxn9ia1,1,t5_2qu9b

I made a OneNote doc and started defining terms I was unfamiliar with.I was running into words in assigned readings in neuroscience classes but it would be really easy to look up interesting topics on Google Scholar and get started now. Id advise adding the term review behind anything youre interested in. Individual studies mean nothing until you have a bigpicture idea about a certain topic. Older reviews even from the s can be really helpful starting points for entirely new topics.If youre coming in as a fledgling neuroscience major getting involved in research can be an AWESOME way to get started and feel like a scientist. Its MUCH easier than most people think and usually involves sending emails offering free labor to professors. It would be fantastic if you searched various neuro professors at WSU found one who studies a topic youre interested in and became familiar with their research. You certainly wouldnt regret it.I spent time in the department as an undergrad and graduate student and I got to know many of the professors.

The issue started only when I took .mg doses of it so I believe its related to this. It didnt cause tics when I took the mg only when I lowered my dose.Ive written in the other thread about how my sister got tics from Ritalin and had it go away after  months of complete abstinence but Ive also heard of parents online mentioning that their young children developed tics on Adderall and one parent said even  years off medication didnt help. I hope its not going to happen to me probably not because Im a lot older.I also now have other symptoms like not being able to fall back asleep at all if I wake up early. I did this without any problem until last week before the .mg doses. Now I wake up early feel tired but cant go back to sleep because my heart rate is quite high feels like a slight Adrenalin rush that prevents me from going back to sleep.I think the best thing to do now is to continue abstaining from Adderall. Its tough but it cannot be damaging. I have ADHD and it was bad enough before the Adderall.

As long as glucocorticoid levels return to normal within a short span of time I cant think of a mechanism that would connect the changes caused by the GC spike to lasting developmental defects. In the short term they mainly only act to implement quick reallocation of energy stores. This can certainly hinder development in the long term with the hippocampus being especially vulnerable due to its energy demands but should not have a significant effect in the short term. The bodys energy demands already shift significantly throughout the day as a matter of course. This is also true for neonates.

And I know a lot of computervision people have worked on that and are still actively working on that because hes right that its a ridiculously ratelimiting step right now for this field. You might think its easy to write some software that can outline neurons in images but apparently its a very hard problem to solve in a way that youd have very high confidence in according to computervision scientists who know way more about it than me. Right now were still depending on actual humans to trace the neurons through stacks of images though to be fair with the help of some impressive software that the computervision field has developed which makes it relatively simple. I think eyewire is a good example of this which if you dont know is someones idea of turning EM tracing into a video game so people online can help trace neurons. Even with all these people actively tracing its hard to even make the tiniest dent in the data so right now people are generally just trying to trace the neurons that neuroscientists have a specific interest in.
