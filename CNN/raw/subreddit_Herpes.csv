Its important to understand that HSV is not part of a standard screening so just asking if theyve tested negative isnt sufficient.  Most people go into a doctors office ask for a complete STD test and are told they are negative for everything.  They dont realize HSV wasnt included. Add to that over  of the US population has some form of herpes  HSV  HSV and  with HSV dont know they have it.Also many people have had cold sores since childhood.  They dont consider that an STI because they didnt get it through sex.  Sometimes they dont even consider cold sores as being herpes.  So its quite possible they were truthful about their status they just didnt know they were tested for everything.,Herpes,cr35zuc,1,t5_2r1yp

The Herpes Handbook written by Terri Warren. gtTerri has served as principal investigator or sub investigator on more than  clinical trials evaluating various testing mechanisms for sexually transmitted infections the efficacy of experimental vaccines and pharmacologic interventions for numerous human infections. Her area of special expertise is herpes simplex virus.In this book she recommends that anybody wanting a full STD screen should be able to request a blood test for HSV. Along with people who think they may have been exposed as I said above depending on the   partners you have been.gtHe does not consider a positive blood test to mean someone has herpes. Like the example in The Herpes Handbook if a woman tests positive for being pregnant it doesnt mean she was just exposed to semen and might not actually be pregnant. You cant be half way preggo. If you test positive for HSV you are infected with the virus. Not just exposed or dont really carry the virus.Does he even know what the difference between infection and disease is?! About  of people with HSV dont have visible symptoms of HSV but they still carry the virus and they still can infect others. And at any time the infection can develop into a disease which causes symptoms. Thiss the difference between infection and disease. Infections dont cause symptoms. But that doesnt mean that the person isnt infected or isnt infectious to others. Is your doctor actually trying to say that anyone that tests positive for a virus or bacteria but doesnt display any symptoms of said infection doesnt actually carry the virusbacteria?!  Ya thats not how it works. Most STDs are asymptomatic but people still carry the infection and still infect one another.gt I asked about disclosing this with new partners.  He said saying you have gential herpes is inaccurate.  You can disclose that you have antibodies if youd like.yes saying you have genital herpes is inaccurate because you dont know where you carry the virus since it could be oral or genital. But you do have HSV. So you should disclose that you carry HSV. gtI asked what are the chances I would show symptoms at some point.  He said that isnt accurately quantifiable so an answer wasnt givenvery true. It depends on the health of your immune system. Keep that string and chances are low that you will have an outbreak.gt I also mentioned about having a new partner who is a little freaked out about it.  He said If someone is freaking out over antibodies you should dump them.  I wasnt sure whether I should have laughed or not.ok......everybody has their deal breakers. If a STD is a deal breaker then thats their prerogative. I would get a second opinion from someone who actually studies HSV or sexual transmitted infectionsdiseases. I would ask the difference between infection and disease. And I would ask if someone is infected with something like virus if they dont display symptoms does that mean they dont carry that infection? ,Herpes,cr8k9ci,1,t5_2r1yp

5656017,0,t3_3skwbn,Im not sure what your doctor considers to be a while but its possible that you may have caught it within the past four months. That could explain your questionable blood test results. You said that you initially tested positive on a swab test so you do have it. It is exceptionally rare for a swab test to report a false positive. However you need to have herpes for approximately four months before it will register on a blood test. This is because a blood test measures antibodies to the herpes virus. When you are first infected you dont yet have any antibodies. After you are infected your body then starts creating antibodies. But it will take approximately four months before your body will have created enough antibodies to definitively register on a blood test. So if you were infected within four months of the blood test you will not yet have enough antibodies to register a positive reading.If you definitely want blood test confirmation then you will need to wait another month or two and get another blood test.You may have caught this from your one night stand  months ago. But since its oral you might also have caught it from your current girlfriend from kissing. She can be a virgin and still have an oral hsv infection. Remember that many people get oral hsv infections as children. The possibility of your girlfriend having it is another thing that could explain your low blood test reading because again this would be a recent infection for you ie within the past  months. Furthermore oral hsv very rarely causes outbreaks. Most people will get an outbreak when they first get it and then never get another outbreak again. This also suggests its possible though certainly not guaranteed that you got it from your current girlfriend.I suggest you tell your girlfriend what happened ie your status. Explain that its possible to get it from kissing and that many people get oral hsv infections as kids that its possible you got it from her and ask if shed be willing to get tested herself.Lastly its important to know that if youre going to get any kind of herpes oralhsv is the one to get. It hardly ever causes outbreaks and is the least contagious form of herpes by far.  It is far less contagious than the much more common oralhsv and far far less contagious than gential hsv. Plus the fact that you have it orally means it is now extremely unlikely that would ever catch it genitally yourself because your existing hsv antibodies will protect you from further infection.,Herpes,cwy6mvf,2,t5_2r1yp
5754430,0,t3_3txj0t,Have you done any reading on it yet? A girl Ive been dating told me the other night she has type  but its been awhile since her last outbreak. Outbreaks are when chances of contraction go up as thats when the virus is present. The fact that she has vaginal herpes also helps your chances a lot as it means your risk lies with something called shedding. Shedding happens a few days before and after an outbreak and only those very aware of their bodies will sense it when shedding starts.  Long story short  you need to be careful for the next few weeks. If you have multiple partners or frequent sex  wrap it up or abstain. You can get tested but sadly even if you are positive  tests dont always turn it up. The reason Herpes has been spreading so much in our generation is due to misinformation and so many people going undiagnosed.Think of it this way   in  people have type .  in  have type . So if you have had unprotected sex with more than  women your chances of carrying herpes is incredibly high. Its also not a huge medical issue just carries a lot of stigma.

5938114,0,t3_3wcjyo,Very high likely hood that it will pass on.The thing about HSV unlike other STDs is that its the only one condoms wont do jack for. Herpes spreads by skin not by fluids. You could get a virus from just touching her since the virus immediately activates upon contact with epithelial cells and youll have no idea when she isnt shedding. Hair wouldnt do anything except contribute to heating up which would make the skins pores open.Long story short You almost certainly have HSV.By the way suppressive only refers to herpes symptoms not herpes transmission.

The chance of you being infected from this encounter is extremely low. gtYou bring me hope in that the probability seems extremely low.Yes exactly. That is the opposite of much uncertainty.gtI am a little worried because it is now  days after the fact and Im feeling a little sick. I cant find information if flulike symptoms come before or during the outbreak of lesions.You are also worried stressed and anxious. People often believe they are experiencing miscellaneous flulike symptoms at such times. Nevertheless people will generally not experience secondary symptoms of herpes flulike symptoms ie aches amp pains and swollen lymph nodes in the groin unless they also experience primary symptoms ie blisters. Primary symptoms if theyre going to show up will almost always show up within  weeks of infection. So if nothing shows up for you within this period then the flulike symptoms you are experiencing are unrelated.gtI cant find information if flulike symptoms come before or during the outbreak of lesions.Secondary symptoms ie flulike symptoms and swollen lymph nodes in the groin generally only occur for people during their very first herpes outbreak. Even then not everyone who gets herpes gets the secondary symptoms. For those that do experience them they would occur at roughly the same time maybe give or take a few days.Again I encourage you not to worry. The chance of transmission in your case is very low. I also encourage you to do what you can to get a handle on what it means to be sexually active. Remember that approximately  in  people have herpes and the majority of them ie  dont know they have it. If you get this anxious from such a lowrisk scenario then you will likely struggle with anxiety when it comes to future partners as well. And that really isnt necessary.,Herpes,czevegy,1,t5_2r1yp

This is because oral HSV is extremely common twothirds of the adult population in US and oral HSV is quite rate and also because the transmission risk from oral HSV is so low.  That said in theory it could be HSV but very unlikely.For a genital infection HSV is more manageable than HSV milder symptoms less frequent recurrence lower transmission risk.  For an oral infection the opposite is true with HSV being more manageable than HSV.  This is because the different virus types prefer a location.Id recommend you see a doctor asap if you have sores  a swab test is only effective before they start to heal and that will confirm statustype now.  Else you have to wait several months at least   but Id recommend  before the results of a blood test can be reliable....Good luck and make sure to disclose your status to recent and future partners.,Herpes,d0nt3f4,2,t5_2r1yp

The first outbreak occurs where the infection occurred where the virus was able to penetrate the skin. This is often at a location where there was significant friction during sex.You didnt mention how long ago your short dalliance was. Another indicator of who you got it from is the fact that a firsttime outbreak almost always occurs within  days of being infected. So unless your dalliance was also very recent circumstances again point to your more monogamous partner.gthow on earth do I go about telling him?Well again first you need to rule out the possibility of the dalliance partner.

Would you mind getting tested so I can find out?And since you also claim to be very emotionally attached to him and dont want to lose him you could also addI really care about you and I promise you I wont be upset. Im just wanting to make sense of this.On a side note if your partner is stubborn and closedminded to the point that youre worried about losing him because of his reaction to very likely giving you herpes I question why you would be so emotionally attached and not want to lose him.

7793572,0,t3_4ly8gs,Well...have you considered maybe you got it from your girlfriend? If shes ever had a cold sore...shes capable of transferring HSV to your genitals. Even if shes never had a cold sore theres still a huge chance she has HSV as its extremely common. Also its also possible your unprotected encounter in  was the cause. As symptoms dont have to be present to transmit the virus. Also you may have tested negative and still had it. It depends on the blood test you were given. IgM tests are considered totally unreliable yet still widely used. They test for recent infections and people whove had herpes for a long time often still test negative. I get cold sores very frequently and still tested negative on the IgM.IgG is really the only test you should trust for sure and it tests for antibodies. It misses one out of every  HSV infection IIRC. But its also only accurate after the antibodies have had time to develop and that often takes weeks to months. So its also possible you contracted it too soon to show up on the IgG. My best bet though is that you received the IgM. Its still widely used in a lot of places in the US and doctors dont listen when you tell them its useless. I was tested via IgM and when I practically demanded I be tested via IgG I was told good luck in finding anyone who will do it. My own gynecologist whom I greatly respect wont test me via IgG. Its very frustrating.,Herpes,d3s20ib,2,t5_2r1yp

8111057,0,t1_d4rcmn9,Im not OP but I can answer your questions. gtIf you have cold sores HSV does that offer any protection from HSV?No. Here are some quotes from recognized herpes expert Terri Warren addressing this issue on her clinic forumgtIt is not accurate that having HSV  offers any protection against the acquisition of HSV . This has not proven to be true.SourceandgtHaving an HSV  infection which you will have forever if you had it as a child does not offer you protection against HSV  infection.SourceIf you already have oral hsv and then later catch genital hsv it may cause your genital hsv outbreaks to be less severegtThe main thing we know about that helps people be less symptomatic with new infection is prior infection with HSV  as you already know. The immune response is similar enough to suppress symptoms but not infection.SourceYour nd questiongtis it true that if you have HSV in one area of your body it wont go to another one?This is true in the vast majority of cases. Once you are infected with a type of herpes in one location you become largely protected from getting infected with the same time of herpes in another location at a later point in time. This is because after you are first infected with herpes your body creates antibodies to fight the virus. Your body maintains these antibodies in your bloodstream and they protect you from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates but by about  months postinfection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent further any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that eg after several weeks.There are very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule.gtIf so if you are with someone that has HSV in the genital area would it make sense to catch it on your mouth first assuming the answer is no to my first question so you dont have to deal with the pain and stigma of catching it on your genitals? After all no one bats an eyelid about cold sores? And its a lot less painful?An oral hsv infection would indeed offer you very high protection from ever getting a genital infection. In addition oral hsv is also the least active and least contagious form of herpes by far. By the way in case you arent aware having hsv in any location also protects from later catching hsv in any location. Relevant quote from Terri WarrengtPeople who have HSV  first do not subsequently acquire HSV  in any location. The opposite is not true.Source ,Herpes,d4rr81u,1,t5_2r1yp

8157027,0,t3_4qvzg5,In my case I got it from someone who I thought was love at first site. We met on Tinder had quite a few common interests in a niche industry exchanged whatsapp and chatted for about  weeks then we met up in real life. At first I thought to myself with a resting bitch face Shes like ten minutes late... She probably doesnt even look half as good as her photos. Then when I saw her getting off the subway my head tilted my eyebrows shot up and I had an ear to ear smile and I was shrugging with this expression like Are you her? and when she saw me she had almost the same exact reaction.When we were walking to find a place to get dinner we were both kind of nervous talking to each other walking a bit aimlessly and we broke the ice over dinner. About three days later we got lunch together and we held hands at one point.About another three days later she went back to my place. I finished up some work on my P.C. and we started watching TV together. I was so happy that I was able to start holding her in my arms. Then one thing led to another kissing and such and finally I asked her Are we going to have sex? She asked me Do you really want it? I said Im afraid that if we dont do it we wont go to sleep.We did it with a condom after I got a deep throat. About one week later we did it without a condom. Then three days after that was Valentines day . My first big outbreak.  months later I ended up calling the cops to escort her out of my apartment for hitting me and throwing shit around.She never owned up to having HSV. She never even wanted to get tested.  of people with herpes dont even know they have it. And I must add that she never even showed symptoms of having the virus.TLDR  You can get it from people who dont even know they have it.,Herpes,d4x6czm,5,t5_2r1yp

8230288,0,t1_d561ynk,What MissRaffix told you is incorrect. Unfortunately she gives people incorrect information on a fairly regular basis both here and in other subs as well.gtif I get another outbreak it could be elsewhere right?Yes elsewhere within your genital region. When herpes reactivates after being dormant it has numerous nerve pathways to choose from to get to the skin surface. For some people it always takes the same pathway and so they always get their outbreaks in the same location. But for other people it might sometimes take a different pathway and so there outbreaks might sometimes occur in different locations from one outbreak to the next.Here is a quote from herpes expert Terri Warren on her clinic forumgtResearch shows that about  of recurrent outbreaks happen in the same location but that means  occur randomly in the boxer shorts area. The virus simply travelled on a different nerve of the sacral ganglia to get to the surface of the skin.SourceOnce your antibodies are established you will be at no risk of spreading the virus further on yourself ie to nongenital regions with the most common other location being an oral infection. Spreading the virus further on oneself is called autoinoculation. It is quite rare. If it occurs it is usually during the very first outbreak. Beyond that it is generally limited to within the first four months of infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates but by about  months postinfection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that eg after several weeks.gtOn the oral sex thing I know I blowed the guy who infected me but my infection only happened below could I have HSV  orally but asymptomaticly?It is possible but very unlikely. Hsv strongly prefers the genital region and even when it is given the opportunity to infect orally it usually doesnt bother. There will be no way to know whether you have an oral infection unless you were to actually develop symptoms that could be swabbed. But unless that happens I encourage you to assume you dont have it.gtIm getting questions like Well you have it on your anus but can I get a blowjob safely?Yes. Herpes is only transmittable via direct contact with the region that is infected. So there is no risk in you performing oral sex on others.gtAnd it was very very concentrated on my anusinside of it on my first outbreak wouldnt that mean a condom would be almost entirely safe?No. Condoms reduce the risk of herpes transmission but do not eliminate it because they do not entirely cover the penis. It is not uncommon for heterosexual men who used condoms to catch herpes at the base of their penis where the condom didnt cover. I presume this would be the case for gay men as well.Also viral shedding doesnt just occur at the location of the lesions though it is the most concentrated there. You will also likely shed virus from your penis as well even if it doesnt show any symptoms. So if you penetrate any partners then your wearing a condom would also lower the risk of transmission.Besides condoms the other main precaution would be your taking daily suppressive medication. eg valtrexvalacyclovir or acyclovir at a suppressive dose. This would likely provide slightly more protection then condoms. For maximum protection both condoms and medication would be recommended.,Herpes,d56cc59,3,t5_2r1yp

8950558,0,t3_52up76,Welcome!I M tested positive for genital HSV  last week and Im currently sitting in the doctors office waiting to discuss the results.Something that helped me was a simple rebranding if you will. The word herpes carries a stigma. People start making assumptions. Cold sores does not. Everybody has that well  of people depending on your source. What we have are cold sores just not where most people usually get them. Its like dried pitted plums instead of prunes its a marketing thing.Ive disclosed with friends so that it could be less awkward for when the inevitable romantic disclosure comes. Its also been because I want my friends to see that herpes is pretty much just a skin condition that can happen to anyone and it doesnt mean Im a bad person or do bad things. Virtually all of my friends thankfully have been very supportive when I told them I had herpes.When I got the results back with exactly which strain it was I told the friends Id confided in  it was HSV  and that its the virus that causes cold sores and the reaction was much milder. One friend pretty much responded Thats all? Everyone has that! which made me feel a lot better because all this really means is that Im in the majority of the population. Statistically speaking any person youre romantically interested in is more likely to have HSV  than not. In a way Im sitting at the popular table now.As far as the contradictory test results go my guess is that the swab wasnt able to get a good sample or that the lesion had already started to heal. I had a similar false negative on a swab I had taken last week and on a blood test three weeks ago.,Herpes,d7nq2hy,2,t5_2r1yp
8971314,0,t3_535svj,Yes it is possible to get infected and not show symptoms until much later.  Happened to me.  I got it from my previous boyfriend who was asymptomatic so I didnt know I had it.  Fast forward to three months ago with current boyfriend had my first ob.  He asked me if I cheated as well.  I was insulted at first but I understand how one might jump to conclusions.  With herpes dont assume anything.  She could have had it for a while given it to you.  Or vice versa.  HSV can be transmitted through oral sex since it comes from the same simplex as cold sores of the mouth.  You could have gotten it that way either of you.  But there had to be genital contact for you to contract GHSV regardless of whowhen you got it. ,Herpes,d7q7sl6,3,t5_2r1yp

She said it definitely looks like something from the zoster family but because of the location and the lack of contact she didnt think it was herpes. I told her about the previous knee outbreak and she said that while herpes can move it has to follow nerve tracks so its unlikely that the two were connected. I cant remember why but she said that testing wouldnt be helpful because something about it not being in my blood.She offered me a script for a topically antiviral cream but i declined it. Honestly even if it is herpes my herpes elbow aint that awful and im not worried about it. Thank for all the comments!!!,Herpes,dcdqcae,1,t5_2r1yp
10340104,0,t3_5nyc3t,As a male Ive had to deal with lots of rejection since I found out I had herpes. I dont know for sure but from what Ive heard it seems men are more accepting of a partner with herpes than women.That being said I always disclose. Ive started to think of it as a way to weed out those who wouldnt want to stick around during other relationship difficulties  honestly thats probably more of a coping mechanism but it helps me.Dont worry about it just be as upfront as you can be. Youll find an accepting partner and theyll be glad you shared the information with them.Good luck!,Herpes,dcg3yfv,3,t5_2r1yp

10431961,0,t3_5p9tml,gtIm only  and I dont want to have morbid neurological damage like this one article said.I dont know what article you read but genital herpes does not cause nerve damage. It can cause nerve sensations but not actual damage. When herpes causes nerve sensations it is known as herpetic neuralgia.Here is a quote from herpes expert Terri WarrengtPost herpetic neuralgia is not nerve damage it is just a nerve sensation. SourceFurthermore herpetic neuralgia is very uncommon. It does occur for some people but not many. And for genital infections it is almost always limited to the back of the leg. Here are several additional quotes from Terri Warren on the topicgtPost herpetic neuralgia is far more often associated with zoster than simplex but some people with genital herpes do get a pain down the back of the leg when the virus is activating.SourcegtNormally it is short and in my experience happens more often prior to an outbreak than after an outbreak.SourcegtI am not aware of a difference between the viruses in the amount of nerve pain that they cause. In reality neuralgia from herpes is usually present just for a day or two prior to an outbreak for most people. ie for the few people who get itSourceYou also mentioned sensations in your armpits heels of your feet and hands. So here is another particularly relevant quote where Terri explains that herpes would not cause something like thatgtPost herpetic neuralgia would not be all over your body like what you are describing not at all. With genital infection it is most often limited to the leg.SourceAnd some more quotesgtantiviral medicine does seem to help IF it is herpes related.SourcegtMy experience is that post herpetic neuralgia with herpes simplex virus is very uncommon. People who have known genital herpes sometimes get pain down the back of the leg before or after a recurrenceSourceI have personally never heard of herpetic neuralgia resulting from genital herpes affecting areas other than the legs.And I have never come across anything in regard to herpetic neuralgia resulting from oral herpes. If it does exist then it must be extremely uncommon because I have never even seen any mention of it on Terris site and a quick Google search didnt turn up anything either from any reputable medical sources.gtThe partner who gave it to me also told me he was positive for HSV  when I told him to get tested. And Im already experiencing the tinglingburning on my lip along with slight bumps and discoloration on the bottom corners of my lips.Unless your partner had cold sores at the time the chance that he transmitted oral hsv to you is very low. Furthermore you first mentioned this stuff with your mouth several days ago. If it was herpes prodrome then actual cold sores would have very likely developed by now. Has anything changed since your photo from a day or two ago?gtWhat do I do?You try to calm down. There are no remotely clear signs that you have caught oral hsv and the odds that you caught it are very low. Numerous things can cause tinglingburning on the lips. Plus herpes would be unlikely to cause slight bumps and discoloration on both bottom corners of your lips. It is much more likely that something else is going on.To find out youre going to need to wait and see. If things on your lips develop any further then you could get them swab tested. See our WIKI PAGE on testing for more information that.Other than that be aware that you will soon be immune to catching hsv. Once your hsv infection becomes established which takes from  weeks you will then become protected from infection from hsv in any location on your body.Oh also how were you diagnosed with hsv? One other possibility worth mentioning is that you might already have hsv from even before your recent partner without knowing it. Many people get it as children. And the standard blood test used for herpes detection the IgG misses it a full  of the time.,Herpes,dcqj649,1,t5_2r1yp

10475052,0,t1_dcvfze9,The fact that it didnt specify type doesnt make any sense as the test itself is for HSV  and . You come positive for one or both of them results dont return just positive for herpes in general they test the types specifically. What the doc might have meant is the test doesnt show which type as in oral v genital because blood HSV tests dont show where the source is located. Thats why blood HSV tests arent recommended.  of the population will at one point contract oral cold sores so you cant determine if the results returned positive due to history of cold sores or actual genital herpes. I would STRONGLY recommend calling your doc and talking about it more particularly since is seems theres a chance you might not have genital herpes. I didnt see you mention anything regarding lesions in the genital area which has me assume there were no lesions to test. Burning with urination can be caused by a multitude of things. Diagnosis of UTI for a male is very uncommon. In terms of if it is cold sores Im less educated on the transmission rate of cold sores than I am for genital herpes but I do believe is it significantly low when there is no active outbreak. Cold sores are such a common thing I never questioned or got bothered by it in a partner even prior to my diagnosis. If its oral I wouldnt sweat it. Just avoid kissing or oral sex if there is an outbreak happening as cold sores can spread herpes to the genital region through contact. ,Herpes,dcvgex7,1,t5_2r1yp
10531624,0,t3_5qsftt,gtWhy is it that Ive been getting these practically my whole life but Im terrified about possibly contracting it down stairs?Well you disclosed earlier that you have an anxiety disorder. This is exactly what anxiety disorders do they cause you to feel unwarranted  levels of anxiety about things. Clearly this isnt the first time youve experienced unwarranted levels of anxiety because you already know that you have an anxiety disorder.

10710776,0,t3_5t4tj6,Swabbing is the best option. They are visually identical. The main difference is that oral HSV very rarely causes recurring outbreaks so if you get a recurring cold sores its highly unlikely to be HSV but you cant know for sure without getting tested. ,Herpes,ddkqid2,2,t5_2r1yp
10735894,0,t3_5tjks5,I have HSV but Ive found that taking antivirals does decrease my anxiety about transmission. Im female so my annual transmission risk decreases from  with condoms to  condoms  antivirals which seems like a very minor difference but it makes a big difference in how I feel because I know Im doing all I can to reduce risk. Transmission stats for GHSV are not yet available but Terri Warren has suggested it is not unreasonable to assume for now the transmission risk tracks with shedding rates. GHSV typically sheds  as often as HSV. MtoF transmission risk of HSV is  per year so this would equate to  per year for GHSV without condoms and antivirals or roughly  per year with condoms and antivirals. If that  risk is still enough to make you anxious I would encourage you to note that your partner would be more likely to become infected through receiving oral sex from a partner with oral HSV if youre adults you can assume more than half of her prospective partners have oral HSV. And if she hasnt been tested for HSV theres a greater than  she already has it orally and theres almost no transmission risk at all. For me the best way to deal with this type of anxiety was to  educate myself on the prevalence of HSV  separate the reality from the stigma that creates a difference in perception between oral and genital herpes  take advantage of preventive measures antivirals and condoms.I think its also important to allow partners to make their own choices about risk. More than half of my partners must have had HSV and some likely had HSV. If I could travel back in time and magically know who had HSV and who didnt that wouldnt have changed my choices. If your girlfriend is comfortable with the risk I would respect that.    ,Herpes,ddnbrv0,2,t5_2r1yp
10762622,0,t3_5txe3k,gtIm pretty sure I have it. Im gonna be really busy this week and Im going on a short vacation this weekend is it ok to not see a doctor until I get back?Testingwise it would be best to get swabbed while you have symptoms present. Without symptoms youll need to wait  weeks from exposure for a blood test. By  weeks post exposure a standard IgG blood test accurately detects  of hsv cases but only  of hsv cases. So you should get a swab if you can.gtLike are the risks higher if I dont get treatment for about a week?gttheres no medicine Ill need immediately or anything?No. The only thing delaying a doctors visit would impact is testing. Medication is not necessary to treat herpes. It can make herpes outbreaks shorter and less extensive but is not at all essential.You may wish to consult our Wiki page on herpes testing.

10888073,0,t3_5vj765,As uihavetolaugh has already pointed out you are asking about HSV ie Herpes Simplex Virus not HPV ie Human Papilloma Virus.gtWill the blood test show if i have either HPV or HPV?No not unless the blood test was specifically for herpes. Herpes testing is usually not included in standard STD testing.gtWhat are the chances of her passing it on to me?Very low. Herpes is a lot less contagious than most people think. In studies of couples in long term relationships where the woman has genital hsv the most contagious kind of herpes and the man doesnt and they both know she has it if they have unprotected sex all year long approximately twice per week except during outbreaks the man has only a  chance of becoming infected by the end of the year. Thats after an entire year of unprotected sex.Transmission rates are slightly higher in nonlong term relationships ie short term relationships and hookups but not hugely.Condoms are estimated to reduce femaletomale herpes transmission risk by a further . Even though your condom broke depending on how long it remained intact it may still have provided you with some degree of additional protection.So as you can see your overall risk was not zero but it was very low. Not everyone who gets herpes gets symptoms but the majority do and symptoms most often appear within  days of becoming infected. You are well past that window now as well.Personally I wouldnt worry about it further.As an aside now that you know the actual risk level for femaletomale transmission you might also be interested to know that people who have herpes can also take what is known as daily suppressive medication which reduces transmission risk by a further . Im just mentioning that in case you meet another woman you like who has herpes. It would be entirely reasonable for a nonherpes person to ask a person with genital hsv to go on daily suppressive medication to reduce the transmission risk unless there is some particular reason why they cannot. If a woman has genital hsv and takes daily medication and you use condoms the annual transmission risk assuming sex twice per week would be about . Very very low.You may also wish to consult our Wiki page on herpes testing for future reference.

10896987,0,t1_de3e7x8,Aw buddy your sex life isnt over I promise. I think something like  of people will contract some form of HSV throughout their lives and a LOT of people have it in the form of cold sores. When your girl told you that she gets cold sores did you think she was doomed to a sexless life? Nope! You hooked up with her anyway. If you disclose oral HSV most people are probably going to be like okay.. so..? Im not trying to invalidate your feelings just know that you are in the majority with this one and objectively speaking its not a big deal.Heres the good news once you have an established oral HSV infection this can take up to  months and your body builds antibodies against the virus it will be nearly impossible for you to contract genital HSV. However until that time it is possible to contract it genitally. You may consider using protection when your lady gives you oral sex until that time. You do not have to worry about infecting your partner genitally from your HSV because she already has the antibodies and cannot get infected in a new location.Why are you concerned about genital HSV?Edit to add no I dont think this will change the shedding rate for you.Edit to add again I was recently diagnosed with genital HSV. I got it from my boyfriend who gets cold sores but didnt have any at the time. I got it from him performing oral sex on me. Since my outbreak has cleared and Im back to normal were going at it like horny teenagers again. He cant get it genitally because he has an established oral infection.

11105638,0,t3_5yjyoi,gthere is a picture of the rash on my arm do these look like herpes sores?Its very difficult to say. It might be herpes but it could also be many other things. For example insect bites could certainly appear as in your photo. Is there any sensation when the lesions on your arm are touched or rubbed? Since they do appear to be somewhat blisterlike you should be able to get them swabbed if you are genuinely concerned about herpes. But I think that herpes is less likely than other possibilities because that would be a particularly unlikely location to autoinnoculate yourself. Remember that the virus needs to penetrate the skin and the skin on the arm is much thicker than the that on the lips and genitals. So if the skin on your arm was intact then I think an new herpes infection is very unlikely in that location.,Herpes,deqtc0z,1,t5_2r1yp

I would not touch on the sexual aspect since you are not comfortable with that risk at least for now but rather patching up the friendship or simply apologizing for being insensitive. Regardless of whether you are only afraid of contracting one type and not another bear in mind that others may feel differently so if by chance you are infected with HSV you may want to make others aware of this. I would say it is most typical for people to not disclose HSV when the infection is oral and not genital but you will see many posts here from people who were angry upon contracting HSV from someone who did not disclose their known status or a history of cold sores and wish they had been informed even if they wouldve been fine moving forward as a result of that knowledge. For some people who contract genital herpes a feeling of not being given a choice when a partner was aware of the risk can make the healing process more complicated.

Its unfortunate that she contracted it and shell probably be angry for a while but if you werent aware you had it youve done nothing wrong. Hopefully she can understand that  of those who carry the virus have no recognizable symptoms. Im one of them and I only know I have it HSV because of a blood test.  I believe they can prescribe a lidocaine spray or gel that may help others suggest warm epsom salt baths are a life saver. Maybe encourage her to hop on here and ask some questions? This and rhsvpositive are great resources. symptoms typically appear  days after sex.  I think its normal to feel guilty but people are seriously uneducated about how common this virus is.
