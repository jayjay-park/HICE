788020,0,t3_234jcp,What a beautiful game. Artistic design was really great and I thought the engine wasnt half bad either. Gameplay wasnt bad but the plot left something to be desired...it raised all these questions about privacy and identity and then never answered them dropping them for a personal story revolving around the protagonist. Really hope Capcom still greenlights Remember Me  Too?. Hopefully with higher res texturesbetter antialiasing next time? Haha,GraphicsofGames,cgtuoci,1,t5_2ztl4
