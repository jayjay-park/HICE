1671776,0,t3_2dhn5p,Im glad I live in Portland as far as I know there has never been a protest against a nude bike ride. There are a few people who tried to start a petition that would force the organizers of the ride to release the route the riders would take. As far as I know it went nowhere because the organizers keep the route secret as to avoid gawkers. The organizers also hire security and attain a permit.,nudism,cjpw0rv,2,t5_2qs47

3905326,0,t3_356jx1,Should have posted it when it happened forgot sorry.Some background In Spain the whole crime of indecent exposure was eliminated long ago explicitely to allow nudism after the conservative dictatorship fell. But lately with the strong leaning towards the right in most governments including Spain things have changed and in  during the winter they introduced a regulation fining people for total or partial nudity in this city that used to be extremely pronudism. This had happened in Spain many times before and every time it had been rejected as unconstitutional. But this time it was and a few days later they banned nudity on that beach. Now the local naturists are inclined to appeal to the European Union which is not anticipated to have much effect given precedents like the Naked Rambler and others.,nudism,cr1fwfs,1,t5_2qs47

The first person who presents new information is usually not successful but it can eventually get one to consider a new idea. If they are not that type of person then yeah no amount of proof is good. Funny though in our past we all at one time thought we had it right. In scripture there are quite a number of mistranslated words or incorrect definitions. Some of it was no ones fault as we just have more information available now. An example is that the word divorce is only found three times in the Greek in the new testament. The rest of the time it should be translated separated as in still married!!,nudism,cwm2jfj,2,t5_2qs47

It seems like it could literally be hit or miss. Theres an unnofficial nude beach down the cape that I want to try but the idea I could be ticketed kinda turns me off of it.

5697270,0,t1_cx39q3n,Unfortunately there really isnt any room to lay towels down. Club O charges  for a chair for the day but theres another beach chair rental company at the north end that doesnt charge as much but I think their umbrellas are smaller. Club Os area has yellow umbrellas the other place uses blue. If youre a guest at Club O Its included with your room stay though.  My girlfriend and i were there for a week and we did two nude cruises with Captain Alan. He offers them on specific days of the week and you can reserve online. We did both the trip around St. Martin which stops at multiple places to snorkel as well as a wonderful lunch on the other nude beach of St. Martin Happy Bay. There are no companies there offering beach chair rental and barely anyone was at it because I believe its a small hike to get there but if youre looking for a secluded nude beach to just lay a towel down on it would be a good option. The other trip to St Barth was great but if you or your SO get easily seasick the ride is about  mins over open water. You stop at one of the port towns and have a couple hours to walk around before traveling around the island as well. Lunch is served on the boat and a stop is made at the nude beach there too. Im not familiar th Tiki Tiki but I heard good things. Captain Alan was amazing though. We chose to spend the rest of our time there being wonderfully lazy so we havent explored the rest of the island. Thanks for the cake day wishes!

6146372,0,t1_cyfce7n,Social nudism and porn are worlds apart and many genuine naturistnudists will be put off by your user name as that combination usually spells trouble in social circle. So I would suggest you really check your motivation for wanting to pursue this. Ask yourself why this is something you want to get into practice being clothes free at home in a non sexual way before venturing out to social setting.

11132656,0,t3_5ny7yt,I think erections happen for reasons that sometimes bypass the conscious mind altogether. That being said its really irrelevant.The real issue is the discomfort of others  and thats about their insecurities not your behavior. Some women who see you with an erection in their presence will automatically assume youre a pervert. Thats nothing on you. I dont think theres any shame in sexual arousal but you have to be sensitive to other people even if their fears are unfounded. So I say cover it up until it goes away  not because youre ashamed and you shouldnt be but because there may be people present who cant deal with it appropriately.Living in society means being sensitive to the weaknesses of others. Thats true of all societies not just naked ones. The main thing you need to remember is that there is no basis for shame in having an erection. Just be sensitive to the weaknesses of others.,nudism,detvk0o,1,t5_2qs47

11555877,0,t3_64mlr7,Been there many times.  Parking fills up quickly so try and get there before  or so or go late in the day say after  since many people just go for the peak sun.   The nude part is divided into two parts a smaller part up front where you can set up your blankets and so on and a larger part which is a bird sanctuary where you can walk through but you arent supposed to set up there.   The bird sanctuary part is closed sometimes I think a couple weeks in August.  The beach is very deep so you will be walking on a lot of sand to get there although some of it has a plastic mat over it to make it easier.   The place gets a big crowd and it can be a bit of a party scene in spots but you can just find the area with the vibe you like.  Some parts are quieter some are more of a party just like any crowded beach.  Ive seen the percentage of people who are naked rise over time.   Theres a beautiful view of NYC and at low tide there is a sand bar you can walk out to.   People are generally nice but I wouldnt say its super friendly or easy to meet people there either.  Ive gone alone or with friends and always enjoyed it.   You can drive and pay to park or there are also boats from Manhattan and Jersey City.,nudism,dg5v28m,3,t5_2qs47
11578458,0,t1_dg7qo9y,Yes this is definitely a valid point. I dont think anyone accidentally finds out about nudism or discovers their local resorts.I visited a club not far from me on my own. I had a good experience and told some of my friends about it. None had ever been to a nudist resort before but several experssed interest in joining me some time. Interestingly it was only female friends who expressed interest. My male friends didnt seem to care.So heres a situation where I could potentially introduce several women to nudism thus helping with the gender ratio and it was only possible because the resort I visited let me a single male visit alone.,nudism,dg8fals,4,t5_2qs47
