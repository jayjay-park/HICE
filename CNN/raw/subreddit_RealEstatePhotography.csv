2869368,0,t3_2syk8t,You have to use flash to light the room. Two well placed flashes would light everything. Then you set your shutter speed to something like  and that glow around the lights will be gone. You actually set your shutter for the brightest thing in the room. So you dial it in until those lights arent glowing or ghosting anymore. If your taking ambient pictures in a room with no light this is going to keep happening to you. Sometimes Ill just turn off the ceiling lights all together and just flash everything. In this case I dont see bracketing helping you because with no natural light through the windows your dark brackets will just give you a really dark ceiling. I use up to eight off camera flashes for any particular comp and then if I have to some compositing in PS. So thats what Im used to doing. ,RealEstatePhotography,cnu8xsb,1,t5_2sb34
3677732,0,t3_2vl1wl,Small pointer clean up the rooms. Like the bag under the kitchen counter the remotes and weights on the table in front of the TV hide the empty pots in the backyard... Things like that. Nobody wants to buy a home that is messy even if it isnt very messy at all.Great start though.edit  I saw the photos you posted. As far as the orange goes use the white balance tool and you should be fine. And again all I see in photo two are the binders the weights and the karoke mics. Other than that its a great shot. Id also think about moving the bike in the office.It also looks like the color temp in the back room looks a little more yellow than in the main room try taking a temp brush to it.Looking forward to seeing your future work! Keep it up!,RealEstatePhotography,cqbhhg4,1,t5_2sb34

7819124,0,t3_4mcla5,I have the AmazonBasic  pistol grip tripod ..  Its sturdy as hell which means it IS heavy . pounds and the pistol gripball head is awesome.  So affordable and sturdy though slightly heavy but I use it for my real estate photography and its great.  They do sell other lighter weightcarbon fiber tripods.  Ive been happy with AmazonBasic branded items thus far.,RealEstatePhotography,d3uxnme,1,t5_2sb34

8963026,0,t1_d7p3clq,Ive seen some people get great results using a couple of off camera flashes as opposed to bracketing but for me that seems like too much work. Ive been using magic lantern for a couple of years now and I really like some of the features that it opens up. Ive never had an issue with it crashing my camera. Since its only installed on the memory card I think the risks are pretty low. But I can understand especially if youre a pro not wanting to do anything that would compromise your gear.,RealEstatePhotography,d7p7yke,1,t5_2sb34
9028608,0,t1_d7vsswq,Thanks! It looks a little bluemagenta on my monitor. I know mine might have been too warm but it worked for me when I was doing it must have been in a warm mood. It probably looks too bluemagenta to me because I looked at my finished image first before looking at yours. ,RealEstatePhotography,d7x3hjx,1,t5_2sb34
9299411,0,t1_d8umifq,I used to do this full time for the past four years. I worked by myself for the first three years then I switched with a company for the last year. Now Im a realtor! So I only do photography on the side for now since I want to focus more on real estate than growing my photography business again. I only shoot for my loyal clients who have stuck with me since the beginning.I recommend getting a wide angle zoomed lens. Again each property is different with its own unique challenges. If everything was perfect you would be okay with the mm fixed lens. You will find yourself in many situations where you have the perfect angle but your cropping may not be right. You can go back and crop it during the editing process but youre only spending unnecessary time doing that. It may not seem like a big deal but when you begin to shoot more than    homes a day youll begin to see how time consuming this profession can be especially when youre starting out and learning. I would play it safe and get a wide angle zoom lens.,RealEstatePhotography,d8urmch,1,t5_2sb34
9396895,0,t1_d914f09,This is extremely common. As a shooter with another FT job its not the end of the world to wait but if I were FT I would be requiring payment up front unless you were a consistentloyal customer.,RealEstatePhotography,d974f09,1,t5_2sb34

10913603,0,t1_de5n0i8,Invoice and quoteestimate templates for Excel are quite plentiful online.  As far as a contract goes you may be able to find a template online that you could modify for your specific needs but I would recommend having an attorney draft one for you.  Contracts can be tricky especially if youre not well versed in law.  Hiring an attorney to draft a contract specific to your business is money well spent.,RealEstatePhotography,de5nsmf,1,t5_2sb34
