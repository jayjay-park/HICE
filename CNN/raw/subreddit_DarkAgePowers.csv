6377327,0,t1_czegu21,I was thinking we could interface it with a really simple moderator sheet highlighting the fact when squalor reaches a certain level. Alternatively and this make the game less dynamic we could set a hardcap on when certain disasters happen.In terms of moderation I think its more of a case of affecting entire regions with big things like famine disease etc. Disease was rampant and nighonimpossible to curb so saying something like Southern england as defined by a rough region map I can whip up has diseases break out. due to one or more cities breaching a squalor threshold. This can also work well for pushpull factors for example having southern england break out in diseases creating incentive for the saxons to push further north away from the diseaseravaged south.,DarkAgePowers,czej6p2,1,t5_3bya1
