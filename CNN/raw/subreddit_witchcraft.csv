Magic could very safely help someone give themselves the confidence and attitude to make changes in their life. lbs in  months would be a total of  calories in deficit. Which would be a massive undertaking as theyd need to eat roughly  less calories than their maintenance each day.

We were alone in our own houses not working together...I think it was one of those you need to do on a specific day of the year. Anyway...the spell involved smoking a cigar. I lived in my parents house and no one smoked cigars. Lol...In retrospect they were probably very confused at the time.The spell warned that if it is not true love you will drive your lover away.

3662866,0,t3_32bpm5,Spells can be expensive cheap or free. It all boils down to what you feel works best for you  Myself I try to use what is around and readily available to me. Cinnamon basil rosemary are all herbs I use in my kitchen already so no need to buy any special ones just for magick. Sea salt is another component that is already part of my household cleaning array. No need to purchase a bouquet of flowers from the store when I could grow a small pot myself or pick a wild flower while on my daily walk. Instead of a vast array of stones you can use just a few that are special to you perhaps your birth stone or the colours of the elements or chakras. I have a smooth rock I picked up from the lake shore that I like to use in some workings. If you look around you near everything can potentially be used for spell work! Heck my first wand was one I made. I took a branch from my lilac tree one that already was curved and fit nicely in my hand wrapped it in some copper wire from the craft store and inset amethyst above the hilt with the wire. Simple but it worked well for me because I made it so it was full of personal power. But some things one cant make Im still hunting for a good cauldron and I dont mind that I will have to purchase one.Dont necessarily be put off from a magick shop though. They are expensive yes but they are usually locally run and have a niche customer base. I feel way more comfortable giving my money to a small local business owner over a corporate chain new age shop but that is me personally. The lady who runs my local shop makes her own organic healing teas from scratch and they are sooooo good!edit Forgot to add my personal weakness on buying components oils! Damn they get expensive!

3709938,0,t1_cqf5a8p,Id be willing to guess most of us here dont work from any set spells or rituals. One of the things youre likely to run into is high magick versus low magick. High magick is heavily ritualized and exact with particular words and movements. If you want an example you can look up the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram. Low magick is what we generally see more of in witchcraft and it tends to be looser and more akin to the wisewomen at the edge of the village sort of work.There are things that do come up over and over and thats where you may want to look to learn. Herbalism crystals divination energy work etc are all interesting and all stuff that will help you with crafting. Sometimes there are good books that talk about old folk beliefs and healing practices and even though they tend to be more anthropologyfocused they can be great sources of informaiton.I would say its generally a good idea to try and put together your own thing. If you find something like mine that you like figure out what aspect of it you enjoy and use that while building up your own stuff around it. Its great to learn new methods and ways of doing things by talking about what other people do but putting together things on your own will not only help that spell or ritual work better for you it will help you grow and mature as a witch.,witchcraft,cqf5py6,1,t5_2s0ge

You could go really simple and say have a crystal and two candles one representing the deities. Dont worry about it your deities will understand that you are not necessarily able to make them an extravagant altar. With a crystal or some object that isnt very obviously anything you can always play it off as starting a rock collection of pretty stones or something if asked. Another way would be to maybe get a box and mark it memorabilia and collect your things in there and store it somewhere for take down and put up when you need it.

So you could be seeing the future but I wanted to make the distinction.On the one hand if you believe you would benefit from seeing a psychologist then you should. It could be lack of sleep I had very similar split second and shadow hallucinations for around  years for that reason. Im not saying they arent real in some sense but if they are unhelpful and scary theres no point to keeping them around.On the other hand there are somethings you can do on the spiritual side energetic cleansing and shielding I wasnt kidding about the sleep either.

Never forget that YOU are the witch. The power you are sourcing comes from the universe from the Old Ones but YOU are the real focus not the candle. Your mind your body your spirit channels that power. Any physical objects you like to use to focus with can help you do that and they are fun to use but in the end you own your own magic.

6728412,0,t3_47rqu0,In the current paradigm of science I dont think so because reductionism is still preferred over wholism. As a consequence its like using two different languages because science is reductive and descriptive it uses its own abstract models to understand reality these models are purposely differentiated from magical ones. A lot of times science is describing the same things magicoccult will describe but from a reductive perspective rather than one that sees everything working together especially true in the very abstract realms of theoretical science like QM or Maxwells work in electromagnetism. The truth is more like science being a form of magiccredit to uElevenThirtySeven one that reduces describableobservableitems into further and further more complex piecesquantities to glean more knowledge in order to imagine new ways to manipulate our physical reality. Theres a huge mind and spirit component to this but Its highly esoteric and thats why attempts to merge magick lingo with science come out looking so corny.The best attempt at that was good old Alchemy and no one can really deny that because even modern physicalist models of today are built on the experimentsmaths and observations of a big time alchemist last named Newton. ,witchcraft,d0f9ytp,7,t5_2s0ge

I more have a problem personally with attributing any sort of power to a deity as I had a very hard time with guilt when I was leaving Christianity. From what Ive read though Im starting to feel correct me if Im wrong as if witches work in unison with their deities rather than be controlled by them which I think is very interesting. But again Im not really interested in working with or believing in a higher power. How do you feel about wicca? Astral projection is something Ive been interested in before but I actually didnt realise that it was related to witchcraft in any way. It wont be something I will be trying any time soon. But possibly in the future when Im more connected to myself and feel stronger about my beliefs. Would you say that the type of magick Im interested in would be considered green witchcraft then?

Im familiar with the Chaos Sigil work youve practiced as with a few other traditions of ecstatic spellwork from Norse and Mesoamerican contexts so we can talk about those as well.  Im curious what youd like to learn or discover.  Are you just casting about for some advice or is there a specific area of practice you want to hone in on?,witchcraft,d908nuo,1,t5_2s0ge

9705987,0,t3_5e08k4,Selfintuition is in my opinion an oxymoron. Your thinking of selfdedication. Initiation requires at least one other although the exception would be spirit led initiation. Dedication on the other hand is a personal led selfrite.Ive done selfdedication rites in the form of sacred blasphemy The widdershins rite the crossroads rite and the blood baptism rite. Ive also been inducted by spirits into covenants that brought a deathlike renewal over me which as I stated could be considered spirit initiation.,witchcraft,da9gys9,1,t5_2s0ge
9729837,0,t3_5eh43d,Magic works if you believe in it because witchcraft is all about believing will and energy. I was also skeptic when i first started practicing. Just think that you dont have enough proof to think magic and deities exist but neither you have enough proof to think they dont! Try to convince yourself when practicing witchcraft just to see what happens! You know when people tell a lie and they actually believe it? Its easy just do that to try.,witchcraft,daceyat,2,t5_2s0ge

9785465,0,t1_daiihui,Awesome  But my sad reply is AHS creates a really cool witchcraft culture which doesnt really have any basis in reality. Some things are based on occult imagery but in a shallow way. I understand that voudouisants are particularly dismayed by the depiction of Papa Legba who is a complex spiritual figure rather than a generic cool boogieman in an excellent hat.Think of Coven as like Harry Potter or something.,witchcraft,daj9sjm,3,t5_2s0ge

9854503,0,t3_5gen11,I stood on this question for an extremely long time. Like some before me have said a lot of people out there make it seem like everyone has their deity and its hard not to feel that way when you go looking for answers and all you find are a ton of people gushing about how amazing their patron gods isare. I did eventually settle on a patron deity but keep that in mind you can make the choice! It sounds so amazing and magical and wonderful to be chosen somehow but if we are even partially divine in our own right apologies if you dont ascribe to that belief! whats to stop us from choosing a deity we feel connected to or one who embodies those things we wish to be closer to? Even if its just for a while theres no harm in exploring the possible relationship you might have with a goddess.Best of luck. ,witchcraft,das2by0,2,t5_2s0ge

10284226,0,t3_5m9503,I would actually involve your husband put on some music light the nicest smelling candles and have him sit and meditate. Maybe write his worries on small scrap paper and have him burn each one or rip them to shreds. And then do something together that will be very relaxing almost like a spa or soothing bath. While this is happening put your protection spell on him.The way I see it the tranquility will remind him about it when he needs it during work and this act of meditation and cleansing is the perfect time to put a protection spell on him. Everyone will feel relaxed and the next work day will be like a reset to him. Not to mention you did all this together so it could start a newer kind of psychic bond between you. I have to say I dont practice many spells and not a wiccan but whenever i make one up using intentions and a new way of doing a spell it has worked each time.,witchcraft,dc9ruxy,2,t5_2s0ge

10501967,0,t3_5plmld,Why would you ignore literally thousands of years of magickal religious spiritual precedent and treat YHVH GOD like any other entity. Even Demonic Evocation is based on His power. You do not approach him as some spirit you approach him as God. He has made that clear over thousands of years. I am not trying to be mean but Im shocked. What gave you the idea to do this? Really I am interested.,witchcraft,dcyic5k,1,t5_2s0ge

I predicted a lot of chaos fighting confusion etc...but   lightsunnew beginnings at the end of the tunnel.

Try practicing some selfcare. If youve been overworked try to see if you can have a day off. Go to a spa spend your day baking go out into the sun play that video game you havent had time for... Of course you know yourself and what works for you best.You are the anchor for that connection youre missing.
