3316049,0,t3_2y2a18,Im nearly positive this is a flaw and not by design.  I had issues of uneven stiffness myself with the throttle I ordered from Amazon recently and returned it for a new one.  The second has a slightly uneven resistance at a completely different point and I was tempted to return it as well. However having already received one complete dud and because this one has loosened up to the point that I dont notice the skip in the throttle its not a stiffer point its actually a point at which the resistance suddenly disappears Ive decided to just keep it.If you check the CH hangar forum one of the recent posts is filled with people having the same problem. I believe that this most recent batch is suffering from QC issues for whatever reason. There is a contact name in the thread to get an exchange directly from CH  might be worth following up on.

4545834,0,t3_3db1pc,Ill echo CH and add that they make excellent quality gear and have solid and reputable support. I have a full CH setup and started with the Throttle its a great piece of kit and the analog stick on it is awesome. The throttle is on a slide which some people dont like and all CH gear is the opposite of flashy if thats an issue flip side is they last actual decades.Good luck and have fun pretty sure VKB just released a throttle too but theyre out of Europe but with exchange and customs it might be less still than a CH and arguably faster.

4816353,0,t3_3gud7c,Id like to offer a counter review to the X as I happen to own one as well.Look amp Feel  The thing looks pretty fantastic and its pretty comfortable in the hands. I would complain that its a bit too big for small hands like mine. But the thing looks fantastic most of the switches and buttons on the throttle are pretty comfortable to reach with minimal hand adjustment.  More on the Feel though The stick lacks some strength. Just resting my hand on it causes it to lean slightly and roll meaning it requires deadzones which is a negative Stepping Issues Stepping is when the tension on an axis isnt consistent across the board. As you pitch or roll or yaw with this stick youll feel bits where its tighter or looser in places. This causes problems with over correction.Setup and Instillation  Virtually Idiot Proof and the Saitek Software is actually pretty good. PROBLEMS GHOST BUTTONS  The throttle is really bad for this I didnt have problems with the stick on this just the throttle. Ghost buttons is where you dont press a button turn a dial or hit a switch and yet you get input as if you did. Powered USB hub required  This solves the ghosting problem mostly. I still had some buttons ghost after a powered hub I mentioned Stepping issues in the feel. I also mentioned bad stability in the stick as just resting my hand on it inputed a roll without deadzones Throttle lost its ability to hold its tension after a month Throttle developed a short in two buttons causing them to press when throttle was all the way forward after a couple months of ownership so yeah a ghosting knob and two more buttons I cant use.PRICEVALUE for Money  The stick just has too many problems to justify its cost. If it were a  dollar hotas I might say it was worth that but the Hotas X is  bucks and much higher quality so maybe  dollars at best. I might be feeling a bit harsh here though because I got some serious buyers remorse after realizing everything wrong with this hotas I would highly recommend looking elsewhere for a hotas. Thrustmaster and CH Products seem to be the better route to take as I hardly go a week without hearing of X or X problems.I do agree with the OP though because moving from something like mampkb or an xbox controller or single stick a hotas is a whole new world of immersion and control.,hotas,cu1n2o6,1,t5_32txt

Also with a joystick  analogue axes  pitchroll pedals  analogue axes  yaw and CH pro throttle  axes  throttle  verticalhorizontal strafe I personally think thats more than enough for most space or flight sims.The only other really important analogue input would be for looking around the cockpit in which case youre far better off with some sort of head tracking either IR LED clip face tracking edtracker or VR instead of having it bound to the HOTASHOSAS.,hotas,d0quseh,1,t5_32txt

6988736,0,t1_d18bp7f,I use a CH setup with a Combatstick instead of the usual Fighterstick so I have a thumb button instead of a hat.

I prefer the thumb button when I play WW sims the only time I want the four more hat buttons is in DCS and rarely.Roughly three dozen buttons on two hands more on a Fighterstick.Also analog stick which is killer for space sims.,hotas,d18ijdb,1,t5_32txt
7019795,0,t1_d1c170l,Dual sticks have more precision when strafing but can have less control over your throttle. HOTAS has comfortable and precise control over your throttle and decent precision with strafing.Basically the main thing it seems to come down to is precise strafing vs precise throttle control. But if you intend to play flight sims as well as space sims then HOTAS wins.Personally I went with the CH Pro Throttle due to the amount of buttons as well as the fact that I tend to play flight sims as well as space sims but it really boils down to personal preference when only considering space sim functionality.Edit Heres a video of the delta throttle in ED.Edit  If you dont mind upgrading in the future and quickly want a decent setup without spending too much then dual tm is probably the best option.,hotas,d1c1l1m,2,t5_32txt

7680574,0,t1_d3f2ocl,As for the wiring honestly I dont know.  When I replaced the wires and put them in a loom they seemed to move better with no stress points.  Again Im only an amateur when it comes to this so its my best guess.  But as I said in a previous comment to someone else in the three Xs I had all of which had broken throttle wires all of the wires seemed to break in the exact same location at a pivot point indicating a stress point.  When I replaced the wires and put them in a loom it seemed to solve this problem.As far as the pot in the stick base youre correct.  Its not the quality of the pot itself but rather the centering mechanism more specifically the spring thats being used to recenter the unit. And yes while it is certainly something that can be fixed andor adjusted my main point is I shouldnt have to do such service on a device of this price.,hotas,d3f8gxz,2,t5_32txt
7724492,0,t3_4l2lv7,Yeah Ive been using one for about a year now.  Its not horrible for the price but its not great either.  The design is kind of cheesy.  A few observations the center mount joystick platform is nearly useless that is unless you like having your joystick mounted cm above your lap and the joystick handle at the level of your sternum.  I opted to toss the plastic platform but retain the pole that it mounts on.  I used a couple of RAM mounts with pole clamps to make keyboard  mousepad platforms  which works well but Ive spent at least  euro extra on this bit of customization so far. The included platforms on either side for joystick  throttle are not very stable.  Its good enough as is for the throttle but my forcesense joystick was not usable without extra reinforcement.  I bought a couple of cm steel reinforcement tubes and connected the corners of the platform to the base of the chair.  That secures it nicely but it means the platform is no longer adjustble and required a bit of work with a drill hacksaw and wrench. Once youve got everything setup as I do its not easy to get into and out of the chair. The chair itself is not uncomfortable but I wouldnt call it plush either.  The seat is a somewhat cheaper imitation of a racing car seat.  After about  hours I do need to get up and take the dog for a walk just to stretch my legs.If I had to do it all over again Id custom build myself a cockpit using a real car seat.,hotas,d3k7yyi,4,t5_32txt

7889294,0,t3_4ncjdg,Gamepads are actually incredibly inaccurate but the way in which you use them and how games handle them makes them seem ok... they require a massive deadzone basically.I think that if you are measuring accuracy for a joystick in terms of deadzone then it doesnt get much better than the Tm. Ive got one and it has essentially zero deadzone.  As soon as you apply any amount of pressure there is a change in value and at rest in the center it stays squarely on zero.  There is a bit of a center detent but it doesnt really keep you from adjusting your aim in any significant way.The T.flight has a bit of a deadzone and youll notice a dramatic deference with the Tm as long as you are flying something nimble.  The only place that the Tm has some deadzone is in the yaw twist axis...,hotas,d42tvkn,5,t5_32txt

All of the PC games as well as HCS appear to be preintegrated with keyboard bindings so does Saitek but not Thrustmaster.  Thrustmaster has the better joystick and CH has the better throttle but Saitek has the better integration.Here is a hint for anyone planning to use VoiceAttackHCS start out with keybinds for the mouse and keyboard or Saitek then add VoiceAttack  your voice of choice then if necessary integrate additional controllers.

8741394,0,t1_d6xodzf,Ive seen your designs on other sim forums. Exceptional work! Id love to snatch one up once your project is done especially the MkIV with cam centering!gt The reason there are centering mechanisms on both sides of the assembly is because of the high mass of the Warthog grip or using an extension. You can only use so strong of a spring in that position before it leads to mechanical failureThis made me think of my last Cougar which failed from total gimbal annihilation. They used a single spring centered on the axis to center both directions. The tension on the spring at the highest stick angle is extreme! Have you checked out the Gladiator gimbal? Its supposed to be based on the Cobra M but with some modifications including the use of damping grease to help with the center detent. I hate the center detent on the CH Fighterstick and Ive been thinking of using some Nyogel a on the gimbal to see if it can alleviate the extreme detent it has when switching rocker arms.,hotas,d6ybqvk,1,t5_32txt

8830383,0,t1_d799n1o,Oh I know the thinking behind it but to me the opposite is true. Twist makes sense for roll because it feels like thats the motion to roll and yaw on the xaxis it feels like the motion for a flat yaw movement.I dunno its weird but those feel like the most natural way for my physical movements to translate out to my physicality with the ship if that makes any kind of sense at all.,hotas,d79aedd,1,t5_32txt

Next unplug the stick and the throttle and open Device Manager.  Enable showing of hidden devices and find the X probably under Human Interface Devices or Game Controllers and uninstall any instances of both stick and throttle my X installed about ten times.  Next install the driver and check back on Saiteks site  it may not be a combined installer  grab the one for the software if its separate.  If it is separate thatll be why it didnt install but starting from a clean slate cant hurt.  Install the software before plugging the stick and throttle back in.
