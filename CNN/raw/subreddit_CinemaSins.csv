Favorite subreddits?Also what are your favorite Youtube Channels? Examples could be Game Grumps RoosterTeeth Yogscast. I list those since they all seem to have large Reddit followings as opposed to this one. Any plans on fleshing this one out to grow to those subs?Well..  looks like managed to make this rather long for not know what my question will be at the start of it. Sorry about that!

2219819,0,t3_2k5kfw,Although this is a step up I still think these videos are missing something compared to cinemasins. Part of the reason that I enjoy cinemasins so much is how fastpaced it is. It makes it a lot funnier and convinces you to watch it multiple times to truly understand all of the jokes that are packed into each episode. Whereas with brandsins it feels a lot more slow paced. The delivery can make or break the joke and although these jokes arent exactly broken I personally think that theyre delivered better on cinemasins.Then again this is just my opinion and Ill continue to watch both channels regardless.,CinemaSins,cllzq6x,3,t5_2yy0f

Whenever a robot has turned evil their chest glows red instead of blue and the movie has no explanation for that But... they do. The glow represents their uplink to USR Headquarters and its how VIKI controls them. This also explains why the older model robots and Sonny remain good.  Still doesnt explain his unhinged hatred of robots or how he was able to spraypaint his arm back together They literally explain it in the next scene and we already have products like silicone skin its not that big of a stretch that they might have it in spray form in .  Why did the robot save him instead of the little girl Spooner explains this right after the flashback and he skipped over it! Its because the robot analyzed the situation and determined that Spooner had a higher probability of survival. Thats also why he hates the robots and their logical thinking so much theres no human instinct and a human would have tried saving her anyway.  The three laws devolve into robot chaos Thats not the three laws at work thats just VIKI trying to destroy the nonuplink robots because she couldnt control them and they interfered with her plans.   Half of the reject robots still care for human lifethree laws programming only affects half of the robot population They explain this several times! The older models dont have the uplink and cannot be controlled by VIKI. The NS robots were never shown trying to harm a human like the NS robots.  Sonny assimilated the winkwhenyourelying thing This is a callback to the interrogation scene when Spooner does the same gesture and explains its significance to Sonny. Hence Spooners reaction and understanding Sonnys use of it. Im normally not one to complain about this sort of thing but seriously this is awful. Whoever wrote the sins for this movie either didnt watch it or completely ignored key elements for the sake of padding the sin counter. The last sin showed that they clearly understand it was VIKI that was in control of the robots so why ignore that fact for so many previous sins?I havent seen the movie recently and even I can remember these plot points. ,CinemaSins,dal38ll,115,t5_2yy0f

Theyre nearly impossible to aim they dont fly well they tend to tumble... and after a few feet they wont even penetrate skin.Heres a video showing this in action,CinemaSins,danw53g,9,t5_2yy0f

If a movie studio bought the film rights for The Ables would you be happy and what level of involvement direct write the script produce etc. would you want? Or would you want Barret or Chris to be involved as well or instead of you?,CinemaSins,db00tma,1,t5_2yy0f

10264021,0,t1_dbrywea,Well cannon is very loosely defined in Doctor Who because of the whole time can be rewrittenunwritten shenanigans technically because of a few throwaway lines from series  the events of The Next Doctor and the end of series  never happened. I think the writers are on record as saying they can basically do what they want with cannon because of all the wibblywobbly timeywimey handwaving they do.The movie and Paul McGanns tenure which I believe includes some audiobooks and a prequel short for the th anniversary special is definitely cannon as much as anything else in Doctor who. The new series just ignores it because they can. The movie was filled with its own inconsistencies to the old cannon and wasnt terribly well received so why would they address it or anything that happened? They just dont deal with it just like they ignore most of the old series hell Moffat barely acknowledges events from the RTD era. Dont get me wrong I love Doctor Who but for the most part they pretty much just do whatever is convenient for them cannon wise.,CinemaSins,dc7hdwr,1,t5_2yy0f
10551353,0,t3_5qg65u,Since x would be great at Cinema Sins is a regular gag in your videos Im interested to know what you guys think of those moments in films when they acknowledge plot holes. I think it can show that the film makers respect their audience but a friend of mine hates it because if the film makers were aware of a plot hole in their film why didnt they just get rid of it?What are your favourite inanimate objects in movies that could be considered characters in their own right? For example Wilson in Castaway.Whats your favourite character in a movie that never speaks? For example Jason Voorhees or Dumbo.,CinemaSins,dd444nm,1,t5_2yy0f
