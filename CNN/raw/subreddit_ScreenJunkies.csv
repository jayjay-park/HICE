6657653,0,t1_d07xymy,nd Edit After looking into it to answer simply yes his seat change is taken into consideration. The personpeople editing the Wikipedia page listed the contestants in the correct order....from first to last starting closest to Andy regardless of what side he sat on. I went through each episode just to verify. The numbers all check out. ,ScreenJunkies,d07yj8j,2,t5_2zl6l
6659467,0,t3_46sogs,I have no problem with Andy being biased. This is not a real contest its for our entertainment.What pisses me off he that he keeps denying that he is. I know that hes probably just not aware. But his bias comes into the game a lot of times and by varied ways.I just wish that he aknowledge that he can be biased some times as hes not free from error. It only makes him look worse when he keeps denying and with a cynical attittude.Great research I hope he sees this and doesnt take it as an offense. Because it most surely isnt. Its human behaviour.,ScreenJunkies,d0859up,5,t5_2zl6l
