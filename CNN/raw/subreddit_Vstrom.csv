5376898,0,t1_cvys9hx,gt Ive got a  A with about k miles on it great bikes.Indeed.gt Where did you order the caliper rebuild kit from? Been thinking of doing mine too. I didnt order a kit but I think ebay has kits specifically for a DL. I just ordered Suzuki parts from cheapcycleparts.com. They have a tool to pull up the caliper parts list.  Heres yours K DLA Front Caliper  I just ordered rubber seal parts  and new pads not from Suzuki which is all you need to rebuild the calipers. I am also rebuilding my master cylinders front and rear. My pistons were in good shape but the caliper carriages  amp  and brake pad pins  were too worn for my liking so I bite the bullet and replaced those as well kaaching! gt Does the k shock bolt right up?Yes it fits right in but it can be difficult if you dont pull the exhaust which I was doing anyway to service the rear suspension bearings. It does raise the bike about  of an inch so that could be a problem for shorter riders.gt Will have to take a look at your thread curious how bad the wheel bearings swap is too.I havent updated my thread lately. I hurt my hand and took a long hiatus.  I am gearing up to finish this Fall.  The suspension bearings were a real bitch and I would never do that again I should have taken them to a mechanic. The rear wheel bearings there are three came out real easy but I used a blind bearing puller hammer type so it does take a special tool.  I bought a new chainsprocket set and those rubber cushions in the rear hub. I havent actually installed the new bearings yet but they are in my freezer and I will probably assemble the rear wheel this weekend.  gt Did my counter shaft seal and the  or  other rubber seals over there last year they all tend to weep oil in higher mileage stroms and svs..I hate oil leaks so that was on my list too. I am hoping once I get through all this work I can just ride.gt also had a little water crossing debacle.. after purging all the water the bike ran great.. but ended up replacing the stator shortly thereafter and then having to rebuild the starter shortly after that. Not positive but I assume related.That would make me sad if I did that to my bike.  I think Im sticking to asphalt for now!,Vstrom,cvyyjy8,1,t5_2vtjz
