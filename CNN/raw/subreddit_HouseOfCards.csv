209376,0,t1_cf29w0y,I see what youre saying and from a TV Show point of view youre right.  If theyre only doing  seasons of the show they need to move the plotline forward quickly...From a historic point of view though the best thing Frank could do in the VP chair is to consolidate his power.  Honestly a lot of his power right now is in perceived power.  Hes not incredibly rich he doesnt have the massive love of the people or of his colleagues etc.  His power comes from that he looks powerful bluffs well and is a master manipulator.  In truth hes an upjumped House member from South Carolina.   There really havent been a lot of VPs that came straight from the house.  None if my brief skim here is accurate.  Anyone who has gone on to the VP or Presidency has done it through another route.  CIA director Senator Cabinet member etc...  Franks real world path would be to solidify his position as a party leader and permanent Administration presence for the next  years.  Hes young he could BE the next Dick Cheney influencing policy in the Oval Office for the next  years.  Not trying to undercut the President in the hopes he can backstab his way into the job...But its televsion.  So who knows.  ,HouseOfCards,cf2aibn,1,t5_2t3ft

Rachel can point at Doug Stamper which implicates Underwood.Also remember that Rachel was hired by Doug again to make Peter Russo fall off the wagon again.  That is how Peter Russo became drunk for the radio interview which resulted in Peter going crazy.  I think the implication here is that Rachel can believe that she somehow helped with how Russo died even if she doesnt know that Frank himself killed Peter.At the end of season one ZoeLucasJanin had a theory about who Peter Russo was helping when he gave up the naval yard and also visited Kaepernick to convince him to say that Kern the Secretary of State that was about to be nominated instead of Frank wrote the article about Israel in the college newspaper which helped Cathy Durant get the nod for SOS.,HouseOfCards,cfh0o5w,3,t5_2t3ft

350753,0,t3_1y2ocm,The ring was as important to Frank as his school was. The episode where the library was being built in Franks honor it was hard to tell how Frank actually felt about the school he attended. Ive seen many people mention that the only reason he may have actually held the memories of his school so dear was because it was the place where he spent time with his best friendlover. The school and the Library brought up a lot of conflicting emotions with Frank. On one end Frank seems to hold no respect for honoring historical figures. At the Sentinel he asked one of his professors why we mourn dead presidents. Throughout the episode Frank makes no comments or gestures to show any sort of gratitude towards his legend being preserved in the library and yet he seems hurt when he overhears students speaking about him as if he wasnt anyone worth knowing. I think at this moment any honor that Frank had in preserving his legend had been erased. He accepted that not only will he die but his memories and all of his accomplishments no matter how great will die as well. I feel that this episode encouraged Frank to pursue living for the moment and not worrying about what his legend will be or how he will be remembered to future generations. The speech Frank gave at the opening of the Library built in his name was more like a eulogy. It felt like we were experiencing the death of any honor Frank had left for his school his hopes of being a legend the library and his class ring. We didnt see that honor come back until Frank met the man who spoke for his great grandfather. It seemed to put a spell on Frank and since then the entire grounds which the battle took place took hold of Frank and seemed to change his attitude towards the dead legends and honor. I think Frank felt haunted by the battle and the knowledge that his great grandfather was willing to fight for what he believed was right. Frank stands for the opposite of everything his great grandfather was in that battle. I think Frank realized this and felt that the ring belonged more in the grounds than it did with him. ,HouseOfCards,cfh4g1v,4,t5_2t3ft

445604,0,t3_1z6icd,I dont think there is some thread that connects them all together like they symbolize her conscience or something.The lady in the cemetery tells her she shouldnt be exercisingjogging in a place where you society in general has respect for the dead. I dont know what it says about me that Ive thought cemeteries should be in business with gyms before as all those lanes in a cemetery would be great for joggers and bikers. They could even have a marketing slogan like The more time you spend here the later youll get here. This encounter does have an impact on her later when she stops at the entrance to the cemetery and decides to not jog there.The incident with the cashier calls back to the office manager she fired. The office manager brought up to Claire that in our ageist society even people with skills and great recommendations are still discriminated against due to their age and she would not be able to find a job except one similar to the cashier. This made her see the impact of that decision a representation of it. We see that one of the reasons she lists for wanting to take Sancorps money from Remy is that she can hire back all the people she fired. I think that incident also had an effect because she never gave the sole reason for firing the people as not having enough money it was also about focusing on a new direction.The homeless person with the money caused her to learn origami and I think was an indirect cause of her feeling dissatisfied with her life and going again to Adam in New York without telling Frank. She had a choice to become someone else there. We know that she has all the money in the relationship father was an oil man in Dallas funded Franks first campaign. And while I think we know now that she truly loves and is loyal to Frank we didnt know then and it is because of the decision she made to not stay with Adam that we know it. She could have easily left Frank if she decided that happiness was more important to her than power. And anyone that thinks Well to Claire happiness is power.

577879,0,t3_20r23k,To understand this you have to really understand both the US Government in broad strokes and the Congress in broad strokes. And its super complicated shit so bear with me. The US government process is broken up into  branches  legislative Congress executive President and judicial Supreme Court. Congress writes the proposed laws or bills the President either signs off on the bills to make them laws OR vetoes them and the Supreme Court reviews complaints about laws and whether they are in line with the US Constitution. Franks job in season  is mostly confined to the Congress so I will explain Congress further. Congress is broken up into  houses the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House currently has  total members each state having a different number or Reps based on their population size. The Senate has  total members each state having exactly  Senators. The reason for this is because the Founding Fathers could not agree on the best way to for the people to be represented...large states like Virginia wanted proportional representation because they had more people and could thus swing their weight to influence laws smaller states like Rhode Island wanted even representation so that they could then be seen as a peer to large states like Virginia instead of overlooked as unimportant. So the Founders split the difference. Now the way that Congress writes a bill is very complicated but the general rule of thumb is that BOTH the House and Senate have to agree on the EXACT SAME TEXT before the bill can be sent to the President for a signature or veto. The simplistic way this happens is as such. House writes its own version of a bill and passes it in the House. Senate writes its own version of a bill and passes it in the Senate. Reps from both House and Senate sit down in a Conference Committee and iron out the differences between the two versions and draft a compromise version. . The compromise version is sent to both House and Senate for debate and final vote.. If passed by both House and Senate the bill goes to President for signature or veto. This process can be changed a bit  for example the Conference Committee can be skipped if one chamber passes the exact same text as the other  eg if the Senate passes a bill the House can vote on the exact Senate bill wordforword and if passed can be sent directly to the President.Of course thats more simple than it truly is because a bill has to actually be written first. Any member can write a bill but not just any bill can be immediately brought to the floor for a vote  it has to first go to a committee either House or Senate depending on who the writer is. So when you see Frank writing the education bill hes taking his first stab at writing it and has no idea if it would ever clear committee. Later on hes meeting with reps from the Teachers Unions to see if the language in the bill is alright for them  because if it is then the Unions could encourage their Reps or Senators to either publicly support or not support the proposed bill. Unfortunately the series jumps a few steps and just lands the Education bill on the Presidents desk after the Teacher strike is done...but in between then it still has to clear a committe and both the House and Senate has to vote on it. Thats where Franks main job comes in. Frank is a member of the House Leadership as a Whip. A Whips job is to constantly gauge where all the members of his party stand on any issue  i.e. if I were to tell you a plan I need to know if you like my plan or not. And if the leadership wants bills to be passed its the Whips job to apply pressure to their members to get their support  i.e. whipping votes. The unspoken rule of thumb in US legislative politics is nobody wants to bring an issue to a vote on the floor unless they know they can pass it  because if it fails to pass then they have to start from scratch and its a sign of weakness in the Leadership. Thats why Frank is constantly gauging members in his party as to how they feel about voting for a bill giving them an incentive to support it eg. if I were to include a passage that is favorable to your constituents I expect your support of this bill in return or outright demanding they support it. tldr  its complicated. But Franks job generally is to ensure that new laws proposed have enough support to be passed by Congress the lawmaking body of the US Government. He has to negotiate pressure and cut deals with members of Congress to ensure they support the bills.Hopefully this answers some of your questions but Im happy to answer more if you have any.

1724831,0,t3_2dvg1x,For three major reasons I think youre absolutely right. Ive seen the UK series where Urquharts wife arranges for his assassination in order to escape conviction on some illegal business dealings in Cyprus. Weve seen before that Claires loyalty to Frank may not be absolute. As you mention with the Watershed bill when she helps tank it when she cries over the young Marine events like that. The final scene of season two. Frank wants Claire to come into the Oval Office with him. He asks at least twice. Claire refuses and tells him to go in alone. In a very symbolic way this indicates that Claire may not entirely be on Franks team any more. For a show so heavy in foreshadowing and symbolism Meechaum and Frank playing catch for instance I dont think that this can be discounted.Claire is the only person Frank trusts implicitly. Stampers dead Seths loyalties are a mystery and Frank has alienated anyone else who was ever on his side. Claire is really the only person Frank has left well and Meechaum but I dont know that hes much of a player. If Claire turns on Frank he will be very very alone and that could be a really brilliant season of television.,HouseOfCards,cjwkvac,3,t5_2t3ft

2491121,0,t1_cmjplf7,When does he make it clear at the start of the season he will end up in the oval office?It is not until later in Season  and possibly near the end of season  that he talks more and more about his distaste with the President and Raymond Tusk. But he never makes it clear that he wants to end up in the oval office. The only scene in season  that might foreshadow his presidency is when Claire goes against him by opposing the watershed bill. Frank goes to her office and says something along the lines about how she went against their plans that they agreed on a long time before what they are trying to accomplish. But even then they never mention anything about presidency.The reason why I bring this up is because I do not think his goal is to simply become President. From the beginning of the show Frank is ruthless about pursuing things and rarely defends his position. Hes always trying to gain more power. So yes he will spend little time defending his Presidency role in Season  but he will work more towards reaching the goal or plans he discussed with Claire in the previous scene.If Frank is power hungry which he has talked about before what more power can the most powerful man in the world want? Well according to Forbes the most powerful man in the world is Russias President followed by USA and then China. Could that mean that Frank is going to go after the Russians president power? Maybe not. There is a stronger possibility that he goes after China since Raymond Tusk has a valuable relationship with their government. Maybe he will try to form an ally with China and then merge both countries together. Then become President of both countries. It is a farfetched idea.Another reason why this show is one of the best. It is too difficult to tell Franks next move or real motives. ... After reading everything I typed I feel like there is too much for Frank to cover up. Zoes boyfriend Lucas trying to get revenge for her death the hacker Dougs death etc. So maybe season  will have Frank defending his presidency for most of the time.,HouseOfCards,cmjq7k7,7,t5_2t3ft

I think the focus was on creating the tension of a close vote before the scene in question but have Underwoods troupe minus Claire believe they had secured the needed votes. If he hadnt believed the votes were in the bag I believe we wouldve watched a scene more reminiscent to his Season  interactions with Blythe.Putting Underwood in his office with a glass of champagne shows him in a confidentlyassured dominant light. Rather than frantically dance across the House floor to whip lastminute votes his carry a big stick mentality further illustrated the notion that he believed the vote was in the bag. Discovering that the work surrounding the Watershed bill came crashing down by only two votes in the last seconds of voting procedure made Claires betrayal that more painful.,HouseOfCards,cokdy8g,2,t5_2t3ft

3200793,0,t1_cotpcey,The way Frank seems to instantly know of whom she is speaking always made me think they are their imaginary children maybe the children they would have had together although the math might not add up since she previously admitted to three abortions.I never considered that they were Russos kids but now that seems pretty obvious and I suppose she and Frank could have discussed them at some point.  He has met them himself and would have told Claire about them as he did with the spider in Zoes apartment.Maybe the dream is a manifestation of her guilt over their actions finally coming to a head after making a connection conscious or unconscious to what it would be like if that happened to her kids.  Not that she would be breaking from the plan or her dedication to Frank but it would be interesting character development to show humanizing moment of doubt before they move forward together.,HouseOfCards,cotrfeo,2,t5_2t3ft

Remember that Secret Service agents are allowed to be questioned.It happened during the Clinton presidency I think this is part of Frank and Claires way of letting the agent know the ramifications on HIS life if he ever spilled the beans of any wrongdoing they committed in his presence.Just my take on things. ,HouseOfCards,coy7aqa,5,t5_2t3ft

Meechum might be the only else as unwavering loyal. Remember that Doug broke his arm and duct taped a spoon to prove himself loyal. Hes calculator and destructive.

The people who go with him do it because they have to Russo Walker because theyre naive Blythe or because they have something to gain in return everyone else.Franks problem when he gets to the top is nobody actually trusts him. When he still had somewhere to go people were willing to deal with him because he had incentives to hold up his end. As president he has more to offer but ironically is a weaker negotiator because nobody believes that hell follow through.

At one point during the season he simply looked at the audience and said Ill slit her fucking throat in broad daylight. What is compelling or intelligent about that? Its just fucked up and it made me wince to hear it. Any boring unlovable sociopath of a character can say and think stuff like that. Instead they could make a show where we follow Joffrey around Westeros as he breaks the fourth wall and inflicts uninspired generic acts of sadism on innocent people. Whereas Frank used to show class and skill in the way he manipulated everyone in a room now he only loses his temper and says disturbingly repulsive things about how he wants to hurt people. It made him stop being a character that was worth following. Whether this is necessary for the shows development and Franks downfall is another discussion but its a reason why I didnt like the season as much.

3301707,0,t1_cp3xsyv,Ive been thinking about Yates some more... He is addicted to Franks story just like us. This is why Frank doesnt have to break the fourth wall the audience and narrator has become personified as Yates.In the prologue Yates is spooling out Franks made up story about swimming the river despite the odds. Frank intends the story to highlight his determination his willingness to attempt the impossible. Similarly the show is initially about Frank clawing his way to the top. Living vicariously through Frank we feel his energy revel in his success. But sofar he isnt president by election  he hasnt made it across the river so to speak and he is losing feeling in his limbs losing the allies who have gotten him this far.Simultaneously Yates is dissatisfied with sugar coated talking points and selfserving propaganda from Frank  the real story is not some masturbatory and sociopathic vicarious experience for the audience. House of Cards is about Frank AND Claire. This is their house their legacy. This is what Claire finds so threatening about Yates  he observes and exposes their charade. And through him she realizes the truth Frank no longer considers himself her partner nor her equal. She is sacrificing her blood body and aspirations for his success. Likewise Frank is angered by the chapter  this is not what he wants. He wants a story of his great climb to power his selfpropaganda. Frank wants to silence this story but Yates says it does not belong to him. And so the show continues not as the Frank Show but as House of Cards the shaky legacy that will come toppling down unless Frank and Claire both realize that together they are the story and need each other to succeed.,HouseOfCards,cp4mddl,14,t5_2t3ft

The bombings together with the Dagestan War led the country into the Second Chechen WargtThe blasts hit Buynaksk on  September Moscow on  September and  September and Volgodonsk on  September. A similar explosive device was found and defused in an apartment block in the Russian city of Ryazan on September .  The next day thenPrime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan and ordered the air bombing of Grozny which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War.  A few hours later three FSB agents who had planted this device were arrested by the local police. The incident was declared to be a training exercise. These events led to allegations that the bombings were a false flag attack perpetrated by the FSB in order to legitimize the resumption of military activities in Chechnya and bring Vladimir Putin to power.  gtParliament member Yuri Shchekochikhin filed two motions for a parliamentary investigation of the events but the motions were rejected by the Russian Duma in March . An independent  public commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma deputy Sergei Kovalev The commission was rendered ineffective because of government refusal to respond to its inquiries.   Two key members of the Kovalev Commission Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin have since died in apparent assassinations.

Once the Presidency was conquered Claire realized that they were no longer equal  Frank was the President and was therefore inherently more powerful for the next  years. Not wanting to being just the First Lady Claire sought nomination for the US Ambassador position. However unlike the Presidency you cant lie cheat steal and kill your way to it.

3405800,0,t1_cpgc53r,gt From your link. Teenagers  are  of the civilian noninstitutional population and unemployed teenagers are the smallest demographic of the unemployed aside from . To say it might be an exaggeration is an exaggeration.Thats beside the point. Youre taking a program designed to transfer money from younger people to older people and using it to transfer money from younger people back to younger people. The older people get screwed by definition.gtIt looks like our fundamental difference is that you dont believe there will be an increase in demand from AmWorks if thats the case then we have to agree to disagree. How is that supposed to happen if the money is essentially a transfer? Currently the govt is giving  billion to people  lets say. What do they do with it? They spend it mostly. If instead the govt takes it away from them and gives it instead to people  heavily concentrated in the younger years what do they do with it? They spend it mostly. Theres almost no change in aggregate demand. You can argue that seniors have a higher savings rate... meaning that they save a larger portion of their income than younger people. But the fact is  of the people receiving Social Security benefits in the US are classified as lowtomiddle income implying that they are already spending most of their benefits. The aggregate demand increase gained by shifting savings to spending in this way would therefore seem to be quite small. The big change would be shifting aggregate demand from one age cohort to another overall increase or decrease in aggregate demand would be expected to be small. The other problem is this according to the show it costs  billion to create full employment right? But if you get that  billion by raising the retirement age to  and thereby taking the money away from people  then you create more unemployment. Therefore its impossible to create full employment by simply transferring payments from one age cohort to another. It simply isnt possible to do both using the same set of funds. To deliver what Frank is promising youd need to increase taxes by  billion to create new revenue.gtAlso growing the economy or maintaining it in a downturn is the hopeful result of good fiscal policy not the policy itself youve put the cart before the horse. It makes me feel like you dont know what fiscal policy is.  Fiscal policy is the use of taxation amp spending to influence the economy in various ways. Economic policy includes nonbudgetary regulations in addition to monetary amp fiscal policy e.g. minimum wage. Good fiscal policy is policy with a high fiscal multiplier that is a ratio of fiscal spending to economic activity that is greater than one. Taxing people in order to put those exact same people to work has a terrible multiplier and therefore it is terrible fiscal policy.  gtand this is done how? magic? you put forward a result and havent put forward any solution other than the status quo.  Lots of ways! For one raising the minimum legal wage which is broadly popular here. Raising the minimum wage is a great example of nonfiscal economic policy the federal government can create economic effects without resorting to spending at all simply by setting guidelines in various economic sectors. Gender pay equality. Lending and leverage guidelines. Regulation of sectors like energy agriculture finance communications etc. Smart stimulus spending for another. AmWorks proposes to spend federal tax revenues but what is the government buying? Jobs thats it. Doesnt matter what jobs doesnt matter what economic sector doesnt matter the impact on the economy. You create a job and Frank Underwood will pay you for it. That seems like a remarkably dumb use of tax revenue it is quite obviously prone to waste fraud and abuse and it isnt directly connected to economic activity in any way. If you want to spend revenue to reduce unemployment why not create meaningful jobs that have a positive fiscal multiplier and a positive effect on the economy? You know like the way New Deal programs did. For example highway repair and new construction dams and flood control expansion of internet amp communications services energy amp utilities improvements education to improve the labor pool. If the government invests directly into sectors that benefit all areas of the economy transportation communications energy scientific research education etc. then you would be reducing unemployment in a way that further reduces unemployment by generating new economic activity. AmWorks does nothing but slosh funds around with no thought put into where those funds are going or how they benefit the wider economy.,HouseOfCards,cpghigc,2,t5_2t3ft

He will probably be fighting the urge to take a drink for the rest of his life.He wasnt going after Rachel because he was addicted to her.

Shes the most unapologetically female character on tv or film the most efficient and rational one. She just cant turn emotional and irrational.

However I think the execution had some flaws Realistically Claires best chance at the Presidency is for Frank to be elected then she gets a position as Senator or something. By leaving Frank shes sabotaging herself. The show didnt really give enough reason to justify Claires accusation that Frank only cares about his own career. I mean ok in the end he physically abuses her during the Oval Office scene but I mean before that after all Claire had just verbally abused Frank so its understandable he would break. In fact its quite the opposite The show insisted over and over again on how much Frank loves Claire. Throughout the show it has always been Claire who has betrayed Frank not only the diplomatic fiasco in Russia but also stuff like the Watershed Act all the way in season .

Ive always thought that this wasnt showed enough in the firsts two seasons and it would made me mad because clearly the best scenes are those between them. They were and still are underusing the chemistry and the dramatic acting chops of two of the best actors around. Just look at the dramatic tension when those two make a scene specially the fighting scenes when he broke the bowl in the kitchen and Claire gave him the bitchiest look ever on S when they fought about the bill at Claires office in S when she demanded to be fucked rough an the at the Oval Office final scene.

Claires actions after Corrigans suicide make total sense to me. I didnt really see it as a brash outburst because of how unrealistically the relations with Russia are  portrayed. I know the show is fiction but what gets me is not Claires power struggle but Franks weird fucking politics. Being overly friendly with Russia and stripping social security and Medicaid would be a goddamn deathwish in the real world.

He uses Freddie as a political pawn which did grant a bit of a windfall to Freddie when his restaurant was bought but this also led to his unemployment. Freddie doesnt like to feel obligatorily grateful. He also knows how conniving Frank is and we have seen how once a character sees Frank as only surface they cannot unsee it.

6872010,0,t3_49vb8b,What do you think Frank would listen to? In which scenario would it improve the show? What would be the purpose of the scene?  We dont see him chilling in the oval office blasting Pink Floyd because it makes Frank appear human impressionable and emotional to the viewer.  Qualities that the Underwoods display very sparingly.  If they do its active self expression through great dialogue and acting.  He used to be in a fourpart male choir and is shown singing  occasionally throughout the show when it benefits the narrative. Most recently in church for obvious reasons.  As the show progresses we see Frank become increasingly calculating and cold with his eyes set on only one goal.  Even listening to the radio in a car would just be a distraction to both Frank and the viewer.Aside from interrupting the narrative music is inherently emotional and powerful and is used to evoke emotions in the viewer not the protagonists.  A good example for this would be the montage like songs during the whole DNC nomination process.    We only see Claire with earbuds but it is never revealed to which music she is listening to. Maybe its an audiobook.  I think this was intentional in order to humanize her a bit. Although she is cold and calculative we could never imagine her throwing somebody in front a train.    ,HouseOfCards,d0v95og,5,t5_2t3ft

I am not  crowding  so as you folks say  I have seen some shit. I have seen power games and govt shit...up close and personal.My theory He just set her up to invoke plausible deniability when the shit REALLY hits the fan he can say that the Sec of State heard about these things. She did but not in the way he will tell it. He is searching for a fall guy someone he can pin all the misdeeds on. Whether it works is another thing.Plausible deniability is the ability for persons typically senior officials in a formal or informal chain of command to deny knowledge of or responsibility for any damnable actions committed by others usually subordinates in an organizational hierarchy because of a lack of evidence that can confirm their participation even if they were personally involved in or at least willfully ignorant of the actions.Frank played her like a cheap violin.

6951954,0,t3_4ax3i5,Some couch psychology here but Dougs main three problems seem to be his control issues his anger management and his relationship to women. Part of why hes so fiercely loyal to Frank is that Frank saved him from himself but its also partly because his position as chief of staff lets him get away with displaying characteristics for all three of his problems.The control and anger are closer to symptoms so I feel like his core issues come from his relationship to women. As someone in another thread suggested he seems to have a simultaneous desire to dominate and be mothered by women he takes an interest in.As Freud would likely say it probably goes back to the relationship with the mother or father  perhaps his father was abusive towards his mother teaching him violent dominance while also giving him a desire to protect her. But thats going way deeper than the text has given us so far. Its definitely some kind of psychosexual issue though and he gets fixated on a certain type of woman of which dark brown hair is a part. And his relationship with Frank often resembles a fatherson relationship to boot.,HouseOfCards,d14c44w,11,t5_2t3ft

7187205,0,t1_d1v05jq,Thats a good way to put it I was struggling to succinctly explain their differences. Frank only cares about the information needed to benefit Frank to the point where he actually alienates potential allies with his inability to empathize with any goal that isnt rise to the top personal satisfaction with life isnt even on his radar as something worth considering. A good example is his he ruined and offended Freddy he couldnt even grasp what hed done. He doesnt care about anyones feelings he doesnt care why someone feels the way they do as long as they do what he wants. The author is such an anomoly to him I think thats why he was fascinated at first this is someone who operated so far outside his expectations he didnt know what to do with him it was new and exciting.  Plus since they have such wildly current priorities Thomas is no threat to him or his power hes safe in a sense.    After his shitty year of trying to do things on his own instead of having Claire as a partner and his death experience I think he realized he needs Claire but hes not willing to give her the emotional fulfillment she needs with Thomas she gets the emotional fulfillment Frank cant give without any worry that shell leave him because Thomas could never give her the power she craves.  The one thing Thomas cares about his secret about his first book is literally the only thing they have on him that they can use to manipulate him so thats Franks ace in the hole. Its win win Claire stays as his political power partner and he knows shes got all her needs taken care of so she wont leave again. ,HouseOfCards,d1v4gff,3,t5_2t3ft
