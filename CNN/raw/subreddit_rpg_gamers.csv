99239,0,t3_1v85mo,Id love to be able to back this but I dont think Ill be able to.  Even if I wasnt broke I want some solid evidence before I invest in something like this.I see a page of concept art and the promise that the game will be some kind of tactical game with no specifics anywhere.  If I hate the ingame art the story or the battle system Im out of luck.Matsuno will be involved which is a great sign but hes far from the only person developing this game.  We dont even know how much power hell have over the creation process.  The only thing we know for sure is that hes allowed them to use his name.Im not familiar with Playdek a cursory examination shows that they have a decent portfolio of games.  This is quite possibly one of the most important criteria for me in a kickstarter.  A lot of them appear to be card games but this doesnt mean that they cant make a good tactics game.  Unfortunately it doesnt mean they can either.Lastly I suspect anticipation would kill the game for me.  If I expected a game better than Tactics Ogre I could only be disappointed.  The mixture of wonderful gameplay and nostalgia can only be beaten by BG II.  Ill do my best to keep an eye out for the game later this year if it comes out but Im not going to allow myself to join in the hype train.Still I wish them luck.  Im just not willing to preorder off of that vague a promise.,rpg_gamers,cepq8oy,4,t5_2su0w

Not because its especially amazing although I am enjoying myself with it but because its the  lineup is just that subpar that a game that just does OK is the best of the list.Shadowrun Returns is probably a close second but I felt like the combat system really held it back from being something amazing.I definitely had more fun with nonRPG games last year like Phoenix Wright Dual Destinies and Assassins Creed . ,rpg_gamers,ceqoeeu,5,t5_2su0w

148310,0,t3_1vs71d,Dragon Dogma is probably right up your alley.  Its similar to the TES series in a lot of ways.  It does have some flaws.  Google some reviews for it.  I think most sites were pretty fair to the game.  Dark Souls is fantastic but only if you have patience and you enjoy overcoming a real challenge.  Its one of the few games in recent memory that actually presents a challenge.  You are going to die.  A lot.  Story is light.  Its mostly focused on building up your character battling tougher and tougher opponents and dabbling in a rather unique multiplayer experience.  I highly recommend Dark Souls but only if you can stand the fact that you will die you will lose moneyexperience you will have setbacks.  That seems to be a big nono for a lot of gamers these days so consider that before buying.  Best of luck.,rpg_gamers,cevbng6,8,t5_2su0w

The person who is Host should have access to hisher Router If you do not know the passwordusername look at the back of your router.. You need to forward the game specific ports to his computer for this you need his INTERN IP Windowskey  R gt cmd gt ipconfig it should look like this .... NOT the Gateway the Gateway is most likely your router. As far as i know the ports for NW are    If this is not enough try disabling you Windows firewall temporally ACTIVATE IT AFTER YOU FINISHED IMMEDIATELYor open the following ports also     This is not needed for every router but for mine i need to forward everything which should be standard because of security reasons.

You talk about the story and the universe but dont give any specific examples of what sets the KoA universe apart from any other generic fantasy RPG. You quote the R.I governor as saying that the first game didnt make a profit and then just move on and ignore that fact. You should have provided us with information that proved it was profitable what are the sales figures of KoA today? You also pull random numbers out of the air to prove that a sequel would be profitable but that doesnt mean anything since you dont provide any evidence as to why the game would sell as well as you claim.Overall this comes off as a very poor sales pitch of the KoA IP with little to no supporting research.,rpg_gamers,cfactf5,3,t5_2su0w

1615255,0,t3_2cscmg,Dragon Quest games have a bunch with fun class vocation gameplay.DQIII started it but it was pretty basic and only secondary characters can change classes.DQVI is where the fun starts. Tons of different classes with combo of basic classes needed to unlock the higher classes I think there are  tiers if Im remembering correctly. Different abilities and passives for mastering classes.DQVII more of the same from DQVI just improved. There are combined abilities in this game where if you unlock an ability from one class then unlock another ability in another class you learn a new ability. Monster classes too with  tiers of classes to unlock. Crazy long game.DQIX a bit more simple on the class department from DQVII but still a really fun game. There are  classes total some only available post or near post game. You level up each class individually in this one but there is also DQVIIIs skill system where as you level up you get skill points you can apply these points to either weapon skills or class skills. Each class has  weapon skills and their class skill. Class skills give a wide variety of abilities and passive stat increases that carry over from class to class. Weapon skills unlock weapon abilities and increased weapon attack and when mastered at  points allow you to equip the weapon regardless of your vocation.The end game of DQIX has a ton of replayabilty and if you really wanna twink out your classes there definitely exists challenging encounters to test them again. Basically you get treasure maps each treasure map unlocks a randomly generated dungeon with a boss at the end. Beating treasure maps unlocks new and more powerful treasure maps and powerful gear to upgrade through even harder bosses. Tons of fun if you like stuff like that.,rpg_gamers,cjirpst,2,t5_2su0w

Currently you kill monsters and get xp.  When you get x amount of xp you level up.  When you level up you gain stat bonuses. Your concept instead becomes when you kill monsters you have x chance to get x y orand z stat boosting items to drop.  Whats the drop rate?  What is going to prevent stat stacking?

2410768,0,t3_2myze2,FFX  This game is simply outstanding on so many levels. Square Enix can be hit or miss on games but FFX is one they definitely got right. The characters are memorable and help create a memorable story. The game has a lot of small things and extras that show good production value. The world is big and open and its beautiful to boot. Theres really not much wrong with it if anything. Its one of the few games that I think people can agree with giving it like a . and calling it a day.Persona   I wasnt so sure about this game before but it definitely grew on me. I suppose Im a bit of a sucker for small world stories. When youre not out saving the entire world from some imminent threat then you have a lot of time to develop characters. Shifting the story from story driven to character driven really works if the characters are good. And theyre not even that good but they somehow managed to get it all working. I guess from the sort of datingsim gameplay it has it just sort of works out. Even though it is just a dungeon crawler SMT is a franchise thats done it enough times that they do a good job. Their combat system is refined enough to allow it.Dragon Warrior Monsters  Outshined by Pokemon but had several things going for it. Pokemon had a sort of upper limit on how long you could play because there was only so much you could do. You beat the Elite Four catch all the Pokemon and get a team of  Pokemon to . Especially since there were things like level  Pokemon due to problem restricting the levels on generation and not checking at all levels if it was bound by  it was easy to just get a good team in no time. DWM sort of did away with all these upper bounds on the game they had them but much larger bounds. The levels on monsters were bounded pseudorandomly and then could increase as you made them stronger through breeding. Breeding in itself was a great idea because instead of just finding Mewtwo in a cave you had to combine a bunch of monsters to get him. Even then youd have to take Mewtwo and another strong monster combine them to get Mewtwo v which had a higher level cap and train him. It was possible to get to max stats with the ideal moves. Pokemon trainers wanted to grind but Pokemon didnt really offer it the same way DWM did. And it all felt so much more satisfying in DWM when you spent ages working your way up to it rather than in Pokemon where Pokemon were fairly easy to catch.,rpg_gamers,cm9ohkx,1,t5_2su0w

Ive played the game  different times and gotten  different endings with pretty varying results which was really cool. There are lots of different characters you can choose to ignore or ally yourself with.

Other than the random bonuses every battlefield is identical and movementattack ranges are large enough that there isnt actually that much in the way of tactics. weapon armor shoes two trinkets are the usual equips.  Each character gets their own type of weapon most of the other items are wearable by everyone You also equip up to  stat boosts that tie into the skill system.  The characters each have their own special attacks that they learn at certain levels but the rest of the magic is done through the stat boosting crystals which additionally provide a certain amount of an element.  They are chained together each character gets different ways of chaining them so that for example if a character has a chain of fire and wind elements they can cast an AOE fire spell.  Most characters need to unlock slots for equipping these crystals.  The very useful ingame guide explains what elements are required for spells and what stat boosts provide which elements.

There are tons of custom campaigns including a complete remake of Baldurs Gate   is currently being worked on.If you do end up trying NWN I recommend setting the camera to rotate with WASD and move with the mouse clicks.  A lot of people complained about cameramovement and this is the best way Ive found.Finally Id play NWN and expansions custom content then .

5651193,0,t3_3shl0x,FFX has to be one of my top  games Ive ever played period top  RPG. Without a doubt I absolutely loved the game. It was just such a good game because it did pretty much everything right The battle system is great. Not overly complicated not trying to do anything cute. Just a solid system with good fundamentals. Graphics were amazing and still hold up well today. FF has always been known for their great graphics but FF on the PS was just so beautiful and its the first time we got to a modernera of graphics for the series. The music is fantastic. Nobuo Uematsu is a legend and has done classics like Prelude and OneWinged Angel from FFVII. To Zanarkand is one of my favourite videogame pieces of all times. But its not simply that song alone even the battle theme is very enjoyable. The map is quite nice. A lot of places to go to and a lot of freedom. Newer games like FF really kind of hindered that sort of style and while you could say youve had freedom since the first Final Fantasy maps werent this good looking that youd care about the open quality. The story is very good. Its not overdone like a lot of games and this really went a long way for me. It gets better the whole time too and the ending is amazing. On that note the characters are also decent. Sometimes people will feel kind of bland but thats true of most games. Tidus is an enjoyable main character I found. The game has voice acting for a lot of it and it wasnt bad like it can sometimes be. The extras in this game are also really great. Blitzball is actually quite fun if you spend a few minutes to understand it. You can go around recruiting better players for instance.,rpg_gamers,cwxl2w8,7,t5_2su0w

What this has to do with this discussion is this Final Fantasy.Final Fantasy was essentially Dungeons and Dragons in Video Game format Obviously they had to change a lot of stuff name wise to avoid copyright but a lot of monster names has remained Rakshasa Beholder etc. So the Cleric of DnD that is typically your healer had to been changed because of the religious implications to White Mage that used White magic instead of Divine magic. This persisted through FF  and MAYBE  due to the PSX being an addon for Nintendo at the time. But the formula stuck and here we have white magic  Holy magic.Lightning magic from Chrono trigger specifically is considered Holy as ujello pointed out comes from the heavens which is why Chrono has Luminaire. ,rpg_gamers,d34pvlj,3,t5_2su0w

9093540,0,t3_54t4hg,Wild Arms was one of the first RPGs I was really ever able to sink my teeth into and it is one I look upon fondly to this day which is obvious to anyone who played it as my username comes directly from the game.  The opening amv has a theme that sets the tone immediately with the dual guitars and whistling before becoming more orchestral in nature which is fairly reflective of the game. Starts with a western theme and then moves into more standard tropes of the genre with demons and the fate of the world on the character shoulders. But the cliches and tropes are never bothersome at least to me and the characters with a few twists and moments really carry the game. It not a game that I would put on a list of best RPGs ever but it is definitely my favorite.,rpg_gamers,d84wbmk,5,t5_2su0w

9648919,0,t3_5d7hi0,Theyre both very different.DAI is highly character and plotdriven. If you want to foster deep relationships with a variety of characters uncover plot twists and watch the consequences of your decisions change the future of a massive continent pick DAI. Its a game that focuses on your party and what they do to the world based on how you encourage them to grow as characters and thats cool. That said people have different reactions to Dragon Ages writing and some people find it nearly unbearable. Its a matter of personal taste.Skyrim is a big beautiful sandbox. It has intrigue in little nooks and crannies and there are a lot of stories and environments to explore and secrets to uncover. Its much more playerdriven than narrativedriven if that makes sense. Theres not as much character writing and high quality voiceacting as DAI and not quite as much story branching but it feels more grounded cohesive and realistic than Dragon Age overall. Skyrim feels like an solo adventure to explore an alien world.Id also like to present Witcher  for your consideration. Great stories character and voiceacting. More solofocused than partyfocused like Skyrim but more narrativebased like DAI. Really great example of a modern WRPG.Basically OP you cant go wrong. Youre picking between two great games. If one of them just doesnt work for you try the other.,rpg_gamers,da2fgju,15,t5_2su0w

11457805,0,t3_63ju8o,Why not try RPG Maker.  I know youve probably already seen it but you can still do real development with it.  The only thing I can think of that is more hands on is HTML webgames for Kongregate or Unity game tutorials  HTML may be the best for future use although I cannot say for certain.,rpg_gamers,dfuqfxk,2,t5_2su0w
11521113,0,t3_64fp1o,When it comes to arpgs I much prefer a committed skill tree as opposed to being able to change it based on the situation. Diablo  plz It makes the decision matter more and I like that. Another thing to consider with aepgs is the size of enemies based on the speed of the gameplay. Diablo  was really fast and had a lot of really easy to click on enemies and Grim Dawn was a lot slower and had a lot more smaller enemies. So getting that wrong reduces the fun factor,rpg_gamers,dg1x4j7,2,t5_2su0w

11763413,0,t3_67u853,If you have a friend to play with Path of Exile is great. A friend of mine and I are on our rd run through on our characters right now since every new run through add so many new components. You can have some alt characters as well to grind for resources so you can actually play the game in your free time without being overleveled from your friend. Its a very complex top down RPG. Its very action and gear oriented. Its an incredible game especially when you consider that its free to play. Its one of those games that have microtransactions but if youre playing it casually you wont ever have to throw money at the game the get a full experience.  game.  with a friend. ,rpg_gamers,dgteujl,3,t5_2su0w
