5017975,0,t3_3jj86q,I like the race but here are some remarks The  melee damage from Vasa seems like too much because it always applies. Especially since it scales. Maybe if it was a weaker trait or one not usable often like the HalfOrcish Savage Attacks. Used underwater you instead create a  foot cube of ink... Instead of what? Also it should obscure area to Atta creatures as well its ink. Maybe there should be a clarification for the quality of ink in case someone decides to sell it. Acid Splash sounds like a terrible idea for someone who lives underwater. Atta feel like they have one too many traits and it doesnt say how long they can transform for. I assume a Water Crossbow is just a Crossbow thats usable underwater? Seems strong but hard to make or find.,voteboh5e,cuquusx,1,t5_39t7r
