9468408,0,t3_5afnjy,After some research Ive uncovered a yearold thread on the OrgMode message archive which explains the situation.  It seems that the behavior of the html export filter was deliberately changed at that time in such a way that. it is no longer possible to add attributes to individual links within a paragraph. all attempts to add attributes cause the creation of a new paragraph. the attributes are added to the paragraph tag itself. the attributes are then  nherited by all of the links within the new paragraph. all in contraction to the OrgMode manual which has not been updated. and this is reported as an improvementThis bug is a major regression which cannot be fixed by simply updating the manual as it produces illegal HTML!Right now Im simply flabbergasted and trying to figure out how to post a noninflammatory bug report!,emacsorg,d9g6q80,1,t5_3e1h9
