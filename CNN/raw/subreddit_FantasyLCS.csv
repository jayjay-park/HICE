1033052,0,t1_chlplg2,Well everyone has preferences but when giving advice on choices I dont say the ones I prefer I say the ones that are more likely to do more points. Mids and adc will on norm do more points then tops therefore a mid or an adc should be on the flex position. If Seraph plays very well and not always go for a tank pick then maybe he will do more points then Overpow or Vasilii but I doubt it since LMQ has a super easy week and Overpow farms like a beast and normally gets decent amount of kills.,FantasyLCS,chlpo9p,1,t5_31ago

1035438,0,t3_25yqum,I do see both Mr Rallez and WeWillFailer as good sleeper picks. When SHC wins they are carried by their botlane who can beat out nearly any other botlane in EU LCS. And even when they lose they win and lane and can get you some good points because of their aggresive playstyle ,FantasyLCS,chlzfvv,2,t5_31ago
1036037,0,t1_chm1ig7,Well I think MIL finished last in the split deserved imo no bash intended. Kevin is the one who has kinda solid or rather nottoobad stats most times so Id slightly choose him over Darien. Best thing is to go for another toplaner though.,FantasyLCS,chm1w54,1,t5_31ago
1036332,0,t1_chkxgo0,I think Fnatic will do better than youre expecting at least to start out the split. Fnatic is a streaky team because they get complacent when winning and work really hard when losing. I think Fnatic will likely still be top  in EU this split.Gambit however I am super worried for. They could right the ship and do well but Im leaning against that pretty heavily.,FantasyLCS,chm33qe,1,t5_31ago

1058419,0,t1_chkof67,Lets say in the draft I was able to pick up both Meteos and Shook but got Darien top lane. Now I can trade Shook for a good top laner with someone who got a bad jungler. People would accept this trade because Shook is a top tier jungler and since I would have a bad top laner in this situation I would accept a midtier top laner for him which is a good trade for both of us.,FantasyLCS,cholhon,2,t5_31ago
1058536,0,t1_chokel5,On a  prediction between  players you act as if its an amazing prediction. Plus its only the first week so its meaningless.

So no point having a discussion with someone that only sees what he wants to see. Enjoy.,FantasyLCS,cholyx2,1,t5_31ago
1058999,0,t1_chonpgp,Kerp shiptur and Selfie all could outscore Overpow in that order.  None of those tops are likely to outscore Ackerman over the season.  But Mill could be a flash in the pan.

1065356,0,t1_chpcz61,this is always tough in fantasy one of the cardinal rules is try to diversify so if one team does poorly it dosent butt fuck your fantasy week. That being said having  on a team means synergy kills for one usally gives you an assist on the other handcuffing as its know in the fantasy world meaning that you play all on one team so youre guarenteed to get those points.all that being said my advice would be to play Kevn over Wikid but thats really a push when looking at skill and points wise i just have faith in MIL this week,FantasyLCS,chpdwd3,2,t5_31ago

Especially with kevins excellent irelia renekton shyvana play he is bound to get points.

1135556,0,t3_274dku,Heres the thing though. You can predict SHC to go  Im a diehard fan of theirs and I wouldnt surprised to see this this upcoming week but Selfie Rallez and Failer should still put up good numbers. Even in losses the Crew still scores well in the way of fantasy points. Selfie is now the highest scoring player in the entire LCS . total points with Rallez at th .. And their team doesnt even have the best record in EU as theyre currently sitting in rd place. For now Id say start SHCs mid adc or support if you can. Theyre definitely top tier players right now and until they have consecutive weeks with horrible scores are going to be some of your safest bets.,FantasyLCS,chxcz4b,2,t5_31ago

1182002,0,t1_ci2l0ru,My comment wasnt necessarily directed only toward your spreadsheet. Its just my belief that algorithm wouldnt work in FLCS in general due to the random nature of the game Im not saying everything is random mind you. In other sports the difference between performance arent too big e.g. a good defensive team in basketball would consistently score between  points regardless whether they win or lose a good player scoring  points per game will still score around that even if they win or lose so theres a certain consistency that can be used as a base to form the algorithm to predict a players performance. On top of that there are also other factors to influence the outcome of a game such as playing at home crowd matters in those sports and easier schedule maybe your opponent is playing backtobacktoback game and youre their thirdlast opponent so they arent in optimal conditionBut in an LCS game its really a gamebygame basis. The gap between winning and losing can be either huge e.g. Kerps  and  score or small e.g. Tabzzs  points and  points in a loss and a win against SHC. Even the same result of winning and losing can result in a huge difference e.g. Xaxus dropping from  to  pts while Jankos increasing from  to  in the two losses of Roccat vs Fnatic. An algorithm needs to work accurately cant have too many faroff predictions it needs to be repeatable same algorithm should work every week and it needs to work for every player cannot just work for one player but not another to be considered as a success. Maybe Im not smart enough but I just dont see how its doable for FLCS.As weird as this may sound its actually why Im interested to see if theres anyone who can actually come up with a legit working algorithm to predict points. Thats also why Im interested in seeing the result of your NA predictions. If theyre good results I might feel even more motivated to outpredict that algorithm for Week . ,FantasyLCS,ci2lfaw,1,t5_31ago

Creaton is going against Roccat and FNC and combined they should cause about a  drop in production for ADC. Roccat may be bad but they keep people from scoring a lot of fantasy points.

1281867,0,t3_28r0t2,Well if FNC beats MIL which is the most likely scenario itll score at least  points. Rekkles is a strong contender even in losses its completely possible for him to score  points in a single game. Keep in mind that a long game even if MIL manages to grab a win will benefit him since it will provide FNC more opportunities to get objectives such as dragons and barons and Rekkles could get more kills and assists. Yellowstar would hardly surpass  points unless FNC decides to play a teamfight oriented team and place him with a aoe CC machine such as Leona or Alistar. So essentially your future is basically on the hands of two of the most inconsistent teams of the entire League of Legends competitive scene. Good luck!,FantasyLCS,cidts4h,1,t5_31ago

1309540,0,t3_292rjx,Top  Quas and Curse are expected to do well. Dyrus is worth a bench spot to save for when TSM gets their mojo back. Mimer is VERY underrated and overall worth a slot on your roster. Mimer and SHC have a new Support and that should be considered too. I think its a toss up between Mimer and Quas. Both are RNG and expected to do well..with Paperwork leaning more on Quas.Jungle  LMQ is having some issues. I dont know enough about noname to say yesno confidently. Amazing is worth a Bench spot hands down. While Diamond could have a good week he isnt worth considering. Honestly Noname amp Amazing are equal in my mind. I would lean more on Amazing Trying to make plays and lead TSM to victory amp create some major upsets in the LCS this week.Mid  Keep Froggen. Pobelter is good and EG may do great this week or get stomped out. I see Bjerg having issues so thats in your favor. I am starting Cowtard but Froggen is the easy YES choice here.ADC  Mr Rallez has a new support. SHC has RNG weeks. Very inconsistent. Genja again isnt worth considering as a stable choice. Creaton has the ability to put up points. Your choice between Rallez and Creaton.Support  Gleeb is Gleeb. Guy is GOLDEN when TSM does well. If TSM wins he dominates in points.

1333112,0,t3_29cd4k,definitely not crumbz.  Even though dig wins he does put up big numbers.  Dexter and sven are a coin toss imo.  Id start dexter just because he tends to get a few more kills.,FantasyLCS,cijlayq,2,t5_31ago

1340560,0,t3_29e3rj,Kerp is probably always worth a start but its a toss up between Shiphtur and Peke.Tabzz is a must start imo. So I guess the question for me would be Shiphtur Peke or Altec?Id definitely start Cyanide over Meteos just benched Meteos myself.Ive started TSM over Dig myself based on strength of schedule since TSM is typically consistent against bottom teams. Although its likely Id start Fmatic instead if they were available in my league.Good questions having the same dilemma myself between Kevn or Mimer.,FantasyLCS,cikffp9,1,t5_31ago
1345517,0,t1_cikzcs7,My pleasure! I love numbers.Dignitas as a team have put up strong results but theyre similar to C in that they have been producing lowkill games. Id definitely run their team its  among teams for expected points this week but as for players Id steer clear if you have options.

1413443,0,t1_citaimo, probably either Cop or Creaton. Im leaning towards Cop as if CRS is on form this week they should all score quality points but Creaton is probably a slightly safer pick.  Dig Even when winning C score lower points than other teams. Cyanide by a small margin simply because Fnatic did better than MIL last week so if it turns out to be a trend Cyanide will perform better. If its not a trend either one can easily score a ton of points. ,FantasyLCS,citgcz4,1,t5_31ago

1491364,0,t3_2b9uug,this week i managed to win all my  leagues matchups so maybe i can try and help you for the following week  Its gonna be abit long so sorry for the wall of text here is my  cents.First of your matchupFrom what you said he got all LMQ so topjunglemidsupport  Tabzz and TSM as a team  LMQ facing this week C and CoL  so at least one of their games should net them big amount of points CoL most likely  same thing with Tabzz he got Fnatic which is first place vs second place so the game should be either very close so it will net both teams points or very one sided as it happens with alliance when they steamroll or lose with very few kills ill consider Tabzz on the avg of  points for Fnatic game since even on bad games he did well and lastly TSM as a team is not the stongest of them all  their avg per game is around  and on bad games it can also go down to .So that puts your matchup with very risky week since if LMQ loss hard to C you will steamroll him so you cant pick anything from C since it will just add to his side if C lose to LMQ.Now to your side  i can tell you for sure not to pick  Mil players in your roster since they got Fnatic who will try their hardest not to lose anything this week to catch alliance sadly im stuck in my main league with Creaton and Kerp who are not bad players but there are not other options for me.The problem that i see with your roster is Rekkels  your matchup got tabzz so he will gain points if your alliance players win but you got Rekkles who is facing alliance so for one game you gonna lose points no matter how you look on it only good thing is very long game between Fnatic and alliance which net big points for both. but there are no other good options  Mil players in the same roster is a recipe for losing the week if they do poorly.I would go with the followingTop  Zionspartan or Kevin i really want to say Zion but Kevin is doing better than him per weekJungle you might want to check Crumbz as well.Flex i think you should take Shiptur instead of SelfieSorry for the long post was just thinking out loud for this week for myself as well  ,FantasyLCS,cj37tzw,1,t5_31ago

If a team was capable of finishing a game well before the average time then they should be rewarded for their domination in the game. Yes I did intend for only the winners to receive points and I guess that could be an issue. Although I dont think that will affect the game any different then how picking a crap player on a great team still gets you loads of points now. I think that will have a minimal difference than it does now except for it will now work on teams with very short games.,FantasyLCS,crwcikd,1,t5_31ago

6258925,0,t1_cz117a3,The only reason why Alex Ich is tempting is because they have an extraordinarily easy week . However even though he will get max points next week alone dropping stars Pobelter or Febiven would basically be a sacrifice for the rest of the season. Pobelter may end up the highest ppg Mid in NA and despite a worse FNC Febiven will get high scores in Eu. Alex Ich will be destroyed when Ren faces better teams,FantasyLCS,cz12kks,2,t5_31ago
6267595,0,t3_41g1yz,Id look at picking up Turtle since Immortals has one of the strongest rosters in NA this Split. You can wait until after their game later today if you just want to be sure. Freeze is a great player too but I doubt hell reach Turtles points consistently since Immortals looks like theyll be winning a lot more games than Renegades. Zven is still really good but Origen looked super out of form in the first week you might want to wait until their games next week before you consider him.,FantasyLCS,cz220ub,1,t5_31ago

6330570,0,t3_42a6jo,Personally I think they just need a better system as far as the bench and picking up free agents.  In all other fantasy sports you can get fucked by late announcements of injuries and such but only being able to hold  players total on the bench and only two of each position is very limiting when these things happen I have both freeze and altec and so as far as adcs Im pretty fucked LOL. I think if a player is not playing you should be able to hold them on your bench at least for one week without using one of the  spots or  player limit for the position.,FantasyLCS,cz97sne,2,t5_31ago

8074629,0,t3_4pt9hr,Top Gamsu and disappointing Darshan Jungler Reignover Mid Keane And Ryu AD Carry Sneaky and sad Piglet Support Matt and Vander Team Immortals Formatted better for others.Try looking for another ADC Piglet isnt that great anymore in a first two format youll never know if hell get the first two games or sub out with Fabby. Consider another Mid as well if youre not happy with your two mids. Ryu isnt scoring that well. Keane is doing alright but it seems this weekm theyre going to take a hit.Always run Sneaky and flex another ADC  Mid or two Mids.Vander is alright not sure if there any better scoring supports left in your league go take a look at the pool. Otherwise very decent roster if its an man.,FantasyLCS,d4nnx9w,1,t5_31ago

10359602,0,t3_5o9ooa,Great tier list am definitely going to be using it! Thank youI have a question though it might not have a lot to do with your guide in particular. So if you pick the first two format does that just mean that most EU players would only get points for one match? Or in other words only get half the points of NA players. And if you pick the best game format it would still favor NA players wouldnt it as they would have a higher chance of getting more points as they would have two tries as opposed two EUs just one in most cases?Ive been pretty lost about it and Im just trying to figure all of this out before my draft as it makes a pretty big difference obviously.,FantasyLCS,dcibl7v,2,t5_31ago

10459529,0,t3_5pt9c1,I say Lourlo.Looper is good but has a harder week this week than last week and he didnt do very well last week. I would go with Lourlo who is looking like he will be a big focus for Liquid. It is a toss up for Flame and Lourlo. Immortals play C but also NV who give a lot of points. Liquid faces TSM who looks...okay and P who look less than Okay. So they should get some nice points overall.  If you think Immortals will go toe to toe with C I say choose Flame if you think C will beat down Immortals Choose Lourlo. I am going on a limb and saying Akaadian.I know I said Lourlo over Looper but Akaadian was doing amazing work in his games and getting points left right in centre. Reignover on the other hand didnt look as amazing without that Huni synergy. I will say it does feel odd to choose echo fox over anyone lol. Contractz over Akaadian.This is a long run thing for me. Contactz showed some skill and I think C will be more dominant over all. Also Akaadian is a beast but he is against two new teams this week flyquest and Dignatas who look like they can really make good teams stumble. However I will say echo fox looks to do well early game and fall apart late gamewhich is great for points. It is only one week in so who knows! Good luck and may the PentaKill find your active player.,FantasyLCS,dctoyvv,1,t5_31ago
