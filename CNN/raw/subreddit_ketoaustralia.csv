3653247,0,t3_326sw8,Heres a recipe with swearing. Separate  yolks. Use the whites for an omelette or fucking something. Drop those little bastards in a measuring jug or something with high sides. Grab an electric whisk cos a manual will be a shit for your arm. Whisk those fuckers until they get pale as. Now choose an oil. I use light olive oil but you fucking choose. Start drizzling that bastard in nice and slow... mls at a time. Whisk until it forms an emulsion and the mix starts to thicken. And keep going like that until you get to the consistency or volume you want. Just as its coming together add a squeeze of lemon and some fucking salt and pepper to taste.,ketoaustralia,cq8p2y5,3,t5_2w0ji

Try bulletproof coffee get some nice cold cuts make parmesan chips if you want crunchy snacks. Get into pork rinds almonds schinken speck is awesome. The thing about keto is that if you do it right most calories from fat you wont be hungry or hangry. Unfortunately cravings for pizza wont go away.,ketoaustralia,dggjyoy,6,t5_2w0ji
