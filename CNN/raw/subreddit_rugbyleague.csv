1620018,0,t3_2cvcgl,I would really appreciate any help you can give by voting for my old uni team to get votes. For the last few years we were the only womens university team. To make matters that bit more difficult there are only a handful of womens teams. We want to bring more interest to the sport in women and with this extra funding well be able to do that. Theres more on the pageEdit it turns out the the university is cutting our funding for the second season running despite our efforts playing in friendlies participating in trials and encouraging more universities to take up womens Rugby league. We could only just afford our coach last season and had to cut the number of training sessions. We also payed for transport out of our own pockets. ,rugbyleague,cjjdaob,2,t5_2rrs2

10819329,0,t3_5upml4,The idea is to get a bunch of players out of the way and run a set play with more room on the field. It was originally all the big players locked up in the scrum but that has been relaxed now you can put in a couple of passes and run a big player at opposing small players. ,rugbyleague,ddvxrdx,6,t5_2rrs2
