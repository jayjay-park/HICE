194698,0,t1_cf055ai,This is the way I think about it. Playing The Last of Us Bioshock Infinite is in same boat and not comparing it to itself in a very alpha and prettied up version of the game I am absolutely blown away. What Naughty Dog did was create a seemingly alive believable world with a story and scope that Ive never seen before in a game. And the design of the levels Game play and ascetic wise and crafting mechanics made the combat with completely average AI feel like the most tense and thrilling game Ive ever experienced. The key word in this video isnt bad AI but disappointing AI. Looking at what a game could have been instead of what it is in my opinion is the wrong way to look at gamesmoviesanything. Also that AI in the trailer is so complicated it probably was WAY too much for the PS to handle with everything else in the game. Im still amazed at  loading screen per game session. So please keep your high regard to the game.,thelastofus,cf0m875,5,t5_2t7gp

In my opinion when Tommy was talking to Maria  months later after the babys birth and he said ..your late uncle Joel.. I had thought and hoped that Joel had indeed passed shortly after Ellies death either from suicide or just extreme grief. That way he can fulfill his wishes and join his two daughters in the afterlife. His two baby girls. I mean another baby? I dont think she will have as much of an impact on Joel than Ellie.

Left Behind made me feel..hopeful. But there is always that sad feeling at the end of a great game or book or movie where you just sit back and think Wow I want there to be more. I want to be there again. Left Behind gave me that feeling again but that is the sign of a truly great story being told.There are quite a few lighthearted moments I was laughing for a long time while I played it.

I mean life wont be peachy in Jackson there will still be challenges. Than theres the relationship between Joel amp Ellie how is it going to be like after the Firefly lie?Taking this into consideration my mind drifts back to a moment in Making Of where Neil says TLOU started from trying to explore a deep friendship type relationship between a parent figure and younger person. So if they will make a sequel it would be based on a core idea that has just as much impact. Maybe well have Ellie and her daughter focusing on playing the daughter leave control of Ellie to ND again cause it worked wonders have her teach us talk about Joel who died when we were very a baby and so on.,thelastofus,cgmjgrb,3,t5_2t7gp

He was upholding his duty to Ellie which he accepted the moment he accepted the role of father figure to her the same duty that Marlene was given by Ellies mother and then threw away for a chance at saving her shitty organization. Marlene wasnt trying to save the human race she was trying to save the Fireflies.

By reading quite a few notes left behind throughout the sewers you can deduce that Ish made a home in the sewers and eventually invited more people to join. They made their own society down there with families and children. But one day someone left a door open and the infected got in. The place went to hell as the sewer people were overrun. One of the adults was cornered in a room with children. There was no way out so he killed the children quickly and covered them with a sheet so they wouldnt know the pain of being killed by infected.

1396283,0,t1_cir813k,Oh yeah she shows what the bite looks like and it looks super grody and its totally bad news bears for her I mean thats part of why she has her last stand she knows she doesnt have long left. She did however get bitten in the neck so its possible that sped the process up Sam got bitten in the leg and David in the arm I think right? which could potentially make the infection take longer to spread. Sam makes it a few hours at least. I dont think they give any clear indications to how much time has passed but it was dark when they get to the radio tower so I feel a few hours isnt an unreasonable estimate. And while Tess doesnt fight after the museum and the hallway is totally when she got bit I agree on that shes still walking about and acting fairly normal meaning even if you get bit in the neck you dont necessarily fall over or are unable to fight immediately she does kill a couple soldiers however its possible she got the drop on them in fact considering that the infected arent exactly weak you might even get better at fighting at least the physical parts of fighting which if hes infected and going through the early stages of the infection could explain how David can take three knife stabs and still move around or he could just be crazyfull of adrenaline.I was just saying that theres no evidence at all that she can even spread the infection not to mention her immunity to make the conclusions you did. It could not easily mean that she has a weaker strand of the infection or that she can spread her immunity. Its within the realm of possibilities but only if its the infection and not something in her bodygenes thats different from the normal infection. If cordyceps samples taken from her blood grow normally it could suggest that it isnt the infection thats different but that its something in her body that makes her immune of course this could still be spread to other people if whatever it is was present in her saliva but since the doctors want to poke around in her brain one can assume that transferring the immunity is not something as simple as through blood or saliva.I still stand in the possibly but unlikely camp. It wouldve been interesting to see what would happen to someone who got bit by Ellie make it for long enough to get an answer to this question Im mildly surprised the Firefly doctors didnt do this experiment.,thelastofus,cirazli,1,t5_2t7gp

I know my opinion is a minority opinion but Im a film maker so I understand the artistic merits of frame rate and how they affect the experience. Whether other people experience the same things as me or even care about the art is irrelevant. All opinions about art are equally valid and there are plenty of people that agree with me about frame rate. Still a minority of gamers especially due to the recent influx of pcmasterrace idiots to console gaming forums recently.gtI cant fucking read this man motion blur in movies and games are different.No they arent. A camera running at fps will capture in each image everything thats moved in the last ms. Most modern games replicate this effect almost exactly. They do it using a post process effect called vector blur where they determine the motion vectors of the camera and all objects on screen and then estimate the blur caused by those objects. Its an estimation but when things are in motion it feels almost identical to real motion blur. gtWtf is this made up shit???Try playing the game again. Measure the amount of time between when you press a button and when Joel performs the action. Its probably on average about  second or slightly shorter. That makes fps a difference of  of responsiveness. Clearly not a significant change.gtMan I really wish you are stuck with fps and your fps cinematic feel games for life. I played Arkham origins on PC recently and while my PC could easily achieve above fps I manually capped it at fps because I preferred the experience.

In the tiny shack the zombies make a bee line for you often times bypassing David completely and you really cant let too many of them inside at once. Its really about knowing when to use the bow and when to knife. Save the rifle bullets for the last stand. Also dont help David push the shelf it doesnt go any faster and you both lose time from the clicker grabbing you. Instead go to the window next to the shelf the one david isnt blocking with the shelf and shoot the clicker thats coming out of the barn before he gets to you then you dont have to worry about him and can easily knife the rest.,thelastofus,cjiruv2,1,t5_2t7gp

Wait for the group of scavengers to stop talking and split up. Take out the guy on the left walking towards the bank. Then sneak up to the bank through the window and take out the guy in there. Sneak all the way back around to the rightmost area of the map and take out the guy in the cafe. Go upstairs and carefully kill the lookout. Go back downstairs and through the back of the cafe to the deli kitchen and take out the guy near the meat freezer. Take out the guy in front of the deli and then the guy in the middle of the plaza. Hurry back to the cafe up the stairs and into the corner office room with the  windows.

2829851,0,t1_cnpgseq,If an underage harmful sexual encounter occurs it comes down to one thing did both parties consent? Yes? No problem. Thats how it works. Laws are silly things but the most developed countries in a social and ethical sense have it figured out to the point where it cannot be steadily improved upon anymore. Countries dont guess when it comes to such laws the US is much stricter on such matters than Sweden is yet the latter has proven to have a far better knowledge of their population and thus acted upon it.If Ellie was of an older age above the age of  the story wouldnt have worked. It would no longer be The Last of Us. Joels arc wouldnt make sense. Youre proposing a worthless and pointless hypothetical situation. Ellie wouldnt have been Ellie Ellie would have been an adult which is something completely different. Refined ways to overcome such a thing? Gee I dont know. Ask a psychologist I dont take enough psych classes to comment on remedies. There are younger gamers out there who had a huge crush on Ellie no doubt. Thatll pass like any other thing. If a much older person experiences the same thing it does kind of raise questions about his or hers sanity. Especially if they fantasize about her a fictional character nonetheless in a sexual sense. And before you ask no its not insane to think of Ellie as attractive even if youre much older because she is. not in a sexual way per s Its not pedophilia it even makes sense in evolutionary senses but it is inherently wrong because acting upon such a desire when youre older is never good for the younger party involved.

Give her a chance to say goodbye a last meal or even a choice in the matter. Its not like they would just let her go even if she did say NO. The Fireflies are totally full of shit and Im glad Joel killed them all. I too believe that Joels reasoning goes much deeper than just gaining a new daughter. He sees what we all saw she fought like hell to get here. She expected to save the world and get to live in it afterwards not to be murdered in her sleep. People are too quick say Ellie would have chosen to martyr herself. Shes been across the country and a majority of the people shes met are horrible. She doesnt really believe in an afterlife.

4928248,0,t1_cuepv07,Im sure we can all agree that TLoU is a strongly characterdriven game. A big perhaps the biggest part of what makes a characterdriven narrative work is the character development.  This works much better with new characters than it does with revisited characters who if they are protagonists from a narrative with any merit have already gone through the most important growthdevelopment phase of their lives.  This is why sequels with the same characters almost never pop as well as the first run.  There is either less character development and it falls flat or the writers have to escalate the circumstances befalling the characters and the situation creeps in to the realm of the unbelievableridiculous.,thelastofus,cufqts0,0,t5_2t7gp

5499738,0,t3_3qcppv,This is something Ive thought about too. In The Walking Dead game you have a gtSPOILERlt choice to cut off Lees arm or let him keep it. Either way he gets infected. Here you can see that the soldier died of blood loss his skeleton isnt warped and he died sitting down not being grown into a wall or anything. As Joel says at one point The dead dont get infected we know that Cordyceps cant infect dead tissues. However they probably can thrive on them once they kill the tissues themselves such as when clickers grow into walls. So lets say a runner does bite your finger. If you immediately kill it with a cleaver and still have the cleaver should you cut your own hand off?Well probably not. Tess got that bad in an hour Sam turned within a day and everyone else turns within two days. And people arent simple singlecelled organisms. This fungus has to overtake the humans entire nervous system and start growing around woundsopenings within two days. Thats one fast motherfucker. Considering red blood cells circumnavigate the entire human body in  seconds youd have less than a second to stop the fungus from getting transported within your bloodstream. I doubt youll even finish your conscious thought about cutting your hand off let alone make the decision to do it under a second. Yes some particles could be killed by the immune system before they infect anything but it depends on the bite and everything. So in conclusion TLDR I guess cutting your hand off could buy you a little bit of time but it wouldnt eliminate the risk of you getting infected. Also youd have to survive afterwards without a hand and we didnt see many of those guys in the game.EDIT However if you somehow know youre not immune sure go for it its not like youll be worse off. If anything you could die of blood loss instead of being a braindead predator. And if you do turn the person that finds your clicker self would have to fight a one armed clicker so its a plus to survivors. ,thelastofus,cwen69l,2,t5_2t7gp

I also platinumed the game and have every single trophy including the absolutely rediculous DLC multiplayer trophies that were insanely difficult to get.

I dont think there are many situations where a woman knows almost  hours after giving birth that shes not going to make it and can write a note about it.  Either something goes horribly wrong and she passes quicklyduring the process or she survives.  Theres more to the story of Annas death.  I think either she was infected and just wanted to live long enough to give birth or similar to Ellie s she was immune and decided with the Fireflies that she needed to be experimented on or they found evidence of the fungal infection during Ellies birth and they all ASSUMED that she was doomed and allowed her to wander off to die alone...but she didnt...,thelastofus,day2bpa,1,t5_2t7gp

Ellie does think that shes dead though no doubt about that. I cant see her agreeing to leave Boston if that werent the case. I do think that well see that relationship come into play in some way in part two. Not necessarily through Riley still being alive but it could influence Ellie with her finding someone new and having difficulties getting close because of what happened to Riley or as others have theorized hallucinations of previous characters.

Other than watching over her from afar it seems Marlene was too busy to spend much time with Ellie. Ellie would be sad about Marlenes death but absolutely not upset enough to avenge her. She definitely knows Joel lied but I dont think she suspects that he slaughtered all the Fireflies. The moment the truth is revealed is going to be really really sad and devastating for her. The betrayal from both Marlene amp Joel the fact that she is the key to the vaccine but has to die for it Joel screwing up what might have been the only chance to get it etc. All of that is a lot to deal with.

When Ellie holedup in the mall while Joel was out in Left Behind it was kinda obvious that the first snow was meant to be serious this may have been a window of about less than a weeks? time. Once Ellie had settled Joel in the garage of the rural neighborhood in the Winter chapter the time frame may still be in that same period maybe a day or two more maybe a month.Weatherwise considering this is Colorado were talking about Mother Nature can be a fickle bitch so it seems like the story is right on track.

10725679,0,t3_5t6k0h,My guestimations...Tommys Dam happens around earlymid Fall since most of the vegetation still is pretty green and considering how north Wyoming is its probably around September.The two travel to the University of Colorado by Horseback which takes a while.  By the time they get there despite being a few clicks more south Colorado is also a little higher elevation.  Which with the way the leaves are on the trees still or are turning colors its probably mid Fall by that point.  The elevation of the region should be noted as mountain snow storms are a thing even if the trees still have leaves its not entirely uncommon for there to be a snow storm large enough to have accumulation.Left Behind takes place almost immediately after that it fills the gap between Joel falling off the horse and the snow starting to fall and Ellie going hunting in the snow.  Immediate in this case is pretty much within days of Joel getting impaled.  Its also not uncommon for really large snow storms to leave accumulation for a few days which pretty much means that even though it might only be the middle or end of November its still close enough to winter that the snow sticks around a while.  Ellie at some point finds the materials to suture Joels wound which is a detail you shouldnt forget.Ellie going Hunting the official start of winter in the game isnt too long after Left Behind.  We catch a glimpse of Joels wound now sutured after shes done hunting but before she goes to confront Davids group.  If I had to place a month this would be earlymiddle December.  Winter enough to allow the snow to stick around or allow further accumulation and definitely enough to convince the trees to lose their leaves.,thelastofus,ddm9veb,2,t5_2t7gp

In the book this guy named Ish finds himself as one of the few remaining survivors in a postapocalyptic world where little to no people are found. He becomes depressed and wanders around aimlessly through America before building a society in the Bay Area. The society grows tremendously over  years and new views and expectations are established since so much of the previous worlds culture died with it. Ish has a son Joey who he views to be a lot like himself an intelligent observer that will carry the building society further once Ish eventually passes away. Its an incredibly dark book that shares a lot of themes with The Last of Us including the themes of parenthood nature taking over and humanity.

11043894,0,t3_5xm7eg,Logan not just this movie but Logan as a character and Joel are very similar characters. Mix that with Hugh Jackman looking perfect for the part and it quickly feels similar.Parent child dynamic is not new. It is a very effective method of storytelling which also perfectly completes two characters growtharc. There was plenty different for Logan as a story to stand alone. It is similar to TLoU which means you will all love Logan and appreciate the similarities without being angry and feeling it just ripped off TLoU. Dafne Keen who plays Laura is fantastic. I would love to see Hugh as Joel and Dafne as Ellie. It would call a lot of attention to Logan though but I still would love to see it happen. Dafne will be the right age in a couple years. She would just have to overcome her Spanish accent.Definitely see this movie. It deserves the critical success it has already gotten as well as financial success.

11183928,0,t3_5znxxi,I just finished Grounded modeGrounded mode  nights ago so the details are still fresh. Here are my thoughtsgt When you get caught in Bills trap and have to shoot the infected while suspended from a ropeI had a hard time at first because I thought that the ammo was limited so I tried to go for headshot. When I found out that I had infinite ammo I just spammed the trigger button.gt Also had trouble beating the first bloater at the high school.I tried to let Bill kill it at first so I just ran around for  minutes until I finally died from the spore bombs. I didnt want to waste more time so I just threw a molly at it and one shotgun blast to the chest finally killed him. Unfortunately I was killed by the runners after the bloater.gt Getting to the high school past all those infected.Didnt have a hard time on this one. Just ran around the parking lot to isolate them one by one then punched them out.gt Getting past the infected in the high school!This part I had a hard time. Lots of trial and error. I had to get the sequence right of stealth killing the first runner then bricking the clicker then running around until we got them all.gt Beating the infected with David helping you... ...beating the infected the next time you do that with David!I got soo frustrated with the first part that I cheated on the second part. I think I diedrestarted  times. The second part I just let David do the killing for me and mollied the bloater.The first part of Pittsburg was difficult as well right after you crashed the car. No room to run around in and the enemies had guns. I couldnt get the timings and pattern right.Another part that I needed more time to figure out was one with the spotlight. Right after turning off the generator I tried to hide under the platform and kill them one by one but I always get spotted. So I just ran back to the stairs to reset them.Financial plaza was pretty easy. I went to the room in the second floor and waited for them to come in one by one.In Bookstore I just ran right past everyone. Didnt collect a thing.In the Sewers with Sam I just killed the first  runners and ran straight for the exitladder when another runner spotted me.Hotel basement was pretty frustrating as well since the bloater always spawned near the exit. I watched some youtube and videos and they said to go inside laundry room first which I did.I just stealthed the underground tunnel with the bloatersclickersrunners.In the hospital I had  mollies  bombs and  to  bullets per gun so I just went on a killing spree.Unfortunately the game glitched on the trophies on Ellies jokes and optional conversations. It didnt pop even if swear that I got them all. Those are the last  trophies for platinum. Perhaps Ill try another run on easy mode next time to complete them.Edit The fight in the dam was pretty hard as well since the checkpoint was too far. I discovered a technique on this part. After clearing  enemies on the ground level just ran past the enemies inside the control room and run to the end of the level to the door. Plant a bomb then run back. It will kill at least  bandits leaving only  which can be easily defeated.,thelastofus,dezoom2,3,t5_2t7gp

11237377,0,t3_60cf1p,I hope neither of them are deaddie and that it ends on a happy note or at least hopeful and not dreary and depressing. Honestly I spent the entire first game certain that one of them wasnt going to make it. The music the tone of the game the conversations etc. All of it was making me thing that this is not going to have a happy ending for everyone. And while the first one didnt exactly have a happy ending it was a lot more positive than I thought it would be. The both survived made it back to Jackson and seemed to be really getting along. All of Joels talk about what he wanted to do after their trip was over was really touching especially after how much of the game he just thought of her as nothing more than a job. So for Part II I know there are going to be some tearjerking and depressing moments. I full expect them to either start out angry at each other or get that way after Joels lie is exposed in the game. But I hope by the end everything is patched up or at least moving in that direction. Im sure its not going to end with some touching scene of an older Joel sitting on the porch in Jackson strumming his guitar while a joyful Ellie introduces her new girlfriend to her father though one can hope but I really hope it ends in a way that we can at least imagine a happy ending like that after the credits roll. Frankly I just care too much about either of them to be ok with it ending with either of them dying or hating each other. I know it might be one of those Stranger Than Fiction things where the perfect ending and the happy ending cant coexist but fuck it. Give me the happy ending. ,thelastofus,df5qoid,4,t5_2t7gp

I also had no idea it was essentially a zombiehorrorsurvivor game when the zombie genre is my guilty pleasure Dawn of the Dead  remake FTW!. The intro was similar to DOTD so that really drew me in. I played on normal much too easy in retrospect since items are plentiful and you shoot em up vs stealth and was enjoying myself until I got to the hotel basement. Im not sure if I stopped playing because I was stuck or if it was too scary both but when I picked it back up a while later I forgot how awesome it was and was instantly scared.

I dont think Fedra would even give a shit about them trying to find a cure if they were doing peacefully and not actively trying to overthrow them for no reason at all.

11296045,0,t1_dfaptqb,Uncharted  is the only one I havent played yet...but I dont have a PS. From memory the stealth mechanic is introduced in U for the first time in that section where you have to kill a guy in rotunda maybe or perhaps he was against a rail or something. Found it so finnicky really annoying. The AI in TLOU isnt terrible Crysis  was abysmal on that front! but God on Grounded would you want really good AI? It has something akin to Metal Gear Solids Alert phase which makes things trickier when youre trying to sneak through unhurt.Cover...oh God...reminds me of the cover system in Uncharted...I never came to grips with that...to my pain...its why I played the game on Easy! Mind you I played U on Normal but that seemed like Easy on Uncharted! Might have to revisit Uncharted and try coming to grips with the gun play and cover system.Really hate how Sam especially totally fncks things up for you when youre trying to stealth kill the stalkers...lots of restarts...he just shoves you out from your cover spot meaning youre not in position to stealth kill the stalkers and...you die. Fnckng hell!Ellie does become more useful after she kills that guy for you in the hotel section I think it is...she can actually kill enemies for you after that moment.Its odd that your axes and upgraded axes have a limited lifespan too.,thelastofus,dfce20e,1,t5_2t7gp
11296084,0,t1_dfaafw2,Personally I find these parallel worldtime travel stories incoherent so Id say that where you find that the game makes sense after a few plays Id guess that it seems to make sense after a few plays Im trying to make a distinction here between making sense of the narrative versus making sense of the concept of parallel worlds as found in this game...not sure how successfully Ive done that though!. Kind of how like I dont buy into the premise of the film  Monkeys...Im thinking that if you could go back in time you could change the future. Ill just say that I dont believe that time travel is possible so the idea of it doesnt make sense. If parallel worlds dont actually exist then that would explain why I find the idea of it in Bioshock Infinite incoherent. I did play Burial at sea. From memory I was moved by the ending of the main game...not sure about BaS though...what I remember thinking is This isnt MY Elizabeth!...so I suppose that I would have been sad at some level that she died in that story.Ive never shed tears in a game but I did get misty eyed and perhaps got a lump in my throat in that part of Metal Gear Solid  where you have to fight Boss. Id say that the ending of Bioshock Infinite haunted memade me melancholy.You have other games that you rate as highly as TLOUBI?I reckon Valkyria Chronicles is a pretty good game...its a turn based RPG...oh...that reminds me...that game had a moment which made me sad and sad that I had absolutely no ability to change the outcome.

11553501,0,t1_dg479rh,gt I did this to try and see if she actually reaches for the robot. She doesnt. When I discovered this bit of the game I quite liked it. From memory I think you can see Ellie staring at the robot from a standing position and maybe she starts going to down to pick it up until you look at her.I had Joel and Ellie doing this weird dance where Joel momentarily looks away and Ellie realises shes being watched so she doesnt pick up the robot.Whatever the time limit is I got to see Ellie getting up from squatting down to pick up the robot and noticing that the robot is no longer there. Presumably you dont get to see that if you take too long to glance back where Ellie and the robot were...i.e. Ellie will have moved towards the next section of the game and theres nothing to see on the ground anymore.Be interested to know if there are more cute sections of the game like this which dont notice unless you know what to look for. I am curious about a lot of the posters and books in the games...wondering if theyre for real products.P.S. I realise that this thread of yours is a joke Im just saying that its impossible to prove...so its smart of you say to that youre fairly certain that Ellie is a witch...because you could never actually prove it!

11642071,0,t3_65y7jj,Ok I think the insinuation of Ellie possibly being raped by David is enough. Also there are many situations that could hurtdisturb Ellie enough to drive her to be very angry. In my personal opinion Im kind of sick of seeing the whole rape thing over and over. Yes I know its a possibility and that it happens but I think a lot of writers use this story line a bit too much to justify a characters anger and hurt. Its a bit of crutch in my opinion and the way it was portrayed in the first game was meaningful and was respectful of the severity of that scenario. I dont really think then need to keep going down that avenue. ,thelastofus,dgfn4ul,1,t5_2t7gp
