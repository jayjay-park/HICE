8831629,0,t3_4jxt42,Since a lot of Kings books are intertwined its quite possible that Pascow after death is the representation of The White in this story. He is certainly something more divine than just a dead college student. The White being basically the incarnation of the protectors of the Beam from The Dark Tower novels. Not that ALL of his novels are tied to The Dark Tower and as far as Pet Sematary goes the only real connection I see is Oz the Great amp Terrible.Pet Sematary is my favorite King novel so I felt I needed to put some kind of input here haha.,StephenKingBookClub,d79fsbj,1,t5_2xdzx
