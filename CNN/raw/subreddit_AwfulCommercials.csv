3200826,0,t3_2vu6sx,Pretty awful but not as awful as some Ive seen.  Just about any car title loan commercial is worse by virtue of its telling part of the truth  if you miss a payment you lose your car and you still owe the company.  But the worse in terms of the audio causing headaches for the casual viewer would be the Head On! commercial. ,AwfulCommercials,cotrjue,0,t5_30g4u
