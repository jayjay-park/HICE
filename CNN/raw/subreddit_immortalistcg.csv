Gundar Firkin is at the Hotel Algonquin where he took a room at my heartless suggestion awaiting a telephone call I am too cowardly to make. Decision is to decline with regret even with a kind of grief. It may have been that my standards were so high or the quality of the books so dreadful but in either case I do not remember recommending a single submitted work during my five months at McGrawHill.This proves how Sophie was Nathans victim. William Styron demonstrates Sophie to be a victim of others her entire life. Her father never cared for her Nathan would abuse of her and finally even strangers didnt have respect over her. Sophie was a victim of oppression her entire life because she never had any willpower. Her rights as a human being were yanked of her with every mental emotional and physical blow she would receive.Miss Meyers said he wanted to see an editor. Now is the time to die Nay time was long ago Let us know whats wrong with this preview of Sophie s Choice by William Styron. The gate to Auschwitz where those in charge choose who lives and who dies Farrell had long before fallen victim to the ambitionless dronelike quietude into which as if in some mammoth beehive the company eventually numbed its employees even the ambitious ones and since he knew that the chances were less than one in ten thousand that I would find a publishable manuscript I think he felt that there was no harm in my having a little fun.It is worth remembering that more than Europe s Jews were caught up in the Nazi insanity  Sophie s story is just one of many.This is a difficult painful ampamp ultimately worthwhile novel. When I reread the novel that s what I ll do.read more I had the book on the plane ampamp had been reading it but having a hard time with it ampamp when I left the plane I left the book without finishing it. Sophie s Choice is a  novel by American author William Styron.It concerns the relation between three people sharing a boarding house in Brooklyn Stingo a young aspiring writer from the South who befriends the Jewish Nathan Landau and Sophie Landau s beautiful lovera Polish survivor of the German Nazi concentration camps.The plot ultimately centers on a tragic decision which Sophie was forced to make upon entering the concentration camp. It belongs on that small shelf reserved or American masterpieces Paul Fussell wrote in the Washington Post Book World.He persuaded her to go with him to a farm owned by his father in Virginia. It was on that trip Sophie revealed her choice at Auschwitz. It was on that trip that Sophie made love to Stingo. And she asked if there was a Berlitz language school near there so she might learn to write in English.Some things to ponder when reading or rereading this book. How unreliable a narrator is Sophie? How much can we believe about her story and character? Second why is there so much sex in the book?.   ,immortalistcg,cx9vfg0,1,t5_2w3w5
