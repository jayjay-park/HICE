7823158,0,t1_d3vcs4e,Vlad is more incentivized to go health tank now... AP builds still work but in my experience I like a hybrid build most of the time. I rush spirit visage against aps and rylais against most ads. Visage rylais zhonyas boots been liking sorcs lately CDR boots or mercs are good too Last  items are situational. Warmogs randuins abyssal void staff protobelt. All good options. Ive been taking stormraiders  mid wirh flashghost or TP. You have to play him differently than old Vlad but in the right hands hes incredibly strong right now. You probably just need to play him more to actually get good with him. You want to get to  CDR as soon as you can... Without sacrificing other core items also.,VladimirMains,d3ve1f2,1,t5_37alf

But the recent changes to his passive means that building ability power is more efficient than before.Stormraiders Deathfire touch and Thunderlords are the most popular keystones. You should find out which one suits your playstyle the most. I use Deathfire touch because it amplifies my own playstyle more than the other ones.,VladimirMains,d5e15jj,2,t5_37alf

8943193,0,t3_52k9c5,Like others have said I put a lot of time into learning old Vlad and felt very strong on him had a high win rate.  Hated new Vlad at first but grew to like him until the nerfs started.Agree that the nerfs have been very wrong headed.  Its the healing on the Q thats the problem combined with its very low damage when not empowered.  I think the heal should be more consistent the base Q should heal more and do more damage and the empowered Q should heal less and do less damage than right now.  Even him out a bit let him get the big burst heal from his ult but not so much his Q.As it is hes fucking broken I stopped playing him ,VladimirMains,d7mu9an,1,t5_37alf

The other one is more to my liking  Same  Mpen reds  Scaling HP yellows and then scaling cdr blues   Dcaling cdr qquint for  and  movespeed quints. I start with either an amplifying tome or bootsmostly boots It is weak eraly but if i am not forced to back early i can come back with  cdr and it gives a lot of space for pure ap items while maintaining the capped out cdr Yeah i like cdr really much,VladimirMains,db1zhyc,1,t5_37alf

Q spell is OK only when you have an extremly high amount of AP like  when E is bad rank  but also bad lategame   sec cast for  damage when most ranged will do  damage poke.Also Vlad is slow predictable and dont have a lot of good matchups yes you will afk farm but will you snowball most of the times ? no.Also dont forget the pool nerf.,VladimirMains,dbg9iau,1,t5_37alf

11065698,0,t3_5xi3o6,Im d rn i typically always run  scaling unless i need ms for specific matchups. The  ap or whatever it is u get instead of the extra  isnt worth imo in comparison to being able to get sorc or tabis. The main reason i run  is because vlad can optimize very well against ap with visage and scepter if he needs but against ad he only really had zhonya. So i typically build tabi every single game unless they have tons of cc which i go mercs. GUYS TABI ARE BROKEN THEY HAVE BEEN BROKEN SINCE THE INCREASE FROM  BUILD THEM ON EVERYONE. Tabi destroys all lethality users all auto attackers everyone ad basically. In terms of raw v power tabi straight up are better than sorc boots against ad even if they have no bonus mr. ,VladimirMains,demabk6,1,t5_37alf

11505589,0,t1_dg052o8,Because a spirit visage rush doesnt play at all into his current strengths. You are looking at the vacuum of one spell use at a specific level. Thats such a small vacuum that nothing can really be extrapolated from it.If you want to go that route why not compare same level vlad casting the same spell with hextech or ludens as first item instead of spirit? In your example the CD benefit from going spirit doesnt come into play at all so why is it a necessary stat?How does spirit visage rush stack up when you add your secondthird item into the mix? Are you going Haunting into spirit? Haunting then pen boots into spirit? boots  straight into spirit? What if the enemy team is all AD? Spirit is completely wasted vs all AD.I dont understand the inspiration by master yi part... Master Yi doesnt care about cooldowns... Hes the definition of an auto attack based champion. He gets all the CD help he wants from getting resets.Ultimately youre whole case originated off of rushing CDR and you havent even run the numbers on a rotations. Go into practice mode build pen boots and spirit and do  seconds worth of spell rotations. Then go back to base and do it again with hextech or ludens probably the  most rushed items. Make sure to include the damage from hextech active and make sure ludens procs twice. Then come back and let us know what the damage over  seconds is from all  item sets let us know things like your HPresists on all  item sets. Have to use same masteries and runes for each test.This isnt about how spirit rush vlad stacks up now compared to spirit rush vlad use to stack up prerework. Its about how spirit rush vlad stacks up against todays optimal build.,VladimirMains,dg05qnx,1,t5_37alf
