5031763,0,t1_cusfjt8,Well Ill check the bindings when I get home then. And not to be a dick but a mouse in the menu is pretty fucking trivial if you ask me. Thats seriously . of the game unless you count the idroid functions as a menu in which case I dont know. Ill check that too. But I doubt it.,MGSPhantomPain,cusiovi,2,t5_2wpja
5066133,0,t1_cuw9se5,I was forced into making my FOB and doing the training for it because I was online the first day I played. Once your FOB exists it can be raided regardless of your online status.The game also autologs you in at startup i believe. So in short your two options are  never build your first FOB andor play the game with steam in offline mode.Edit  I should also mention only people of similar progression you can invade you. Also if you successfully defend yourself you can counter attack to try and redeem your stuff. I hated the whole invasion thing at first but i actually like it now.,MGSPhantomPain,cuwnsb7,1,t5_2wpja
5075737,0,t3_3khvwm,Yeah if you take them in the wrong order you cant get them all. I made that mistake the first time. Now im a master thief.,MGSPhantomPain,cuxtg6s,2,t5_2wpja
5083311,0,t1_cuypibj,I wouldnt think you could in Metal Gear. Someone else pointed out that message I heard was probably referring toPretty sure it means that you can now play missions AS other team members. Change your character in the loadout screen before you deploy.Which is something that I realize I now have access to.,MGSPhantomPain,cuyqdpd,3,t5_2wpja

5121311,0,t1_cv2oirw,If your FOB gets invaded while you are offline and not able to defend it then people in your Relationships list will start getting notified to come defend it for you.  Its very beneficial to defend someones FOB for them because the GMP reward can be in the high hundreds of thousands.,MGSPhantomPain,cv3b6bz,1,t5_2wpja
5148814,0,t3_3lh7op,Have you seen episode  Kingdom of the Flies?It was the scrapped real ending to the game. My best guess is that since Konami decided to stop making AAA games they figured lets just release this game now unfinished. Why pour money into this thing any more than we have to.Ive always felt the Kojima can make strange artistic choices at times but this really feels like someone else forcing his hand.Heres the video,MGSPhantomPain,cv6mjg5,1,t5_2wpja
5149860,0,t1_cv66wp0,Yeah that is strange. Huey was already assigned and I never even had to develop the DWalker. Certainly some strange issues.,MGSPhantomPain,cv6r2ri,1,t5_2wpja
5187217,0,t1_cvb8nav,The thing is I started to sprint under the Metal Gear it then stomped me and killed me so I thought you just had to run away as hard as you can. I ended up doing the mission again and it just felt weird that the metal gear was JUST THERE whilst the chopper was waiting for me amp hovering right next to it.,MGSPhantomPain,cvb9030,1,t5_2wpja
5209425,0,t1_cv8qzav,gt youre going to extract him??this apparently is not meant as an insult its just random i have extracted guys with  A and he stil says that randomly. its just bad voice acting. or a bug,MGSPhantomPain,cvdxfmo,2,t5_2wpja

6407652,0,t1_czhjbbp,Ok i did some looking around and found that error  can be fixed by setting your time and date properly. Also since you actual connection is tops and youre still getting the connection error you should be able to fix it by forwarding ports,MGSPhantomPain,czhzgzo,1,t5_2wpja
