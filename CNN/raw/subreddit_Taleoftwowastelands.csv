4333107,0,t3_3alpwy,As far as I know there isnt such a patch. The the only PN  TTW patches I am aware of are darthbdamans RoyBattys and ThatcherPuppettrons and they all seem to require the cyberware module. I doubt making a version that doesnt require it is a priority at the moment so Im afraid your options are to either ignore the cyberware in your game or take a crack at removing instances of cyberware from the mod yourself.,Taleoftwowastelands,cse2jow,2,t5_2xgs5
7331192,0,t3_4fqz3m,Last time i did that Which was a while ago i had to get a very recent fork of FOMM. I believe it to be this one but i havent tested it. Note It will still say NOT RESPONDING while its working. Its important that you pay attention to every detail of the TTW install guide,Taleoftwowastelands,d2bi8s5,1,t5_2xgs5
