9813875,0,t3_5fsip6,Bay Ridge is a bit more expensive but the grounds and apartments were pretty good! Tara Heights is on the expensive side but some of the best apartments around when we went looking. Royal Crest seemed pretty grungy the apartment we were shown smelled heavily like smoke and mold. Weve found that it is pretty hard to get a washerdryer in unit. I know Bay Ridge only had them in certain apartments at the time we looked about a month ago. Royal Crest I think had one but they were tiny and stacked in the bathroom which was a huge no for me. Thats all the information I can give based on what we saw in the past month! I can say that Boulder Park and Somerset Apartments were pretty good price was. There isnt any washerdryer in unit but they are on every floor and sadly cost around  dollars per load.,nashua,damrq40,3,t5_2rq99
