Biglesworth made a base and set his spawn within range of said baseturretsships then fired on them causing them to declare war. So he gets shot dies respawns at the spawnpoint in range etc. ,Starmade,cefc5to,1,t5_2tnkl

3123667,0,t3_2vxhqv,Always always have a ship core Actually whatever you do dont make your ship core exposed very easily. Defend it with your life. Play around with the modules to see what they do and what you need to get them to work. Always keep a spare ship core in your pocket unless youre doing survival and dont mind rebuilding from the ground up. Learn from everyone else. Generally a salvage ship is the first thing to get followed by a defense ship. In my vids Im doing a survival thing I built a nice salvager then destroyed it on a bunch of pirates. Now Im stuck on a planet with pirates still circling. Ive got an interesting quandary where I cant actually build my next ship in an exposed area so Im planning on seeing if I can make a turret act like a planetary defense system. Given the limited rotation of the turret theres no guarantee it will work but its worth the try I admit my first couple of vids had its share of hiccups but I think Im getting better. Check it out It starts here and continues on till episode . Granted it may not be what youre asking for yet but well see what I find out must be a must have ,Starmade,colrm97,3,t5_2tnkl

4013622,0,t1_cqsmcm4, I really am lookng for a more competative experience. To do this a I think a few things need to be added.  Shipyards for automatic construction and repair with blueprints Balanced turning manuverability renewable resources better reason to hold territoryreason to take territory.  better faction control to combat trolls i.e. private storage within a faction. better server control max ship station and turret dimensions.  On the creative side I think this game works well besides needing a creative only mode. I love the stuff people build but I find that fighting these super cool looking ships can be a bit boring. They fall victim to the cube ships really easy and it is hard to combat that on the admin side of things. Thus a rebalancing of all ship systems is needed. Furthermore factioin warfare is lacking it just isnt gratifying and it is hard to build larger fleets when you cant trust new players to add to your faction. ,Starmade,crds8c2,2,t5_2tnkl
