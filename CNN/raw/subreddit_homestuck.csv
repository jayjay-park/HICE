I think this was the moment the Homestuck really grabbed me. Until now I expected them to gradually complete the game and come together at a final fight against the black king following a set storyline of something like say Avatar The Last Airbender.spoiler This showed to me that the story in itself was not going to follow its own rules and anything could happen.gt S Dirk SynchronizeUnite Counts as one I love the way Hussie is able to make these connections and let everything flow together its a really amazing thingspoilergt S Enter OK Ill admit when I first read the story I wasnt really involved in it I skipped the Midnight Crew Intermission .

The only problem is that a solidification on the mechanics of Sburb could make fan works easier OR harder.It could really go either wayIt could make it so the fans understand how Skaias Game works and are able to write their fanadventures and fics and such with more accuracy. It could ALSO make it so that theres less room for fanbased leeway. For all we know learning how The Game works and learning too much of its lore could take away from the funheartbreak of creating it ourselves.

699825,0,t3_22411j,Well I think this is the perfect time for me to talk about an old tv show called REBOOT! You might have heard of it but if not think Tron if it was really colourful. Now let me give you a point by point as to why you should just drop all of your shit and just watch ReBoot right friggin now.gt Novel use of its medium to tell a story that cannot be told otherwiseYou want novel use of a medium? This shit was pretty much the first CGI ever used barring stupid little shorts and special effects. It came a full year before Toy story to give you a reference of how old it is. But with that being said YOU MIGHT read will FIND THIS ANIMATION LAUGHABLY BAD BY TODAYS STANDARDS. Dont worry though it gets better in later seasons.gt Worldbuilding that is flippantly detailed to inspire childlike wonder and awe along with being intellectually stimulatingIf the world of a superfuturisticyetalsoprettyretro and is also inside of a computer isnt awe inspiring I dont know what is! While the earlier episodes are more for kids it soon develops into a tight paced plot that is made even better by super cool characters. It also has a fair amount of THEMES and SYMBOLISM.gt Selfaware enough to be humorous and reflect the grownup view of its audience without diminishing any of the impact and wonderAs for selfawareness and humour this is where ReBoot gets an A muthafuckin plus. Its hanging up lampshades like no tomorrow like how the characters talk about things like ridiculously timed gamecubes! There are also many NERDY JOKES and COMPUTER BASED PUNS.Overall youll want to watch this show because FUCK YEAH!DIGITAL WORLD and SWEET JEEBUS!DAT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT and finally HELL YES!AWESOME PLOT save for a massive cliffhanger ending.Also the villains are awesome and everyone knows that villains are the ones who make the series.,homestuck,cgjtmdg,3,t5_2rzgi

750593,0,t3_22r75s,i think a best villain is one you can relate to. if a villain is just like lololololol im evil suk ma dik then thats no good. theyve got to have character n shit. Infact Caliborn i think is a good example of this or at least hes becoming one. At first i thought he was just some annoying jerk but honestly hes become one of my favorite characters in the recent arcs. Not only is his banter fucking hilarious hes akward around girls and struggles with trying to make friends he has a hilarious fetish for softcore porn and hes an aspiring artist! it makes him a really interesting and well rounded character which will make it all the more impactful when if they put him down.My second criteria for good villains are their style points. villains that are smart cunning badass and possibly even devilishly good looking will always rank high above their sloppier counterparts. A good example Amon vs Ozai from avatar. Ozai was kind of a shitty villain because he was completely full of himself and was really just a raging lunatic. But Amon? They really didnt even need to give him powers in the end becasue god damnit his swag just rules over everything. Slade is another good example of this.Edit Ive suddenly realized i have this problem where on the days leading up to a day off I will get less and less sleep thinking i will just make it up when i get the day off but then i end up not sleeping at all cause im like ITS MA DAY OFF GOTTA DO STUFF! im going to die of not sleep X,homestuck,cgplknb,4,t5_2rzgi

The gameplay will be a typical retro point and click adventure with a sylladex like inventory. It will come with moderate success  on metacritic user reviews  due to some of the puzzles being to vague and lack of voices but critics will laud the games writing music and art. It will also bring a lot more attention to Homestuck and get more people to understand what its really all about i.e. jokes about old adventure games data structures and really bad s movies. Some of the fans will be angry about the game due to the omission of main characters except for one encounter and a few little jokes and thusly will refuse to buy it but overall it will fair well.Im really just guessing here.,homestuck,ch753bk,33,t5_2rzgi

1175670,0,t1_ci1uy5f,As a Seer of Time you benefit only others with your knowledge of Time. This could manifest in many ways. You could have the potential to see far into someones future selectively and know the factors causing it. You might only get slight glimpses of the immediate future for someone else etc. This can be used to avoid major ambushes from enemies with actual intelligence and can also see the effects of plans you might have and if they doom a timeline. In battle it is rather simple you can look into the future to see exactly how the battle goes what moves they make how they react etc. And you plan around that creating a perfect routine for tough enemies although only for other players. As a person you have an inkling for death you are rather macabre in many aspects especially since you could see many peoples deaths in succession and you might attempt to stop them each time. Whether you become a guardian of others with this knowledge or simply not care it wont effect that fact you cannot see anywhere into your specific future only others.,homestuck,ci1vsmd,3,t5_2rzgi

You are in charge of planning you see what could go wrong and understand the strengths and shortcomings of every member of your team. You know when a plan is futile you know when it is time to run. You know when it is time to advance. You know who to leave behind if necessary. While you are known for planning you are also an effective fighter. You understand the shortcomings of an individual enemy almost immediately by seeing their deviations from your standard of that enemys traits. Of course you file away everything you see as fact.

1890671,0,t1_ckgpj5r,My understanding of Cal is that his timeline starts on Alpha Earth because he isnt cursed yet at that point. Caliborn makes Dirk drop him into the ocean and then Gamzee digs him up much later and gives him to Caliborn who curses him and makes him an extension of Caliborns own soul able to absorb information and influence other people. Gamzee takes Cal to Alpha Jack to curse him and then Cal is probably taken by Gamzee back to Beta Derse to haunt Daves dreams.Heres where things get tricky. At the ectobiology lab Cals timeline splits into three loops. In the first one he goes to Alpha Earth with Dirk as a deadeyed puppet. In the second he goes to Beta Earth with Bro and starts terrorizing Dave while hes awake as well. In the third loop he goes to Alternia where Aradia finds him and gets Kanaya to patch him up and make him a green suit. At this point hes paradoxcloned to create Doc Scratch who is also probably an extension of Caliborn given that Lord English enters Alternias universe through Doc Scratchs body.Then Gamzee steals thirdloop Cal and starts communing with him just as hes sobering up. Cal transmits information about everything that has happened to him so far and advises Gamzee to kill his teammates in order to set the whole thing in motion. Hes probably still in the depths of the meteor somewhere though its possible that he has stopped existing by the time Gamzee arrives on Alpha Earth to dig up his firstloop self.,homestuck,ckh0n5s,3,t5_2rzgi

Mostly because usually fan made aspects are just a stupid excuse to give OCs crazy superpowers when thats not really what the aspects are about. Yeah the witch and prince classes are sort of like that but they are also some of the most active classes. But fan aspects are usually just like oh im a mage of lightning or some shit so i can do crazy lightning magic even though mages dont actually get offensive magic based on their aspect.

2417612,0,t1_cmahoua,In another corner of the theory spectrum... I read through your third scratch theory. Its pretty solid but i think youve made a small miscalculation that i believe cuts a hole in your theory. From what i read the ultimate purpose of scratching the Cherubs session is to essentially switch the roles Caliborn and Calliope resulting in Callies predomination and eventual ascertaining of a power that will act as the creative force to counter LEs destructive power. but heres the thread caught on the hookdoing this would completely obliterate Calliopes Character. not physically but from a storytelling point of view. Calliope has been built up as a character of incredible importance and to just push her aside to make way for her already accomplished counterpart would defeat the purpose of the current Calliopes characterization. The most recent update proves that there are vast and purposeful differences made in the character development of the two Calliopes. The purpose of Alt!Calliope is not to roll in and save the day. The purpose of Alt!Calliope is to help build upon current Calliopes character so that she can aid her friends in victory. Lets not also forget that Alt!Callie is a god tier of the most passive class in the game and that her class also likely has something to do with telling stories. Would it not be unbelievably passive of her to tell a story that would be passed down to eventually inspire the current Calliope? As a fully realized muse Alt!Callies purpose in this story is to play an incredibly passive role of great importance. Current Calliope is not destined to master her class but rather she is destined to envelop a greater role something that will be a grand culmination of all the efforts within the story.In the end im not necessarily debunking a scratch but if there is one it wont be for the purpose you described. Personally i think it would be more likely if Alt!Calliopes session was the one that was scratched. It would be more fitting in the cyclical nature of the story as a scratch of Alt!Calliopes session would be necessary to create LE which is necessary for most of homestuck to even occur and most important of all would be necessary for bringing the true Calliope into being.Also a scratch in the reverse order would still allow for the Checkmate ending that you described because as with any universe in homestuck both instances of the session exist in tandem.BTW i dont mean to sound like im arguing with you or being rude i just really enjoy discussing theories! it is after all one of the best ways to learn more about something you are already familiar with ,homestuck,cmaixeq,2,t5_2rzgi

2466247,0,t3_2nsiw0,I stayed up until  the other night. am that is to say. Holidays are over and a friend of mine decided to buy me a shit load of games. Im not even finished with the games Ive had for years so Im a little winded. Especially since as previously mentioned the holidays just ended so I may have to just wait till Christmas break before I can play the actual shit out of them.But I stayed up until am playing them anyway. Cause I basically live on the edge. Gone Girl by David Fincher. Ive frankly never seen a single Fincher movie that hasnt completely satisfied me. I once had a dream that I had a bunch of shit lodged inside of me. Like for example there was an entire pen lodged horizontally in my throat. And the only way to get these things out was to do a bunch of arbitrary shit. Like for that pen thing I had to drink a cup of coffee for some idiot reason.I tried to get a cup at some local coffee shop but the barista was being a total dick. He was also VSauce for some reason. I guess he didnt believe I needed a cup?? He instead gave me a bunch of crackers to eat. And for some idiot fucking reason I actually started eating them all as if I was obligated to.Turns out eating crackers with a pen stuffed in your throat only for lack of better words makes things worse. I started spitting cracker pieces all over the counter but VSauce didnt seem to mind too much. He just had the same look of disapproval and judgement he did when I asked for the cup in the first place.I eventually convinced him to give me a cup by telling him that I knew about his dead wife?? He was also Tony Stark suddenly btw. But also VSauce. He was Tony Stark and VSauce simultaneously. He also suddenly looked like my brother. He was my brother and VSauce and Tony Stark all at the same time. And I knew about his dead wife.yeahI have stupid dreams.,homestuck,cmgj172,6,t5_2rzgi

2711649,0,t3_2r39d1,Eridan didnt kill Sollux just blinded him and you missed Terezi killing Vriska.Gamzee was frankly a more menacing villain. Its not just in his body count. He also made it a point to terrorize Karkat and manipulated Terezi into killing Vriska among other things. Vriska killed Tavros and immediately felt bad about it and was remorseful in a weird alien way. Eridan killed Feferi and Kanaya but he didnt set out with the goal of killing them. He set out with the goal of joining Jack and he was perfectly on board with leaving to join Jack without killing anyone himself Sollux challenged HIM to a duel Feferi attacked HIM with her trident and Kanaya attacked HIM with her chainsaw both murders and the one KO were technically selfdefense. It wasnt murder for murders sake as is evident from the fact that he left Karkat behind as a witness. And after killing them his next stop was getting confronted by Gamzee and Vriska and then chainsawed in half by Kanaya.Gamzee meanwhile didnt just kill some people. He made it a point to announce that he was going to murder each and every troll and grind their bones up and paint with their blood. Then he terrorized Karkat with honking from every direction including stealing Terezis glasses and honking at him from there which also has the bonus of removing Terezi from communication took a brief break from that to murder Equius and Nepeta and then he manipulated Terezi into killing Vriska.Plus we saw that in another timeline he snapped earlier and killed LITERALLY EVERY TROLL.Oh and hey he has more deaths on his hands than that. After all it was by his influence that Dream Jade Daves Bro John a Doomed Dave Johns Dad Roses Mom John again Rose Dave CD WK WQ AR BQ BK all the trolls dreamselves besides Vriskas Roxy and Billious Slick died plus all the trolls consorts carapaces and sprites a shitton of doomed Aradiabots and that doomed Karkat and Terezi from that one timeline Terezi saw.I think that is enough to count him as a major villain although I dont think anyone at this point or any other was calling Gamzee big bad given Bec Noir Doc Scratch and the stilllooming background threat at the time of Lord English.,homestuck,cncaxvn,10,t5_2rzgi

2823477,0,t1_cnozmgp,. Youre assuming that if Equius was dead his body would be right there next to Nepetas for John to notice.  This is not an unreasonable assumption but because we never see it or hear anyone mention it and that Gamzee obviously didnt just leave the scene after killing Nepeta its still an assumption and not actual evidence.. Incorrect.  At that moment Karkat was attempting to revive Kanaya.  It wasnt until some time later that Karkat notices that Terezi had messaged him saying that she was going to try and revive Tavros and then lost her glasses afterwards. And since when was Gamzee only gunning for Nepeta?  Im quite certain his objective was kIlL eVeRyOnE.  If he didnt want to be seen he wouldnt have been sitting out in the open wearing bright red glasses that he didnt need to be wearing.  He wasnt trying to be stealthy.. Fair enough but thats still not evidence.  That description contained just as many hints that Vriska was the leader and they were far more explicit.. Now youre just splitting hairs about what exactly qualifies as an inscrutable gambit of circumstance.  Its an intentionally nebulous expression.  Dont act like youre an expert on inscrutable gambits of circumstance.  That isnt a thing people can be.And . Equius isnt a leader.  He may think hes suited to the task by virtue of his blood but he never showed any indication that he could capably lead anyone to do anything.  Whats more he gets perverse pleasure by following.  Thats the punchline in each of his scenes somebody tells him what to do he gets sweaty and does it.,homestuck,cnp0ufa,1,t5_2rzgi

The literal porn even if it is grayscale for another thing. The blood.Never mind that totally appeals to twelveyearolds. Still Id rate it  at least.That aside its weird for me to see the main Homestuck fandom. I only really partake in this subreddit and the update threads on chans co board which is pretty far from tumblr!To be honest you whippersnappers kind of make me cringe. For you Homestuck is all about cosplay and roleplaying and shipping. Shipping does infect this subreddit and even co but its less incessant and obsessive.I think homestuck is a great webcomic but stuff like this is pretty embarrassing. This kind of weird geeking out is probably what your friends consider Homestuck.

3567502,0,t1_cpyqlyp,Yes.Turns out that in the end Jade was a softie on the inside too! Shes a dog. Thats a metaphor too Dogs like bones and of course she also likes them. Shes always chasing that bone because she wants to be like them. In fact the bone metaphors that surround her are one of the most fascinating and wellwritten themes in MS Paint Adventures. Lets for example take a look on Jades dream self. She was dreamy and adorable but whenever there was a problem she didnt hesitate at all. On the contrary she toughened up immediately like a bone and she faced those problems right on. It happened when the Courtyard Droll tried to steal the queens ring and when Johns dream self was about to be crushed by the Prospitan golden moon. If Jade hadnt been a boner John would have been a goner.Sadly Dream Jade was squashed by her home world resulting in the shattering of every one of her bones exposing the soft marrow they contained. This was a breaking point for the character both in a literal and figurative sense. Just like her bones were broken in half her character splintered from the original Jade becoming an independent entity and her development took a completely new direction.As if having her bones crushed wasnt enough Grandpa took Dream Jades corpse and stuffed it. The symbolic implications werent clear back then but a small detail in Act  casted light on this otherwise obscure metaphor the traditional stuffing process of the Crocker and by extension the Harley family involves hollowing the cadaver. That is the skeleton is removed from the body. At this point Dream Jade is nothing but an empty boneless husk and that would be fine if she was to remain dead. But she wasnt!  She came back to life. Dream Jade experienced the absence of her skeleton on her own flesh for the first time. Even worse! She was now some sort of ghost spirit even less bones who was also part dog! Dream Jade became Jadesprite and with that she didnt only lose her tough inner self but she also became a beast naturally predisposed to love bones. Its like poetry. She obviously broke down to tears. She just couldnt bear it and she gave up. The dialogue hints that theres a difference between Jade and Jadesprite. Jade was still brave and tough tough enough to beat the shit out of Jadesprite! but Jadesprite was a coward. She the one who once was plucky enough to protect the Queens treasure or to save her brother from the meteoric lunar debris had become a cowardly dog. The difference between them couldnt be any clearer it was their bones. You could even say that Jadesprite needed to grow a spine eh? Eh??To the uncultured eye it would seem that Jadesprites arc would need an act of redemption an ascent to what her courageous former self used to be. But only to the uncultured eye. Jadesprites only feat consisted in teleporting a sword so that other character could actively act towards the common good.It wasnt until Jade ascended to the God Tiers that she could toughen up again. Her human endoskeleton came back to her and with it her courage. Jadesprite also lost her individual entity. Remember when she died and she splintered into two different characters and how I likened it to a bone breaking in half? At this point the bone has finally been allowed to heal and the two independent halves have merged back into a whole powerful femur. But Jades bone journey was far from being finished. Oh no. I wont get into details because in Act  some of these patterns are repeated. Perhaps the most interesting symbolic event that happened there was when she was manipulated by Her Imperious Condescension. Grimbark Jade was born an entity who having left her humanity had never been as close as she was to being a full dog. The implication here is clear she had become pure bone toughness itself. The upper layer of soft meat is discarded her factions are sharpened and she goes on an almost murdering spree to satisfy her impressive condensation of emotions. This is ironically when she starts craving for meat. The other characters trying to bring her humanity back start offering her meat products like ham steak and then the truth is finally revealed there was softness inside her toughness. The anatomic metaphor is complete.The next piece of characterization doesnt make sense lineally speaking because in the Homestuck canon those two events are unrelated but from a narrative standpoint both are absolutely tied to each other.As if to echo Dream Jades death Grimbark Jade is squashed by her home. The soft marrow of her bones is exposed again dissipating the illusion of her purebone transformation. The next time we see Jade shes talking with Calliope. It was later revealed that theyre different Jades the latter being the result of Johns journey through canonspace. That difference isnt really that important though as I mentioned in the previous paragraph. The narration treats those two Jades as if they were the same character and it doesnt make any attempt to separate the themes of both. That second Jade was never crushed by a tower and the softness inside her was never exposed but she still carries the thematic symbols from the Grimbark Jade who ceased being bone to become marrow.Heres when she completes her journey. After having pierced through literal layers of flesh and bone her development is complete. Her character is fully realized she was soft all along and thats fine! Now she can finally spend time being the meat she always was and playing trollsona games with her new friend. Its just like Calliope said meat is very good.UU retroGnostalic,homestuck,cpyx78i,18,t5_2rzgi

3706639,0,t1_cqerdin,In a normal prescratch session the babies are created ectobiologically and then sent back in time on meteors via Skaias defense portals.The scratch swaps the portals around so that the same exact meteors with the same exact babies get sent to different times andor places. Thats actually the entire point of the scratch as Rose explainsgt ROSE But they werent flung through portals in their own session nor will they be created there.ttgt ROSE They were created in our session and sent back through our portals. Just like us.ttgt DAVE ................tggt ROSE To understand what happened it really helps to understand exactly what a scratch is.ttgt ROSE When John severely damaged the Beat Mesa on your planet and sent it off to Skaia to release its temporal energy there you could view it as a kind of request.ttgt ROSE We were asking Skaia to change everything at a fundamental level and we gave it the energy to do so.ttgt ROSE But Skaia is a very passive entity. It only knows and sees but it never quite acts.ttgt ROSE When it is asked to change everything there is only so much it has control over.ttgt ROSE In fact it has control over exactly one thing. The defense portals.ttgt ROSE It can decide to send important meteors to different points in time than originally planned thus creating alternate realities.ttgt ROSE Offshoots of promise rather than futility.ttgt ROSE And it turns out the most important meteors of all tend to be the ones delivering the young players to their planet.ttgt ROSE So all it has to do to change everything is tweak their destination times a bit.ttgt ROSE All internallyprompted changes in the postscratch universe are decided entirely by this modest adjustment to the parameters.ttgt ROSE Its a very simple concept actually.ttgt ROSE Yet the consequences are dramatic. It results in not only a hard reset for the session but a partial reset for the universe too due to the many causal entanglements between a session and its originating universe.ttHowever the trolls session is weird in that the usual situation is swappedwhereas normally the babies are created in the prescratch session sent back on meteors and then the scratch just scrambles them around for the Trolls the babies are actually created in the postscratch session meaning that the prescratch Trolls have to scratch in order to bring about their own creation. Doc Scratch explainsgt Though they could not recognize it for the bad omen it was this session was not the one in which they had been spawned. Such is the symptom of a subtle glitch affecting certain sessions an error designed to trigger an unfathomable cascade of misfortune throughout paradox space. This glitch is the calling card of the one I serve. It is the discreet gentlemanly manner in which he reserves his place in a universe for later visitation.scratchbgHope that clears things up.,homestuck,cqes625,1,t5_2rzgi

Such trolls will have an instinctive pale attraction to a more eventempered troll who may become their MOIRAIL. The moirail is obliged to pacify the other to function as the better half. The two partners in a strong pale relationship will serve to balance and complement each others emotional profiles and thus allow their other relationships to be more successful. Its often ambiguous especially among young trolls whether a bond formed between an acquaintance is true moirallegence or the usual variety of platonic involvement. Furthermore romantic intentions of a more flushed nature can often be mistaken for paler leanings much to the frustration of the suitor. But some pale pairings as the one above will be strikingly obvious to all who know them.,homestuck,cqq2k9u,23,t5_2rzgi

3875850,0,t1_cqy2jwp,gt I disagree. Where is this shown? If you mean her powers theres loads of godtiers stronger than her. If you mean stuff like timetravelling and prototyping sprites we may as well call Gamzee absurdly competent. She just found out the stuff from ghosts in dream bubbles. If you mean something else Id like to hear it.We arent talking about Gamzee.  Were talking about Vriska.  I am saying that the extent to which she plans aheadsucceeds at her plans no matter how poorly assembled they are is absolutely ludicrous.gtFuck no. Since when? Loads of people dislike her. Karkat was insulting her in the most recent update Rose thinks shes an annoying bitch Kanya was passivelyaggressively insulting her John thinks shes crazy...And despite all of that they still tolerate her presence... why exactly?  They have absolutely no reason to let her stick around nor any reason to actually try to chum up with her.  Theres absolutely no logical reason to keep her around.  They still do it.  gtTavros was just as much at fault for that as herBullshit.  Tavros was going to try to stop her from going to fight Jack because he knew Jack would just follow her trail back to the meteor.  And you know what?  HE WAS TOTALLY RIGHT.gtThe only area where Vriskas had a significant effect is Roses drinking. And again thats because Vriska is the kind of unbelievable bitch who tries to dominate everyone. Shes a massive prick who publiclym humiliated Rose. Normally thats a bad thing but this time? This time it helped prevent Rose from becoming an alcoholic only by messing with her origin. Again all she did was kick Roses arse in a public and annoying way as she started drinking. That isnt a fucking good thing in almost every situation it just happened to help here.Right because everyone knows that alcoholism is an easilytreated psychological problem with very few layers and that publicly humiliating somebody is totally a foolproof way to go about treating it.  What she did would make the problem worse not better  but it still magically works.   Also that is not the only area shes had a significant effect.  She stopped Gamzees relationship with Terezi which is perhaps in and of itself believable  but her totally neutering him and making him into a harmless slave?  No not even remotely.  Gamzee killed ALL OF THE TROLLS in at least one doomed timeline.  Nepeta Equius Terezi Vriska weird uncle Stubbins whos always adjusting his bone bulge  everyone.  Vriska would not have a chance if she tried to fight him so how is she subduing him like this?  There is absolutely no explanation given for it. Finally Hussie has several times admitted that she is both intended to be a Mary Sue to an extent and a base breaker on top of that.  She is literally committee designed to make people disagree about her.  I rest my case.,homestuck,cqy2wgq,-1,t5_2rzgi

3949407,0,t3_35p1g8,I like the implications this would have if you add Void into the mix. It is canonically the opposite of light so following a basic line of though it would be related to lack of story relevance. However Equius Roxy and Calliope all have relevant arcs. My solution is to stretch the definition a little bit and say that light is related to the spotlight on the main stage more than relevance to the narrative as a whole. Hence void players would interact with relevant story points too but always behind the curtains. Equius role as Heir of Void was basically to check out of the script soon and without achieving anything at all just to turn up at the end as one of the sources of the ultimate challenge.Horuss as Page of Void basically was an unrealized version of a similar role.Roxy as Rogue of Void steals irrelevance. This works the opposite to Vriska. When one turns her enemies into red shirts the other takes secondaryness away from others to help them stay relevant in the story. For instance by materializing the matriorb she is giving Kanaya a chance complete her arc. And by seeking to give the ring of life to Calliope she helps her come into the light.Calliope as Muse of Void essentially appears the least in the story and when she does she only influences the events through passive conversations with the main characters.

He loves his god lord english and wants to serve him and set everything up for him. But also he isnt really a character anymore the way say hivebent gamzee was a character. Hes sort of this extremely homestucky force of nature that exists to further LE  annoy people both within and outside of the comic. If thats actually good writing is another question entirely.Because the comic still isnt over there are a lot of decisions that have been made recently where I am waiting for a resolution before I comment on them in more detail believe me if vriska was right and everything goes mostly according to her plan and thats that I will have Words but one thing I do want to talk about is the absence of external recaps in act six in favor of internal recaps where a character explains events in the comic that just happened in flashes or were slowly revealed over months of updates. Really they just never work the way old recaps did. The older recaps were presented in a separate reference frame from the rest of the comic so you knew you were reading a recap and could just skip or skim the page if you wanted to. Presenting recap dumps in a pesterlog format fools you into thinking you might get something dramatic interesting or funny instead of information that was already presented. I get how recaps can be necessary I know not everyone has the weird hs knowlege brain lump that I do that makes every event understandable if not explictly explainable but presenting them in the way that he does in act  always struck a nerve.,homestuck,crf1ym5,7,t5_2rzgi

4088127,0,t3_37d6dh,In my opinion this is by far the most important peice of information that has come from this interviewgtWhy do you kill off all your characters?gtAndrew Dead characters have a funny way of sticking around in Homestuck. Its a story with a very big cast. In a big cast not everyone can be a major character or enjoy the spotlight for too long. All stories with huge casts have certain means of letting minor characters recede into the background after they stop being relevant. In HS death seems to be the line between relevance and irrelevance more than anything else. Some ghosts then struggle to stay relevant in the story but usually fail.gtThats one answer which may or may not be satisfying to you. Theres another answer that is more practical. HS is supposedly a story that is also a game. In games the characters die all the time. How many times did you let Mario fall in the pit before he saved the princess? Who weeps for these Marios. In games your characters die but you keep trying and trying and rebooting and resetting until finally they make it. When you play a game this process is all very impersonal. Once you finally win when all is said and done those deaths didnt count only the linear path of the final victorious version of the character is considered real. Mario never actually died did he? Except the omniscient player knows better. HS seems to combine all the meaningless deaths of a trialanderror game journey with the way death is treated dramatically in other media where unlike our oblivious Mario the characters are aware and afraid of the many deaths they must experience before finally winning the game.Id already suspected something similar to this but its really nice to have confirmation about it.,homestuck,crm9sd6,1,t5_2rzgi

So far Ive been mostly focusing on choosing the options that make the most powerful character but recently Ive come up with an idea that has a lot of flavor.A Summoner a class with a bit of spell casting and the ability to customize and summon their eidolon a creature whose appearance and abilities are completely up to the Summoner that is afraid of his own eidolon. His backstory is inspired by Chinese and Japanese myths. He was originally a painter but one day his paintings became so realistic that they came to life and became real. The first painting this happened with was a painting of a horrible looking demon. That painting is his eidolon. The Summoners first reaction was to flee in terror and now he is constantly scared of his eidolon which in reality bears him no ill will. It only wants to help him so he does that by staying out of sight but close enough to protect him if he needs to step into combat.,homestuck,crn3axf,1,t5_2rzgi

4233786,0,t3_39ezwm,Wow just steal it from rstevenuniverse would you? What is this rstevenuniverse you speak of?Anyway may as well make some quick theories that Ive got to get out of my head at some point. I know youre trying to stop shot posting about complaints about shitposting and I do admire your efforts. Right lets cut to the chase and put some stellar theories on the table.On HopeHope is a powerful aspect indeed which seems to represent a users active willpower to redirect a story. Not to dissimilar to Breath Hope emphasises change through a users strength of mind. An active hope player is a formidable adversary and perhaps an unstoppable one. From what we have seen of Jakes powers and what we hear through Araneas exposition Hope is a particularly powerful aspect. I believe that from what we have seen of the aspect Hope emphasises the use of mental will to manipulate the world or textual medium that one is present in. Jakes quest as the Page of Hope is to gain more willpower and stand up to others as well as standing up for them. This quest is quickly accelerated when Aranea manipulates Jakes mind allowing Jake to temporarily tap into the powers which were previously unavailable to him. Another example is Eridan who destroys the willpower of the team by hopesplodding the matriorb and thus destroying the will to succeed as well as the hope for the troll race. Hope emphasises the exertion of will over the narrative and allows individuals to change events based on desire and mental strength.,homestuck,cs2u89f,3,t5_2rzgi

4260579,0,t3_39rpnq,Was a nice day. Took a nap had Mcdonalds and chilled with my family. I played with my rats too. Summer eh? I live in Texas. Summer is  of the year. We did have a pretty cold Winter tho. Anyways I dont have much planned. Im just gonna wing it. I cracked the screen of my phone. I wanted to cry. Funny that this question is asked right after I had the most detailedhorrificreal dream last night. I dreamt that I disappeared for two years after I had to go on the run for something I did. It was so vivid I could feel the difference in myself. The worst part was when my mom and sister found me it was like they saw a ghost. My family had all moved on accepted the fact I was gone. And suddenly I was back I was different mentally and physically. Stepping back into my house was foreign and painful. All my friends had done the same as my family my pets had since become deceased rats dont live very long and no one knew how to take my arrival. I didnt feel like myself and my world was crashing down. I ran into one of my best friends and all she could say was she thought I was dead. I had my own thoughts in the dream I remember thinking about all my friends wondering what had happened to them and if they wanted to see me. I was numb.When I woke up I was scared to get out of bed. It still feels too real. ,homestuck,cs5vwy8,2,t5_2rzgi
4260948,0,t1_cs5rwah,This. In my own opinion the movie would open with Rose and John panicking in the final moments of Act . The apple falls the meteor descends cue logo. The screen displays several minutes earlier and shows us John receiving the game connecting to Rose and the early moments of the game including Roses internet troubles. Then the scene from the start plays again and the meteor hits. The view switches to WV caption years in the future but not many... as he finds the command station and sees John is perfectly alright and in the medium. He starts issuing commands to John and John is distracted by the commands as Rose is also communicating with him. The car is dropped dads kidnapping is revealed and John starts to fight minions.Several minutes earlier... is displayed again as Daves quest for his Bros discs starts after he accidentally launches his own copies out the window by throwing his sword at a crow. The view switches back and forth proceeding similarly to the comic though some cuts would be made to make it more movielike and some changes would be made like removing or simplifying sylladices up through the end of Act  then thats the end of movie one.IDK what the author of this google doc was thinking. This sorta movie wouldnt work without changes.,homestuck,cs5xeta,9,t5_2rzgi

4268678,0,t3_39umnl,it may just be that I love Vriska to a fault and if so Im sorry for this I think Vriskas involvement and reign of the group makes sense. Like on both the levels of charismaimportance AND mind control. If Vriskas been orchestrating this whole fucking debacle I wouldnt be shocked in the least. Its one of those nefarious character things like with Dr. Drakken in Kim Possible. For all intents and purposes he SHOULDNT be able to get as far as he does with his schemes but hes great with technology and apparently? has the cash to back it up. Vriska in no terms should be able to command the Alternian trolls AT ALL but unfortunately has the charisma and mind control powers to make it work. But then thinking in terms of Aranea and how nobody gave a flying fuck about her or what she was up to on Beforus it leads me to think that Vriska specifically as the edition of Serket that Vriska is is significantly more... significant? in the timeline than any Serket before her. As shitty and lame as she is and as much as it may be due to Hussies fucking selfjacking infatuation with her shes pretty fucking important in the timeline thats going on right now.

The one that combined with nepetasprite or the one who died when LOWAS exploded?The arquius that could conceivably end up with the other characters as an extra arquius would be the one who was already with the davesprite who combined with nepetasprite.I was saying that the potential extra arquius would arrive in the same way that Davesprite did by being on the LOWAS that replaced the one that exploded.The now davepetasprite davesprite was in GameOver!B as was an arquiussprite.said davesprite ended up on LOWAS and as a result ended up in the current narrative focus spacetimestorysectionThere doesnt seem to be much reason that that arquiusprite couldnt have also ended up on the same LOWAS.

So ghosts being generated every time an instance of a character dies has less to do with their actual soul and more to do with what the Horrorterrors think is going on.  It could be that they simply create a ghost copy of a players body and memories whenever they see someone die regardless of any existing copies of the player that may contain their soul. ,homestuck,ctrzl3q,2,t5_2rzgi

If Knigjts are supposed to exploit their aspect going with Aradias definition here sorry uZeroInfinity they cant create it but use what little they have to their teams benefit. Does there seem to be an absence of caring and loyalty throughout the movie? If thats true then this lack of Blood could easily be wielded by a Knight but that sounds a little to active of a role correct me if Im wrong again I havent seen the movie.

6116046,0,t3_3zb6nj,Homestuck is a singlestory webcomic. It is not an episodic story nor a daily strip nor a franchise nor any other type of narrative universe where multiple selfcontained stories take place. If anybody have suggested you start at any point in the middle they have given you bad advice. There is only one point to begin reading homestuck and that is the first panelSome FAQs Is this the right web? Yes mspaintadventures is the main web of homestuck. Some people are surprised because they have seen fanart that seemed much more professional than the official site. Do not worry if you miss characters or items you have seen in fanart either you just begin reading with one of the protagonists and will get to meet the rest later waaaaaaaay later some of them. Despite its first impression being significantly different than the average homestuck look you have not ended up in an abandoneddeprecatedunofficial site by mistake. This is the very thing that everybody else is reading. Is it very long? Yes homestuck is above  pages long. Some pages are single panels without text some are long chat conversation logs between the protagonists But cant I skip...? ABSOLUTELY NOT. No matter how pointless some things seem sometimes they all turn out to be plot relevant sooner or later. DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING. EVER. Is it always like the first pages? The first pages are boring! No both the tone the themes the art and the jokes evolve drastically along the comic. The best word to describe Homestuck progression is exponential. Literally every Act is as long and weird and convolved as all the previous Acts combined. Some readers do not like the first acts because things start extremely slow if you are one of those the general recommendation is to bear for the first hundred pages or so until the pace starts speeding up. What if I LIKE the first pages? Will it dissapoint later? Its alright the comic doesnt deny its start it builds on it to create something even better. I liked the first pages too. What if I do not want to invest time in reading to find out I do not like the later parts either. Is there some general description to know what to expect? The author created a very nice overview of what is Homestuck when he made a kickstarter for a spin off game Is there some shorter similar story? If you want to get a sense of what to expect you can read the authors previous story Problem Sleuth about  panels Is there an animated version? You can watch ColabHQs Lets Read Homestuck series if you prefer voice acting over reading. I do not understand the linkscommands that the character is doing MSpaintadventures started as a sort of PHPforum game collaborative writing exercise. The story parodies old videogames of the textbased adventure style. The users of the web used to input the commands that advanced the characters story trying to figure out the same puzzles that the protagonist finds. As the plot advanced this evolved until being completelly dropped after the first few thousand pages. More information on the format for new readers can be found here Is there any prerequisite read? There are no prerequisites although some patterns and copypasted art are running jokes referencing the previous comics of the author. You can read the earlier adventures and this will make you smile a little when you see some of their jokes repeated in homestuck but there is no plotrelevant connection. But somebody recommended that I skip... Some people enjoy being part of a fan group more than they enjoy the source material that put that group together in the first place. Would you definitely prefer to still play with toy lightsabers with your friends but never having heard of what Star Wars was and never having watched the movies? Unless the answer to this question is yes never skip any part and pay no attention to those that recommend it. I think I have figured out what comes nextam good at following stories partially have played or watched something similar have already been spoiled X Y Zsome other lameass excuse can I skip this part? NO. FUCKING. WAY. But... Go to the first page start reading keep reading in order do not ever skip anything. Do not ever deviate from this sequence of commands. That is all there is to say on the matter. You will thank me later. And when you are done reading start rereading and repeat with me Oh shit! Why didnt I notice THAT before!.youremfwelcome,homestuck,cyktxjz,59,t5_2rzgi

Like how people trace back the codification of American novels to Mark Twain people will one day trace back the codification of narrativedriven animation to Avatar The Last Airbender. Ive been coding a lot lately burning the candle at both ends to try and get a game prototype I like. Something they dont tell you about zerobudget game dev is that any time you spend working on your game instead of a retail job or whatever is crunch time. QOTD This is a weird one. My sleepdreams are usually pretty forgettable but one thats stuck with me is... theres an island sort of thing and when I first like dreamed of it there was a path thats lined with rocks and some kind of cement. On the left theres a smoothed out granite wall about the height of a single person that keeps the path inset. I think its like the donors and sponsors for whatever the path leads to thats engraved on it but its not in a language I can read. Theres a grass field behind the wall and beyond that is another wall and paved path next to a rocky beach. Water would splash against the rocks but other than that not much happens except for this one dream I had where some Free Willyass Last of the Starmakersass shit happened. I was sitting on the beach with my thengirlfriend and from the coast there was something giving off a deep rumbling sound. The dream was like directed and edited so that the something was never in plain sight and I pulled out a stretcher from wherever the fuck and my ex and I carried it to the path paved with rocks that led up the hill.

I knew about Homestuck before then but at that time you guys seemed to have a pretty bad rep. Once I started reading the comic I realized that there had to be a subreddit for this and now here I am.With my joining so late I guess I feel obligated to make up for missed time by staying here so much. Im trying to cram as much Homestuck into me as possible before the comic ends.You guys are awesome!. Theres one guy I know. Hes a bit strange to say the least. Last I heard of him he had to make a public apology to the teachers for saying that he masturbated to Hitler and  while his class was watching a documentary about WWII.We dont interact. Ever..

A couple years later I happened to see something about Dave and his Bro and I jumped on the homestuck train expecting to dive back into analyzing Abusive Older BrotherIdolizing Younger Brother dynamics in a canon that isnt dead.

Uhhh okayKyoko from Danganronpa  Chiaki from Danganronpa  Phi from Zero Escape Asuka from Evangelion Adrian Andrews from Ace Attorney Rin Tezuka from Katawa Shoujo Tali from Mass Effect and maybe... Just maybe Vriska.The difference between a waifu and a favorite character is the fact that an individual gets an actual romantic or sexual attraction to their waifuhusbando. Sometimes this evolves into fantasizing or much worse. Thats why its a guilty pleasure. I honestly believe that the way I consume media has gotten me to a point where I can use it as a supplement for actual human interaction. I legitimately felt nothing but excitement to play Danganronpa  today because the game does such a good job with its character development and making a bunch of strangers seem like your friends.

7157688,0,t3_4dk9gc,Dad. I COMPLETELY FORGOT that he was on Derse and was till relevant. I hope hes the one who kills LE.All the little shows of comfort and support the kids were giving each other helping each other up halfhugs ect... It was small but it really made me way more emotional.I started sobbing when Dirk died even though I know hes probably going to be fine due to multiple reasons it was the fact that he and Dave had their arms around each other right before it happened. Then when Dave realized he had to kill Dirk. It literally killed me.Also when Roxy fucking destroyed the Condesce. I started sobbing there too. Im also really fucking happy we wont have to worry about her in the future now or her mindcontrolling Jade.I also loved how the kids were drawn. They look like actual children and I think that fits the emotional feel of the comic at this point. The Cascade look of the kids is still my favorite but this was really good too.Didnt care for a large portion of the music though I thought Cascade was way better in that area. Also hated the Undertale reference.

7213284,0,t3_4e8skx,Game Over wasnt a video game battle it was a flash so everything was more grand and impressive. Collied is built like a video game fight specifically like the strife battles that are the series hallmark so everything is less grand more technicalgamey. Strife battles mind you are in essence a mixture of turnbased rpg battles and beatemups. Basically the difference between playing a battle in a game and watching a prerendered game cutscene. There is actually a nice example of this in Cans vs Dad. At one point he throws cream pies and the attack looks weak and silly. But then it switches to this dramatic more accuraterealistic picture of his pie throwing and it looks like those pies can really wreck some stuff up. As for Condesce not throwing planets I want to point out she only did that out necessity. Aranea threw a planet at her out of rage and the Condesce threw a planet her planet to defend herself. I dont think its something she would do if she didnt have to and it looked like it took immense concentration to do it which the kids werent giving her time to make.,homestuck,d1y3em7,3,t5_2rzgi

For example Terezi could have used her mind power maybe in conjunction with Dirk or someone else to bestow the memories of the altselves into our heroes so they would all know the sacrifices that were made and become more determined. That would also have given weight to the statements about a singular true self made by Davepeta and tied a lot of things together.Its a just a load of small missed opportunities like that that are now adding up to a lot of empty development leading to an empty feeling here at the end.,homestuck,d21wdsq,9,t5_2rzgi

Seeing his immortality eyes fail just before Vriska hit him with the jujubeam was awesome.Two things bug me a little.  First when did Caliborns masterpiece occur and tied in with that how did he get that ring?

7269907,0,t3_4ey87u,For me its not so much anger nor dissapointment but rather a lack of fulfillment.Its not like Mass Effect s ending in which you felt like nothing that happened prior really mattered or Neon Genesis Evangelions ending that was just plain weird. Its just the plot threads which are still hanging and Im really hoping the epilogue can wrap them up.As far as finishing the main plot Act  did a pretty good job all things considered the whole pool analogy really felt nice the animation was pretty damn awesome and my personal theory is that by finishing the game the events of Caliborns Masterpiece do not have to occur at all due to the kids no longer being subject to the temporal laws of Sburb. I mean from that point of view the only real problem I have is Vriska going backwards in terms of character development without any consequences. I stand by my opinion that the only good Vriska is a dead Vriska.Thing is when your webcomic goes on for  years you accumulate a lot of plot threads and its really jarring for them not to be resolved. But considering the epilogue of the last MS Paint Adventure I have faith in Hussie to wrap them up in a reasonably satisfying manner.,homestuck,d24jelk,5,t5_2rzgi

7281451,0,t3_4f2aku,I love Slick as a character hes the only guy Ive ever cosplayed actually but I personally I think the negative reaction to his death is all a little overblown for a couple of reasons. . Yes the Jacks arent all exactly the same. But Davepeta made it pretty clear that they all share a single indivisible soul. Any differences in personality and experiences no matter how seemingly radical in nature are still kinda superficial.They are all fundamentally the same dude deep down except for Lord Jack seeing as his soul was presumably overpowered by Caliborns. So A little bit of Spades Slick survives in B Jack. . Yeah Spades Slick is usually an antihero not an outright villain. But lets get real this dude greets people with stabs. He loves killing. Its part of his charm. His utter lack of charm also part of his charm. Even if he hadnt been provoked I cant think of any reason he wouldnt have tried to fuck the kids up once he was done with Lord Jack except maybe selfpreservation. And possibly fondness for Karkat. ,homestuck,d25up75,1,t5_2rzgi

7281907,0,t1_d25v9ct,Well I still have my original PS as well and it still works. Theyre pretty well built so unless you dropped it several times I actually yanked mine off a bureau once or twice it should be fine. The memory card issue however is difficult to get around. You could always get the emulator PCSX and try playing the ROM.One thing I didnt know about the game was that it reviewed poorly since as I said it wasnt as polished as say Jak amp Daxter even though it came out the same year as its sequel. I still thought it was a good game but then I tend to be easily entertained. Another game series Id recommend is the Persona series if you havent already given it a try. I personally like Persona  the best since it has a murder mystery plot.As for learning to enjoy things when they arent going the way youd like them its probably one of the best skills in life. On that topic Id encourage you to think about why learning not just classroom learning mind you is fun. It may seem at first that Im crazy when I say that but do you ever feel like the second or third time through a game or a book is better than the first? Probably not and thats because youre not learning anything new when you do it. Just remember that every failure is a new opportunity to learn and a new opportunity for success. Itll take some time to get thinking that way but once you do youll be able to rebound faster and have more passion for things you didnt think youd be passionate about. Case in point Ive always been good at math but I never liked it until grad school.Edit I hope you dont mind the text wall.

7282883,0,t1_d25uv4v,Yeah unfortunately  the only way it would work is if a lot of things didnt change. I was thinking maybe a story based game could work where you control four different characters throughout the game. Maybe switch back and forth between characters so not everything has to be done linearly. Unfortunately that would require most things to be static always have the same lands same aspects etc. Name and appearance could be changed since thats not a big deal to Sburb.

7308652,0,t3_4fgxf6,I actually got quite a lovely vibe from Davepeta. Davesprite had a huge issue not knowing what his purpose is. It derives from his existence as yet another Dave. Time as an aspect is tricky because you get very confronted with yourself and your actions but it makes you lose your sense of self. You get lost in the fabric of time if youre not the alpha one and you feel like your existence is lacking. See Davesprite a Dave who gets to keep existing alongside the alpha Dave but not the main Dave.Heart on the other hand is all about that connection to the self and the many iterations that exist. Heart is an excellent complimentary aspect to Time in that respect and Nepeta carries her aspect so well. Nepetas personality and aspect were the missing pieces to Davesprite and the one reason he could feel like... like a person by himself. The Heart aspect along with Nepetas expressionate and uppity personality made him whole. They formed such a strong character and I wish they actually showed up a lot earlier!

Characters also act in accordance with the values of their role even without using flashy abilities tied to it. Bros molding of Dave is in a way an erosion of Daves own self.As for why Davesprite doesnt use timetravel Im not sure. I feel like its less that he couldnt and more that he didnt want to?

But Rose just kinda shot beams at Condy we didnt see her use her powers to guide everybody to victory.

Retroactively all of this would be normal things to complain about if youd actually lived them but it almost seems in Daves nature that his past would have such a huge impact on him that in an emotion filled conversation with Dirk those are the sorts of things a real person would bring up even though none of them are real in the first place.,homestuck,d2o5jqd,1,t5_2rzgi

Namely because shed been such an asshole for the entire year before said ending and never got scolded even once for it. Hell certified nice person John Egbert who previously told ghost Vriska that he didnt like and couldnt trust her praised alive Vriska for being so good at planning while completely ignoring her being nasty to his friends I guess.

While S is what were currently in and is ahead of the books the showrunners have said that although they know what is going to happen in the stilltobereleased books the show wont spoil that stuff because it has a different story.I dont know exactly how much control GRRM has over it but hes a busy guy and has made the occasional comment that would suggest that he isnt very happy with the show. So most people think he doesnt have much control and even if he did he doesnt have the time to watch over it because hes too busy writing his books.As good a writer as the guy is and as socially conscious as he is ASOIAF has some fantastic explorations of things such as the patriarchy its difficult to imagine him being anything other than disappointed with the show.,homestuck,d3ffieh,4,t5_2rzgi

7731923,0,t1_d3kvenp,I mean of course people put weight on stuff that happened in acts ! Acts  made up half the comic were many peoples favorite part of the comic and had much higher density in terms of what we see happening. Compare this to a couple of conversations stretched over three incomic years and yeah  even though the three years would be weightier in the real world the fact is that nobody likes major dynamics changing offscreen and thats basically what the Yellow YardMeteor Journey was. Im sorry but even if its more realistic for none of the earlygame ships to be endgame its way less narratively satisfying for them to be replaced mostly by stuff that had littletono onscreen buildup. Although Ill freely admit that my opinion may be unfairly skewed there since I never noticed any of the sexual tension you mentioned between Dave and Karkat in act  while I could have sworn every conversation between Dave and Jade was dripping with them working well together.

7744839,0,t1_d3m6imb,I think a big part of the reason that the communities for these shows latch on to a certain female character to hate is because all of these CW shows seem to have a quota of relationship drama that needs to be fulfilled which these people dont want to see and I find tends to be poorly written and often relies on the heros love interest to behave irrationally. Even if these characters arent the sole problem with the show or even very awful characters they become representative of the relationship drama that brings the shows down at least for these viewers Im sure that for others its one of the big draws.

I also caught a bunch more pokemon that I was missing and I think the only route left that I havent caught every possible Pokemon on is Victory Road. After that its just evolving all the ones I can. I know I cant complete the Pokedex though since I dont have access to anyone with Pokemon X and that renders Xerneas uncatchable and unseeable for me. I did have an infuriating encounter with Politoed today though.  encounter rate and the first thing it does is use Perish Song which means both it and my Pokemon will faint in three turns. Its also lvl  so trying to catch it with a Quick Ball is quite difficult. It took me  hours to see my first one and I wasnt able to catch it due to Perish Song. Then on my very next fishing attempt I GET ANOTHER ONE! And this one got caught in a Ultra Ball at full health while asleep. I cant believe how unlucky I was at first and then how lucky I got right at the end. I also spent a long time Probably  hours of using sweet scent for this one capturing Sudowoodo since it was a  encounter rate in a horde but at least nothing there tried to suicide on me.NONPOKEMON NEWSYou checked this section but there wasnt anything of interest here.ToTD Ive only watched a few episodes with friends. It seems like a good show but I think it would be better if the episodes were  minutes instead of .  minutes is tough to write a compelling story for without sacrificing some kind of suspense and  must be nearly impossible to do this with. That said I should probably start watching it.QoTDCATCHING THAT DAMN POLITOED! But seriously its probably this If you can go through this video without laughing thats quite a feat though not one that you should be particularly proud of.QoTD Strangely enough a bowl of pasta at Olive Garden.

You couldnt just put a small slab of butter on top of it wait for it to melt and then mix it around a bit? Instead you think I want butterpasta soup? And this from a place that has pasta as one of its specialties. I really thought theyd know how to make plain pasta with butter but apparently unless you have olive oil gazillions of spices and meatballs on it they dont know how to do it.They do however make a GREAT Five Cheese Ziti.

If they wanted the session to fail they would turn on their allies as soon as god tiered and if not directly dealt with they could find many ways to fuck the session even if not wearing god pajamas. Believe me a dangerous player needs to be dealt with before its dange is game breaking. BUT if someone like the Witch of Heart or Blood is on good terms with the rest of the team and want the session to end well then they can corrupt the dangerous elements minds to bind their souls either via friendship of by any other boundry to the rest of the team to prevent them from killing everybody. They would still be able to fuck the session to doomed realm without hurting anybody tho.,homestuck,d3qkfxd,1,t5_2rzgi
7780809,0,t1_d3qfwzu,I dont disagree with your idea but that carries more over to the human and emotional side of things. Understanding the self is an emotional basis this theory is based on a more mechanical look. It examines people as pieces in a larger machinegame and what their role is to the game. Hence idea the that breath is the difficulty setting controls of the game. And then focuses on how Breaths freedom relates to that. The inspiration and freedom arent like mutual ideas really the same one since inspiring others to action is little different from freeing people to lead themselves. Either way in the end they make things easier for everyone in their session.Also not quite on the alpha kid session as said by Rose when the beta kids arrive she said it will become a new session entirely one undocumented and unprecedented. Basically you can divide the Alpha session into two components. Prebeta void session which required a life hope heart and void player...and postbeta totally newtype of session which was so complex it required...A hope rage blood  space  life players  light players  void players  time players  breath players etc... if victory was to come.,homestuck,d3qm3bx,2,t5_2rzgi

7799849,0,t1_d3soyay,It is pretty clear to me it didnt culminate in a relationship because they were too busy fighting over Terezi and thus removing her from the romantic playing field allowed them to grow closer. As I said before I saw enough hints in the preretcon timeline to see them as a viable ship before I ever knew about them becoming canon whereas I had never shipped them before. There is nothing clearly platonic about it to me it is up to interpretation and there is enough evidence to argue that they had some unresolved romantic tension. I do agree that it seemed like she didnt interact with them at all postretcon which is really confusing and sad to me because they would still have been good friends as she is important to them both. I always thought it was the vague wording of you dont need him that made her assume she needed to stay away from all the boys entirely just to be safe. But the question is did preretcon Terezi intend for herself to take it this way? If so then why? In any case I hope Terezi Dave and Karkat get to actually hangout in the epilogue.,homestuck,d3srig4,1,t5_2rzgi

And then you go on to say something about how he isnt actually bi because then people would have a reason to ship him and jade?ampnbspI think if the artist did mention the fact that he was gay youd probably take it as some sort of attack anyway based on everything else youve said.ampnbspI mean who else would she go after? even then she went after davepeta whos nonbinary so that point really doesnt make sense as a whole.ampnbspshe never asked him to break up with karkat she just didnt care and was forcing herself upon him which Im not even sure is really that relevant actually.ampnbspfixed him back to the nondescript white. Id definitely say it was racist if she changed him to another race but thats not the case. now let me ask you something if dave had been Caucasian in the comic would you have called that racist?ampnbspI think I got what you meant for most of this right but if I got something wrong feel free to correct me on any o your points.,homestuck,d45g2wi,1,t5_2rzgi

8022110,0,t1_d4hhf5r,Though there will always be slight differences for example sollux had two dream selves. If all players decided the wanted to do this then both moons would have  player towers. Not to mention someone would need to work on hiding the second quest beds in the land quite well.I think its also worth mentioning all planets can be destroyed moved and manipulated. This may require extra work and as previously mentioned a standalone server to have the capacity to hold the extra data. We cant afford for such a massive game to be laggy.Pfft. Hopefully this game when done will turn into the portal for the real sburb then game creation will be way easier with alchemy.Ah alchemy! I feel we would need quite a large art and programing team to keep up with the constant expansion. Not only this but we may have to add more complexity to alchemy systems if we use all possible codes. Some items may have to be creatable only to players who new game or something. Maybe they get an extra row of numbers and a new machine for said alchemy.Of course that would be far far from now many many years if we made this big enough.,homestuck,d4hrdz3,1,t5_2rzgi

I used to ship KarRezi before I gave into Davekat and before that SolKat.So its like I said last time this was brought up ship what you like but dont shame others for shipping something you dont ship.

8198390,0,t3_4rm23y,Today was fine just a standard day. Woke up late wasted time yadda yadda yadda. Watched a lot of Youtube videos today mainly Vinesauce stuff. I should probably start taking care of my backlog since its vacation time. I mean I know I have two months to do that but if I keep putting it off theyll pass in no time. Then I came to the stream and... where do I start. Maybe with some backstory.Okay so a while ago there was an Emotebot a fake bot that only communicated in emotes. The next day it malfunctioned spewing glitchy messages and even getting an emote named after itself. Fast forward to a few days ago when a new bot showed up MIMEBOT copying any messages it sees.And now we get to what happened today The Mimebot returned but this time the admins took it upon themselves to try and break the bot. Spam ensued. when I came in the bot was barely able to keep up We managed to defeat the bot but after a short time it came back with a vengeance. MIMEBOT as it was now known also copied all messages but it also made random sentences out of them kinda like a Markov chain. It didnt survive long. However it then came back again as MiEMEBOT and started reposting the whole chatlog timemarks and all. As you can imagine things went pearshaped very quickly. I even lost my connection at one point. Anyway the bot left after a while so we drank... and it came back AGAIN. This time it was focusing on specific users starting with me and later moving on to babybowser. It even changed its name to include ours! Anyway after that had been dealt with the Emotebot came back. It said its the first and last bot and that yannastg is everyone. It then said it had to go because it was banned from these lands but also that it was good being there. And so it left. But after a while a user named GODyanna showed up. Unfortunately they didnt say muchsup no tahnks thanks when asked for an explanation and byr after which they left. I feel like I mightve been responsible for that since I added the loadofshit around that time. Then the person behind it all showed up named SORRY. They came to well say sorry. They wanted to apologize for those events saying that they only wanted to give us hope even though hope for yannas return is dead it was still appreciated We reassured them they dont have to apologize after which they left. Oh and a few hours later a new bot called HSCSPBOT showed up but I told them to try again some other time since I was the only active person at the time.Anyway tomorrow looks like its going to be a pretty grand day so looking forward to that!TOTD Ive seen some posts about it on the sub but I havent read it yet. I should probably do that sometime.AOTD Joel has a pretty good laugh and I remember Raocow had a good one too. Theres also SomecallmeJohnnys evil laugh which even became a minor meme within his fanbase for a while. Oh and JonTrons laugh is quite great. And someone here mentioned King Harkinian the best character from the CDi Zelda games who also has a pretty good laugh.AOTD As mentioned above tomorrow is shaping up to be pretty grand. Im also looking forward to buying a pool too. And maybe going out for pizza sometime? I dunno. Ill update this if I remember something its very late and I should be in bed now. Good night everyone!  EDIT Okay now I remember my brothers visiting today!! I dont know how long hell be staying but still.also this is just a complete shower thought but I think Jades words would taste like lime.

Excalibur was a sword of justice hope and righteousness.Excalibur is nonetheless a sword which fits destruction. Calliope did foresee calamity when Skaia began to cloud over.gt Can you please list further questions.  I will do my best to answer them.  Although events to transpire after act  past Calliope require some more time and musing.I personally dont have any more questions about canon. So Im asking you to list off questions about canon that consensus interpretation doesnt answer and this theory does. Things like who flipped the frog switch? which Im happy to just let be as WV playing around offpanel or something like that.gt But they wouldnt be a true god on the level or surpassing the old gods of the  player session.Wasnt that just a random joke from Hussie?gt This is why I didnt want to oversell her powers if she is in fact a lord of space.  Its quite possible she had no way of leaving the bubble or navigating the furthest ring until either Calliope and Jade found her first or Lord English destroyed enough dream bubbles to create a target in the center for the green sun.The fact that Space players can navigate the Furthest Ring is an immutable fact I am stating for the record. If there are exceptions they need to be established in canon or actually argued for rather than just asserted. The same applies to dream bubbles being able to trap people.gt She already had the discs to start the game in the first place.  Summoning them was like retrieving something from a sylladex but using god powers and more flarepardon the pun.  The expansion pack was nothing more but an expansion pack for disc .

Dirk has so many interests and while he also had a lot more technological advancements to work with there were still plenty of things for Bro to have pursued in addition to his main interest. Dave was also really young when all of this shit started lets be real  is practically a fucking baby in a lot of respects so I wouldnt be surprised if it turned out Bro was also managing some shady deep web BitCoin services on the side and Dave just had absolutely no idea about it.

From likely being able to bend time to being able to wither away anything to even CONTROLLING THE ALPHA TIMELINE to an extent theyd be a valuable ally. Its entirely possible in fact that the Alpha Timeline will instantly change itself so that the Heir of Time doesnt die.Now there are downsides. First off as upokemonfreak stated many things about their progression are out of their control. In addition Heirs of Time will have TONS of responsibility. Theyll probably need to do ectobiology theyll probably have to go back and fix tons of little things to make sure things go as planned and Ill bet that theyll need to go make so many stable time loops its not even funny.Buy overall an Heir of Time at full potential would be a powerful teammate helping their allies through the toughest of situations.,homestuck,d6qnt9x,2,t5_2rzgi

I also remember the sale ending on monday so it will probably end at the end sorry for the repetition of the week whatever week it is. My advice is to buy it the istant you are able to. I got the money to buy it only one day after the sale ended...Once you buy the music you should be able to download it as many times as you want. After you buy them you can download whatever album you want as many times as you want so a backup shouldnt be necessary. If you are afraid of someone stealing your account which would be the only way to steal your music or lose it for that matter then you can do a backup but I personally think its unecessary. The only other thing I think you should know its the fact that you will be able to do a Bandcamp account which I think is necessary in order to download the songs only AFTER you buy something they will ask you to do an account right after your first purchase not before.Also youll have to pay taxes in order to buy it. I know its bullshit but what can we do about it.I think this is all you should know. Have a good day!,homestuck,d97dvnd,3,t5_2rzgi

9795713,0,t1_dakex2l,Cohen has stated that Hussie is the only person who wrote the comic up through the credits. The snaps  are written by Shelby and Cohen but Roxycal was a thing  in the credit snaps which Hussie  wrote and drew on his own. Plus Hussie probably has to approve everything they post.Also where are people getting that Hussie is tired of Homestuck? Hes  probably just tired  of the fanbase and the large degree of work involved not the story or characters itself.  Hes  kicked around the idea of doing more with the Homestuck universe albiet in a format other than a serial comic.It is a ridiculous  theory because it assumes Hussie himself isnt  interested in including LGBT  relationships in his comic which obviously isnt the case given the sheer number of them and the fact that theres an entire race of bisexual aliens in the story. Cohen and Shelby cant  have pressured  him into something that was conceptualized  long before either of them even read the comic.You went to great lengths to prove that you and Cookie werent  advocating this rumor but here you are arguing in favor of it as a possibility.,homestuck,dakj7hn,2,t5_2rzgi

10069264,0,t3_5jyrjs,Okay so INCREDIBLY OBVIOUS OBSERVATIONS WITH ENIGMAThis facility is being used to calibrate the moon laser for the moons reshaping. This is NOT the rebel base or whatever. This is however an assassination attempt.The laser will be fired soon and Jane is right where its going to be fired. Would she survive a death laser? I mean honestly its not out of the question. Would her death be just if she didnt? It certainly wouldnt be heroic. Random teleportation murders are usually pretty safe when youre God Tier and this is one of those.Motives Clearly the perpetrators of this act are Trolls or at least want people to think theyre trolls. IIRC Jane is a monarch of the Human Kingdom? And theyre being set up to die at the hands of the Carapaceans. This seems like some outside agent possibly troll possibly someone else entirely is trying to arrange a war between the Human and Carapacean kingdoms. If the perps are not themselves trolls they want people to think the trolls are also behind it in which case theyre angling for a threeway war.In any case we know how much Jack loves setting up cities on the moon so its no surprise that hes here. I find it interesting that theyre playing up the Jack as a product of circumstances angle that the two universes Jacks are fundamentally the same person and the circumstances of his life are what caused one to become Spades Slick while the other became The CancerBec Noir. I was under the impression that B Jack was fundamentally more dangerous than A Jack due to The Cancer and it becoming Terminal but its increasingly appearing that its entirely a product of the events surrounding him not any influence upon who he actually is.,homestuck,dbk1qc4,8,t5_2rzgi

10300462,0,t3_5nffvq,I started reading in early  possibly late  dont remember exactly. I had just finished reading through Vattu as much as was completed at that time so I guess like midway through book  and was looking for another longform comic to fill the empty void. The funny thing is I was looking for something epic and I guess vaguely fantasyish with really great artwork. So I looked around saw a bunch of recommendations for HS went to the site looked at the first page thought this looks stupid and left. I did that a few times after failing to find any other comics that captured my interest occasionally clicking through a few pages before again deciding that the comic was too sillylamewhatever and navigating away.Then one day for whatever reason I said fuck it and pushed through and got sucked in. I think it was the beginning of Act  the walkaround where I really started to think damn this is really good and not at all what I expected it to be. I blazed through the thing fast like ridiculously fast and as a result I barely understood a bunch of the things that were happening. I ended up missing a lot of key things as well as just outright skipping some stuff not intentionally Im just a dumbass but even with that selfimposed handicap I absolutely loved it. Then I find the MSPA wiki read the article on Cascade realized I hadnt understood a fucking thing and reread the comic about half a dozen times each time picking up stuff I hadnt before. Then the Gigapause ended and I was there to see the one page go up and the subsequent crashing of the site and subsequenter taking down of the page and even subsequenterer the reuploading. Then I got to be a serial reader for a while which was a ton of fun especially for Game Over waiting the whole day for AAI then AAA  I later on.Oh and I loved Act .Then I made a reddit account just to answer this question.,homestuck,dcbm2zh,6,t5_2rzgi

The only way to have a true toolassisted run is if you somehow knew everything that was going to happen in a session and programmed some sort of tool in order to complete the session for you similar to what dirk did during S Unite Synchronize except even more effectively since Dirk only had a general idea of what needed to be done while someone who had groundhog day powers would know exactly what needs to be done.

10703133,0,t1_ddj38ng,. amp . are the same complaint you just personally dont believe theyre romantic. And I can see why between the way presumed Trump supporter Andrew Hussie wrote them and the short and pretty weird on screen interactions as a couple. But refusing to acknowledge lesbian poly OT ships just because theyre poorly written creates a double standard where anyone no matter how good or bad they are as a writer is allowed to include straight monogamous ships in their writing but only a small minority of good writers or even people who just understand what a real date is like are allowed to write non heteronormative ships. And with the small amount of representation such ships get already cutting out the majority of writers from having them is simply unacceptable. I hope that once JaneRoxyCalliope is explicitly confirmed you can look back on this reaction and do some soul searching to determine why you had such an opposition to the idea. Homestuck characters even god tier ones need to breathe air in order to live Space does not have air. The exception to this is Cherubs who live in space naturally and do not have to breathe at all.Conversely anyone can breathe in the space of the Incipisphere even if theyre a regular human instead of an SBURB player. The closest any normal character ever got to surviving in real space was Jade while grabbing the Earth and that would have only lasted a few seconds before hopping back into the session.,homestuck,ddjy5sw,1,t5_2rzgi

10812786,0,t3_5umrak,This is pretty fucking stupid if true. Honestly I dont really have much faith in What Pumpkin as a company considering how poorly they have handled PR in the past but frankly this is just too far. Now to be fair there are good reasons to shut down fangames like this such as protecting your IP so that it doesnt set a precedent causing it to fall into public domain but even if theres a good reason its pretty fucking low of them to send a cease and desist with a  day timer without even contacting the people running the project especially since theyre huge fans of the source material and would be willing to cooperate if What Pumpkin actually gave enough of a shit to get in touch. In fact the people making the overseer project repeatedly tried to get in contact with WP to ask permission and never recieved a response. For them to never get any sort of response whatsoever for a long time and then get a cease and desist order is just despicable business practices. For a company owned by Hussie who has anticorporation themes in his work this is hypocritical at best.      I have a lot of respect for Andrew Hussie and a number of the people employed at What Pumpkin. I really hope that this behaviour doesnt sit right with at least some of them. Im hoping that as such someone in the company will take action to rectify this situation or at the very least give us a good reason as to why they are behaving in this way. If not and if this turns out to be true I will lose pretty much all of the respect I have left for What Pumpkin and everyone who works there and allows themselves to be implicit in this behaviour.,homestuck,ddv9gsh,51,t5_2rzgi

11588766,0,t1_dg9kmvd,!!! I know almost exactly what the problem is. ABJ inherited the AuthorBots the next session you simulate is the child of the current session code.  Which is to say everything is deterministic. So if you happen to find an upuntilnow theoretical incestuous Mobius  multisession reach around it will just keep chasing its own tail oroboros style.  A sessions greatgreatgreatX grandchild is responsible for creating it Like a PARADOX!???. And so the AuthorBotJunior gets caught in a loop visiting the same sessions over and over again. Obviously this is more likely to be a problem with ABJ than the AuthorBot cause youre pretty unlikely to wait around for the AuthorBot to come back from  sessions. Ive upgraded ABJ to go to a random next session instead of trying to find its offspring it wouldnt even be the right offspring anyways cause the session hasnt actually DONE anything to really modify the universe frog.Also Congrats on finding such a weird fucking thing in paradox space.,homestuck,dg9le96,1,t5_2rzgi

11683533,0,t3_666hhu,I encountered a bit of a bug with combo sessions. This one in particular was with a X Combo Session I found with the Rare Session thing. The third session failed and gave me the option to do one thing and whichever option I decided on it reloaded the page for just the third session but it bugged out after the Time player ascended the God tiers to SEEING iDOG and wouldnt generate any more of the story EDIT Probably seems to be because of interactions with preceeding session players. In the non time shenaniganed version immediately after this the player that God tiered talked with the time player of one of the preceeding players which didnt appear post shenanigan. Anyways the seed of that session is . Also it seems sometimes in combo sessions some of the characters talk to dead players when they reach the new session? The dead player doesnt respond but it seems weird they talk to the dead player anyways.  Not sure if its a bug but its kind of funny and also kind of sad either way. Speaking of funny things its somewhat comedic when someone has numerous crushes but gets rejected by all or most of them. Heck Ive even seen one where they finally find someone that likes them back but the one whos been rejected loads of times up until that point break up with them not much later.Another thing is what are the possibilities of Void sessions being added? Im not sure if they naturally occur in canon or if the Alpha Kids sessions didnt make some of them time and space players because Skaia knew the Beta Kids were coming and would bring along the necessary things or if that was just an odd outlier as far as void sessions went. It seems to be implied as the latter though so idk. If this is implemented Ive not seen one yet as every session Ive seen generated has had a space and time player. Anyways either way this is really cool. I ran into a session in the one of previous version where pretty much everybody had a crush on the Witch haha. Sorry for the numerous super long paragraphs I will never be able to write short comments P I even removed an entire section on Dead sessions just to make this not a thesis and its STILL longer than the OP haha,homestuck,dgkcgbx,2,t5_2rzgi
