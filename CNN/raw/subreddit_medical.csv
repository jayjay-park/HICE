43353,0,t3_1ukx7y,I would get it checked out by a physiotherapist physical therapist for ligament rupture or tarsal dome lesion. It sounds like you have some residual instability causing some impingement maybe at the frontoutside part of your foot OR when you rolled it you smacked some of the bones together causing a small lesion on the smooth bone surface. I would recommend visiting your physio for an assessment... You may need something as simple as a strengtheningstretching program to ensure that nothing is too tightweak,medical,cejd823,1,t5_2r1b9

Ive wanted to try them for a long while but THC never had the intended effects for me so here are some alternatives.Seasonings to her tastes are good meal replacement drinks are great. The foods she likes and the foods that personally agree with her will be important as well as having quick meals ready to go at any time.

325117,0,t1_cfefp41,Thank you for the thorough response. I feel that I should let you know that I am only a medical student and that I am not qualified to make a diagnosis. Unfortunately the only real advice I will be able to give is to go and see a physician. That being said I may be able to think of some plausible etiologies that you can explore with your doctor.For now I have some more questions. They may seem a bit unorthodox so bear with me.Would you say that you feel constipated? You mentioned that sometimes you feel as if not all the fecal material has been expelled and that upon digital insertion into the anus some feces was still present. Do you ever feel as if you are straining abnormally hard when defecating? Does your feces appear very compact dark and hard as far as you can tell? Do you feel some sort of discomfort prior to defecation that dissipates following your bowel movement?Do you have a significant amount of perianalperineal a.k.a. around your taint and anus hair? How dense is it? Do you find pieces of feces getting stuck in said hair? Did the wet wipes help? When you finish wiping do you still notice significant amounts of feces on the tissue paper?You mentioned sweating. Do you feel as if you sweat an abnormal amount? Is your underwear soaked through after a typical day? If so what about your pants? Do you sweat primarily around your genitals or is just diffuselyeverywhere?This may seem silly and obvious but when you shower how do you clean your anus? What type of soap do you use?You mentioned occasional sharp pains when you defecate  can you elaborate? Are the pains associated with anything else? Do you ever feel nauseous? Lightheaded? Colicky intestinal pains? Do you feel bloated? Any problems with dairy products? Any abdominal tenderness?How much water do you drink a day? How much fluid in general? You said that your diet is geared toward I presume increasing muscle mass  what sort of supplements do you use?Your esophageal ulcers definitely puts up some flags but Im not sure how or even if they are related. Do you know what pills the doctor gave you to help with the ulcers? Does anyone in your family have a history of autoimmune disorders? Or a history of gastroenterological issues? Really any familial diseases high blood pressure cancer diabetes etc. at all? Sorry for all of the questions...just trying to flesh out your circumstances as best I can.,medical,cfegw39,8,t5_2r1b9

502775,0,t1_cfvuan5,thanks for the info i work in retail in regards to sales in electronics and I deal with douchey patients all the time who have so many questions. What they told me for this job is that I work in is I check people in deal with insurance phone calls all that stuff. I have pretty good people skills. I am working in urgent care like a small hospital I guess you can say. I am using this as just a stepping stone to get my foot in healthcare since I grad from college with a neuroscience degree but not exactly sure what i wanna do atm maybe dentistry or somewhere in the hospital. Plus I wanna take a break from school make some money and gain some experience while im at it. I literally finished my  years uni about  or  months ago and just been working retail Im prob gonna start taking some classes for fun to jog my mind again. But yeah this is deff not what I want to do for the rest of my life just a learning experience stepping stone for something better. The pay they told me is pretty good about  starting  if I knew insurance an hour plus overtime if I get called in which is half my pay on top of it. I am only  and seems like alot of work but I cant work retail forever need a job I can be proud of. Whats your thoughts on it? Is it too much for a  year old? I thought I did really well in my interview so I will have to wait for a call back if they want me. If they dont I dont know what I will do with my life at the moment since I am getting tired of retail and my life isnt really moving. I prob plan on doing this for a year and a half or less I feel like it would be really good for my resume and a great learning experience. THen prob go back to school ,medical,cfxf3bg,1,t5_2r1b9

855547,0,t3_23wmah,Edema swelling in the lower legs is a common response to standing for several hours continuously. Its pooling of fluid from cardiovascular circulation that has been subjected to gravity. Try taking breaks to sit with your feet elevated. You may also consider compression stockingssocks AKA ted hose for long shifts to prevent swelling and over the longer term to prevent spider veins and varicose veins.  Other than prolonged standing the primary cause of circulatory edema is heart failure. If you are young and healthy this is highly unlikely.

It sounds like he experienced a stroke and the pain is an unfortunate result. The nail clubbing could be a result of long standing heart or lung disease. He really should quit smoking but at this point it may be that quitting and even medical treatment may be redundant at this point. Medications can manage symptoms but cannot undo damage that has already occurred. If your father complains of increased eye pain with loss of vision he should go to the ER to save his vision. If he has any numbness or tingling he should go to the ER. I wish I could give you comforting news but the likelihood of this being a benign situation with your fathers risk factors is low. He seems decided on his choices frightening as they are to you and I think you should should sit down and write out an advanced directive. Not saying hes going to die tomorrow or something like that for all we know he could live  more years but trust me when I say you want to have hashed out these decisions BEFORE you need to know the answers.

Perhaps if you let his office know about this problem if you can get the backup from the board hell continue to treat you for a few more weeks. Beyond this you cant make him treat you. If you were using insurance you could complain to them but that isnt the case. So anything beyond this means you will be out of meds shortly. Granted that means if you are dysfunctional you can sue him if he broke the law but that takes time. Look into the affordable care act and your schools insurance plans immediately.

2778914,0,t1_cnjyb0d,ampampamp Lucid dream sfw gtgtA lucid dream is any dream in which one is aware that one is dreaming. In relation to this phenomenon Greek philosopher Aristotle observed often when one is asleep there is something in consciousness which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream.  One of the earliest references to personal experiences with lucid dreaming was by MarieJeanLon Marquis dHervey de Saint Denys gtThe person most widely acknowledged as having coined the term is Dutch psychiatrist and writer Frederik Willem van Eeden .          In a lucid dream the dreamer has greater chances to exert some degree of control over their participation within the dream or be able to manipulate their imaginary experiences in the dream environment.    Lucid dreams can be realistic and vivid.  It is shown that there are higher amounts of beta frequency band Hz brain wave activity experienced by lucid dreamers hence there is an increased amount of activity in the parietal lobes making lucid dreaming a conscious process. gtSkeptics of the phenomenon suggest that it is not a state of sleep but of brief wakefulness.   Others point out that there is no way to prove the truth of lucid dreaming other than to ask the dreamer.  Lucid dreaming has been researched scientifically with participants performing predetermined physical responses while experiencing a lucid dream.  gtgtImage iInteresting Prelucid dream | Aarab Zaraq  Lucid Dreaming | Lucid Dreams | Atlantis Lucid Dreaming Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcnjybp oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecnjybp.

2957244,0,t3_2tw5z9,We just talked about this in class. There is Alternative medicine  which is a replacement for actual evidence based medicine. Example Eating Tiger testicles instead of taking antibiotics.There is Complimentary medicine which is just an addon to western medicine. So this would be like taking fish oil or herbal teas along with your antibiotics. When complimentary medicine is low risk no side effects including very low cost the placebo effect can be helpful. It gives the patient a sense of satisfaction and well being.Try to get your mom to follow her docs advice while ALSO doing the natural stuff. Tell her Mom do what the oncologist said AND take the supplements  it will give you the best of both worlds  and in reality it will by the placebo effect since  of that stuff has no actual pharmacological action.

5153635,0,t1_cv72lyw,I am a chiropractor and would agree that SOME chiros out there only adjust the spine and still follow the subluxation theory. With that being said myself and the majority of chiropractors out there do not adhere to this old theory it is not taught where I went to school it is mentioned as part of our past and nothing more. A competent chiropractor would assess the wrist arm and function of all the joints and muscles while doing a physical exam that would entail orthopaedic and neurological testing for a condition such as this. To say all chiropractors adhere to the subluxation theory is ignorant of the profession and healthcare in general. Those chiropractors are looked down upon in the profession in fact we dislike them very much as they are the reasons we are all put under the same umbrella  which your response shows of no fault of your own besides not looking more into the profession and taking the time to learn more about it. I would say there is nothing wrong with going to a chiropractor for this condition provided it is one that does not follow the subluxation model but one who is trained in Active Release Techniques these docs are more into sports and therefore more likely to be someone I would recommend a sports chiropractor. Science based medicine is notorious for antichiropractic propaganda and not a reputable source whatsoever. If you are in the medical profession I would encourage you to find some chiropractors out there to shadow or just talk to.

Then check the consistency. Dandruff tends to be flaky dry or generally a bit sticky if her head is greasy. If you get a pasty material however then its likely the fungal infection you speak of.Theres multiple things that can cause this if it isnt a fungal infection but it sounds like to me and I am not a doctor. However I do have a history of dandruff and was worried about this that your sister may have malassezia. Certain changes in your sisters body can cause oils to secrete from her scalp and this fungus loves it. Itll feed on the oils and cause irritation. That irritation causes the scalp to flake and causes a huge wash of dandruff aswell.You may want to read this article. I also personally use Head and Shoulders in itll say pyrithione zinc under the title and it greatly reduced my dandruff. Its almost gone currently from this shampoo.

At  weeks I was at the development of  weeks but when my mom went back i was still at the same development of  weeks they did an ultrasound before the DampC and there was no heartbeat.

First you lose sodium because you are expelling fluids in multiple ways and second you are replacing that lost volume with water which has no salt in it. The result is that you are hyponatremic the percentage of sodium in your blood is low.But if its just a minor cold then these things really dont happen to any extreme degree. What is probably happening is that you arent eating enough which is making you lightheaded and you happen to like salty food.

Youre  and this problem will get solved one way or another with many decades left to have a great life.Please dont try to remove them yourself.  Im generally supportive of DIY medical treatments but the details need to be thought through before deciding to go that route.  In your case your skin is prone to forming severe keloids and its not necessarily limited to your skin  I know somebody whos had years of complications from colon surgery due to keloids forming in the colon at the surgical site.  If you try to remove this tissue yourself you will absolutely NOT be solving your problem even if you manage to avoid a serious infection.  You will simply move the problem closer to your head face and ear canals.  You will form new keloids wherever you cut.  This would be a very very bad idea.Keloids are very difficult to manage and treat.  Even if you could afford surgery it wouldnt necessarily provide more than a temporary fix.  The good news is that theres a lot of research going on and its likely that effective treatments will be found.Try to make the best of the situation.  There must be some kind of work you could get hired for.  Many entrylevel jobs dont require a good appearance.  Theyre generally not the most desirable jobs but a job is a job until you can get yourself in a position to be choosier.  I gather youre male otherwise I doubt that long hair would be posing any obstacle to hiring.  Do your best to look like a respectable wellgroomed young man instead of focusing on hiding your ear problem.  Get a haircut ditch the beanie and try to cover your ears in a way that doesnt make you look like a respectable adult with a medical problem instead of like a grungy teenager with an attitude problem.  You simply cant look perfectly normal but try something like fleshcolored bandages over your lower ears or a stretch headband thats wide and fleshcolored over your ears and a narrow piece of elastic that blends in with your hair color over the top both of these options might help with the pain by supporting the excess weight in addition to helping your appearance.  When applying for jobs dont try to hide the problem  be upfront and explain that you cover your ears because of a serious keloid problem that can be disturbing for other people to look at.  You dont need to go into detail about how they got started  some people get serious keloids from a simple earlobepiercing.Many people who you will talk to or formally interview with during your employment search did much dumber things in high school than try to stretch big holes in their earlobes to go along with a social fad.  Some of them have done much dumber things well into adulthood like driving drunk.  Youre not a loser youre a young adult whos struggling with a very serious problem.  The world is full of successful people who struggled with and overcame very serious problems before getting their lives on solid footing.  You can join that group.  Really.

Prices for a basic exam are posted online and anything else they may recommend after an exam theyll be able to tell you how much it would cost.  Just the basic exam will likely be able to pinpoint whether this is a lymph node salivary gland or just a cutaneous cyst.

10802793,0,t1_ddlsj3p,Thanks for the response sorry for the delayed reply.  Wasnt thinking Pyridium was directly turning it yellow so much as the residual urine might be dyeing it for lack of a better term.  After reading your link I stopped drinking energy drinks to see what happens.  I was drinking them frequently and this way if its the drinks or psychosomatic it might go away. ,medical,ddu8cs5,1,t5_2r1b9

11158308,0,t1_dewe9qy,Not a clue about Uric Cycle Disorder. Nothing says Parkinsons Id add a dietician to your medical team.  In my case is helped to record everything I was eatingdrinking and every two weeks meet with a dietician to review.  I needed to drink more water no surprise but added about  cup vanilla ice cream to my diet. I wasnt getting enough fat in my diet oddly I started loosing weight after that change my body was storing fat. The catch is I was working out for   minutes  x a week.  Dropped from  to  over  months so feeling better. ,medical,dews66o,2,t5_2r1b9

11437314,0,t3_632cw9,Haha I agree with the other comment tell your parents you have an infected ingrown toenail. Also tell them thank you ingrown toenails are almost always genetic. My little brother used to bite his toenails and it got infected and turned out it was an infected ingrown nail... But it would have never gotten infected had he not been putting his nasty saliva all over his feet! Lol try to break the habit so it doesnt happen again ingrown toenails come back. I just rip mine out with a sharp tool and clippers every couple weeks before it starts poking into my skin. ,medical,dfseptm,1,t5_2r1b9

11776816,0,t3_67y1ug,What is your strongest memory retriever since you have no sense of smell? Like for instance I walk into my grandmas house and smell my whole family and picture myself as a toddler safe in her rocking chair...what brings back memories like that for you? Do you find it any more difficult communicating nonverbally since our sense of smell can be very important in that? Do you set a chore list for the week for things that can start to smell of left alone whether or not it looks dirty? Like trash dishes bathroom animals clothes bedding? Are coldsallergies any different for you than what you have seen from others?Some of our attraction and choosing of partners can come down to smelling the health emotions and personal generic scent of the potential person...do you find that you choose partners differently in any way than others?Smells can influence our emotional well being a lot...when you come home after a stressful day what calms you down the most? For me its the smell of my bed the familiarity and association of sleeping safely....what do you do?Chemicals react differently with each persons body chemistry....do you ask a friend if your soapdetergentdeodorant works well on you?Do you eat mostly by texture than taste?
