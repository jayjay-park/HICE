365786,0,t1_cfimmkf,I never said a stranger cant help which is why I didnt say the OP should turn down shinywtfs offer. But it seems like some OP needs or prefers at this point help from a professional or people who struggle with the same. Hell I struggle with depression myself and I know I cant even help. Trust me its not that I dont want to. But I know I cant provide the support hell need because when it comes down to it I really dont know how to. Being willing to lend a ear can only go so far. I really do find it admirable that shinywtf and yoduh and Im not knocking them at all. And maybe both or one of them have gone through or are going through the same who knows they never mentioned their own background or possible struggles with mental illness. To be willing to step up and offer support to a stranger going through a tough time is great. But in this case as both Ive and OP pointed out he feels like he needs more structured and people with experience in this. I do think thats a great realization as well. Im aware that friends strangers family whatever can help people out of their depression. But I also feel like if your depression is severe enough it wont be enough. Lets switch out depression with alcoholism. Would you think that someone with no experience with dealing with that or sometimes even with people who do can help someone battle that or any addiction? And yes Im sure there have been cases that will refute what I just said... but that is a huge task and not one to be taken lightly.Sorry I wrote such a long wall of text. I really dont want to come saying that shinywtf shouldnt help and that OP shouldnt take his help. But even if OP does lean on shinywtf a bit he will still need more. Not only that but if shinywtf doesnt know the extent or severity heshe may not quite know what theyve signed up for. OP not only mentioned depression but suicide as well... thats huge. ,SanJose,cfioga7,3,t5_2rbod
385848,0,t3_1yh8pa,So the idea would be to come up with a concise statement explaining what we want Google Fiber! and when we want it Now!. Kidding. In the end the decision whether to roll out the product is up to Google but the local government can certainly help facilitate this. Googles release mentions things like a streamlined permitting process and access to existing infrastructure to hang the wires on. It would be a good idea to come up with a concise statement in support of city council facilitating the rollout. Talk about the benefits of true high speed internet and some honest to god competition for the current residential internet dupoly. Point out that were in the capitol of Silicon Valley and our residential internet speeds and cost are simply not competitive on a global level. I guess the primary goal would be to ascertain whether the councillors intend to provide the required support to Google and trying to get them to state on record whether and to what degree they would facilitate the rollout. Id certainly be interested in showing up for one or more or every of these meetings if it would help get effing Comcast out of my life.,SanJose,cfkrbsv,8,t5_2rbod

545186,0,t3_20d625,Your first step is to format both your actual resume and this post to make it easy for people to read. Otherwise theyll throw your resume in the trash or in this case not bother reading your post.Add lists headings bold as necessary. Capitalize things properly if possible look at the formatting help when you reply.Second start with exactly what youd like to be doing in your internship. If you have a major in Business and a minor in CS you probably have a broad array of possibilities. It seems like what youre interested in is robotics and maybe the product department of a robotics company. Make that clear from the get go.Third where have you looked so far? Have you looked at the resources your college offers? Have you looked at job boards? Do you know what qualification the companies youre interested in expect?I would skip a lot of the good things about yourself versus bad things about yourself. Keep it short and to the point.. What do you want to do?. What do you know that is relevant to what you want to do?   Past professional experience   Relevant coursework   Side projects that are relevant!. What do you not know but want to learn at the job?   Interested in expanding my knowledge in X etc.. Where have you looked and what have you done to find an internship?

It was managed by a political veteran and involved a lot of various activities from gt the Yes on  campaign led by Californians for Medical Rights CMR continues to gather steam. Managed by veteran political consultant Bill Zimmerman out of Santa Monica offices CMR gathered nearly  of the  signatures used to quality Prop.  for the ballot. CMR also has offices in Sacramento and consultants around the state who bring topflight expertise to endorsementgathering media strategy fund raising literature design and other campaign activities.Lets contrast this to San Jose pot clubs and their recent petition.  According to the local news articles none of which seem to be coauthored by any pot club representative this drive involved an Occupy city hall event and vouchers for free pot.How exactly is this supposed to win the support of the general public?  There seems to be no organization no media campaign no outspoken wellrespected activists but most importantly no efforts to reach out to those who take a moderate stance on the issue.  Do you think the average liberal soccermom who may totally support medicinal marijuana is going to attend an occupy event or go to a pot club for free weed just to sign this petition?The signatures were there for the taking IMO.

Weve already got the Sharks and the ers our transportation infrastructure is a huge problem particularly with weekday games and the city is still having significant financial troubles. Im not against the idea of investing for the sake of economic stimulus but not all stimulus is created equal. Instead of building a new stadium maybe we can get more ambitious about fixing roads and highways. Or we can make those investments in city water use reduction that would make us a model for the rest of the state. Infrastructure investments have been studied at length and on average have a return of some . on the dollar in economic stimulus. Nothing against the As Im glad they can play sports and entertain millions. Nothing against people who think having a national baseball team will bring additional prestige to San Jose though I wonder if perhaps that effect is exaggerated see the Detroit Tigers. Nothing even against the people who could work at the stadium dong security or collecting tickets or being a vendor probably not making all that much. It just seems a bit frivolous.

Also buying pets amp horses amp war dogs is limited to  and it must have a CR below your level exception pets of CR  and below are always allowed.

In fact most of the communities that have Bass Pro Shops actually give them tax breaks so they would build there and the communities can benefit off the sales tax.  San Jose was deemed so desirable that Bass Pro Shop did not need tax breaks to open here.And Bass Pro Shop was not sprawl.  That land that it sits on has not seen usage for a long time and is not located on the fringe of the city it is a great use of the land.  What would you have built there?  Thats a special commercial zone so only commercials can go there.Commercials comprise a very large part of San Joses tax base.

7653213,0,t1_d3bpkc4,You really need to get out and travel some... Murican food is highly diverse and has some of the best dishes in the world.    American Pizza  Nobody does pizza like America. Weve got deep dish NY style cracker thin pan hand tossed each with its own pluses and minuses.  So much more diverse than that bland brick oven napoli style pizza.  Whats with the napoli style pizza?!  Put some god damn cheese on that pie! The most common pizza topping pepperoni is an American creation. Unfortunately pizza sucks and is way over priced in California unless youre a transplant from the great lakes or north east you wouldnt understand and you will down vote me.    American BBQ  Hugely diverse depending on what area of the country you are in.  Youve got Memphis style BBQ thats sauce or rub focused.  Carolina with a mustard base sauce.  And texas style which is slowly smoked.  Brisket in Austin will change your life.    Buffalo Wings  A relatively new comer to American cuisine.  These are also becoming a very diverse dish with many different takes on how to cook and sauce them.    The cheese burger   America owns the burger Nuff said.Fried chicken  This ones for you south east America!Cajun food  New Orleans represent.  American Chinese Food  General Tsos Orange chicken and sweat and sour pork are completely American dishes.  Yeah its not real Chinese but I dont care its delicious and its as American as apple pie.    And make sure to finish it off with American tradition of fortune cookies!  Its really odd but I found that American style Chinese was much better out east than in California.   Deserts  America rules the world in deserts.  A lot of American deserts might have some Europeans arguing that they originated else where but if they invented the cheesecake and didnt take the next to deep fry it like the good people of the Wisconsin state fair did you really invent it?  Ive tried Indian and Chinese deserts... Its like trying to give aspirin to a heroin addict...  Ive got a taste of that high fructose corn syrup I cant go back to mild sweets.    You would be really surprised at how American all of your meals are.  Maybe they have some roots in other countries but a lot if it is Americanized.  I get its cool to look down on murica as some uncultured country compared to the rest of the world.  But overall we have the most diverse food of any country EVER.  And these were just foods off the top of my head.  There is so much more to murican food.  If you get a chance go travel or take a job else where in the US and experience the different regions! ,SanJose,d3c4lqr,2,t5_2rbod

But many people find it at least distasteful that Trump did not immediately reject the endorsement and then later pretended as if he had.  Furthermore the fact that Trump is someone that KKK members would endorse is relevant to many.gt Theres a picture of Hilary Clinton Kissing a KKK Wizard...If you are referring to Robert Byrd he was a former KKK member in the s quit the KKK apologized many times for having been a member and went on to support the Civil Rights act and Voting Rights Act as the U.S. Senator from West Virginia.So to describe him as a KKK Wizard is totally inaccurate and disingenuous.If you want to be taken seriously dont make arguments that are such obvious attempts to mislead.,SanJose,d3v5c5b,-3,t5_2rbod

You cant let these dregs of society walk all over you. You have to be firm with them or theyll take everything. Even without having to deal with the bum. I suggest you buy a gun before governor moonbeam and the communist state legislature bans them.If he attacks you regardless of the law you have every right to defend yourself. Even with lethal force. Thats Gods law.Ive had to deal with plenty of bums and hippies squatting around my property and the property of friendsrelatives. A good quality mace not that  pepper spray crap can also be helpful.

8533882,0,t1_d67z2ub,gt apparently anders breivik and dylann roof was  years agoCompletely different. Both were politically motivated attacks by unstable individuals. They were not religiously motivated by people just following their religion. But hey better luck next time with the cherry picking.Breivik himself in his  page manifesto stated his attack was politically motivated and that he is not religious and does not believe God even exists. The stated his preference for a secular state over a theocracy several times.Islamic terrorists staged nearly ten thousand deadly attacks in just the six years following September th .  If one goes back to  when Muslim armies in Bangladesh began the mass slaughter of Hindus through the years of Jihad in the Sudan Kashmir and Algeria and the presentday SunniShia violence in Iraq the number of innocents killed in the name of Islam probably exceeds five million over this same period.In the last ten years there have been perhaps a dozen or so religiouslyinspired killings by people of all other faiths combined.  When such a small handful or loners act in isolation it can legitimately be chalked up to mental illness or at best genuine misunderstanding. By contrast Islamic terror is organized and methodical.  Islamist groups span the globe with tens of thousands of dedicated members despite intensely targeted countermeasures and supporters numbering in the tens of millions.  They are open about their religious goals and they kill in the name of god each and every day of the year.  Verses in their holy texts arguably support them.  There are none who will even debate them.No other religion is doing this.  So while some Muslims may pretend that other religions are just as prone to misinterpretation as is their perfect one reality says otherwise.gt Never mind the cops so far have found no evidence of radicalization or even mentioned the attackers religion.Thats because it is common practice of European governments to cover up because they dont want to incite their wonderful muslim populations. But hey this wasnt religiously motivated at all. The guy was just a Muslim migrant from muslimmajority Somali. He yelled Allahu Akbar! before his little stabbing spree. But clearly it was not a religious attack.You should be in the Olympics. The mental gymnastics you have to do to believe this wasnt a Muslim attacking infidels are incredible.gt but islam isnt a race amiriteIslam is not a race.  Islam has nothing at all to do with genetics nor is it an innate characteristic.  It is an ideology  a set of beliefs about individual behavior and the rules of society. People generally choose their beliefs they do not choose their raceTherefore Muslims are not a race of people.  In fact there are Muslims of all races.  Does a person change their race by adopting or leaving Islam?Criticizing Islam is not racism.

It is because of this that we are taken advantage of.And doesnt every little towns around San Jose tried to hire away our police force?  The police force that has for decades contained the crimes in San Jose to city proper and not let it leak out to the little towns surrounding San Jose.

The county Sheriff has to approve it and in California you have to show an actual need to have one such as having a job that carries risk etc..gtIn the past good cause has meant that you can show thatgta clear and present danger exists for you or your immediate family andcarrying a concealed weapon would mitigate that danger.gtTraditionally both the sheriff and police chief have maintained that carrying a concealed weapon is a privilege not a right.  You must therefore meet all their criteria before they will issue you this type of license.gtThis has been the case for each renewal application as well.  Simply stating that all conditions under which this CCW permit was originally issued remain the same does not establish good cause. You must present evidence as to why this is the case.gtThe good cause requirement has been challenged in federal court in a case called Peruta v. San Diego County. The plaintiffs in the Peruta case argued that the good cause requirement as it was administered by the sheriff of San Diego County was unconstitutional.gtIn San Diego County concern for ones personal safety by itself was not enough to constitute good cause. Instead an applicant for a permit had to show that she had a set of nonmainstream circumstances causing him or her to be placed in harms way.,SanJose,dcpsrbj,3,t5_2rbod

Best art galleries are all in San Jose Downtown theres actually quite a bit and most of them open on South st Friday.  The best gallery is actually the ones at the Art Ark artist studio on Keyes and Fifth but they dont always open to the public but when they do its pretty bad ass.There is also an art gallery for exhibitions in the old Ross store on st street.  I have not checked it out yet so I dont know how big the gallery space is.There was another art gallery in Japantown Empire Seven but I think they got evicted due to high rent Hip neighborhood?  Santana Row Alameda Japantown and Willow Glen downtown.  You can also try Sunnyvale and Campbell Downtown as well.  Theyre pretty charming.For transit options youll want to check out VTAs website.  The light rail will get you to MOST places but you may want to look into Uber and Lyft at times.Specific to Santa ClaraSan Jose?  I would say the Tech Museum in Downtown and the Computer History Museum in Sunnyvale.  If you are into Eastern cultures San Jose has two very beautiful Buddhist temples Duc Vien and Pao Hua and the massive Sihk Gurdwara in Evergreen.The best landmark and the one most worth of visits in the South Bay would be Lick Observatory atop Mt Hamilton in San Jose.
