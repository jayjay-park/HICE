9385992,0,t1_d95q2zh,The adviser option is turned off I thought. Every time a major change happens she pops up and tells me something I am not interested in. Ill have to double check that.I also like the threat barbarians pose but their numbers are absolutely insane compared to .In the first  turns Epic speed there was no issue moving past city states. However as city state land expands it cuts off any path to the area beyond them on Fractal map type and I now have people who cannot get back to my main area. I understand borders exist and stopping in those borders with military units could be construed as aggressive. But at least in Civ it reduced your status with them not completely stopped you.Combine the above with the stupid housing aspect where settlers are wasted on anything less than  housing and it is extremely difficult to get a good spot with actual resources. I still enjoy the game dont get me wrong. But there is a lot of poor design  mechanical decision in this game. It really messes with the pace of the game as  of my turns are just spamming next because workers get  uses. Makes the beginning of the game feel very boring and empty.Now that could be because I am on Epic speed and it was designed to be faster. Fair enough but now youre punishing players who like longer campaigns. ,civ6,d95qnzu,2,t5_2wwdz
9393968,0,t3_591v5b,Not a bug if you cut down forests or something similar on previous turns  anything to give you a huge production boost that carries over.... I think.,civ6,d96r2nx,1,t5_2wwdz
9549376,0,t1_d9pp5m0,problem with their ability to build districts is you generally dont need to rush them. But what makes this worse is that the ability to get workers  from units only works on enemy civs or city states and also the ability is only for the warrior once you get swordman tech you cant even use the ability any more. This pretty much makes you early war people which also gives you a huge debuff called war wearyness after all this you still only have a chance to get the workerits also fairly hard to get kills on the warrior seeing as they are very slow and you generally attack with range units and use the melees on choice spots for better defense,civ6,d9q5p1u,2,t5_2wwdz

9785317,0,t1_daj8u80,I get the logic on the first point but throughout history troops have been able to kill themselves eliminating the need to supply them if they were outnumbered. If that meant that the opposing force couldnt gain experience by fighting them oh well.For the second point troops would be carrying explosives with them which can easily be used to blast trees out of the way or simply set the forest on fire.,civ6,daj94xn,2,t5_2wwdz

10265604,0,t3_5mzw9e,I always disliked that putting units near a border meant getting the warning from another Civ but if they do it we cant say anything. Id like to escalate the warmongering penalty by asking if they plan to invade but its a oneway only feature I guess. I love the idea of a warning shot.,civ6,dc7nukx,5,t5_2wwdz

10808415,0,t3_5tx6fl,Best tips I can give after  hours of Civ  gameplay is this GET A PANTHEON...NOW!Pantheons are SOOO strong and getting the first one can mean A LOT. They stay with you for the whole game and make your life SUPER easy so get one by ANY means necessary you need  faith on Online speed so spend  turns with GOD KING get a point into a Religious City State work a tile with Faith Yields or get a Goodie HutMy favorite pantheons in this order Open Sky  culture from pastures likely the strongest God of the Forge  production towards ancientclassical unitsmost versatile Oral Tradition  culture per most plantation Divine Spark  great person point in  districts Dance of the Aurora Adj bonus for tundraholy sites Desert Folklore Adj bonus for desertholy sites Sacred Path Adj bonus for jungleholy sitesRANGED UNITSCAVALRY VS THE WORLDThese two types are the best units every other unit type is a niche unit specific to a certain situation heres why Ranged unitsearly can be made in  turns in any city  pop or higher requiring only . hammers to make in one turn with AGOGE they take no damage when attacking They cost littleno maintence Cavalry units high CS units available early massive movement amazing upgrades amazing timing pushes.ARMIES MATTER... A LOT! This isnt civ . No more slinger vs the world .  You NEED at least  ranged units for early defense and barb clearing defense vs other civilizations ESPECIALLY since early walls plain suck.  You NEED  anti cavalry for barb horsemen. You NEED support units for aggression vs cities with medieval or later walls. If you have level  Light cavalry then you can use them as escourts for these units to have them as mobile as horse units while you use heavy cavalry to tear cities down! COMMERICAL HUBSHARBORS FIRSTThese are the only  in every city district the extra trade route basically giving you the yields of a free tile AND roads between all your citiesenemy cities so these should in general be your first districts in EVERY city The more districts in the city youre trading with  more yields Internal Trade Yields  Food growth Production Gold with CARAVANSARIES International Trade Yields Culture Science Production GoldTRADE IS GOD CENTRALIZED TRADEamazing late game Make all trade routes go from your CAPITAL to expansions for a MASSIVE  pop production capital DECENTRALIZED TRADEamazing early game Make all your trade routes go from your EXPANSIONS to your capital  OR Foreign Cities for a little productiongrowth or goldscienceculturehammers everywhere.    You can easily get  scienceculture early when using DTrade  TRADE CONFEDERATIONPERPETUAL EXPANSIONYou should be in a state of perpetual expansion in Civ  always using at least one city to expand for Newunique lux More territory Infrastructure roads  To simply to deny all of the above to other people. Remember the more cities you have the more trade routes you can support you can use these routes to massive effect for production growth science gold spreads religion. W.E. you need or want trade routes will work for you.  Its also important to note that theres not nearly as harsh a penalty for having a tun of cities especially when compared to Civ EXPLORE Stay away from the polesNo not Jadwiga because they contain tuns of barbs. Explore manually and move one tile at a time.  Avoid all barbarians like the plague with your scouts as Recon units die easily and their only real purpose is to unveil the map not fight barbarians.  Your goal is to find ALL the other Civilizations for trade and specifically their capital for spies free goldworks later also you want to find ALL the city states to maximize the bonuses you can get from quests. Also scouting out the map tells you when a barbarian encampment spawns so that you can kill it before it starts spamming units into your cities Gives you VITAL information on where you should expand such as Choke Points vs nearby enemiescivs Luxuries City States Natural wonders. SPECIALIZE CITIES EARLY IF POSSIBLE Do not neglect to get at least one district of each type as terrain allows you dont NEED to have every district type in one city BUT you need to have at least one or two in each. For example in a city with mountains in reach get a commercial hub and a campus in a city without mountains look for a spot with  adj on a industrial zone or  for another district.  You want your cities to specialize until high pop for the best yields since districts are at a premium My reasoning for this is that even if you were making between  science per turn at turn  because you have  cities with a Commercial Hub  Campus in all cities its not going to do you much good if you cant produce units to defend them since youve got neither the culture for  bonus civic cards nor the production to back the later era units excluding ofc timing pushes.GREAT PEOPLE!!!!!A Look at the great person screen EVERY turn!This is a simple way to see what everyone is doing and what they are focusing on EVEN if you have not met them! Get at least one Great General from the ClassicalMedievalRen eras. This is the era that generals will have the most impact in the units from this era have VERY low mobility Pikemen Xbows Musketmen and that  movement means the world when fighting in hilly areas allowing them to be competitive versus the all mighty Cavalry spam that so many fall to also these units are relevant for a VERY long period pikemen are the only anticalv units until Chemistry for example so get one general to effect this eraBDONT LET PEOPLE GENERAL STACKAnother SUPER important reason to pay attention to great people. If someone starts getting great people points towards generals early then they can get MULTIPLE generals effecting one era and their AoE effect stacks two generals means  combat and  movement  a  shot on  CS units I have personally used this to get FIVE generals in one era classicalmedievalren as Japan. My Xbows could fight tanks AND WIN KILL CITY STATESNot sure why people do not do this as much as possible the bonus youd get from a city state is less than what youre going to get from that city by capturing it also youre DENYING the bonus to other players so unless youve got a super op city state near you ZanzibarCarthageKabulECT If its anywhere near your main city say within around  tiles of your capital youre better off just capturing it to get the free district and yields as well as any luxuriesstrategicbonus resources in the area and you basically get free bonuses and upgrades for fighting them. STICK TO LEADERS AGENDAThis is a super easy way to improve just read up on a leaders lore and play accordingly Playing America? You get a  bonus for all combat on your continent so why not expand to control that whole continent since its going to be super easy to control it? WAR EARLY OR USE TIMING PUSHES. War earlySince walls melt like butter and most people do not build the necessary units to defend versus early agression also its important to remember that pre turn ish you do not face penalties for warring so why not kill the city of someone who forwards you? No extended warsopposite of using timing pushes Timing Pushing Stockpile around  gold early and build between  units of one type then upgradeattack as soon as you have the required tech. Build units Usually chariotsarcherswarriors get the tech for the next unit knightsxbowsswordsmen and use gold to upgrade them all at once and attack to quickly kill an opponent before they can respond.  Never fight an extended war for no reason since weariness applies a   modifier to Yields in your cities GET AS MANY AMINITIESLUXURIES AS POSSIBLE Via either actually owning your aminitiesluxuries or trading for them you want to get ALL of the aminitiesluxuries types if at all possible.    You can also get them by being Suz of a City State so pay particular attention to getting Suz on CS that have amenitiesluxuries on other continents Just like the  modifier having  aminitiesluxuries gives you a  modifier towards ALL your yields as well also it makes it to where your cities can grow larger so you want as many as possible! GET A RELIGION Why would you not do this? You dont need to get the first one or even a good one but by simply having a religion you can get some sweet bonuses such as  gold per city and deny someone else an victory type in the process. Just pop down one holy site. You can round your Civilization out using religion to fit your specific needs in EACH game did you start on a MASSIVE continent and so your aminitiesluxuries are limited to ? Get the aminities options in religion. There is so much that a well tailored religion brings to your table so pay attention and specialize it! CIVICS CARDSThe transition from Civ  to  can be fustrating and this is something that most people will neglect Look at your civics cards EVERY time you complete a Civic Tech Try to min max by only focusing on one thing while using a certain civic card otherwise put them on something that will effect you permanently. Ex dont use AGOGE for rangedmelee units expanding or building districts rather use DISIPLINE vs barbs or CONSCRIPTION GPT per unit to either maintain a standing army or fight off hoards.SORRY FOR THE QUANTITY OF MY POST HAHA DIDNT NOTICE TILL I HIT THE k LIMITER,civ6,ddut8k5,10,t5_2wwdz
10821813,0,t1_ddw6fm7,Interesting thought! I usually get a few great writersartists every game so I have to have some place to put them if I dont get wonders that can hold them. Im still fairly new to civ  and won my first game by culture and my next by science though I still had a strong cultural presence in the second game. I just tend to gravitate toward culture I guess! Going lighter on the cultural sites seems like an intriguing idea though. ,civ6,ddw6zed,2,t5_2wwdz
10879041,0,t3_5ve0o8,I dont think so.You have to focus on production to ensure you can build what you want to build. And when you managed to have strategically located industrial zones with the appropriate set of mines building times can get ridiculously short.,civ6,de23gey,1,t5_2wwdz
