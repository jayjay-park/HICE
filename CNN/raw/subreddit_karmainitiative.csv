2918518,0,t1_cnzoahc,We dont have any NA players anymore I think. If you are on a NA server you cant play with people from EU anyways. We had someone from NA on a EU server before but only because she was working night shift. Otherwise the timezone is a problem.I think you lose the guild not sure though. Because you have to delete everything to be able to chose a new server. But its better to research that,karmainitiative,cnzue9f,1,t5_2xqsr
