494338,0,t1_cfwexfa,It is most common for bedbug bites to be a series of multiple smaller bites after several longer ones. This is a result of the feeding train that bedbugs get into as they travel in a straight line following pheromones left in the fecal trail of their older relatives.  on the same vertical line would be exceptionally rare however finding the evidence of  feeding trains with  bites each is not uncommon in large infestations.,Bedbugs,cfwgkru,2,t5_2s36j
811897,0,t1_cgwjt1j,please discontinue the use of noncontrolled pesticides. The only ones that work require a license to spray them. However bleach mixed with water and  or greater isopropyl alcohol will kill the bugs and their eggs. The eggs are the objective in this war. The reason you are seeing new bugs yet arent getting bit is because the eggs are still hatching. Get some plastic sheeting between you and the box springfloor and locate and destroy that harborage.,Bedbugs,cgwkf1d,1,t5_2s36j
1257666,0,t1_cib1hge,gt You didnt read the original thread completely or was only listening to second hand misinformation. I suggested the use of a fogger to kill fleas a OP was having only after it has been determined there was no bedbugs.You suggested the fogger when OP couldnt find bed bugs. Not finding them on an initial search doesnt mean theyre not there. You also suggested that the fogger would be helpful if bed bugs were present because it would drive them out of hiding. Thats just poor advice. If a bed bug infestation is suspected foggers need to be avoided until it is reasonably certain theyre not present. You also suggested RID shampoo would help with fleas ?!?.gt The BB problem my friend had was localized to his bedroom of a  bedroom occupied one level house. He sprayed plenty of insecticide in his room for a time there and they always came back the other bedrooms reported no problem bites or any evidence.Your anecdote does not trump established protocol by licensed professionals.gt So all in all I think the pesticides drive them away is a bit overblown its not like roaches where they can survive in other areas easily thus scatter far and wide once a pesticide is applied.They can absolutely survive in couches office chairs and anywhere else that people remain motionless for a while. If scattered they may very well take up residence there. Worse they might be scattered to a region of the house where they cant easily detect a human presence like a basement or subfloor and come out of hiding months later.gt Until your mention of those new pesticides I was under the impression I was telling the truth right?Sure but you were stating as fact things that you didnt know and didnt research. Perhaps a better approach would be to admit you dont know what an exterminator can do to fight bed bugs but you know how to fight them without one.Heres another examplegt DE food grade isnt very effective as its hoping to scratch their shells to leakdry them out. A drying agent is x better as it removes the waxy surface over the entire insect to dry them out plus it transfers to other BBs and their eggs. DE is a drying agent and it works exactly the same way as Cimexa they both scratch away at the waxy cuticle that prevents bugs from drying out. Cimexa works better because it is shaped differently not because it employs some new principle. Theyre both amorphous silica.gt Correcting someone can be done in a nontrolling manner.

1700342,0,t3_2dv2qn,gtToday we cleaned the room thoroughly and layed down diatomaceous earth across the carpet.Vacuum it up right away before it gains moisture. DE and other dusts are for floors only because it needs to be removed when it gets wet or absorbs oils.Once the dust gets between the fibers of the carpet it will have be extracted using a expensive high powered steam device and a lot of labor.gtWe have also thrown out our sheets and are thinking about throwing out our blankets and pillowcases is this overkill or should we just wash and dry these at high temperature?Bedding that can fit into a washer or a local larger laundry machine or dry cleaners doesnt need to be thrown out. Dont overload the washerdryer and do so on high heat so its very hot in the middle but no burning for about a hour. Afterwards clothes and sheets can be misted with water to regain the moisture and become soft again.gtAlso we have a few stuffed animals that have large sentimental value that we will not throw out. What can we do to make sure these dont carry the bugs?As long as there are no openings to the inside the outer surface can be sprayed with rubbing alcohol. If this cant be done then seal the item in clear plastic airtight for the next two years it will also keep the dust off of it.If you need to use the item before  years then seal it in plastic stick it in a bin and await the Dry CO process along with any other hard to clean items.Anything cleaned needs to be sealed in plastic bins or bags and marked as such.gtWhat can we do to make sure we dont bring any bugs with us to our new home?Read the links on the sidebar. And when he or you leave for the last time you both need to do this.gtI was wondering if the pictures can give you any ideas on how bad the problem might beYou have them for sure and it doesnt matter how many really just one is bad.gtWhen we lifted the box spring we found two small patches about the size of a quarter with bed bugs at various stages and saw about  live bed bugs roaming in each spot.This is a bad infestation that they achieved such numbers.,Bedbugs,cjthodl,0,t5_2s36j
1800599,0,t1_ck5tm7m,gt We have confirmed they were no where else but our couch. You cant go by sight alone assume they are everywhere and act accordingly.gtFirst we took the couch outside and it is currently sitting out there until we can get it to a dump. I threw all the cushions and pillows from it in the dumpster and literally doused that shit in spray. I know i know not supposed to spray but i said fuck it.If the couch was outside it is ok to spray as any bedbugs not directly hit may or may not be chased off the item being sprayed and into the outside environment to be eaten by predators or simply perish.Then again since the couch was being thrown away there wasnt a need to spray at all you could have simply spray painted it or cut it up with a knife or something to discourage someone from picking it up. Bedbugs cant live more than two years without a blood host so if the item is going to the dump or furnace its no bother for you to waste your money spraying it.The couch could have been saved if wrapped airtight in  plastic and left like that for  years.gtThen we did hardcore vaccuming in the whole area where it was.Sorry still not enough by itself. Read through all the sidebar links and be through with your actions.Hopefully the vacuum was placed outside to allow escaping bedbugs to no longer be in the house.gtAnd now we are washing all of our clothes and sheets from our beds just in case. So ill have plenty of clean clothes my bed and my moms is still fine and well have clean sheets and consider the couch erradicated. The clothes that came in contact with the couch while it was still in here a day ago that we wore we changed out of in the bathtubs and put in plastic bags and transfered to the washdryer. So those are clean.Make sure to seal all cleaned items behind plastic the bedbugs are still in your house.gtBut we will still have some professional come out and look see what is necessary.

3033705,0,t1_coca8d8,Very true they now have a pesticide grade version of DE that is a step above food grade and less dusty. So that is advised if available because then they know what its being used for and can eliminate issues.Dont use Pool Grade DE its extremely fine very dusty and harmful even in small amounts only to be used outside for pool filers using a dust mask always for any DE not inside.Also DE is not  pure silica its made by long diatoms and mined so it also can contain quartz or other sharp minerals.DE acts like a abrasive and a absorbent of the waxy layer of exoskeleton insects so they dry out and die. However it takes well over a week and requires them moving through it at a thin enough level that they wade. Too muchhigh and they go around as they cant gain traction as their legs leave the solid surface.Wearing a dusk mask whenever using any desiccant is mandatory then using a HEPA filter or airing the location out as to remove the airborne dust is required. DE also cant be applied anywhere its going to be kicked up into the air again.,Bedbugs,cocfx3m,1,t5_2s36j

3540643,0,t3_30tc43,. Read our guide here It covers what you can do to resist in the home and hitchhikers etc.. Call the management so ALL units can be checked as bedbugs can come through the walls. Use a canine inspection.. Heat treatment may not be necessary its usually for large infestations. If your willing to tolerate pesticides or leave until the smell is gone that might be the better route as the neighboring units will also get treated.. CO traps are bad dont always catch bedbugs and if used wrong can kill or cause brain damage. They are mainly for checking in a empty home for nonbite reactors and cant be used consistently as they cost too much to maintain  every two weeks. Since your being bit its clear you have bedbugs. There are far better and safer dusts like  amorphous silica gel that can be used to mine your house for  years for  and kill far more than the occasional bedbug that arrives. Its safe enough to eat even as its only silica sand but shouldnt be inhaled or get into the eyes much like sand shouldnt.. Post bed interceptors dont work for frame beds work if the bedbugs are using the bedposts. If your bed frame is made of smooth metal then there is even less chance the trap will catch anything as they are bidirectional. Bed post interceptors are detectors not for control and they really dont work well enough as it really requires a traumatized female to be chased out of the closertothehost harborage likely located in the mattress or boxspring.  Bedbugs can be housed on the bed itself or even on a blanket at the foot of the bed or being slept on top of! They also could be on the headboard frame or traversing to a hideout in the wall or behind pictures. They also could be using the fallen bedding touching the floor as fabric makes for great handholds for their claws and contains your scent. They can even drop off the ceiling or overhanging cabinets etc. Then there is the couch the easy chair the floor and a ton of other places bedbugs will live and bite. So in other words they wont work alone but can be used a part of a overall defense and early warning plan. Then there is a brand that are black and have been proven to work better than the white ones as bedbugs prefer dark areas to hide in out of the light. . Far as what to do I would notify management to do a canine inspection of the neighboring units to rule out that angle. And if it comes up clean and your not getting bit anymore after a few weeks to consider it might have been a lone hitchhiker and luckily it didnt lay eggs.

3573857,0,t1_cpzin25,Im not saying you or all PCOs are swindlers just like not all cops are bent and not all priests are pedophiles.All Im saying is you have considerably more experience with bedbug behavior than my  selferadicated infestations and here I was able to demonstrate the folly of recommending bed post traps alone.Someone of your experience should have caught that which leads me to question your motivation.I have my own PCO and guess what she tells me? She goes around and informs me of potential bug and rodent access points and causes so I can inform others like gardener and the handyman to fix things so there wont be a issue in the future.Thats being proactive.Waiting  days while one is getting bit to hell and back for something to appear in the bed post trap isnt exactly my idea of being proactive.Ive built our own bedbug proof bed two years before our first infestation a year ago.Thats being proactive.We are currently testing DE as a perimeter defensive and will be switching to CimeXa in a few weeks.Thats being proactive.We need to do this because we have friends in the hotel industry and they occasionally drop off a bedbug. We react badly to the bites.There isnt much activity on this sub perhaps a slight bump in the summer otherwise we really have nothing else to do but ponder the best proactive solutions possible.We already got the routine down for a present infestation see everyone chipped in and said get a exterminator! so thats a nobrainer. I chipped in with after that be more defensive...blah blah.What we dont know yet is how to do things in a sufficient enough manner so bedbugs dont become a problem again.We are not out to bankrupt the PCO industry and your huge investment in equipment thats not going to happen as there are many other pests to deal with. People need the bedbug problem resolved like it was back in the DDT days because its just too severe of a issue.I personally think its wrong for the pest control industry to handle the bedbug issue its because they are used to the cycle of pests arriving and them being firemen coming to the rescue. So IMO they are not really as motivated as they could be to find real solutions.What we need instead is higher up level action that take the bedbug problem more seriously take it out or at least reduce it so its a rare occurrence because its just too severe of a effect on people.The PCO industry is losing the war on bedbugs its partially the blame of government for restricting certain pesticides but its also a lack of motivation to find new solutions because the money is coming from the pest control industry that wants to keep the squeaky wheel squeaking.I personally think the Federal Government should get involved and mandate much like they mandate fire sprinklers and smoke alarms that other industries to comply with furniture and construction code changes that make homes and locations more bedbug resistant.Thats where Im looking at.Thats being proactive.Bedbugs have tipped the scale before it was fine to have a few bugs in the house it wasnt exactly life threatening or disfiguring but these bedbugs are whole another game level and new ways of doing things needs to be found.Edit For a bit of related.Ripley How long after were declared overdue can we expect a rescue?Hicks pause Fourteen days.Hudson Fourteen days?

8909322,0,t1_d7idbzs,Youre right  I remembered seeing figures well below these as insufficient to kill bbs especially as egg but cant find them now. The paper I cited wasnt the one I had in mind but you remain correct regardless.My thinking in recommending heaters is that they have the potential to treat all sorts of sensitive objects that cant be put in a dryer potentially saving someone hundreds if they have books CDs or certain electronics that will resist the heat. Personal items with sentimental value are another common use.Cycles also only take up to  hours at a time rather than the  hours that are typically recommended when freezing.If the OP has a large chest freezer that reaches C to C and can keep it closed for at least  hours undisturbed it would do the trick!I honestly appreciate your concern and perspective uIanaLorD thank you for making me take a second look.,Bedbugs,d7irrgh,1,t5_2s36j

10541925,0,t3_5qvnn1,Do you have bed bug traps set up on all of your beds?  If not I would recommend the following pulling all beds out from the walls putting bedbug traps on the leg of each bed putting mattressboxspring covers on all mattresses and box springs laundering all bed clothesThat should help in a big way because it will turn your beds into islands that the bed bugs cannot get to without getting caught in the traps.  From there I would recommend having a PCO use chemicals to treat your place.Good luck!,Bedbugs,dd31mcd,2,t5_2s36j

Run it trough a tumble dryer on high heat for  minutes and inspect it in a dry bath.Now this part may sound odd at the start but read it through a few times and thing about it.  When finding a dark object on a dark surface you are better looking for differences in depth than differences in colour.This way anything present will be easier to spot because of its differences rather than similarities.  If you want to see what I mean by this have a look at the link below its a  min room inspection video recorded to prove it is possible to doIts an old video but the info is still accurate.David ,Bedbugs,dficp99,1,t5_2s36j
