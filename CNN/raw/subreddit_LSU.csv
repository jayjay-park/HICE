But having a protest and not actually doing anything about it such as fundraising isnt going to accomplish anything.The Art building has been a problem since I was in school almost  years ago. Thats  years of fundraising that they could have been doing.  years of calling alumni to donate to the cause of matching the cost to repair or replace the building. Why didnt they do that? How do you think the Music and Dramatic Arts Department got an update to the MampDA building? They campaigned for donations.,LSU,cgja8s9,1,t5_2rlgj

2324318,0,t1_clyzas8,You should reevaluate your transportation. I dont even drive to campus on school days because traffic is so bad. Is this the first Saturday you or the author of the post have worked? Probably not. Why dont you just rude your bike to campus? Thats what I do on game days. Dont have a bike? Buy one and consider it an investment in your own time. Certainly after enough game days youll have saved enough time to make it worth it. Just sound like poor planning to me.,LSU,clyzzuw,2,t5_2rlgj
2407160,0,t3_2n046w,I would suggest a food tour! I dont know where you are from but the food of Louisiana is an integral part of the culture here! If you are going to  be on campus I would suggest the Chimes for a taste of Louisiana food. Their seafood is fantastic! Also I would highly suggest you get a plate of fried alligator for the two of you I always order this when I have people from far off lands. Trust me its absolutely delicious. Louies is a staple on campus its our local  hour diner that is amazeing. Get some of the hashbrowns. Do it. Just do it. Do it.,LSU,cm98fmt,3,t5_2rlgj

8780065,0,t1_d735ev2,The whole point of formal and informal rush is to get to know a couple guys in the fraternity. Make connections and bond with them a bit and your in. In OPs case Id aim for a smaller fraternity so you can actual get to know people there,LSU,d736fj3,3,t5_2rlgj
8841255,0,t3_51auzn,Hey man as a Beta Im super happy to hear you were considering us and hope we arent off your list. I really believe that us being a lower tier fraternity has more to do with the newness of the colony than anything. We just got to campus last fall and it takes time for a reputation to build. I will say that were making some great first steps. We have a great group of guys some really quality individuals that are way more interested in developing a true brotherhood than anything sketchy. In our first Greek Week we logged more service hours than any other fraternity and you have a unique opportunity to help the state of Louisiana with our philanthropy which goes towards coastal restoration and awareness. Were in the final stages of locking up a really nice house on campus too. Were really building a positive reputation with sororities for our bus tripsother events too. Weve gotten some superpositive feedback girls feel safe around us. They can put their drink down and not have to worry about it. If theyre visibly not feeling well well stop what were doing and check on her. We treat our dates well.So to answer your question rushing a lower tier fraternity doesnt mean youre making a bad choice. Its all about fit. Those tiers are not set in stone so pick the people you feel comfortable around and do your part to help that group ascend the ranks whoever it is. I honestly believe that Beta is on the rise and just needs time so I hope you come for the ride.I transferred from LSU this fall but Ill always be proud to be a Beta. If those guys are weird then I dont want to be normal.Feel free to message me if you have any other questions.,LSU,d7aldfc,7,t5_2rlgj

11383131,0,t1_dfm30f1,Honors basic sciences series are generally better imo than nonhonors as well. Honors o chem was not bad at all and he curved to the grade distribution of other college of science honors courses. Honors classes in my experience were more fun more engaging and actually easier than the corresponding non honors options to fulfill those same hours requirements. I used honors courses to fulfill humanities and even a general sciences requirement where there was a  level honors science elective that was great. Basically I found it very rewarding to stay in the honors college all four years even though I didnt fulfill the requirements to be recognized with honors. ,LSU,dfm9bjm,3,t5_2rlgj
