2341880,0,t3_2m4bzn,I agree with you that the games twist was that it is a prequel. However the rest of the theory is entirely speculative and it isnt based on any information from the game. It sounds kind of like fanfiction but to be fair so do most FNAF theories...I subscribe to the prequel idea based on the newspaper clipping at the end indicating that we will reopen someday but with a smaller budget explains why there were electrical power concerns at the third location the one from the first game as well as the original characters are being kept in hopes of a future reorganization of the company. It also justifies the state of the animatronics being in disrepair.,FNaF,cm16357,1,t5_333sj
2571884,0,t3_2oxruz,PSA Any night other than  is  fake. Well sort of. It is possible to access them but it is not an easter egg or secret. I would hesitate to even call it a bug. You can access any night number you want by editing the level value in the games app data. Now everyone PLEASE stop talking about Night  or anything else.,FNaF,cmua80w,1,t5_333sj
