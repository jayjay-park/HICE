3032297,0,t3_2uv2c7,I was fearing the worst up until the end.Good on Yato for not listening to his father and for believing in Hiyori to come back from the other side. Also good on Hiyori for blowing off Yatos dad.,Noragami,cocanjc,1,t5_2yt0q

Locate the icon and apply it.Make sure to keep the icons somewhere safe and not move them after applying them otherwise folders will become default again and youll need to redo the process.,Noragami,cw9k1xb,2,t5_2yt0q

5669628,0,t3_3sq5k0,That is actually a good question!It has stemmed off into many theories albeit none of them have been completely answer. I think it comes down to the nature of the two Gods.Bishamonten Vairavaa is a god of war. Following the characteristics of the God whose name she shares Bisha is also a god who punishes evildoers. She is also part of the seven gods of fortunes seven lucky gods. Thus being the strongest war god within the Shinto pantheon her final word represents her nature.To ruin is to destroy ravage and wipe out. All synonyms of war and the representation of her character.Meanwhile Yato is portrayed as a one of the lowly gods. A magatsukami or one of the many gods of calamity. Interestingly enough youd think he would use something along the lines of destruction?However when you look up rend in the dictionary it literally means to sever. Tear ripapart rupture and sunder are all synonyms of something being split apart. Possibly destroy but not quite.Animeverse these changes are shown and thats what intrigues me. I dont remember ever seeing Bishamonten uttering her own prayer thus it just adds up more questions about the noragami. ,Noragami,cwzvfqe,6,t5_2yt0q
5793685,0,t1_cxf95kb,Most definitely. I think Noragami is one of those series that gets a ten in everything imho. The animation the story the lore and the soundtrack is fabulous. I hope that soon well get to have the soundtrack in digital form.,Noragami,cxf9f4r,3,t5_2yt0q
5831611,0,t1_cwzwil0,Yay! Im happy to discuss them! Sorry it took me forever to respond lifes been busy orzI agree that the symbolism is really strong with Amaterasu and while I would expect that such an important god would have been more recognized by the others though I guess Shinki might not know about her unless they met her before and her saying something like Im not anyone who is worth helping would be strange for the ruler of the gods to say the idea of Yato actually being someone important and good by nature is too good to pass up! I just want him to be happy and end up with Hiyori somehow Thats an interesting point about Nana! I want to learn more about her first but I can definitely see the resemblance between her and Yato.Adachitoka is so good at foreshadowing and hinting at stuff early on I would be surprised if everything didnt end up fitting together in the end! Yess share your father theories! Its been too long for me to remember but didnt you mention something about noticing that Noras been growing? Because I havent noticed that but now I need to go back and reread!..I agree. I dont think the manga is going to retread the same ground that happened with Tsuguha  though that did a good job setting up what a threat Fathers curse is but rather take a different approach like the theory mentioned! I almost cant imagine Yukine losing once that battle happens but either way Im sure itll be pretty epic!,Noragami,cxk1u5v,1,t5_2yt0q
6043941,0,t3_3xgzwt,I enjoyed the realistic depiction of the heaven crew who prayed to the heavens for the Pacification Ring by saying Ebisu if this holy attack misses you then you were innocent but if it hits you then you were always guilty and thus deserve to die...  then HYPOCRITICALLY after the first time they MISS thus proving Ebisu to be innocent they fire a second Ring at him anyways!!  And that second one misses too thanks to Yukine so rather than accept that Ebisu is clearly favored by the heavens and an innocent god they STILL have to attack him with that red light at the end of the episode.Yep... sounds like all of the religious zealots that I know.  Their faith is pretty much only there for them to reinforce their own preconceived biasopinions on how to view the world.  Kudos to the mangaka of Noragami for perfectly capturing the lack of objectivity in the perversion of spirituality.,Noragami,cybva50,1,t5_2yt0q

6243627,0,t3_411s2o,like others said yato has never had more than one shinki at a single time hiiro dosent count obviously and i also agree that yukine would get low key jealous as he is kinda possessive over Yato when it really comes down to it despite him always calling yato names and kicking him around lmao.   Also kazuma mentioned during the bishamonten arc that it takes a lot out of a god to support several shinki and as he is now i feel like having another would be more of a burden on him. But tbh i really want bishamon to release nana and have yato somehow end up with her as his shinki. something about her makes me think that shes be a great match for him and yukine. perhaps its her strong headedness or fearlessness in the heat of battle that reminds me of yato like how ebisun said his hafuri vessel yukine is just as reckless as he is during that last bit where yato cut the purification ring in half before ebi died PLUS I WANT YATO TO HAVE A ENCHANTED GARMENT SO HELL ALWAYS BE WAREING SOME KIND OF CUTE KIMONO!! ,Noragami,cyzbz9o,1,t5_2yt0q

7501485,0,t1_d2utuct,Yeah it has many shojo traits though. The story is often told from the perspective of the female MC Hiyori who is a seemingly ordinary girl meant to resonate with the female viewers. She is also sandwiched between  cute male characters Yato and Yukine. This is not surprising though because its written and illustrated by a female mangaka duo. I enjoy it its feminine themes are a refreshing change from the usual battle shonen.,Noragami,d2uvop2,4,t5_2yt0q

11797691,0,t3_689dh7,Whatever the issue is it seems like its been going on for a while.  First they stopped doing Shuuishuu chapters after the December  Christmas special then the chapter page count started dropping starting with chapter  in November  then it went on a complete hiatus for July and August .  Honestly I wouldnt be surprised if it was just plain old burnout or stressrelated and they just need a break.,Noragami,dgxb4d0,12,t5_2yt0q
