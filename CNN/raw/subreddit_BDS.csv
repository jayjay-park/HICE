388652,0,t1_cfkys66,Someone must be paying to act stupid  youve made yet another completely meaningless statement  Israel has repeatedly bombed flat all prisons and police stations in Gaza.So Gazans and the few Gazan policemen not already massmurdered by Israel up to  at a time are forced to do what they can to punish criminals in their society.Why are you criticising them for this?The Resistance in Warsaw did something very similar  what kind of sick person criticises Gazans for doing it?,BDS,cfl1sh3,1,t5_2s7ox
412290,1,t1_cfnh2gu,Im citing Livia Rokach daughter of Israel Rokach Minister of the Interior in the government of Moshe Sharett who saidgtIn the eyes of todays reader this plan seems an accurate blueprint for what took place in Lebanon after that  the civil war the establishment of the Maronite enclave of Major Sad Haddad and labeling it free Lebanon.Despite the Israeli foreign ministry threatening anyone who touched it the book was published in the United States. Israel never took legal action fearing that in the words of Knesset member Uri Avneri stopping the dissemination of the booklet would be a mistake of the first order since this would give it much more publicity. In  Livia Rokach was murdered in a Rome hotel room by persons unknown. What agency is it that specialises in murdering people in their hotel rooms?How come you dont know this stuff?,BDS,cfni06b,0,t5_2s7ox

1110847,0,t1_chujyov,Holy shit  youre right!  We dont link to ANYbody else!Well I also mod on rPalestine so Ill check into how the links are made.  Dunno about linking to rIsraelExposed.  Their stuff can get awfully nasty sometimes.  Then again if they link here . . . maybe.  We also have an insanely long list of links in rPalestine.  Ill check with some of the Mods in those other subs to see if theyd like to institute a crosslink agreement with us.  This effort is going to take a few days to a week anyway.I thought about crossposting to some of the more popular subreddits with xposted from rBDS in the post title.  Its a matter of having the time and making sure that the xpost is appropriate to their sub.I have some work to do obviously.,BDS,chuk869,2,t5_2s7ox
