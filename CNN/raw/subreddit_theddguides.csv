229031,0,t1_cf3uqpm,Its more than just the ilvl the lack of gemslots secondary stats and PvP power as a large contribution to the gear make it difficult for PvP players to even quest in the isle.its very difficult to solo the elites in the best pvp gear yet players in higher ilvl pve gear with significantly higher killing stats are autorocking  resil.Its not fun and since PvP does in spite of the loading screen tip cause repairs while pvp provides zero income....its just frustrating to say the least.,theddguides,cf4hjh7,1,t5_2zzp2
267607,0,t3_1wp4u7,My main is a tauren warrior and Ive been playing him since late BC. I choose him at the time because i wanted to be a protection warrior because everyone else at the time played a hunter and i wanted to feel more important to the groups i joined. I choose tauren mainly because of the  stamina buff and because of War Stomp at the time I though it did damage and stun like it did back in War and because at the time my friend told me they made the best tanks. Another contributing factor was their height and the size of their armor just felt like a perfect fit looked like they can take hits. I guess i originally chose them for their racials even though they didnt do much. Over the years though I have gotten bored of the taurens animations and they just dont look right to me anymore as he just stands there and raises his shield to indicate that he blocked or raising his sword and twisting it to their left to indicate a parry. Ive actually grown envious of the blood elfs tanking animations and i kinda wish my tauren can move like that the BE dodge animation looks incredible with a shield. ,theddguides,cf8hx6i,1,t5_2zzp2

420496,0,t3_1yvdem,No top  on this one. But ill say this. When horde and alliance are going together to take a stronger force. garrosh LK or something. Than for those dungeons they should make cross faction dungeon searcher. They shouldnt be able to do it all the time cuz that would go against the story line and would restrict them to shared enemies.,theddguides,cfoclzl,1,t5_2zzp2
455518,0,t3_1z2drw,Was exploring Dragon Soul the other day and found out that the Chamber of the Aspects under Wyrmrest Temple actually is there and has tentacle like things smashing through its walls. This area was not used for anything to my knowledge so it would be interesting to know what was supposed to be there.On other things that never made it I suppose the Emerald Dream which would have been an entire expansion. And on features Dance studio.,theddguides,cfs1htd,1,t5_2zzp2
520226,0,t3_1z2ruv,The easter egg I think is the most interesting is the WKM shrine in Orgrimmar. Youd have to get under the map and fly up into one of the rock spires. Im not sure if it was intentional for players to see but the fact is its there and it means something.,theddguides,cfzejxj,2,t5_2zzp2

1783541,0,t3_2ex2ut,Maybe since Bolvar is the new Lich King and is keeping the undead in check KelThuzad wants to keep the memory of the old Lich King by reforming the Scourge from Naxxaramas or a different necropolis. Then maybe we could either join forces with Bolvar or just go it with only Alliance and Horde. The end raid could be finally storming wherever KelThuzad is and finally putting an end to that awesome character.,theddguides,ck3ywgf,0,t5_2zzp2
1928623,0,t1_cklkjbw,Now all that said I dont think that any of this could save WoW. The majority of players that they would need to acquire or win back in order to get back to old numbers likely wouldnt care about most or any of what we typically consider endgame content. The fact of the matter is that WoW can never get back to those old numbers  or any numbers approaching them. But hear me out because this probably isnt going where you think.WoW simply put is old now. And it has much more and much stiffer competition. Sure there hasnt truly been a next WoW yet but this hints at several things I think. First the fact that everyone is still trying to be the next WoW says volumes about the games continued popularity. Its no longer in the golden age it experienced during BC or even arguablyto a lesser extent WotLK but the number of subscribers is by no means small. WoW is still the biggest MMO out there no matter how you look at it. In an industry that primarily charts its subscriptions in tens or hundreds of thousands WoW still counts in millions of subscribers.Secondly I believe that the majority of players who left were drawn to other MMOs. Given that these sprang up after WoW this is only natural. When all you have is Doom everyone who wants to shoot stuff is going to play Doom. But now theres Halo Gears of War Call of Duty and so on which are all dividing up the pool of players because each one offers something slightly different. Likewise when WoW came out it was very nearly the only option for immersive D RPG fun in a shared world with dozens of friends and thousands of strangers. Since then weve got countless MMOs which all do things slightly different. If you prefer a scifi environment theres Star Trek Online and SWTOR. If PvP is more your thing theres dozens of Asian MMOs. For people who enjoy playerdriven economies and the auction house theres EVE Online. Whatever your preference theres an MMO that does it better than WoW  except that WoW does the most things well enough. It doesnt shine in any particular area but it does perfectly decent or even great at all sorts of things from PvP to raiding to all the little side bits like battle pets WoW always has something to do if you ever tire of one aspect even if its just exploring or seeing what bizarre way you can get various spells and toys to interact see this  I challenge you to find another MMO that lets so many things that were never intended to be used together cooperate so well.And heres the last thing yes WoW looses hundreds of thousands or even a million subscribers on what appears to be a regular basis these days but I dont actually expect that to continue. Given all of the above I think that WoWs early advantage bubble is deflating and it will reach an equilibrium that could potentially be maintained for who knows how long  as long as Blizzard thinks ahead and plans for this which I think they already are to some extent or another with things like crossrealm. As long as Blizzard is wise about its budget and doesnt try to spend too much trying to win back too many players I could easily see them lasting another decade at the absolute least.As an aside I think its actually the RPers and those who are in for the lore who will turn out making up the majority of WoW subscribers. But that may just be because Im one of those more than I am a raider PvPer or even achievement hunter. p,theddguides,ckll2ml,1,t5_2zzp2
2105691,0,t3_2iwaf7,Which character in the Warcraft Universe do you think was spoiled the most over the jump from WC to WoW? Personally I think Cairne Bloodhoof or Tyrande who were really huge and exciting characters in WC. In WoW Cairne did nothing but DIE all the way up till Cataclysm.   Tyrande barely did anything up until CataMoP where she now gets depicted as a goodfornothing crybabyleader who has no idea how to do a single thing in warfare. Her voice actor also suddenly forgot how to do Tyrandes voice and now she sounds like the infamous female orc Aggra. In WC she was a force to be reckoned with but in MoP she gets outplayed by a ishyearold Human Varian Wrynn in terms of strategy like it was her very first time in battle. Blizz effectively killed off her awesomeness over the span from WC to WoW.,theddguides,cl7h9h7,1,t5_2zzp2
