749464,0,t1_cgp1jyt,Oh right duh. One of my favourite games that we play with the RAs for training every year is mousetrap. You need a big area to play this. First split the group into two teams and have them gather at the same side of the room. Then set up a whole bunch of mousetraps across the room. The whole point is to blindfold one person from each group and get someone else from the group to talk them through the mousetraps. Then get the people who were blindfolded to take the blindfold off take it back to the other team and talk a differnent person through. The team who gets all their team members through the course first wins. When we did it first time they made us kick our shoes off. Obviously this is optional. ,ResLife,cgpgy7k,1,t5_2sfkj
