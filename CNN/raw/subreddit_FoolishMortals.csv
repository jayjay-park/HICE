5627175,0,t3_3s4ya4,Hell yes!I was going to wait until tomorrow to play it but since Im not going to be able to sleep tonight Im just going to start playing it as soon as its installed after midnight. Ill play until I cant stay awake any longer!In terms of technical things I really like to get lost in the atmosphere of Bethesda games so that means a few things in terms of the stream being different from the other Zahkoo streams. Basically it means therell be no webcam and a lot less talking though Ill probably still be using the mic to talk to chat Im not going to be reacting and commentating as much as I would a normal stream.Im also going to try to be streaming at a higher bitrate than usual to keep as much of the visual quality of the game as possible.Im really glad youre interested Im definitely stoked to play the game!,FoolishMortals,cwuls4t,1,t5_3apte
