1355688,0,t1_ciltugh,I dont know.  That factory in Kettering still gets shipments by rail every once in a while.  Since Hewitt soap closed down there is no one else using that rail line.  Under federal regulations the railroads are considered a public utility so Norfolk Southern has to keep it open if someone is using it even though the railroad is almost certainly losing money maintaining it for so little traffic Keeping up  miles of track four bridges and well over a dozen grade crossings for two carloads a month?  Its nuts!.Maybe if we prod Norfolk Southern or Tenneco they may find a way to do this with trucks.Three years ago I saw the only train that runs on that line  It is seen here near the Valley Thrift Store on Woodman Drive.  Ive seen it once since.  It always has one car.  Im told it runs twice a month.,bikedayton,cim85k9,4,t5_2zb9b
2263307,0,t3_2jx7u1,I was in the same boat looking for the same kind of bike and I shopped both Kettering and KampG in Kettering. I got great service both places but ultimately I liked the Trek . and . I rode at Kettering better than the Giants they had in stock at the time at KampG. Might be different now.  Ill probably shop for more of a road bike in the next year or two and Ill happily shop both again. ,bikedayton,clrgqv8,1,t5_2zb9b
3824244,0,t3_346m5c,If I have friends visiting I may use them but I tend to keep a few loaner bikes in my garage so Im definitely not the target market.  Unfortunately Im mostly just curious to see what kind of Daytoney think thing happens to them.  I might have to borrow one sometime just to try out the bikes.edit  thing not think,bikedayton,cqs731q,3,t5_2zb9b
