2548463,0,t3_2oq3ah,Apply at the end of second semester for the  coop prep course.. GPA is needed. It cannot drop below that after you have started the prep class. If your GPA drops below in third semester you are no longer eligible for coop and wont be refunded the . Thats for the class not the guarantee of a job.If concerned go to the tech office on the second floor of T building and talk to the coop coordinator not your program coordinator.Keep in mind ukatterman was right this is not an official sub. Im just a student about to finish CNS. ,Seneca,cmr7z17,1,t5_2spdb

6825246,0,t3_4903i7,I had a future due  charges for the full tuition when I made the payment it started to show no outstanding charges. I presume thats because I dont owe Seneca anything until the expiry date of my admission offerand they will charge me that day. Id love some clarification as well. Either way see you on summer bro!

7042314,0,t1_d1ejd25,Have you tried the Newnham campus residence yet? Theres a free shuttle bus that goes between the Seneca campuses I think it takes like  minutes to from Newnham to York. Theres not much to do around SY after classes but so what? Youll be in the biggest city in Canada. Get a car or a metropass and youll never have to be bored I recommend the metropass parking fees are hell in TOSadly I dont know of any other large student communities. Look on kijiji or craigslist though there are many landlords who rent rooms out specifically to students.,Seneca,d1elqgq,2,t5_2spdb
