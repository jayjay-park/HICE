Meh my dude felt bad that we didnt get to have the proper proposal and all that jazz before so he planned it for a later point in time than the marriage i.e. signing paperwork.

790064,0,t3_234u8p,I didnt get to do it in a special way only because the proposal itself was so special.  He did it in front of his parents and all of our friends at his Masters graduation.  It was videotaped and photographed by a lot of people so glad to have it.. I cant watch it though because it makes me cry every time.  Everyone was immediately posting pictures and stuff to Facebook.  I didnt want my family finding out that way so I had to call them in the car on the way to the postgraduation restaurant to tell them.  They were all really happy about the engagement and about the fact that they didnt find out about it on social media.,JustEngaged,cgu31je,1,t5_2w13j

1325468,1,t3_296rwh,Im a little bit late here but...Definitely not weird. I totally understand where youre coming from! My fianc didnt even end up proposing bit of a long story I asked him for a redo since after talking about it he realised how important it is to me seems a bit silly but the circumstances of our engagement were very disappointing. Just talk to him about it ask him to do a faux proposal when you two do your engagement shoot this is what were doing so I get the nice words pretty scenery and pictures of it all none of which I got the first time or recreate it at your engagement party if youre having one or something so you can share it with everyone and make it super memorable instead of giving off the impression that what he did just wasnt good enough. Especially since he was originally planning something big hes probably a bit bummed out that it didnt pan out and could be open to the idea. ,JustEngaged,ciiqd6z,-3,t5_2w13j
1455617,0,t3_2astze,I know how you feel. The weather was uncooperative and he had no contingency plan. My ring doesnt fit cant be resized and gives me a rash recycled metal maybe its not pure silver. I feel horrible for being disappointed. I told him months beforehand if he was serious I needed to be professionally sized but nope. No time for that. I guess the  minute drive to the mall was too far. He does so much for me I just expected more. There were no horses cupcakes or chocolate involved and thats what Id told him I would like for years. It isnt that I dont love him or dont want to marry him or that Im not grateful for him. Its that I get this one proposal that Ive waited for for a long time and he knew it was important to me. It didnt have to be fancy I asked for candy and a horseback ride or just extra candy and maybe a stuffed horse. Thanks for letting me vent.,JustEngaged,ciyqjec,6,t5_2w13j
1498510,0,t3_2bd1mn,Steve knows me well but hes never been able to pinpoint my vintage meets modern taste in jewelry. So he wasnt about to pick out a ring for me. Smart boy.  He proposed with a big ol leopard heart ring he won for me at an arcade early on. And he timed the proposal perfectly Over the holidays when I had lots of time off... and could spend it all ring shopping. Fun!Ultimately I had something so specific in my head I ended up working with a local designer to pull it off. Though it was pretty nerve wracking and I often thought Id end up not loving it Im so very happy he did it this way. I cant imagine a more perfect ring for me. ,JustEngaged,cj442hu,5,t5_2w13j

Emeralds are not as hard as diamonds or sapphires yes but I dont like diamonds or white stones as centre stones in general and we lived in Colombia for awhile so the Colombian emerald we picked up there won out over any sapphire.

As someone who also had to scour the internet for what we wanted in our matching wedding bands and our requests were more onerous and complicated than yours I will recommend the Etsy seller we decided to use Stonebrook Jewelry The guys out of Utah and makes many kinds of custom rings. We have not received the bands yet but he was super helpful and Im confident hell deliver on our order. He can make any of his rings to any width and if you message him Im sure hed do a matte titanium band with a rose gold inner sleeve no problem.

My wedding band is approximately a  carat of diamonds.My husband has a jeweller in the family so he only paid for the materials at cost. I believe that the total cost of the set was between  though my husband has never confirmed. It was appraised at  five years ago. I would never have spent  on a set as that is a crazy amount of money for young folks but that being said I adore my set even after having it for half a decade. Although I loved my wedding gown and party I am glad that my husband spent the extra on the ring and we spent less on the day.

If her friends are really her friends anyway theyll be happy for her no matter what!

They made my fiances ring totally custom with the autocad rendering and everything and it turned out great so they dont just do premade settings. They also fixed my ring which was from a different jeweler and replaced my morganite center stone with a moissanite and I couldnt be happier.

11118301,0,t1_der59nj,I really must say that it seems you have a real breakdown in communication. That is at the core of your issue. Im glad you were able to talk. Did you get what you wanted out of that talk? Do you feel your feelings and desires were addressed? Did you tackle your issues? Unwanted surprise proposal. You propose in a traditional way and she sees this as you dominating the relationship. Im sure you didnt see that coming. So what does engagement mean to each of you? How would the ideal proposal look? What does marriage signify? Mismatched expectations for roles in the relationship. What rules do you want to play by? The game only works if you both know the expectations. Unclear understanding of how it will proceed in the future. A lot of people need a clear plan to commit to first. Who is moving? How will you live together?w Do you want to get legally married? When? How will finances work? Do you want children and if so when? How will jobs work? Generally a proposal should come after these questions are all but answered and the formal engagement is just making it official. Holding out for equal sacrifice. This is the one that stuck out to me. She wants you to sacrifice the same. She views you proposing as taking away her agency. She views her moving as giving up more than you. Why does she feel that way?That honestly seems an unusual viewpoint to me. Relationships cant be split  all the time. Its not practical. Sometimes one person has to bend a little more to make it work then later it might be the others turn. Especially with moving thats just a practicality. You are now holding out for her to show initiative. Why do you want that? Is it that you want to see her investment? Or are you too holding out for equal sacrifice? Did you tell her that and do you think she will? Why do you want to get married and how long are you willing to put that on hold? Your feelings are equally important. You deserve to be heard. You are half of this. Frankly this relationship sounds exhausting. Your post really reads confused and tired and talks almost all about what she wants. I think you should ask yourself if this has the potential to give you the life you want in the timeframe youre comfortable with or if you might need to let each other go. Timing is half the battle and even a great relationship sometimes just doesnt hit you at the right time in life to go where you want to. Or maybe you jusy got your wires crossed and moving in together might be a great next step while you figure out how to tackle the future!,JustEngaged,des90rx,6,t5_2w13j
