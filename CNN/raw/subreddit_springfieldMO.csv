3256677,0,t3_2x92zs,I dont see anything wrong with this article.  The author didnt try to sell anything she didnt oppose or condone the use of essential oils.  She simply presented a brief interview with a homeopathic doctor and a brief interview with a satisfied user.  In fact the doctor even cautions potential users about the risks of essential oils arguably more so than she recommends them.If youre looking for a more indepth scientific research you wont find much and there are reasons why.  Here is an excellent article about the research of essential oils explaining why research is difficult and why there is very little.  It references several studies that corroborate many of the claims of positive benefits.Finally who are you to judge someone for making a life decision to create a better existence by conducting odd or unpopular remedies?  If it makes someone feel better why criticize them even if it is a placebo effect? I add this part because the tone of the post feels like more of a jab at essentialoilusinghippies than at a poorlywritten article.,springfieldMO,cozkdd6,-2,t5_2qiap

You already got great suggestions. My frequents are Commercial Street as a whole where Askinosie Chocolate      Big Mommas and Lindebergs are all located Mothers Marias Nonnas and City Butcher are great eats.

7570776,0,t3_4izx7t,Burrell behavioral health  Center an extension of the hospital is a resource Ive had prior experience with.  They can set you up with regular meetings with a range of professionals including psychiatrists if you believe her condition is serious enough to warrant the support of a medication.  But dont just stop there if she  needs meds shell need counseling too to help her cope and better work through the process of recovery.  Since youve seen this before its important to give the professionals the details of her history and they can take it from there.  But if you think shes in a serious risk of harming herself andor others dont hesitate to seek help immediately. The hospital may take in patient services but that usually amounts to sitting in the hospital for a few days under evaluation and supervision. From personal experience this is an acute fix if its reached a state of emergency. Otherwise I suggest you talk to Burrell and ask to speak with a nurse in private about her circumstances and dont hold back in explaining your fears or darker observations. Its important they know the gravity of her situation if you dont want to be stuck waiting days for an appointment feeling like youre not getting anywhere.  Best of luck with with you and the one you care deeply about. Let her know how much you need and love her in your life and you only want her life to be easier for her to manage on her own terms but theres no shame or failure to do so through asking for help and utilizing your resources. Sorry to babble but this is something I take very seriously having been a consumer of these types of services in the past. Stay strong and be well! ,springfieldMO,d32rdrn,9,t5_2qiap

9780344,0,t3_5dgxlo,TMobile is definitely the service with the strongest signal in town as far as Ive seen.  Ive had problems with the strength of the signals indoors though.  At my work I lose signal completely in certain rooms.  As far as auto switching Ive had some minor issues with it.  Down towards Ozark it puts me on Sprint with an oknotgreat signal and when I drive into Springfield it doesnt always switch over to TMobile when the sprint signal becomes totally useless.  I use the Signal Info app to force it over to TMobile when this happens. I have only had some experience with the free wifi switching but had no issues.  Its nice to see it jump on a wifi and show the encryption icon at the top.I switched from Verizon and its definitely been worth it monetarily.  Depends how much data you use though.
