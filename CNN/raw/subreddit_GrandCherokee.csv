Go to a tire shop and ask them to balance the front tires.  If youre lucky they will just need to put weights on.  Otherwise they might find a rim thats been bent out of true.

3751819,0,t3_33cae3,A few years ago I did a complete AC rebuild on my WJ Laredo. Most frustrating part was taking out the dash. Finding all the bolts to remove the dash was quite the chore.

Same goes for the evaporator core.  of the work to replace those parts is the removal of the dash.

10070137,0,t3_5jz6xa,Possibly.  I know the exhaust runs under the lines but Id figure theyd be able to work around it.  It shouldnt be a big item though the bolts like to rust up pretty bad on the connector collars and are prone to just twisting off instead of coming apart gracefully.  If it were me Id try to do it without removing the exhaust.  As if they can try it that way and only charge you if it becomes necessary to remove it.  Youll be able to tell if they actually did because the bolts on that collar will be very visibly messed with.,GrandCherokee,dbk5tjw,1,t5_2tt1d

10358286,0,t3_5obu96,Youll need a proper  axle car trailer with brakes on BOTH axles and a brake controller in the ZJ.  You need a weight distribution hitch and a BIG transmission cooler for the ZJ and you wont be able to put much weight in the ZJ.  Keep the trans locked out of OD when towing and plan to avoid any overly steep hills that load will be tough with a ..  Figure XJ  trailer is around    lbs.  Expect anywhere from    mpg depending on hills wind etc.  And I wouldnt plan to do more than  with that much weight behind a ZJ.  Note I say this having towed a ZJ behind my ZJ.  Be aware the math isnt going to work out well for this unless you wanted to buy a car trailer anyway.  I can almost guarantee you wont find a worthwhile car trailer for .  And youll spend another couple hundred on a weight distribution hitch to keep the ZJ stable with that much trailer behind it.  A car dolly front wheel lift type is no good for this thats far far too much weight for not having trailer brakes.  ,GrandCherokee,dci67r2,2,t5_2tt1d
