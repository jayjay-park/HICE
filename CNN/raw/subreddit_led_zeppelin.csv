The music I listened to was because it was popular because I thought people would think I was cool for listening to or because it was what my friends listened to. That film inspired in me a true love music particularly guitar of rock and roll and a desire to know about music and the people who created it.

To some people Zeppelin sounds like loud steelmill sounds interspersed with orgasm vocalizations. I would suggest those people give a listen to this song or this album by LZ to give them a different taste of them but I wouldnt say theyre wrong.

Meanwhile Robert had sworn off hard drugs after the death of his son in  and Jonesy was always the relatively clean family man of the bunch. In that light its obvious to see how the two camps developed. Im sure it hit Jimmy hard. Led Zeppelin was his lifes work even if he admitted that hed likely not see the age of . Even today hes still doggedly protecting Zeppelins legacy where JPJ and Robert have had multiple successful projects between them. When Bonzo died Jimmy didnt play guitar for three years. Led Zeppelin was everything to him in a way unlike the rest of the band. All this is beside his personal feelings for Bonzo.,led_zeppelin,cvq8fhw,7,t5_2shnv

6405773,0,t3_42m9tl,It is a very nice video and playing. I think the last part with guitar solo has a rhythm problem. It does not get funk at all or change in dynamic enough. It still feels like classical folk instead of a transition into an epic cloud burst of lightning and thunder.
