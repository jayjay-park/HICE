9050291,0,t1_d7zl5t6,Greninja has good speed and combos but his attacks have a lot of endlag and his counter sucks as well as him having some difficulty finishing off opponents sometimes. Overall pretty decent otherwise though.Dont let the meta analysis get in the way of your character loving though if you enjoy his playstyle go for it m!,thebluememeroom,d7zp8po,1,t5_3g1dc
