27508,0,t1_cehjwc8,Excellent response it did make me think outside my box. I my be quick in my reaction to label her NPD or BPD but there is something with her. My therapist that i saw for depression did ask if she was BPD and gave she me a book on how to live with someone with BPD and it did work for a time. My family from that start saw something wrong with her but i was in love and saw past her faults and her family caudle her so as not to upset the apple cart. ,NarcissisticAbuse,cehkbj9,4,t5_2ys1m
327419,0,t1_cfen2np,Hahaha check out TOTALLY a hoovering thing. Suddenly the things youd always begged for them to do theyre more than happy to do eager to do!My ex did something very similar. He hated anything that required anything of him obviously so he refused to do anything like Christmas dinners he hated Christmas on the whole though hed still throw a fit if I didnt buy him stuff...Then suddenly in the last week were talking and Im telling him I really dont want to be with him anymore within a few days of me going NC actually which occurred November  the conversation goesNx Do you have any plans for Christmas?Me Nope.Nx Could I please come visit you?Me Nope.Nx I just really want to spend Christmas with you it would mean so much to me.Me Doubt it.Nx Please? It would mean so much to me if we could have a Christmas dinner and a Christmas tree and all.Me Hah. Bullshit. You never liked Christmas.Nx What do you have someone else youre spending Christmas with? Is that why you dont want to spend it with me?Me No I told you I dont.Nx Then why wont you spend it with me?Me Id rather be alone than be with you.Nx Who is it? Who is this person youll be spending Christmas with?Me Nobody.Nx I wish youd just be honest enough to tell me who it is. For all the times you insist that youre so proud of who you are because I came out as queer and he insisted I was just saying it because at that point Id never been with another girl you wont tell me honestly who this person is.Clearly he was figuring out that hes about to lose his hold on me...,NarcissisticAbuse,cfephjg,8,t5_2ys1m

540026,0,t3_20ahd4,I totally understand and agree.I think this last bit though Id like to rewordgt Be polite if you can avoid going into reasons do so. Take the fault on yourself if you have to I know this is reminiscent of the Nrelationship but maybe do it one last time to save your friends some hurt.Take the fault on yourself if you have to yes but its not for your friends and its not to save them any hurt. Its to protect YOU. Not telling them or saying something like I cant handle that right now so Im taking mespace or some variation thereof is perfectly acceptable but it is not FOR your friends. It is FOR you and to protect you. If they are under the Nspell enabling explicitly or through inaction then telling them would hurt YOU not them. So dont tell them. Youre already going NC for your own protection so remember thats your focus.Im rambling. Sorry. I just feel its intensely important to know that youre doing these things for YOU and YOUR wellbeing and this is a GOOD thing. If the collateralpeople dont understand thats okay. Its even okay if they think its your fault just as long as YOU are SAFE in going NC.Besides if you told them honestly it wont really affect them weve seen time and again that telling collateralpeople uGreay has referred to them before as flying monkeys people under the Nspell doesnt help them leave or see things any more clearly. What it does do though is often put you at greater risk as you try to go NC.So if you have to let other people go when leaving the abuser it sucks but its okay to tell them nothing. Its even okay to lie somewhat but you know and say something like Im taking time away to focus on other things so not quite true maybe not quite a lie but enough to get them to respect NC...Does my ramble make ANY sense?

1229490,0,t1_ci64jii,Thats a good balanced perspective and I like the way you view it.  I agree with you for all the mental illnesses except for the cluster B personality disorders.  Cluster B disorders have levels of stigma that the other mental illnesses dont and I hate to say it but its because theyve earned a stigma.  These are all disorders that are primarily characterized by treating loved ones really shitty.  Its hard to overlook that and its hard to not have feelings about that.  But Im highly biased on this  my ex was borderline and I went through hell.  I have nothing but the utmost of compassion and desire to help someone who is struggling with a mental illness but I have to say after my experience of dating someone with borderline my best suggestion to everyone who is dating someone with borderline is to save yourself and get out.  This is not what I think about the other mental illnesses  just the cluster Bs.  ,NarcissisticAbuse,ci7xomr,1,t5_2ys1m

My wife uses my previous pornography use to deflect attention away from her and it worked pretty well. Ive gone to counseling and worked very hard to stop using porn but the therapist kept coming back to it. I am hoping that once the therapist starts making suggestions on things we could try changing my wifes total lack of responsibility for problems in the marriage will reveal itself. I will try to make an honest effort and see if I can show that I am better than the person my wife tries to portray. I will also be seeing my own therapist soon which will cause a big fight Im sure but I know its important and maybe I can get some advice there on how to proceed. Thanks for your comments I will definitely be journaling my experience and impressions. ,NarcissisticAbuse,ckxsyr7,2,t5_2ys1m
2073737,0,t3_2iljmn,Yes. I think that should be expected from an N because nothing is ever an Ns fault. Its a good tactic because it focuses the attention and argument on someone else. If you take the time to explain yourself even just for a second you give N the opportunity to start attacking you. It can be difficult to see whether someone is FLEAridden or an N.I thought my former friend was FLEAridden but when I ended the friendship with her she threw a tantrum with manipulative tactics and then said that Id lost the privilege of talking to her. I would call her an N now. Looking back at everything I can also count a number of instances where she would manipulate me into doing things withfor her put me down for no reason refuse to take the blame for things that were at least partially her fault but had no trouble attacking me  guess that was one of the privileges make up drama to elicit attention and a bunch of other crap that a bad friend would do. She was very selfcentered.The tantrum worked in the sense that I am still pissed off she is that delusional but at least now we know shes a special kind of crazy.,NarcissisticAbuse,cl3f1e8,3,t5_2ys1m
2090824,0,t1_cl5k46i,Its amazing how easy it is to get stuck in the relationship. I didnt leave even after I knew things were getting bad. I started to dismiss things and make excuses for him. It wasnt until he escalated the abuse to physical that I left. He actually said you are making me do this to you. The issue....i went to bed too early instead of staying up to entertain him. That moment was like a massive mirror to my life. At that point I knew I would have to seriously lie to myself to excuse it. As terrifying as it was he tried to stop me from calling the police by tackling me or my phone. Luckily the call made it thru it ended up being a gift. It was the jolt I needed to see things clearly. I feel like I was lucky. Had that not happened I might have been stuck longer. Being free from him is beyond words wonderful. Even with the struggles of starting over.

2186711,0,t3_2k0rl4,It sounds to me like you already know  exactly what you need  what happened  what is an appropriate response for someone to give to your story. It sounds to me like you are wise and strong albeit understandably traumatized.   you need him gone  no longer intruding in your life or thoughts with his insane irrational and cruel abuse.Out of the life is easier than out of the thoughts.  Heres whats worked for me... debriefing talk about it as much as you  want. Write about it.  Fuck people who say you are obsessing dont talk to them about it  because they have no idea what theyre talking about. There is a reason you feel the need to discuss what happened it was traumatic. You have to sort out what happened before you can calm down. education READ. google. Look up  Patricia evansThe cycle of abusePtsd or cptsdCodependencyIdealize Devalue Discard cycle John Bradshaw Narcissism  caveat there is a popular youtuber named Sam Vaknin. His videos helped me to some extent but  realize that he is himself a narcissist. Because of this he lacks compassion and tends to cast narcsissists as all powerful supervillians. This can be toxic of youre trying to get over an abusive relationship. And anything else you can get your hands on AudiosI listened to these almost constantly when i was suffering the most. I recommend the free audios at www.excelatlife.com  especially Rational Thinking and Lies You Were Told. Another set of recordings that really helped me were from the I  Can Be Free app from HumanProgress in google play. There are other good free audios available online and in app stores.  You need to know what happened.You do need to know this. Its likely that what happened is that youve encountered a person with an extreme lack of compassion and am extremely sick and irrational worldview. Youll sort all this out by debriefing and educating yourself. With respect to his new victimThe only difference between his view of her and of  you is likely that he sees you as a human being and her as a lifeless doll into which he projects his mommy fantasy.  He used to see you this way but stopped when it became clear that i dunno youre a fucking person... And hes probably so insane that he considers this to be a harmful act by you onto him. Hes freaking crazy. You need to feel safe and supported. This will come in time. Let yourself learn to breathe again. You just had the wind knocked out of you.  The key here is NOT to beat yourself up about being anxious depressed panicky or paranoid.  For a great help toward learning how to do this listen to the Rational Thinking audio i recommend above. You need to be reassured that you are still the beautiful person you once felt you were.You are you are you are. You are so beautiful and strong and i admire you.  Go do the things you love to do. If you cant manage that take time to remember doing them vividly.  If you cant even remember take the time to try to list them on paper or in your mind or ask someome who knows you. If you cant do that eat a single peice of chocolate or give a beggar some change without worrying about what they will spend it on.And if you cant do that weep. Grieve. When we grieve something we are giving dignity to those who suffer. Weep for yourself and then weep for all others who suffer too. I still do this sometimes. And know that next time i do it i will have you in mind and heart. Because i care about you and your suffering and i believe your suffering is worth crying over. I am right now actually. But i also believe that as long as i  have compassion it must be true that others do as well. And the world must be full of love besides the suffering.  And if there is love there is also life and hope and joy. So i know that life hope and joy are available to all of us who love and grieve. So remember that you are worth your grief and that grief brings the reward of compassion and hope. Im here to talk if you need an ear. ,NarcissisticAbuse,clhs8cd,3,t5_2ys1m

Before the service my sister ducked into the bathroom to avoid him and he actually literally stood at the door knocking and calling for her to come out while she cried inside.  During the memorial service he went to the podium to say a few words about his mother and he ended up giving a ten minute speech about how we all depend on our mothers and how my younger sister the one who he cornered in the bathroom always cried for our mother instead of him.  Then he sang a song.  I wish I were joking.  Later our uncle hosted a reception at his house where we could eat my dad cornered me and asked for my phone number.  I said no I wont give it to him.  Then he got flippant and he demanded to know why.  I told him that its because hes unhealthy and I dont want contact with him anymore.  My dads cousin overheard this and came behind me putting her hand on my shoulder.  Leave her alone George. she said.  Its okay lookingforaforest you dont have to explain anything.

3587236,0,t1_cq146kq,Youre welcome! Leaving your wife isnt the same thing as giving up on your family or relationship. It takes two people to make a healthy relationship. Narcissists dont want a healthy relationship they want their needs fulfilled no matter the cost. If one of you is constantly putting in the effort and the other wont then its her who has given up. Do you want your son to be in this kind of relationship when he grows up? Because you are molding what love looks like for him right now. When he sees you being treated this way thats what hell think is normal when he starts dating. Divorcing your wife will set an example for him that you dont stay with people who treat you like that.

Why wont you leave me alone? We both know I am just a resource to you. You dont come around when I pull back and am not so generous with you. Why is it you flirt with me and touch me then when I think we are good you go ahead and make it clear that were nothing like that? Why is it when I ask you to not contact me anymore you do the opposite? You have already explained that you found other positive people. Well if Im not a positive person they why not leave me like we both agreed and you just hang with them? Maybe because they dont buy you food smokesweed and whatever else your heart desires. Why is it when we fight you are the first to say bye and when I say bye too you come back. You come back with why am I the one always coming back? youre lucky or we would have split up along time ago... How am I supposed to process this? Why do you think you are superior over everyone?

I found this extremely helpful as the therapist focused on me on reminding me that I was sane decent and worthy of love. For my own story One night whilst walking home from a bar my nex held me by the throat over a motorway bridge tried to force me to have sex in a public park. When we got back home I slept with him to shut him up. We had both been drinking. The next morning he accused ME of rape and of taking advantage of HIM because hed been drunk. He would do all manner of shitty things to me and not once did he ever apologise but if I did one small bad thing I was the Worst Human Being Ever and I would find myself grovelling for his forgiveness. Eventually he had me brainwashed. As for his friends...well my Nexs friends all figure him out eventually and all his ex girlfriends do. A few of them even went behind his back to warn me off him.

I myself didnt even realise I was being emotionally abused because he was lying and manipulating me and telling me what I wanted to hear.

She can have access to your child without being allowed in your home. You can arrange visits in advance and if you want you can even set it up where you never have to see her if you have family nearby  for example you take the child to your mothers and leave Nex picks up the child there and then brings the child back there after the visit then you go get the child and bring them home. Even if you dont need to go that far you can insist that visits be scheduled not as she pleases. If I misunderstood then disregard but thats my first thought.,NarcissisticAbuse,cydcgla,0,t5_2ys1m

6292558,0,t1_cz4hl6t,Mine didnt thank me for helping but did pick someone pretty similar me except at least in my opinion not as good looking.  And would talk about how this thing or that thing was perfect about him and it was something where he and I were really similar. Hes such a logical thinker that it balances me out and its just perfect exactly what I need that sort of thing. That was a bit frustrating until I went LowContact and hid her FaceBook stories from my newsfeed and just started doing things for me started runningworking out that sort of thing.And the taking out annoyances on me was a common theme too. Our last big fight the one where she stopped talking to me for a year was over her wrist hurting. Im a thousand miles away theres nothing I can do and Ive played this game before and I know its not a game that you play and win. So I decide to give her the option not to play and if she pushes Im going to lose in the way thats most entertaining for me. I tell her to put it on ice or stop complaining about it. But it really hurts. Like I said Ive played this game enough to know that with her there is no right way to approach this and whatever I saydo will be judged to be inadequate so I just go all out as far as a really wrong way and just make fun of her. I dont call her names or insult her but I just dont take her seriously at all.I dont understand how people think its okay to just take out anger they feel due to random annoyances on people they claim to care about. Doesnt make the slightest bit of sense to me.I guess here I have more time to compose my thoughts and you dont get that I go from not crying for over a year to now having a month span where I havent gone more than  or  days without crying. And how Ive gone from knowing for sure who I am to now being unsure and sort of confused because Im realizing some of the things I knew about myself werent actually true. I think I projected my own empathy onto my N while she projected her lack of empathy onto me. So I walked around for years thinking I was on the cusp of being a sociopath and working extra hard not to hurt people before realizing that sociopaths dont care if they hurt people thats what makes them sociopaths. But thats what I think. I still feel like Im just this blundering buffoon who is so emotionally stunted that he cant help but hurt people at every turn because hes just so clumsy with people.But I have good friends around me who can show me who I really am I just have to trust them and be willing to be vulnerable enough to open up about the doubts I have. And to not think of myself as a burden for having to check often.And Journalist huh? Ill keep it all in mind. Im sure hearing similar stories is helpful too.

I dont want to be another parental figure that just becomes absent.Im also becoming increasingly aware of just how much shes using me and shes aware of it as well.  Last night she said Well one good thing about you moving out is that Ill lose a ton of weight since Im too lazy to just get out of bed to get myself something.  Small meaningless comment  She wasnt even asking me to get her something.  But it was the moment when I realized just how many little things she asks of me every day that I do because hey its a simple thing.

You have to realize youre not dealing with a normal human being with a normal emotional life and hes exploiting your sensitivity in these matters.Your plan sounds smart. I did the same thing with my narcissistic exgirlfriend. You can meet in person to tell him its over  as long as youve already moved out and you meet in a public place.After youre out lessen your contact over time. Shoot for a weening over a period of months instead of cold turkey. But until youve escaped with your stuff stay quiet.Best of luck.Edit Btw my relationship which lasted a little more than  years played out the exact same way. Mostly happy days until I moved in with her after  months and then all hell broke loose. It was the most toxic abusive environment Ive ever experienced. And it didnt stop and it didnt get better. When the final reckoning of our relationship came she even said she would never live again with a man until they were married. I suppose shes getting more savvy with her manipulations.

You can keep him in your life on the current basis as a friend and sometimes lover and be ok with that or you decide that isnt the right kind of relationship for you and cut him loose.  When you threaten to cut him loose he starts being more affectionate because this relationship works great for him and he doesnt want to lose it.  That burst of affection doesnt mean hes going to turn into a proper boyfriend it is just meant to string you along further.

Listen your choices your attempts to assert your boundaries and independence none of that is what made her try to commit suicide. You are not responsible for hershe was your guardian. You arent obligated to her.If shes mentally unwelland it certainly sounds like she isthen you moving back in with her or contacting her wont fix that anymore than you growing up with her fixed it. She needs professional help and you cant provide that no matter how guilty you feel.I bet rraisedbynarcissists could provide you with a lot of resources and support.Trust your gut. Youre not crazy or wrong for thinking your Aunts behavior is weird abnormal or hurtful. You mention she gaslighted you sometimes and that she made you feel stupid or incompetent thats not okay or normal and of course growing up under her thumb is going to make it difficult for you not to trust your own feelings and decisions!Narcissists teach us how to stop listening to ourselves and to put the Ns needs above our own even above our safety and wellbeing.Internet hugs if you want them. I hope you find the support you need and continue on the road to untangling what I imagine is a pretty intense flood of thoughts and feelings so you can heal and feel whole and confident. Best of luck!Edit And I just want to add that I think you should go wholly no contact with her block her friends her flying monkeys as the N lingo goes and try your best to keep moving forward. Of course you shouldnt make any decision that makes you think of killing yourself!

I am a masochist Ive realised. I love the pain. I started torturing myself emotionally when I was about  years old and eventually I grew to love it.  I nearly cry when I look back at myself as a kid and see the torment I was going through. But its like Im not looking at me Im looking at a kid that is dead and gone.My first narc when I was  was a shocker. First proper girlfriend. I was desperate to impress her because shed had way more life experience than me. Didnt realise she was a druggy but I managed to break her and expose her to her family at the end. To my shock she got sympathy when she ruined herself on a drug and alcohol binge and ended up in hospital to manipulate me after I broke up with her. Again her mother was enabling her and in fact had created her. Her father had abandoned the whole situation when she was  years old. And that caused the separation trauma that ruined her as a human. I didnt identify what the problem with her was. I put it down to drug abuse damage. Told her she was drug fucked and infertile because of it. I moved to Australia to escape her clutches because she was just lovehate cycling me and I was super desperate for her attention. Only realised last year that her problem was borderlinenarcissism. Id accused her of being bipolar. I actually made her mother cry when I broke down in front of her. Id outed her as physically abusive also. But she always seemed to get a pass no matter how bad her behaviour. It was like taking crazy pills.Im feeling a load lifted off my shoulders by giving up the dream of a family. If it happens it happens. But theres nothing I hate worse than false hope. And it would be completely unfair to bring a child into an emotionally toxic environment. I dont wish my experiences on my worst enemies.Staring into the cavernous blackhole abyss that is the narcissist is terrifying when you finally identify it.,NarcissisticAbuse,d8cudbs,1,t5_2ys1m

Narcs are a different breed though.Your exstepdad probably contacted you because he was looking for a flying monkey.  You can google flying monkey narcissist for my info on that.  Or he was looking for info on your mom.  Narcs are usually deceptive and you cant trust that their stated purpose is really what they are seeking.Good for your mom for getting out and thank you for being supportive of her.  just dont respond to the narc anymore,NarcissisticAbuse,d9hi2fl,2,t5_2ys1m

You are certainly entitled to pick who is part of your life. You dont have to be nasty about it and you definitely dont have to put thought or energy into it and waste it on him. Hes nothing to you.

I would get emails texts and cards after I left him that lamented how everything was his fault and he totally understood why I left. Then a day or so would go by and he would suddenly be blaming me for everything again. I knew the apologies were bs when he made blanket statements without apologizing for anything specific.

11087657,0,t1_denwa2a,Similar story here. He eventually left me alone and moved on to someone else and quickly had a child with her. Surprise they are no longer together. I think she was just smart. I actually kinda like her shed call him out on his bull shit in front of me then look at me with  ya know ??  eyes. Id try not to think of it as grooming your child though. Siblings from other step parents just happens and you want to be the better person. Because your daughter is technicallyNo not even technically REALLY is going to be a Big Sister and is going to love that person for the rest of her life way beyond you and your ex being ancient history. It would be her family and you want to serve as a good role model to both the children that you nuture their relationship. My son is  and his little brother is . He absolutely adores his big brother and wants to do everything like him. i even let him come stay over sometimes because its not his fault who his dad is and frankly hes a sweet little kid. I do my best to respect my sons relationship with his father because no matter how much of an asshat he is he loves him. If I tried to interfere with that then that makes me a NARC. Narc in the sense that I think only I matter to my childs  development. If I acted like that then Id be no better than him.,NarcissisticAbuse,deoryax,6,t5_2ys1m

11109745,0,t3_5ylzkg,Im the one that was left by a NPDBPD. My friends told me for  years to leave but for religious and other reasons I didnt. When my stb NX left I practiced the coparenting style of split parenting. It was  one sided as she kept info from me gave up parenting time to go on trips with new gf lied to kids about it and refused to coordinate childrens activities. When I confronted her via email about the lack of coparenting and asked her to join me to coparent she gave an honest answer. She stated that the best she could do for now or ever was parallel parent. The childrens lives at each house is distinct separate and isolated from the other. So she is making a choice to live her selfcentered life with the top priorities being the new girlfriend trips to the beach and concerts and the latest social cause. BTW she is a well known respected and successful family therapist that teaches coparenting. She couldnt do coparenting while we were married and admitted that she cant do it now. If her peers and patients knew how fucked up she was and the unethical professional things shed done she would lose her business and maybe her license. Ive have been advised to protect myself emotionally coparent in a limited manner documentjournal every thing and in a couple of years when she crashes amp burns again go back to court for increased custody. Several friends that have NXs say this is what worked for them. Good luck. ,NarcissisticAbuse,dera39h,3,t5_2ys1m

Now I know while I was in massive amounts of pain he was with other people. The whole time.This is the key to how you feel about it. Hes laid out that hes like his grandfather and stated his grandmother had to get pregnant to keep him. Throw in whatever cliched response here from me to you that works. So many fish in the sea. You deserve better. Whatever.The truth is so simple. You dont deserve THIS. Whatever it is that hes doing doesnt line up with what you want to be doing. Thats not some melodramatic nonsense. Thats your life. The result of four years of loyalty was that you didnt line up. You didnt work as a relationship. Using the royal you there in those last two sentences to say you and he. Youve already spent enough time figuring out that he isnt what you want. Now you just need to figure out what you do want. And that is worth spending time on for you. He isnt.I hate to be curt about it but if he doesnt love you the way that you want to be loved or you dont feel loved the way you want to be loved there is absolutely nothing you can do to change that feeling except ignore him and move on from this situation as quickly and healthily as possible. He literally answered all of the questions but why that you could possibly have about the end of this and he shut that down with idk. My guess is the starting point for healing begins with What now? and the answer to that is anything you want to do. But not this.

11784751,0,t3_684aa3,udanceswithbourbons That was the most heart wrenching yet most beautiful thing Ive read in a long time. What I mean by beautiful is that I think that I was afraid I endured so much abuse from my ex that its been a long time that something I heard or read touched me as profoundly as what your letter did. Ive been so focused on my own pain that often when I read things I just imagined myself in the shoes of others because our experiences can mirror others here. But your letter I dont even know you and never met you but I imagined someone else painfully writing it out letting their emotions pour. Ive cried so much the past few months and then I just stopped. I think my pain hurt so much that I was turning off my emotions so I could stop feeling. I was afraid my ex had turned me into what he was until I read your letter. I realized as I read it that I was feeling your pain. Ive forgotten what it felt like to feel true empathy for others because I realized after reading that thats exactly what Ive been trying to do. I shut myself off except for the rage. The rage I could handle because the pain was crippling me almost killing me. I never realized that I was shutting the door to other peoples emotions too. I can imagine how painful and difficult it was for you to write that. Ive thought about writing my real emotions out only to stop because I did not want my tears to flow again.
