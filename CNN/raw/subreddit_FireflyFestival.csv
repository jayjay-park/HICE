It was a solid concert and everyone was respectful and chilled out. One of the big things people said about the first year was how respectful and chill the whole thing was it was good last year but not the same.

I was more shocked that we were getting rushed out of the festival grounds that people didnt know that its not cool to poop next to peoples cars we are all subject to portty pottys... just to name a few instances... but you should absolutly check out ROO acres of farm land attendees!!!! Centeroo does not close till sunday!the  food is amazing! The people are even better... staff included!! The only reason I did firefly was for the lineup this would have been my fourth Bonnaroo in a row and now I know I have been spoiled!! But everyone should spoil themselves!!! Bonnaroo is a true festival where all are encouraged celebrated and honest.. being that Im from philly its nice to go to s festival where if I happen to leave something valuable out I never have to worry about it being stolen.

Test kits are a must. The better way to buy is ask people that are rolling on molly. They can tell if its good and direct you. Best bet is outside the festival. Dont buy from homelesshippies. Knowing the molly trade and cash flow they probably dont have molly. Specifically ask what the molly is and test it. For tldr crowd one of the rick shaw bike guys named Nick was selling all weekend. There is always molly in the rick shaw. ,FireflyFestival,cigdw1k,2,t5_2u882

2837199,0,t1_cnqki3e,And I cant wrap my head around someone who adamantly adores the Beatles. At  years old and an avid listener of all genres of music and I literally mean ALL genres of music I just do not see the appeal of a premodern rock band from what was classified as rock during that era and a hype and awe about a couple of guys who hated each other. As far as sayhting that their songwriting was amazing what about Pete Townsend or Hank Williams. The Beatles were the quintessential Boy Band of the era in my opinion. I must say though I am the Walrus coo koo cachoo is one of the nicknames I call the  year old dude that I know that is so spaced out he cant even spell his own name. So that is one bonus. And we can all talk about the bands I listed they all have their downsides and their quirks and their bad times I just can not compare them to The Beatles even as great as they were and I say WERE. ,FireflyFestival,cnql3z5,1,t5_2u882

So i was stuck at this festival without a ride without a place to stay luckily we hit it off like no other and spent  days having the most amazing experience together.

However there is plenty of precedent and reasonableness in an outdoor venue expecting guests to dispose of trash they create during their time at a campsite.This would hold more weight if they had provided us with a way to actually dispose of the trash though.gtIts all in good fun and the poster you were responding to doesnt exactly sound like hed be much fun at parties but I still respectfully think your analogy was pretty stankhaha no worries its a good novelty idea keep it up,FireflyFestival,cshjrba,0,t5_2u882

Ive bought and sold a lot of tickets over the years and they are by far the easiest and most secure.  If you sell on ebay there is a good chance you get an unverified buyer who screws you over and ebay sides with the buyer as a rule.  Forget craigslist unless you are going to meet in person.

I snuck into the mens shower tent because i was so desperate for a shower. I even left a day early last year because our tent got flooded during the storm we had to sleep in the car and we were sunburnt starving and caked with mud. In retrospect I was really dissapointed with myself at how grumpy i was that day. That definitely wouldnt have happened had we gotten a cheap hotel with a Continental breakfast. I can however definitely chalk this up to poor planning and having never done a festival before and Im stoked to try it again hopefully with less mud and scorching heat!,FireflyFestival,cz30z1n,1,t5_2u882

11164033,0,t1_dexegcy,If they follow the format of last year the main bands will play at alternating times on the LawnBackyard stages while DJs run in parallel at the The Pavilion and smallersolo acts play the Treehouse.
