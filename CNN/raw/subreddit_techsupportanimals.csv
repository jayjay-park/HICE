3774404,0,t3_33lrw9,Our QA dept. had funny names for testing.  We set up an appwebsite for a limo company.  QA tested it.   months later a limo appears in front of our office building.  I look closer at the iPad in the drivers hand.  The name was Testy Testerson.  It turns out one girl in QA accidentally created a real reservation before the host file pointing the URLs to the QA environment was pushed to her workstation.,techsupportanimals,cqmid6f,6,t5_2tg7x

7876961,0,t1_d41c6of,I support hundreds if users as my daily job and to be honest it is a little wrong of Microsoft to push it so hard. I know I will get a couple of people approach me in a few year ish asking me they have a message on their screen saying their os will soon be unsupported and will have to pay to upgrade which in turn I will ask why they didnt upgrade to . Most users dont know that operating systems have life spans and i had a fair few people get pissed with me when I told them to upgrade to windows . or  when support for xp and vista ended. As you said FOR THE AVERAGE USER I think they should read before they commit everything is documented if they want to roll back then they should know the consequences.,techsupportanimals,d41fyj6,1,t5_2tg7x
8261143,0,t1_d5a56mv,Its At Will employment and you dont know what youre talking about.At will means you can be fired for no reason not for any reason. Yes there is a difference.  For example you cant fire someone for being old for being black for being a woman or because said employee reported you to the labor board andor sued you for misconduct.  The latter is called retaliation and comes with a nifty paycheck for the person fired.,techsupportanimals,d5a78u6,4,t5_2tg7x
