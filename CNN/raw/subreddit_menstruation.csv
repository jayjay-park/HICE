1735093,0,t3_2ea1os,If my flow is coming FAST then the tampon just doesnt have time to absorb it and I get leaks while the tampon remains pretty clean.  Such a frakkin annoyance. Nothing will help this so Im stuck using a menstrual cup then.When my flow is coming slower then leaks are usually due to me not positioning it right.  I push mine in at an angle directed towards my  lower back.  This doesnt prevent leaks all of the time but it definitely helps me. ,menstruation,cjxvfd2,2,t5_2ticd

8289163,0,t3_4mknbl,I experienced this for years. It would happen about once every three months and I lived in fear of my period. I went to the gynecologist and she did an ultrasound. She said there was no sign of ovarian cyst or endometriosis which took a load off my mind. I really recommend seeing a doctor to rule out any medical cause.That being said I found that having an orgasm makes it go away. I know its the very last thing you feel like doing when in that state but if you just stick with it and make it happen it gets it over with a lot quicker. It worked for me anyway.About three years ago I switched to a whole food mostly plantbased diet and have not had severe cramps since.,menstruation,d5dpd5i,1,t5_2ticd
10003244,0,t3_5is2w6,Its never happened to me but Ive heard and read that a period thats gone on for that long is not normal and could be dangerous so seeing a doctor is definitely the right course of action.  I hope you get it figured out!,menstruation,dbbg9gk,2,t5_2ticd
10168111,0,t1_dbhtqoe,Sorry! Ive been using my phone rather than logging on for real so I didnt realise youd replied.This wont be much use to you now but for the future I would suggest finishing the pack you are on when the breakthrough bleed happens then taking a week break before starting the new pack. Now that you know how long you can go without bleeding you can use that as a guide for how many packs to take before taking a break  i.e. take your break just before starting whichever number pack youre on now. ,menstruation,dbwm0kf,2,t5_2ticd
10959114,0,t1_de9udj8,Yeah I got excepted into my college for engineering and Im stressed about getting enough financial aid so my parents and I wont be burdened. And also looking at all the calc and physics classes has been giving me some anxiety. About two weeks ago I had a huge project due and other normal stuff. I did notice that my ovulation seemed very long though... ,menstruation,deacs6n,2,t5_2ticd
