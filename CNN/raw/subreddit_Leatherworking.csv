1409858,0,t1_cisy5vm,Not at all.I used a stylus from tandy on the part you cant see to trace a message then this swivel knife to carve it.I used this water based stain as well as a standard rotary punch. An xacto was used to do all of the cutting.I also purchased a belt blank from Tandy though for my next few belts I might not use a blank.,Leatherworking,cit0732,1,t5_2tceq

2191182,0,t3_2ju0r1,Properly casing leather involves completely saturating the leather in water and putting it in a Ziploc bag in the fridge overnight. But Im lazy and dont plan ahead very well so all I do is spray with a spray bottle and let it set for just a minute. If you toolstamp too soon after spraying itll leave mushy impressions. ,Leatherworking,clicphp,1,t5_2tceq

2744004,0,t1_cnftm4h,Eventually! Your tooling is pretty good. I think the stylus you are using to press your designs leaves a decent indent when you then cut with your swivel knife you need to cut to the outside of that indent. You are getting some blur to your edges I think because part of the outside untooled edge rolls down into the cut due to your cut being made in the middle of the well that your stylus makes. ,Leatherworking,cnfzcnj,1,t5_2tceq

3149686,0,t3_2w4l6y,Perhaps try some Obenaufs leather oil. I would imagine the two biggest issues with the wet weather would be getting your leather soaked and growing mold. Regular application of the leather oil or any other waterproofingprotective oilswaxes will help!,Leatherworking,coogmsk,1,t5_2tceq

4047116,0,t3_36tsg6,Gold Star Tool  sells a good setter and dies at a great price.  The only bad thing is that their setter only works with the dies they make but since their dies are much cheaper than any other place Ive seen it doesnt really matter.  You could get the setter and a heck of a lot of different dies for less than .Someone over at leatherworker.net got in touch with them and worked out a deal with different dies and accessories for their press but Im not sure if theyd still honor it.  Might want to call and check unless you actually think you might use  grommets.,Leatherworking,crhloyw,2,t5_2tceq

5376310,0,t3_3ogrxh,It looks like these use oiltanned leather which may not redye quite as well as either pure veg tan or chrome tan leather and there are different varieties of oil tanned leather to complicate things. One such complication are the grain amp temper of the leather The tobacco looks to have a more pronounced grain especially on the uppers. This means that even a perfect dye job wont produce the results in the black boots linked. It wont have that smooth finish. Also keep in mind that the thread will turn black as well so you wont have the nice lines amp color break.All that aside Fiebings pro oil is a good choice though so is the USMC black. Their pro oil will be more colorfast and be more likely to penetrate further which may be crucial in a redye.  the USMC seems to have bit heavier pigment resulting in a deeper black but may be more likely to fade over time.  I have heard both positive amp negative accounts of using both together but the negative may be due to using USMC first best method for both would use pro oil first then USMC.On predye cleaning These dont appear to have any top coat of lacquer or similar. You probably dont need a solvent but you can try fiebings deglazer if readily available. Otherwise just clean the outside thoroughly with any cleaning product that is based on oxalic acid barkeepers friend comes to mind. Then try whatever dye method you choose in an unobtrusive spot first.You could also consider bringing the shoes to a shoe repair shop which often perform redyes via dip dye and theyll give you realistic expectations on the results after looking over the leather.,Leatherworking,cvyvute,1,t5_2tceq
