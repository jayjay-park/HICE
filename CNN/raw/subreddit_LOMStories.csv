The names where eventually shortened to Uialben and Fenfir. The clans where for the most part peaceful with eachother.. until..Knowns teeth grind in anger as he has flashbacks of the day. His voice fills with anger and rage as he continues talkingUntil the Uialbens wanted ta fuck the tribe queen of the Fenfirs.. and then.. when they didnt get what they want.. they killed all of them.. every single Fenfir.. except me..Known slams the table as hard and it goes flying into the Earth until it is literally not visable.The Uialbens found me and they threw me into a trapped pit and cursed me to never be able to escape the horror they made me whatch.. But.. those idiots can barely screw a lightbulb.. so I escaped.. centuries later.. and now all of the Uialbens have basically fucked the dragon blood out of there newest generations.. those fucking untraditional idiots....

7786154,0,t1_d3r7nn4,Known lays down and stares at the Sky while still levitating in the air.I understand you have a hard time understanding emotion and that death and things of that nature dont come off as important or motivational to you. However whatching  family members die infront of you for petty reasons was devastating for someone like me at my age.Besides emotion is a very nice thing to use sometimes infact I feel being angry makes accomplishing things MUCH more fulfilling..

The siege engines were also progressing along very nicely. Of course some poor forest had to be knocked down to build it all but it wasnt needed anyway. Heh. At this rate theyll be in the castle by tomorrow evening at least.Commander Umbora sat back on her horse satisfied by the days work. Unbeknownst to her Lyon wasnt even sending orders anymore. Lyon is done. What she is doing now is completely of her own accord. That thought if known to her would probably make her laugh.

Other than that I got guesses.He stared at the leaves of the oak above them. It appears to be the remnants of when a entire universe popped out of existence for some reason.
