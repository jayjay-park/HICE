I said there shall be no more than  root words and each shall have exactly  derivations and all the root words are the only proper nouns to exist in the language and no more shall ever exist for any reason.Which means that Fenekere cannot accommodate the titles and names for anything outside of the individuals and concepts that belong to the root words.  In other words imagine that in all the world there is only one Jonathan me for all time.  No one and nothing else may be referred to as Jonathan.  And you cannot properly import a word into Fenekere because you cant inflect it properly.  So Charlotte is stuck not being talked about.  Unless shes willing to have the prefix besheke  meaning outsider stuck in front of her name so that she can be used in a sentence.Its kind of rude I know but thats one of the first lessons that the speakers of Fenekere must face as they grow up and encounter the rest of the universe! ,conlangs,chbik6j,2,t5_2red7

1239019,0,t3_289bdg,I once tried to make a language that was inspired by Arabic with the main similarities being the triconsontal roots and the sounds. I set it off to the side while I worked on another language Harazsin. Harazsin ended up with mostly quadriliteral roots such as HRZSN and some triconsonantal roots and sounds similar to Turkish.Then after Id done all that I realized that the Arabicinspired languages werent necessary anymore since I already had Harazsin.I also once tried to create a language derived from Old English  basically modern English but with less loanwords and more Germanic grammar.

For an a priori conlang one that has no inspiration by another language you kind of just make up the whole thing Id suggest coming up with a few words that sound nice then from there see what phonotactic rules youve created. Use those rules with a word generator to create more words and go from there. If its a conlang based on another language come up with phonotactic rules and morph words from the other language to fit them. For example if your conlangs phonotactics say that every syllable has to be a consonant followed by a vowel then English sting might become satingo.,conlangs,cjlsosw,1,t5_2red7

For example the word cz thing in the genitive is scz whereas ans year in the genitive is sans as you remove the  from the prefix s when the word youre declining starts with a vowel. If you decide to keep the schwa and say sans then you have up with a word that can barely be pronounced at all violated the most basic grammatical rule and managed to sound like a complete asshole simultaneously.  Another thing one can do is use the subjunctive wherever possible. In Hudson there really are no hardandfast rules for when the subjunctive applies aside from some to natives common sense uses and is falling out of use overall. For example any imperative statement saying that something cannot be done and doubting that something really happened all call for the subjunctive. If you wish to be pretentious you can use the subjunctive when saying that something can be done hoping for something to happen in the future or even talking about what tomorrows whether will be like or how hot the tea is. These will never be wrong since there are no rules specifically stating what is right even language experts and the University of Antigone have failed to agree on rules for this but it will sound very very uppity.,conlangs,cjpkdpl,2,t5_2red7

Especially since it lacks phonemic voice and it seems preglottalization could easily arise from an earlier voicing destination perhaps from creaky voice though Im not about any natlang precedent for that they often seem to pattern together.

1986900,0,t3_2hggyk,The word order isnt necessary but the common order is vsarpur. a r p and ur are cases of nouns and they can be s or o depending on context. They can change based on many things such as the verb of the sentence tense of the verb whether or not the verb is conjugated the words in the other cases the gender of the words in other cases and quite a few more things. The reason for putting the verb first is because the verb is the most important part of the sentence so you want that to be out there as soon as possible. The rest is because of how the cases function. The subject can be conjugated with the verb reguardless of what case it would have been in thus the parentheses around s. Given all the possibilities I think the most common order turns out to be VSO though.    An example  Tabtes k dakje n.  Tab e k dakt n.    I gave you an apple  Both sentences mean the same thing but in the second one Tab isnt conjugated. In the first one dak apple is in the acase active and it is the indirect object of the sentence. In the second e I is in the active case and is the subject while dak is in the p passive case. In both sentances the direct object n you is in the ur ultimate receiving case which is the object.    Bdd k dakje.  Bd k dakje n.  You have an apple.    This one has the same difference. Bd is conjugated in one not the other. This time the subject is n you and its in the ur case. Dak is in the active case in both sentances.,conlangs,cksmegk,2,t5_2red7

2108144,0,t3_2j1ym8,SpOoOoOoOoOoOoKy!Ill finish the IPA transcriptions later  its past am here.  Idea  A ghoulish language full of moans and shrieks spoken by ugly clumsy grey creatures. The phonology is filled with long voiced consonants from the back of the throat and a lot of middle groaning vowels. I tried to make the orthography match the moaning with things like ltghgt ltnnhgt ltahgt. The diacritics have sharp corners like bat wings or cobwebs. There is slight influence from Celtic languages and Old English.  Phonotactics  Anything goes! There is a general mix of consonants and vowels but long complex consonant clusters are frequent. Even ones impossible for the human mouth. The penultimate syllable is always stressed and the stressed vowel is always long.Grammar  The language is quite agglutinative. Prefixes and suffixes cover pronouns tenses moods number case derivation etc. There are no genders or classes. The word order is VSO and adjectives come before the noun. The language can be redundant at times using the third person singular suffix on verbs even though the subject comes just after.Consonants  Phoneme|Orthography|Pharyngealised|Orthography|Velarised|Orthography|||||d|d|d|dh|d|dgh|g||||m|m|||||ng||n||n|n||nnh|||v||vh||v|||h||x|ch|x|h|||gh||h|||c|||||h|||||l||lh||ll|w||wh||vh|uu||||Vowels  Vowel|Orthography|Vowel|Orthography|||||i|i||eu|oo||ueiu|ou||au|u||ah|o||a  Sentences  Whuuuuei ngou chieuwannnh hoo chinnhaunhoo whoudu iogh auueu ghueivag.  . u xi..  xi.. u.d i. . .

Assign letters to the sounds so you can work with it easier.Once youve done that all phonotactics is is a set of rules for what you want to hear and what you dont want to hear in your language.  So its things like syllable structure and restrictions on what consonants can be put together.For instance you might say that in your language youll never see a lttgt followed by an ltrgt because that just doesnt sound like it is in character with what youre going for.And thats really it for the most part.You might include which syllables the stress is on and other stuff like that.  But you can make those notes later as you go.  The real key is getting those rules about syllable structure and restrictions down so you can move on and use this kind of thingword generatorOn the other hand using that thing may help you figure out how that part of phonotactics works!

2569672,0,t3_2p6kv2,So Ive never played this game but this was a cool translation challenge. I would have done Igogu but Im still figuring out things like the Imperative which was used here. Anyways here is the Odki for this with my new pronoun system. Alas where the Dative would have come in handy it isnt used as I fused the Accusative and Dative cases within the pronoun system.igRodke pkdedo igRod pkmogmodo kb nobnobag mb igRodke pengpeng.s.M.Gen life.Acc.I s.Nom live.Impfv.Past to most of s.M.Gen heart.NomLiterally My life I lived to most best of my heart ability.In the above sentence heart is equated to ability. To do something to the bestmost same word in Odki of your heart is to do something to the best of your ability.nidmog papokaki agkovkaki tti qopbonkaki igRod poogti poogti wb par.but year.Acc.IV anger.Acc.IV or hurt.Noun.Acc.IV s.M.Nom regret.Hab.Past  behind leave.InfLiterally But yearcycle fate anger or pain I regretted behind to leave.Obviously it makes more sense than my literal translation says. Yearcycle is used to symbolize fate. Regret is actually acting as fail and behind to leave is just how you say to escape in Odki. Thus the sentence reads more like But fate anger or pain I have failed to escape.twegkokaki ttitti tingbimkaki papate kb nodqopttotidkaki kb vadmeg agte igRodko yitkegkon.answer.P.Acc.IV and road.Acc.IV that.Rel to truth.Acc.IV towards go.Impfv.Pres EndRel s.M.Dat breathe.Pfv.PresLiterally Answers and road that to truth towards goes to me breathe.First off truth n was a difficult construction. It comes from the verb to lie nodqoptto which in turn comes from the verb to stab or qoptto. tid gets added to the end to reverse its meaning turning it into the verb to tell the truth. And then it has to be converted to a noun by declension. Goes towards just means leads. And to breathe something can also mean to bring something. Kind of a weird metaphor but all these metaphors in this post almost all at least were crated because Im too lazy to create new words.agte vo mog mb pab pakigdaR agte igRodko padaR akgegnagte.SentBegin how all of this.Nom end.Pfv.Fut SentEnd s.M.Dat finally open.Pfv.Pres.SentLiterally How all of this ends to me finally openconfess reveal.Openconfess also means to reveal.Edit Here it is being spoken.

2672805,0,t3_2qmhor,Everything should have male and female gender. But unlike English use female gender as the default. This actually does happen in some natlangs too.You know how French has some weird genders for their nouns. Do that with your conlang. Choose things that are powerful in your conworld which sounds like you are doing and give them female gender. Choose things perceived as weak and give them male gender.An honorifics system might be helpful.You could have two different ways of speaking the language. Men speak one way women the other. This happens in some Aborigines languages. With this for instance you could have fun with the honorifics. When men speak they must use honorifics that indicate the difference in power towards who they are talking. These are considered respectful. With women the same honorifics show the difference in power between them and the person theyre talking to but these are considered degrading towards that person.Use evidentials perhaps. Create a funky mood system such as different types of Imperatives or Jussives. Perhaps a standard imperative a profanity laced imperative and a demeaning imperative.Theres a lot you can do I suppose.

I grew up learning a bit of Spanish in school which has helped me to be able to pronounce the vowels a bit better as well as introduced me to some nonEnglish concepts.Hebrew has a lot in common with English but then it also doesnt. Its a neat language that gets away from IndoEuropean but I think is more accessible to English speakers than Arabic is. Hebrew for instance does not use the copula normally in the present tense. Plus the abjad is pretty cool and exposes you to a different writing system I really like writing systems.Esperanto helped me with a lot of grammar stuff and I really like the simplicity of all nouns adjectives and verbs having certain endings. Korean is neat though I havent studied it as much. Of course they have a Featural writing system and you get some interesting phonology. And Cherokee. Well if you wanted something not like English youve found it. I was mainly fascinated by the syllabary as well as nasalized vowels.So anyways my point is all languages have things to offer and I really do think having broad knowledge of all these languages helps.

The word Sona in the language itself means auxiliary neutral thing but the name was also chosen to echo sonority or sound.gtSearight created Sona as a response to the Eurocentricity of other artificial auxiliary languages of his time such as Esperanto and Ido  At the same time Searight intended his language to be more practical than most a priori languages like Solresol or Ro which were intended to be unbiased by any particular group of natural languages. Thus Sona sacrificed familiarity of grammar and lexicon for some measure of universality while at the same time preserving basic notions common to grammars around the world such as compounding as a method of word formation. Searight used inspiration from many diverse languages including English Arabic Turkish Chinese and Japanese to create his eclectic yet regular and logical language. gtSona is an agglutinative language with a strong tendency towards being an isolating language The language has  radicals or root words whose meanings are based on the categories in Roget original thesaurus Ideas and sentences are formed by juxtaposing the radicals.

And taking a word that ends with a t or d and adding morphology to the end to change the environment of that phoneme is one of the ways they do that.  Another way is vowel length in that in English vowels are longer before voiced sounds than voiceless ones.  And Canadian Raising is a third way its done.

3405636,0,t3_2z6l97,Ill give an example  from French.In Classical Latin the future tense was produced by the bi infix. Like so. However in Vulgar Latin this conjugation was dropped due to vowel mergers resulting in it sounding like the imperfect tenses ba infix.Instead in Vulgar Latin the future tense came to be represented with the construction infinitive  habere  e.g. dicere habeo I will speak. As habere became more important it became the irregular verb avoir resulting in an early construction je dire ai eliminate the space and you get the modern French je dirai I will speak. This is of course but one of many possible grammaticalization processes but its the most likely one for an analytic language to develop into a synthetic one.Interestingly since the modern French perfect tense is formed by avoir  past participle exactly as it is in English and this tense has largely rendered the simple past tense obsolete one can argue that in some future French the phrase jai dit I spoke will become jaidit. Yes Latin verbs are usually classified by .s.present form so habeo instead of the infinitive habere. Why this is done I do not know. But given the process at hand using the infinitive is probably the best way to talk about it.,conlangs,cpggu9v,7,t5_2red7

Im trying to take a minimalist approach here  one letter per phoneme but using the Latin characters if at all possible.The only problems come with the aspirated stops which generally get written as two letters in English if theyre marked at all.

3667200,0,t3_32dlhe,Rating Latin as a neography is kind of hard because what do you compare it to? Its the most used alphabet in the world. What else would we be using? Greek? Phoenician? Arabic? The futhark? Logograms? Its just hard for me to imagine our world without the Latin alphabet but I could easily see a world in which some other European language took on the role English enjoys today.And which typeface are we talking about? Real scripts come in different fonts but conscripts usually have only the canonical form. Theres a big difference between Comic Sans and Hoefler Text and old Gothic fonts. On purely aesthetic grounds I have to say the Gothic style has to be one of the ugliest scripts Ive seen literally Baroque. If we imagine an average font I guess its a bit boring. Doesnt have the elegance of Chinese or the swishy lines of Arabic. But again its so hard to imagine what it would be like if it were some exotic invention. How do you rate Medieval Europe as a conculture?On the other hand I could easily imagine not that it would be plausible but that its easy to accept as a counterfactual that Old Norse or Norman French supplanted Old English for instance. In which case Id have to praise the creator of Modern English for the Great Vowel Shift which has to be the most impressive chainreaction of sound changes Ive seen in a conlang.Even so its just so hard to let go of your realworld knowledge to make this exercise meaningful.,conlangs,cqaaagy,4,t5_2red7

4471396,0,t3_3cagzo,Hello! I was actually planning on making a post soon! Ive been lurking on this sub for a few months I think Ive made one comment since I began conlanging. Ive been worldbuilding for a few years now and I decided I wanted to make languages for my world! I had already created a language family for my most developed area along with a few unrelated languages so I chose to learn and practise with those. I started by going through the LCK and picked the Moranese language. I started and realised I was not happy with the order Id done things so I moved onto the next language Id planned on its closest relative Cedlav which Im still working on but already see bits that I want to do differently next time. I dont have a problem really with these mistakes as Im already working around quite a few names locations and a few words so its not going to be the most consistent but it works well enough. I discovered I really love the simple stuff deciding on phonography phonotactics orthography or at least the simple parts of them and I dislike most bits of syntax but hopefully thatll go as I learn. Expanding the lexicon depends on my mood but mostly its just meh. I can already see places where I have improved and where I need to improve I have a lot of trouble distinguishing some vowels especially when I associate them with English letters too much and Ive already started on the phonology and phonotactics of future languages even though Im only at ish words with Cedlav and an incomplete grammar. I think the reason I lurk is because I talk too much about stuff like this when I do comment which I dont like to do because you have better things to do than read this P However I will have to post soon because I have reached a problem I cant solve. Youll probably see me soon. ,conlangs,csuak2j,3,t5_2red7

4751672,0,t3_3fzniq,The dative marks the socalled recipient. If a verb has three arguments those are usually the agent the theme and the recipientbenefactor. The actor nominative is the one which carries out the action denoted by the verb.The theme accusative specifies the exact kind of action such as what is given seen or heldThe recipient dative is someone or something which is affected directly by the action. Consider this sentenceI give him a present. I  agent. I am the one doing the giving  Nominative a present  theme. Specifies the kind of giving more closely by denoting what is given. him  recipient. This object is directly affected by the act of giving in this case because they get something. However do note that languages dont always follow this scheme neatly. German for example has the verb schlagen to hit where the hit person is in the accusative even though youd expect a dative. Many languages especially IE ones but probably others too use datives for certain prepositions. Which ones theyre used for is arbitrary unless you look at the history of the language. German for example uses datives for prepositions of locations because ProtoGermanic merged the Dative and Locative cases.,conlangs,ctthrfn,5,t5_2red7

An example would be a language that manifests pitch accent as a fall on the posttonic syllable. The implementation of tone is a lot more complicated than just high syllables are high and low syllables are low.Your argument still seems to be that there must be some property of the unaccented syllable that marks it as low for example to contrast with high for example  that high cannot contrast with unmarked. As I said I dont know where to begin to untangle this. The reason why unmarked is chosen instead of low would be based on the phonological analysis of an individual language. Im really not up to writing an introduction to the topic sorry.gt and tone isnt exclusively used to mean phonemic tone.Within linguistics tone is almost exclusively used to refer to phonological tone its not used to refer to pitch. And I only use almost exclusively because Im sure you can find exceptions if you dig especially if you look at older works or those on the fringes of the field. I should have been clearer about the distinction in my explanation though. Im a linguist who works on intonation and tone and its too easy to take terminology for granted even when it might be different in lay usage.gt In another the whole word has one of two different contours. So it seems to me that one language lexicalizes syllable accent and the other works pretty much exactly the same as a tonal language except that the tone applies to entire words.I think you would really get a lot out of reading some work on word prosodic typology and I suggested Hyman earlier because I think you might have a similar way of thinking about these issues.

Does the other words follow with some sort of criteria?No when conlanging you do not start with the words. That just leads you to create a wordlang. When conlanging you start with the grammar phonology and phonotactics. Words feel more like filler to me than the main attraction.gtwhy most of the languages I see here are totally different from European language in vocabulary script and phonology?

5608245,0,t1_cws8bsb,Exactly. And you certainly could use two separate morphemes like that t for sg as for sg.f. If you wanted you could also make them both prefixes or suffixes.     Some languages even combine the meanings. So you could have a suffix like an which is for a first person singular subject and second person singular object and another suffix ra for sg subject sg object and so on and so on. But that would mean having a lot of different affixes which may defeat the purpose of a naming language.    You could have an actual subject and object in the sentence and that would help remove ambiguity if you werent using pronouns like in the man fought the bear. But the agreement on the verb means that they can both be dropped as well.     So you could easily have just Tasitsengas  I fought her or Qam tal  tasitsengas    The reason I wrote the second sentence different from your example is because of two things. The first being that pronouns arent really incorporated onto verbs in these kinds of languages just actual nouns like bear wood democracy etc. The second is because if you do incorporate the object the affix on the verb for the object goes away. Heres a quick example    Lets pretend the word wood is a feminine word in your language. So you would have a sentence like  I tchoptsengas the wood    But if you incorporate the word wood you get  I twoodchoptseng     This is because incorporating the object fills the same role as the object affix on the verb. So you dont need both.     Its understandable to be confused by this kind of stuff if youve never studied a language like this before. So dont be sorry. The beauty of conlanging is the more you do it the more you learn about the subject and the easier things will get. ,conlangs,cws99o9,1,t5_2red7

5749568,0,t3_3tvii4,I think you should ask yourself as I did when I developed my own Romlang how did your language come about? The substrata the vulgar Latin swallowed on your area and the other languages around it contributes highly to how itll stem off from latin. Like French getting a shit load of influence early on in vocabulary from Gaulish substrata then the whole syllable initial thing it got from Frankish contributing to the phonology it has now and how vin vins verb and noun vain vains vint vaincs vainc vingt are all pronounced v nowadays.But then you have Norman which stems from old french but gets all of its character from Viking raiders at one point in its history. What Im saying is youve got this language dol you wanna do but where does it stem off? Did it stem off from Old French or another proto language that just borrowed heavily from French? I feel like having this sort of mentality will help you develop your language a lot faster cus youll have mechanisms in place to how any world should sound in your languageSome examples as to what I mean say its an insular dol that stems from Anglo Norman. Say the richer southern counties of England just stuck with it and said screw you to Middle English. Alright cool. So since youre separated from all the other dols cus of a big ass channel youre gonna start borrowing a shit load of stuff from English. Hows about our do system for starters? Do you want to go? I dont know. Etc.. replacing do with a form of facereMy language Letnish formed when a bunch of rich Italians over in the colony of Britannia decided to start a colony of their own psuedosoverignty where they could work their servi to death with free reign from taxes. They found a load of hills on the coast across the sea or Norway and decided to settle there. NorseRomlang. Basicbitch skyrim shit i know but it had its fun features. It had a grammatical drift into isolation and heavy heavy compounding between its isolated contact with Sami and Norse folk where they were just slapping words together with crazy glue tlum in Latin is a spear in Old Letnish is tel. alarius is a wing or branch of a regiment or support in Old Letnish becoming alm lyr l.lrm eventually meaning an army. Then from the s on there was this craze among royalties and priests across Europe to study this population of a couple thousand village folk in the middle of nowhere Norway. Converting to Catholicism along with the other Norse on top of this there was this drive to revitalize the Latin they all once spoke. It was heavily sponsored by these other high classed Romance speakers from faraway lands but it failed miserably leaving a crude case system in place.

And for some they may just be so irregular that they just have to be memorized rather than fitting some neat pattern. This is something thats just part of languages. Not everything fits the pattern perfectly. Despite being described as a triconsonantal root language there may be irregular verbs bi and quadriconsonantal roots etc.     Where exactly does the  come from? Perhaps its better analysed as an infix?    I would suggest finding a reference grammar of a triconsonantal natlang and seeing how it documents the various patterns and affixes. For instance not every noun follows the pattern of kitaab  kutub to form its plural. So you may well have multiple conjugation patterns like Italian are ere ire verbs which would each need a separate section to describe their various forms. ,conlangs,cxt65lo,1,t5_2red7

6006432,0,t3_3xqvln,A syllabary is simply a writing system that uses a different character for each syllable that is possible in the language. The best languages to use a syllable with will be ones with simpler syllable structures like Japanese. But nothing is stopping you from having a syllabary with a language that has a complex syllable structure. It just means youll have to have more symbols for all the extra syllables. For example words would have a different character that word. Same for syllables like start art straight and strengths etc etc.    One way languages like Mayan got around the whole complex syllable structure is to just ingore it and fit the word as best you can. So a word like bad would be written with two characters bada and the reader would just have to know that the second a isnt actually read. Or you could leave out that last syllable simply writing ba and know from context that the word is bad     The link you provided has a sort of syllabaryalphabet blend going on as it allows for whole syllable characters as well as stand alone phonemes.

In certain languages like German and English you often have to pick one. They is a viable alternative for English as a third person singular pronoun but some dialects dont have it luckily mine does! I use the shit out of it. Why should we identify people so much for the genitalia they were born with or their gender?For politeness levels in pronouns you can can opt for one pronoun or another and it is really up to the culture to decide whether its acceptable. In societies that like to convey a lot of politeness to certain types of people theyd probably find other ways of doing it without pronouns as in English. For that reason I dont think you could say that honorifics serve no purpose.I never use sexbased grammatical genders in my conlangs or honorifics.

6286935,0,t3_41lwrp,Depending on the final settingUsdonag of Earth They have a long history. Living on a somewhat remote Island in the Atlantic they are geographically SouthWest of Ireland West of France and NorthWest of Spain. The Island is about the size of Tasmania and has since Time Immemorial been host to a CelticLanguage speaking people. Classified as an oddity Insular Celtic Speakers they are related to Irish Welsh ect. Generally its considered a PCeltic language though its been heavily influenced by Irish through loan words. The Isle was a destination of choice for Gauls during the Roman Conquest for its remoteness assuming they could make the journey. Some have even theorized that the Islands inhabitants are relatives of the Picts due to common cultural imagery and standing stones as well as sword making and the use of blue woad. Also it was a holdout of Celtic Paganism until the s when Christians became the majority. In  the Isles came under the rule of a small army of conquerors from Scotland no less. Adventurers conquered the Isle and founded the long and to this day Rule of Gaelic Kings. From then on the Language of the Island became more heavily influenced by Gaelic loan words. But the language never fully shifted. The Gaelic speaking rulers were always a tiny minority whom overtime adopted the local language and shifted it unlike in Scotland were Gaelic pushed the native Pictish out. Usdonland as the English called it remained a stubborn thorn in theirs and all Europeans side throughout the centuries. Proving insanely difficult to invade due to the stony cliff laden shores and lack of safe harbors. Indeed the largest mass invasion of the Island was during the height of Andulasian Caliphate power when Muslims attempted to secure it as an Island fortress. The invasion failed and its reported the invaders were burned alive on the cliffs and stones and left to rot as grizzly warnings to further invaders. The island also proved stubbornly independent in the eyes of the Pope whom could never secure total power over the Islands much stronger King. The Church being off and on effectively a national entity there with at times mandates to give Liturgy and mass entirely in the Local language. Things shifted a bit during the Protestant reformation and the Protestant split in England with the Usdonag becoming more rigidly inline with Catholic theology and continuous wars for rule over Ireland ensued. They warred with England for ages and launched several attempted conquests of Wales Cornwall the West of France in various raids but generally were pushed back. Though they held Brittany for  years between . Their Irish holdings were fully lost during the English Civil War to Cromwell but they continued to back Irish rebellion in their geopolitical bid to gain Lordship of Ireland and wrestle it from England. Today the Islands people are known for their oddity. They are the only Celtic language peoples to be completely independent and to have always been independent. Usdonag is the largest in terms of numbers Celtic language on Earth with  million fluent speakers and . native speakers.  give or take residing on the Island and the rest scattered in communities mostly in the United States were some small towns and neighborhoods have Usdonag speakers and even native speakers of which roughly  million exist with  claiming it as a first language. South America boasts the remaining areas of Usdonag speakers and some also reside in Ireland and the UK. The people are regarded as fairly conservative and are not EU members occupying a position akin to Iceland Switzerland ect but are not part of schengen. The have a relatively stable birthrate compared to most Europeans with . fertility they are considered down right fertile by Euro standards. Usdonag are also sometimes pilloried in the European press as a nation of isolationist drunks poorly educated and uncivilized. Primarily because the King has slightly more political power than say in the UK. Also attempts to pass the Lisbon Treaty had failed and in spite of serious diplomatic efforts the people and parliament remain unwilling to join the EU or Euro currency. Much of it blamed on native prejudices towards the mainland. In  a TV channel began running dubbed Japanese anime in the country making it the only Celtic language that has had Sailor Moon Dragonball Z and Kill la Kill and any other anime dubbed into a Celtic language. They are generally the poorest Western European country but do enjoy a relative equity in terms of wealth distribution. Ethnically they are the most homogeneous Western European State though oddly enough there is a small community of Mexican Guatemalan and Honduran and various South American immigrants in the country making Spanish the second most spoken language at about  of the population and leading to an importing of many Spanish loan words particularly for various cuisine. Also by Western European standards they are freakishly high on the religiosity scale with relatively high regular Church attendance   claiming Catholic Christianity specifically as their religion and  claiming Christian in general.  claimed PaganNeoPagan ect. Generally these factors have made Usdonag people the black sheep of western Europe. Though for linguists and other Celtic language communities they are critical as they are the th celtic nation and have the most vibrant Celtic language. Parliament even voted to spend money in Brittany Cornwall Isle of Man Scotland Ireland and Wales to help promote her sister peoples and their language.,conlangs,cz4950o,1,t5_2red7

6337543,0,t1_cz9d64s,Definitely not everything is made out of triconsonantal roots however Id be cautious when speaking about biconsonantal roots. A thing to note is that biconsonantal verb roots have all been wiped out by now except in some specific nouns eg. father    .Biconsonantal roots are today assumed to have existed in ProtoAfroAsiatic languages of which semitic languages have descended and today we can only see some very few remnants.   To fit biconsonantal roots into triconsonantal templates Hebrew and Arabic turned biconsonantal roots into triple roots by the means of augmentation  for example the hebrew  ran is of the root ..  the  just falls under certain inflections. it is suspected it was . once but not anymore.  Another case is the arabic  which could have been biconsonantal once but is actually of the triple root  today. To conclude as far as Im aware  while there are traces of double roots Semitic languages no longer work with them.OP  A thing to note from this is that in Semitic languages the construction of the verb is a subject by itself. Because of the fragile nature of roots and templates some of the verbs as a result sound unnatural under some inflections. To deal with that Semitic languages developed special conjugation rules for certain root groups.gtFor example Arabic has  said kaala is of the root    KA WAW LAM. In past tense in the inflection of XaXaXa instead of it being Kawala  it becomes Kaala. Thats a conjugation rule. works only when the middle letter of the root is either waw  or ya .Also OP you might be relieved  nouns are much more freeform than verbs. ,conlangs,cza0baq,4,t5_2red7

6623113,0,t3_46avod,There are both movingtime and movingego constructions but unlike English as described in the paper the two axes are perpendicular rather than reverse. The progression of time is viewed as moving vertically up and down based on natural observation the sun moves up and then moves down. The tree grows up the tree falls down. The clouds go up the rain comes down. These things happen naturally without any sort of intervention. Using this conceptual metaphor of up being good and down being bad this is extended to other things that seem to be beyond our control such as health luck and mood. If we get sick we have been moved to a lower situation. If we get better were higher. In this regard time both present and past can be viewed as being above or below us based on our present situation. For example we would say Muno got sick above four days but below two days he started to get better. Above two days he will be completely healthy. We can view this time as a contour with each event being considered relatively better above or worse below the present state. Additionally time is generally viewed optimistically despite its ups and down things on average are getting higher. For example I was born below  years implies that things are better presently than they were  years ago. We can of course take a negative view crop yields are down because we had less rain this year above last year.However as we experience this vertical time we as living creatures can actively move horizontally through this space allowing us to map out a conceptual D field where we encounter peaks and valleys. Imagine time to be a the surface of the ocean. We have no control of where the crests and troughs of the waves are but we do our best to avoid the low points and keep on the high points. In this egodriven sense the future is always forward because we move forward but the past is not necessarily behind us since we can metaphorically stop moving and just experience the vertical movement or circle around to return to the place of a past experience. However we cannot change what has already happened because it would be above us or below us even if we are standing still or revisiting it.,conlangs,d04dxk9,2,t5_2red7

The simple scratches with the occasional circle gave me the impression that itd be a script etched into stone or wood sort of like how in real life this occurred with Ogham and Elder Futhark. Paper provides a glossier flowier surface to write on and history adapted to this by changing their scripts. Thats why when our own Roman alphabet shifted from stone and papyrus very very rough to write on inscriptions the actual scripts we used shifted from Roman Capitals think big easy scratches to make across the surface with the occasional circle  to... uncial cus we started using animal skin to break a million monks hands copying bibles all day. Curvy as fuck script  I wasnt sure if you were fishing for criticism but if you were then thats basically it. I just dont think your script looks like something folks would write on paper.

7500738,0,t3_4i0ups, Are you talking about the different speech styles like formal and casual? If so my language Zhana has ... at the moment. High formal is spoken only from a male to a pure and honest oriental female or your wife due to beliefs. Or to parents and the elderlyabout  to so on depending on what you think is old.Low formal is spoken by a male to other females. Females that arent oriental and to all females that are honest but also unpure.High informal is spoken by a male to another male that the speaker does not knowa stranger and to unhonest and unpure females.Low informal is spoken to people in the lowest priority. Such as people who lust and greed and sell themselves andor others Murderers Rapists etc... Low informal is also used by a male to close male friends. Females can use any form of speech as they like. Zhana is a language based off the beliefs that females are gods because females create life. So females are highest priority. Oriental females are highest because of their eyes. I call them the Diamond eyes. But females can also be what is called tainted which means they lust greed sell themselves andor others etc. This rule can also apply to males. Being a tainted being is looked down upon and a male should always be polite and honest to females and do as they say. If it is personal then of course the male speaker can politely deny to do so. I could go more in depth about why Zhana speech is how it is but I think this is enough. It is the basic stuff needed to understand why I made it like this.,conlangs,d2usmvz,1,t5_2red7

7746612,0,t3_4ldnqm,Nah put it simple Id just do something like the following. Create a bunch of basic words just to make some embryonic sentences. They dont have to be perfect words you can change them in the future. for exemple to eat is now kooka  . Now lets make some simple sentence. Howd we say I eat? I is called pronoun. Lets look at wikipedia to see what a pronoun is how it works and what natural languages on Earth do with those thingies. Pronoun So lets say I is now ma remember we can change everything later on nothing is already written on stone. The sentence I eat is ma kooka.  . What if I want to say I eat an apple? An apple here serves as direct object lets look at wikipedia again. So ma kooka peenko is now the sentence we needed.  . And so on... What if I ate the apple in the past? Lets look for tenses. How long the action of eating lasted? Am I still eating? Im eating right now? Did I use to eat? Lets look for aspects. And if I want to eat? Moods. But wait is it just a random apple I found now or is it the apple we talk about right before or yesterday maybe? Definiteness.  . Now we have some words we can make some sentences and talk. But which sounds are right and which ones are bad? How can I tell people especially on internet how does kooka sound? International Phonetic Alphabet or IPA. So kooka is k.k...   . And so on... What syllables are allowed and what not? What is a syllable? What do words like plosive fricative affricate etc... mean? Wikipedia can help us here too.  . Etc...And finally we could reach something like this peenko dja ma kookastapul tarai shee   Peenko  apple   dja  means yes but here used as a topic marker. Put it simple it means Let me tell you about the apple you dont know yet   ma  me I   kookastapul  kooka is the verb eat st is an suffix indicating the progressive aspect roughly the ing form in English pu is the negation the not in English l indicates desires. So kookastapul as a whole means dont wanting to eat or Im refusing to eat   t  is the contraction of ti the one I choose  the one among the others   arai  is an adjective meaning red. This is inflected in ai because the word peenko belongs to the noun class or gender for natural things like sky tree river water....   shee  is an ending particle indicating disgust like yuck in English. However it is not an onomatopeia it is part of the grammar and its a true particle.  Literal translation  Apple yes I dont wanting to eat the one red yuck!  English translation I dont really want to eat that red apple now because I dont like them!  Basically you have just to play with things.

It is perfectly within reason and Id argue more probable that intelligent insects would be communicating through sounds. However the one thing you wont find many insects doing g is vocalizing using vocal cords or even anything similar. Sure hissing roaches can force air out passively to make noise but nearly all other insects are passive in respiration and wouldnt produce sound through those means. Insects do however love to make high pitch oscillating sounds think crickets and cicadas as well as tapping and grinding of chitin appendages which can be noted in an assortment of larger arthropods such as crabs and well as spiders. ,conlangs,d3v3e2d,1,t5_2red7

8515783,0,t1_d65ktx0,Definitely PCeltic for you then.Casewise ProtoCeltic had NOM VOC ACC GEN DAT ABL INS LOC. In Insular Celtic the DAT ABL INS and LOC all fell into the one case Dative though in certain declensions the forms are identical for different cases andor different numbers singular dual plural.Verbwise a particularly interesting feature that developed in Insular Celtic in both P  Q is Absolute Independent and Conjunct Dependent verbal forms e.g. Middle Welsh chwaryit vs ny chware. Check that out Wikipedia for more.Regarding similarities well the only ones that remain today are Insular Celtic languages and even then really only Irish Scottish Welsh and Breton with efforts now to revitalise Manx and Cornish  fair play. That means theyre far closer to one another than to say Gaulish e.g. taruos trisgaranos in Gaulish vs tarbh tr chorr in Modern Irish especially in structures so that sometimes sentences can be translated almost word for word certainly within the GoidelicQ and BrittonicP branches themselves at least.I can read Scottish Gaelic without much and frequently no difficulty Irish being so similar. Manx is a little trickier because of its weird hybrid spelling but when spoken slowly mind you or rewritten its very very easy to follow in Irish e.g.Normal Manx Tra va mish ny ghuilley aeg veagh eh ginsh ayns ny thieynoast harrish yn chappan mysh yn tra a veh son sidoor.Manx with Gaelic Orthography Trth bha mis na ghille ag bheadh e ag nns anns na taigheanst thairis an chaban muis an trth a bha e son saighdiir.Modern Irish Nuair or An trth a bh mise i mo ghiolla g bhodh s ag insint sna tithe sta thar an gcupn faoin trth a bh s ina shaighdiir.But thats only the Gaelic side all stemming from Old Irish  the Brittonic side is quite different. I might recognise some nouns or simple verbs take CY gafr  GA gabhar goat CY arian  GA airgead silvermoney and theyd probably have to be written down even  after that it just incomprehensible Sindarin to the ears Im not sure when protoCeltic split up but it makes more sense that theyd be less mutually intelligible than say the Romance languages considering the extra stages of separation  where the Romlangs basically all came from vulgar forms of Latin the Celtlangs split first into Insular and Continental the Insular than split into Brittonic P and Goidelic Q then from there came Old Irish giving Irish Sc Gaelic and Manx and Brittonic Old Welsh Cumbric Breton etc.So ya hope this helps a biteen ,conlangs,d6615vo,1,t5_2red7

8526776,0,t1_d675z7d,PreNapoleonic Doggerland was very complicated. The Frisians and Saxons were the first to invade Doggerland that we know of at around the same time as their invasions of England. During the Viking Age the Norse used Doggerland as a launching site for invasions of England and the North Sea Coast leaving behind North Germanic loanwords and orthography and the largest city Aegiravikgh. Denmark controlled Doggerland until the Napoleonic Wars when the French puppet Kingdom of Holland took the island. After the Napoleonic Wars Doggerland along with Belgium and Holland formed the United Kingdom of the Netherlands but Doggerland left in  in a similar but seperate manner of Belgium involving nationalistic movements and the revival of the Doggish language. The country became the Republic of Doggerland following the Treaty of Copenhagen in  and remained independent until  when Nazi Germany invaded. The Allies retook Doggerland in  and since then has been an independent country. Doggerland is a founding member of the European Union and of the Nordic Council has a population of  million and its capital city is Terreinbourg.Another thing about my conworld The Island of Sodor exists and the Danish control parts of Germany north of the Kiel canal ,conlangs,d67erxb,3,t5_2red7

I did some backoftheenvelope math and Vietnamese should have at least  possible syllables before tones.So I would suggest either expanding your phonology towards a Southeast Asian languages syllable count or accepting that a Japaneselike syllable count will result in Japaneselike word length.Japanese itself squares this circle through massive numbers of homophones. Some of the homophones are disambiguated by the pitch accent like the famous hshi  hash  hashi  set. As far as I know the SinoJapanese homophones are only disambiguated by kanji and context although I expect a reply about how so many compounds are disambiguated by the pitch accent.,conlangs,d6e8j40,3,t5_2red7

8822459,0,t1_d789uqe,I do have the problem of being a programmer and therefore prone to thinking like one too often. Especially when interpreting clauses to translate and choosing the grammatical tools and standard forms in the language to use. Further you learn a new way of expressing something then start using it all the time even where its less apt. A bias with the warlike nature of the language and perhaps myself would also be a factor in skewing the interpretation of the sentence to translate. You look at in peace think oh that must be referring to a cessation in hostilities like peace time and go straight in to the standard way of expressing something happening while a time period happens and overlook an alternate interpretation.,conlangs,d78c6m2,2,t5_2red7

My particles are not that different from Japanese so you can just look at them in Japanese.

For example   Mangio un panino I eat a sandwich  straight meaning I just eat a simple sandwich.   Mi mangio un panino lit. I eat myself a sandwich  this is a false reflexive in Italian and means that Im eating the sandwich with please tasting each single bite.   Guardo una partita di calcio I watch a soccer match  factual meaning   Mi guardo una partita di calcio lit. I watch myself a soccer match  I take my time to enjoy a relaxating and exciting soccer match.   Vado I go  leave  its time for me to leave simple meaning   Me ne vado lit. I go myself there  means something along the line Im so angry that I decide to leave now but also   Vado in Spagna I go to Spain  factual   Me ne vado in Spagna lit.

10327068,0,t3_5ndsdu,Hello so Ive been thinking for a while about maybe making a script for my constructed language Ryovyi. The language was made with a few goals in mind  mostly the goals of being easily learnable usable and versatile as well as the sidegoals of being much more sensical than most natlangs  and Im not entirely sure if making my own script would go against the goal of being easily learnable. Since I know my language has  characters Every English letter except for C that means that learners would need to learn  extra letters to pick up my language. That means probably about a day or two for the casual learner yet for a language thats supposed to be easy to pick up that is a lot of extra time! Yet without the script I would add the language looks very intimidating as well  it looks like a mess of jumbled English characters. I know I could steal a different languages letters but the English lettered keyboard is one of the most popular keyboards out there. So with all of that said heres one of the resources for my language You can use this to judge whether a script would be better or whether I should keep the English text...   Thank you! And note that the dictionary and grammar guide are not online yet so ask if you are interested in learning it and Ill pass you a link! ,conlangs,dcemptl,1,t5_2red7

10808460,0,t1_dducavt, Rare but widespread and not so rare as to throw out obvious conlang flags.  If theres a voiceless rhotic then if theres a lateral it generally has a voiceless counterpart and often either glides or nasals as well sometimes all three. Significantly more common than phonemic voiceless trills.  It happens sometimes in the coda again usually alongside laterals glides andor nasals  Turkish has the trill and lateral wordfinally some Mayan has rhotics laterals and glides before voiceless consonants Nahuatl allows devoicing even before voiced sounds as long as its in the coda.  Can happen after aspiration or between a voiceless sound and a word boundary e.g. rki or ikr.  Very rare limited to a few languages in the Amazon Central Africa and the South PacificNew Guinea.  Definitely stands out in a conlang though a way of incorporating it more innocuously that making it fully phonemic is a change of a b or especially b to a trill before u or a similar vowel which accounts for as far as I understand a significant number of reported bilabial trills.  More common than phonemic voiceless trills but not as common as voiceless laterals.  Particularly common in the Sinosphere but widespread.  About a fifth of languages have retroflexes about as many has have uvulars or ejectives and significantly more common than   or frontrounded vowels for example.  They almost always contrast with either alveolars or dentals usually the latter due to maximum articulation distance but sometimes alveolars and sometimes both.  Its not common but yes.  Almost all Australian languages have either a  or way contrast laminodental apicoalveolar alveolopalatal retroflex Dravidian languages generally have a dental alveolar retroflex contrast and a number of other Indian languages have advanced the typical dentalretroflex contrast to dentalalveolar both in additional to an affricated consonant in the postalveolar region Mapuche in Chile and Pomoan in California are a couple others that once again also have a postalveolar affricate and for Mapuche a retroflex as well.  There was an areal feature of medieval and possibly earlier Europe to have a laminodental versus retractedretroflexed alveolar versus postalveolar in the sibilants still present in Basque but collapsed in various ways in Spanish French and German.,conlangs,ddutek6,3,t5_2red7

If you have a cluster of bj with no other clusters allowed or if you allow two consonant clusters like b only but  something like bj can also appear its generally better to analyze such clusters as single segments i.e. bj bjThough they can be distinguished. Some languages are said to make the distinction. It might be better to think of secondary articulation as the shape of the mouth rather than a release. In bj the center of the tongue raises toward the soft palate at the same time b is produced. Whereas in bj b and j are articulated separately.,conlangs,deqh8zc,1,t5_2red7

Offhand I know of  which has been discussed on rlinguisticsThere are also some people from the Conlang Facebook Group who wanted to do a collaborative IPAtoSpeech project I dont think its gotten anywhere yet but theres a wiki for it at And for basic sound files you could go with  or any of a number of similar resources.As Ive said many times before in discussions of IPAtoSpeech however what you really want is not a set of sound files for each phone in isolation you want a set of sound files for each pair of phones. That way you account for the articulatory effects of phones on their neighbors many consonants for example manifest exclusively as a pattern of modifications to preceding or following vowel formants and have no concrete invariant phonetic representation of their own and you dont have to be anywhere near as careful about editing your audio to get exactly on the phone boundary. You can of course do much better than even that and getting large gram or larger base segment sizes could help a little but just going up to phonetic bigrams is a major improvement.If you want to deal with all of the enormous number of IPA diacritics it might be worth looking in to directly synthesizing  modifying segments from mathematical descriptions of the formants. Youd need that for stress tone and other suprasegmental feature anyway if you want to be able to handle those.,conlangs,dfg9da7,5,t5_2red7

11534279,0,t1_dg2qclg,gt Ooh is the identity of ones biological father known?  It may and may not. Theres two modalities on which a woman can choose a man  . In accordance with her mothers and mother sisters the girl can ask for an arranged meeting with a specific man belonging to another tribefamily. If the two families the girl and the man all agree the couple go and live together for  months far away from their native families often in a different town district but sometime even in different villages.  . A woman can also decide to visit a sort of  basically  brothel. However brothel shouldnt be considered as we usually would do. Young men from  up to  years of age can decide to leave their families and join a house of man where these men live in a sort of multipurpose center here they challenge each other in dances poetry philosophical or political debates theatrical pieces they entertain women of all ages even with sexual intercourses any kind of payment is not however allowed and they can also be employed as workforce for any kind of town needs and maintenance. So unlike the name may suggest a brothel in the Shawi society is a place where gentle handsome and educated young men exhibit their talents and gain prestige for their own house of man there can even be competition between these houses and a champion get chosen between the best men once a year.. That being said a woman can go there and have pleasant moments with whoever she wantsHowever women cant have children whenever they want her mother the tribe Matriarch and the Matriarches of the  most influencial tribes all must agree and give their blessing to begin with. After that a woman enter a waiting list and stay there for few years that depends on how quickly and how many elders die in a year.  gt How are children conceived?  Shawi people are humans. So Id say there is any particular difference from us.  gt What if a set of siblings is allfemale? Who fulfils the role of baki then?  The entire family structure is different it is not based on bloodrelationship but on persons age   kih any child between  to  yo of your family so it corresponds with child son daughter nephew niece grandchild   nuze any  yo childless peer female relative sister female cousin young childless aunt you also can ad ki or ba if the nuze is younger or older than you respectively. A kih becomes nuze at her first menstruation or menarche.   mize any peer female relative with children sister female cousin aunt  kiba. A woman becomes mize after her first childbirth.   bozo any yo peer male relative little brother son little male cousin nephew grandson  kiba   baki any ish elder male relative approx. mothers age that is it corresponds with uncle older brother cousin. A bozo becomes baki after the completion of the first  gran circles  x  years of his life he is now considered adult and publicly responsible of his own action before  yo her mother was legally responsible and imputable of his son actions and also she spoke in his place in any official public ceremonies. Because he now reached the age of adulthood he cannot live in the house of man anymore he must come back home and help raising his sisters children. babo or babu elder male or female relative approx. grandmothers age that is uncleaunt and grandmother herself. A mize becomes babo at the begin of her menopause period while a baki becomes babo too in the same time there is not a neat separetion line   mah its the only bloodrelated kinship term and means ones own mother.  So to answer your question a baki is any yo male of my family both in the strict sense people under the same roof and in a larger sense my whole clan that is dozens of families. I myself am an obaki for you o means belonging to another family someone elses because Im in that range age,conlangs,dg3evc7,5,t5_2red7

11569119,0,t3_652wkg,I do something similar but I feel relatively organised. Heres what I doI use lots of LaTeX as it just makes everything beautiful but you can use Word or any office software but LaTeX is better trust me. I have  LaTeX documents Documentation Dictionary and Textbook. Then I have an excel sheet for word roots a few wellnamed text documents with little extra bits like numbers and stuff and the odd image or font if I have a writing system.The Documentation document is how I properly document stuff. I can use LaTeX to organise it into sections and subsections really easily and LaTeX makes a table of contents for me. I always start with phonology phonotactics orthography and writing system. Then I have basic syntax in which I outline my word order and how adjectives are placed etc. I then have a series of sections on all the things required for basic sentences such as noun case plural article etc. Beyond that I just add a section for each thing I work on. Say I do numbers that becomes a new section on the end.The Dictionary is exactly what you think it is and this is where LaTeX really gets useful. I have a section for translating to the language and another for translating from the language. I can use a custom command so I can put in a single line with all the right information and LaTeX automatically does all the formatting so it looks really nice and I can change the formatting globally extremely easily.The Textbook is a more optional one but Im finding it to be more useful for documentation than the Documentation file. As I have the intention to teach my conlang this textbook will be my teaching resource once finished. This also encourages production of a corpus that really helps with lexicon and grammar and is just plain useful especially if someone wants to learn your language.,conlangs,dg7d5ot,2,t5_2red7
