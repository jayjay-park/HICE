I want to have this done in the next day or so. Every day these districts are without power businesses will fail and people die. Raleigh says. There will be payment of course. At this point I am willing to pay out two hundred grand to anyone who comes on this. If nobody gets killed I may even be willing to raise that number.,Empyreus,cljodei,3,t5_33v8c

3185589,0,t1_cos4sps,Thanks.  Not even a little abrasive. Not even a little.That being said I hadnt realized the parallels to Trevor until you pointed them out.  As for money he doesnt struggle to sell or steal things. The personality aspect is difficult to write because radical and extreme his mood swings are.  There will be times were his entire personality will shift half way through a sentence,Empyreus,cos6pw4,0,t5_33v8c
3215137,0,t3_2wyamb, Okay lets get started!Numbers are mostly fine and theyre the only real issue with your character here. First issue is that you mentioned  attachments on your weapon but havent paid for  of them in points. Every weapon gets  free attachment youre gonna have to pay for the other one with an equipment point. Unless youre trying to say you have a rank  sniper rifle with a second attachment. Should probably list those as  separate costs or atleast mention it in your weapons section.Second issue is with your advantages chart. You somehow have  armor even though you have no ranks in armor base armor is  or . Youve forgotten to add the damage associated with  or  if thats what you meant ranks in a sniper rifles progression aswell. Final issue is your eye and how that applies to your flaw. The Marked flaw is some sort of physical indicator that permanently marks you as a member or former member of a particular group that people could use to identify or discriminate against you. I cant see pun intended how a cybernetic eye would fall into that category especially if its custom made by an indiviudal.Other than that I like the character a lot. Interesting but not overly edgy background a decent amount of detail feels fresh and unique. Good job.Fix or address the issues I mentioned and youre good to go.,Empyreus,cov919q,1,t5_33v8c

3391927,0,t1_cpewcu4,Then you are a fool. I might not like the W.A.R.D but even I can see that some people Should be locked away and stay away. We are trying to make this place better not make it more of a shit hole than it already it is. What about the gang leaders that hurt the innocent people around here that got locked up? People who have killed for pleaser and murder for fun. I dont know what kind of fucked up place you come from a boy but Im sorry but that is not the kind of people who should stay there and rot till nothing but their fucking dust is left. You are a fool to think the ones who should be locked up will be so willing to join us. We are all human and some are greedy and want nothing but pain. uClearlyInvsible uBorderbot ,Empyreus,cpewn34,2,t5_33v8c
