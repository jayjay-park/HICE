3930323,0,t1_cr4a9i2,Thanks for replying GameOn. Sad to see he passed away in  but by God what a legacy he left in the visualisation of ST and not only the ship. I also read another snippet on how Yeoman Rand   Grace Lee Whitney actually pushed for the Barbarella look of short skirts and stockings when the designers actually wanted trousers for the female crew. Shame she got punted after  or so episodes but at least Roddenberry took her back later. I read the news about her death recently when she was  years of age?Ive been watching the remastered series lately and what an absolute joy they are to watch. Looking back on all the Star Treks the originals are without doubt the best. ,WidescreenWallpaper,cr4ajok,1,t5_37ckf
