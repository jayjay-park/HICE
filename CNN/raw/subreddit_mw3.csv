2215522,0,t1_clleh9j,Well that is definitely fair. To combat camping i wanted the best reaction time i could get so I play at  sensitivity with fps freaks but getting used to it caused my aim to suffer so i went to hardcore so i could spray and still get kills. ,mw3,cllg2eh,-2,t5_2rp9s

9621799,0,t3_5bbemn,Pryotoz I think. For a young guy he was very well spoken and gameplays were fun especially with the random class generator. He still uploads now I believe but he got out of cod for most part. ,mw3,d9z32at,1,t5_2rp9s
9814808,0,t3_5fg8pr,Opening your eyes normally helps Kappa.On a serious note knowing the spawns and trying to actively predict where the enemies should run will help try to avoid massively open areas where you can as youre bound to get shot from someone hiding somewhere. Check your corners and make sure to use red dot sight on guns with ugly iron sights as that clears everything up for you a st tonne. I tend to preaim common camping spots or preshoot if you cant see an enemy in a dark location but you have a feeling that theyre there take the shot as it may well save your life.  I presume that you used silenced weapons as well its far easier to see your enemies without the muzzle flash.But yeah I hope you find something that helps out of all of this ,mw3,damvy2q,1,t5_2rp9s
