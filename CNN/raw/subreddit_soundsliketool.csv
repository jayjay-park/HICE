6351975,0,t1_czbkohz,Correct. The point of this subreddit is providing music you think that Tool fans may be interested in. The reason why its named Sounds like Tool is simply because we kept getting hit with the same type of posts on the main subreddit which always were titled If you like Tool than youre going to love... Or Name some other bands which sound like Tool. If we only named bands which actually sounded like Tool it would be a very short list because the band is unique.,soundsliketool,czbndla,1,t5_2yfdp
