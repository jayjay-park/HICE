21158,0,t1_cegpum8,This is true.  There are parts of manhattan that had property values as low as some buffalo ones were in the ss and these places today are untouchable and incredibly expensive.That said its easier said than done and being a pioneer in a shit neighborhood for how any many years it takes for the investment to pay off is very unpleasant. Especially so if youve got kids. And not for nothing but the bad neighborhoods in this town are pretty fucking bad. You cant blame people for finding it unacceptable to move their families into neighborhoods where drug dealers stand on corners people get shot and break ins and muggings happen. Yeah they might kick themselves when the property values rise but better to regret an investment  years from now and have have peace of mind until then.Mad men actually had a funny little story arc with this. This author convinces his girl to get an apartment in the lower east side  cause he wanted to feel the soul of the city! And all it took was a few good people to change a neighborhood! They get kept up all night by salsa music and eventually the writer winds up getting stabbed by a puerto rican guy. Even when you succeed do you think the hopeless poverty just disappears because you bought up the block? Nope you just priced people out of their old neighborhoods and they either relocate to another part of the city or to another town. So sure NYC is a lot safer today but then you have towns like Newburgh up the river that had to have the fbi come in to help clean up the crime .On a side note if you ask me whats happening in NY sucks. Slowly but surely the city is gentrifying becoming cleaner becoming more modern becoming safe but its simply happening as a result of the place getting more and more expensive and pricing the poor and hell even the middle class out! The ethnic neighborhoods arent becoming richer instead theyre just being swept away in favor of homogenous yuppie neighborhoods.  ,Buffalo,cegubk1,3,t5_2qi6i

I went I Ginos based on reddit recommendations and I didnt like it at all. Their crust didnt have any flavor to it and the sauce was forgettable not like the NY pizza I ate at home.

399727,0,t1_cfm67os,Investment into canalsidemedical campus aside we are still the one of the nations poorest cities. An overwhelming majority of our workforce is made up of under skilled service industry workers. I think the current projects are great but I dont think they will usher in some kind of new era in Buffalo. These tourist areas like the cobblestone district cater to a population that is a minority in the city wether we realize it or not. We need to find a way to fix educationquality of life issues crimeand blight. I dont have a ton of answers as Im still a young student but from what Ive seenread there isnt a great track record in this city when it comes to government funded projects. Also keep in mind we are putting a whole ton of money into two Bubble industries EdsMeds..how that plays out is up for debate. Im not trying to be a pessimist but we need to take these things in strides. Buffalo has a MASSIVE mountain to climb before we can say things are really turning around.

583914,0,t3_20tdsc,North Buffalo Parkside University Heights Elmwood Village Allentown and parts of South Buffalo I would not call up and coming as they are very much fully developed. However prices here are rising rapidly as well.As for true up and coming places Blackrock Hamlin Park Westside and Lower Westside are becoming trendy places to live. They will most likely be fully gentrified in  years.The First Ward Fruit Belt University District and anything on the metrorail are prime candidates for gentrification. The Fruit Belt because of the Medical Campus and the First Ward because it is surrounded on all sides by developments.The near eastside is developing because of the metrorail as more and more people work downtown and at the medical campus.Future Areas Larkin District While Larkin Square and the surrounding Warehouses have been cleaned up and its an awesome place to visit Im not sure exact about the surrounding neighborhoods. As they build more apartments down there and there is a solid base for retail restaurants and bars  thenI can see the surrounding neighborhoods taking off. Right now Larkin is primarily a  MF area. Polonia Efforts by the Central Terminal Restoration Corporation could help to turn this neighborhood completely around. However the restorations to the old train station has to be completed first. South Buffalo along Seneca and South Park With the newly announced Green Energy Campus close by and  large manufacturing plants slated to open in the next few years near there I see a reemergence in South Buffalo.I see other places in the Eastside getting worse before they get better though.

I believe very strongly in the sanctity of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States and do not feel it is right to force people away from their families on this day. If you agree with me and decide to remain closed on Thanksgiving I will proudly shop at your store when you are open and avoid all the rest.,Buffalo,cm1t77j,3,t5_2qi6i
2348859,0,t1_cm1i4ih,I meant that as a joke. But to your points. The Toronto areas two other really big malls Square One and Yorkdale are also open on Canadian Thanksgiving which isnt really that big a holiday here. It doesnt seem to be that hard for malls here to get tourist attraction status. I think the new outlet mall in NiagaraontheLake has it now as well. The Pacific Mall in Markham aimed the Chinese community is open  days a year so you can shop there on Christmas if you want.. I wouldnt suggest coming to Toronto just to shop at the mall but if youre here for something else weve got some unique stuff you can pick up like a For Better or For Worse calendar or one of those Hudson Bay stripe blankets. Its an interesting time to Toronto area malls right now. Unlike in Buffalo there isnt a clear No.  in the market so theres a bit of an arms race going on. Three or four malls will be opening new Nordstrom stores in the next couple years if you like expensive shoes.Whenever I visit Buffalo I generally dont go there just to shop I like to check out some of your local attractions like the Albright Knox or that Frank Lloyd Wright house.

Anywho just saying that me boycotting anything is probably not going to be noticed as its a normal thing.Oh except that I heard some employees at the Target on Niagara Falls Blvd. talking about how they were staying open until  but nobody told them until they were scheduled that extra hour.  This was about four months ago.  Kinda nasty one was a mom who had a sitter that wouldnt watch the kids that late the other two were students and they were all talking about how bad an impact that extra hour was going to have on their lives.  I havent shopped at Target since.  Im just not comfortable with it.  I could contact the corporate entities but usually what happens is that they tell the store managers to reeducate the employees about what a GOOD thing this is and then the employees are told that if theyre complaining they can find a different place to work.

We do have a lot more moderate problems than we used to so its much more accessible to newer climbers.If youre looking for a world class gym with huge walls and tons of stuff youre in the wrong city.

But the malls exclusion of the number  bus meant that passengers like the yearold Wiggins were let off on the opposite side of Walden Road from the mall with no sidewalks crosswalks or pedestrian signals and left to traverse seven lanes of heavy traffic.gtThere on Dec.   in a freezing rain on a roadway narrowed by snow mounds higher than hydrants Wiggins wove her way through cars stopped at a red light and was crushed under the wheels of a dump truck.,Buffalo,coizjvj,8,t5_2qi6i

However I did spend my whole summer working Downtown on both the west and east side and everywhere between as well as the Kenmore area. The east side has a high crime rate. The west side is being built back up and a lot of young people are moving there. But for an inexperienced buffalo resident I would avoid going there. Refugees are being moved into the area and are adding to the safety but they are targeted for mugging on a regular basis. This is not to say that you cant go there during the day time there are businesses popping up on Grant Street that are really unique. That being said I made a Google Earth colorcoded map to depict the general breakup of cityproper areas and where the two campuses are. If you would like to see it just let me know!! North Buffalo has many safe places to live and is at a good point between both campuses but is closer to South campus confusing yet? If you have more specific questions feel free to ask. It is daunting moving to a new area and not all internet searches are helpful I totally understand! Im a Buffalolifer but am moving out of the area for school as well. Good luck to you!

I own nothing but have been there and was fine with the rental stuff the only problem I have is with the mask fogging up so if I played more I would at least get a better quality mask. Also had resonable pricing but I cant remember how much.

You do pay for them through your taxes and Im sure that a portion of your tuition goes towards campus safety and some of that money likely goes towards helping fund the UBPD. Without a doubt UBPD has ticket quotas just as any police department has. While Im not a fan of quotas I am a huge fan of campus PD handing out seat belt tickets. Its such an easy law to follow and so easy for them to catch you breaking.

3832509,0,t1_cqshv8e,No I actually mean triangular in a local sense not so much in a layout sense but yes radial in a larger sense since Buffalo streets extends out of a downtown epicenter. Ashland Bidwell and W Delavan is an example. I know what you mean but sometimes when youre new and the roads are unfamiliar its not that easy. There isnt a lot of leeway  in terms of distance  to react either. I can think of many examples in the greater Buffalo area where lanes appear and disappear within a very short distance. There just isnt enough time to change lanes at least not without being a little aggressive. Couple that with the heavy snow in the winter things can get confusing pretty quickly. Ive gotten used to driving in Buffalo its part of my muscle memory now but when I first moved here I got thrown off a lot. I speak from my own experiences your mileage may vary.

If there was a way they could work with an app that alerts you about  minutes before your time expires and asks if you want to renew via your creditdebit card that would be a big improvement. Its not always easy to get everything done in under  hours.Side parking  I dont mind the MWFRF rules too much although God for bid I oversleep or have a day on a Monday or Thursday. But the alternate  day cycles are a major pain in the ass. Especially like I mentioned on Cleveland the only street that I know if in the nearby area that operates like that.Theres another stupid rule on a strip of Baynes off of Ferry. You can ONLY park on a certain side between AMPM on Mondays and Wednesdays. The other side you cant park there during those times but can every other time. I do not know of any other street with those rules and is pretty much a gotcha grab.Speaking of sideparking I have yet to see a street cleaner come down my street so having that enforced during summer hours is just pointless and again a money grab.

If homeless shelters are full of violence and theft that just proves the assumption about the homeless that you want to lecture to people about making.  Getting rid if a homeless camp is perfectly reasonable for anyone in the area with anything to protect.  They dont have to be using illegal drugs other things they will probably be doing is commiting crimes of opportunity harassing people leaving body waste vandalizing etc.  Another thing is that its not necessarily a shelter they needed to follow the rules in but a relatives house or wherever.

Take all your preliminary general education courses at ECC easy credit courses also find out what would be required in your program.   thats what? Two semesters of classes?   then transfer those credits to which ever school you intend to study your focus.   Also be sure to find out if those credits what level courses would be necessary are transferable.   I have heard some people lose out on transferring credits because they didnt meet requirements most likely because they took a lvl cc course   generally  amp  level courses super easy at CCs eliminate  lvl courses at the Mid level state schools.  If you want to stay very close  especially to save money on room amp board go to state ub or canisus.   If you want to be a little bit away and think gas and driving to visit buffalo will be affordable go to geneseo or Fredonia.  ,Buffalo,cyny1hr,4,t5_2qi6i

Those I know most opposed to change in the EV are typically identityobsessed. Their selfimage is as dependent on conformance and susceptibility to branding as that of lets say WYRK listeners. The guiltbyassociation argument for punishing the franchisee for the obviously deplorable hunting of the franchiser is absurd if you are willing to harass and intimidate over that you ought to be doing the same thing to every restaurant serving meat. Its our national attitudes writ small. Everyone thinks theyre righteous. Lack of reason the instant othering the resentment the hate and vigilantism are presented as ills of the opposition by all sides. In my reality everyone is acting like a dick and bickering over dogmatic garbage. The mere existence of contradiction is not a targeted attack on your identity.

We sometimes take for granted how easy it actually is to park FOR FREE in almost every district of the city with a little work. But to end my rant there and give you real advice  Find your destination and start circling the side streets increasing your radius as you go. Hertel may be a hot spot right now but there are pockets of it that dont have much going on. Just venture a few blocks away from your destination and veer down a side street. For someone like you that is obviously new to the city as well parking a few blocks away and walking could introduce you to some new spots along the way too. Good luck!,Buffalo,d15aueq,2,t5_2qi6i

7667062,0,t3_4kbgs5,Welcome to Buffalo! Its a cool town. And its dirt cheap so if youve got a decent job you can live like a king relative to NJ or other east coast cities.  As mentioned Elmwood is probably the  area for the something crowd. But Allentown and North Buffalo have their value too North Buffalo is a bit older but still with plenty of youths. Less bar hopping and more hanging out at the bar all night having great conversations. Probably a bit more of a regulars scene there though there are lots of young regulars about. Downtown has an ok happy hour but empties out pretty quick unless theres a game or concert at st Niagara.I havent spent a ton of time in Allentown since moving a couple years ago but its got its own vibe too.Theres a million things to do in the summers and the What are you looking forward to this week threads are a great place to find specific ideas. Not surprisingly the summer is all about being outside as much as possible ideally while drinking.  There are festivals nearly every weekend through the summer from the Italian Festival to the Elmwood Festival of the Arts to the Allentown Art Festival just to name three. All are family friendly but also drinking friendly so they are great places to meet new people and spend an afternoon though the Italian festival can get stupid later.  There are lots of microcommunities from slowroll a weekly bike brigade through a different neighborhood to curling at Canalside in the winter that can be great for meeting people. Whatever youre into within reason theres probably a group of likeminded people who gather to enjoy it and welcome newcomers.Broadly its a pretty welcoming place sometimes a bit parochial and certainly with an inferiority complex but overall the price the pace and the quality add up to a gem. ,Buffalo,d3dp8wh,11,t5_2qi6i

There is nothing of value to a train passenger near the Central Terminal.  Like  years ago they would have to connect to downtown or other points in the region. The only reason people continually try to return train service to the Central Terminal is because they want to piggyback those funds into a greater and unrelated development project.  What they fail to see is Amtrak will only cover a very small portion of the project see. how they have not signed on to the new NF station and thus it would be a misguided boondoggle.

11353225,0,t1_dfhsm0s,This isnt directed primarily at your point but we really need to stop thinking of economic growth in terms of developers.In this case what we spend a bunch of public money rehabbing CT and subsidizing a project with a developer. If he needs the subsidies its because it wasnt economically viable in the first place. So public money finances a suboptimal project that doesnt create its own selfreinforcing demand.Im not sure exactly what the answer is and this is a much longer and more in depth issue about economic development outside of major cities. But I think the genesis of an answer starts with things like spending public money on education UB creating smart people in the area and on basic infrastructure look to what Chatanooga has done with building top class broadband which is huge for job creation these days when Buffalo cant buy fiber to save its life  Our conversation is skewed when we talk about transportation projects and rehabbing old buildings as economic development. Transportation serves primary sectors that produce something it doesnt create wealth by itself unless your connecting people or bringing more people in some way which would happen a bit perhaps but not on the level of what other investments might do.,Buffalo,dfiv81n,2,t5_2qi6i
