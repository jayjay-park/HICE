11106640,0,t1_deqwanc,But this is the problem there are inconsistencies with all of this. From day  it seemed the logical scenario that he had gone off in one of the bins.  This possibility was ruled out.  So it sent the case off into all kinds of directions.  The police are now saying they believe this is what happened and no crime has taken place.  However I myself have thought how hard it would be to climb into a bin.  I dont think anyone drunk or not would even consider going to the effort to open up a large bin and get inside just to sleep.  My only thinking is one of the bins was open and he went for a wee up against it with his phone in his hand but then dropped the phone inside the bin.  Hes then had to get inside the bin to retrieve the phone.  If the bin was full of cardboard and not particularly dirty he may have sat in there looking at his phone or doing something like taking a photo of the inside of the bin to post.  This would be the kind of thing a  year old would do as they post any odd situation on SM.  but hes somehow fallen asleep.  He may have been a sound sleeper who did not wake when the sound of the Lorry reversing happened.  By the time it was tipping it would be too late.  This is the only scenario I can think of that would not be criminal.  ,Corrie_McKeague,deqxf7i,8,t5_3io8n

11154296,0,t1_dewaze2,Tesco is just on way out of Bury so should have still been on that mast. I am almost certain that i read that the last ping was originally mentioned as Milton or Mildenhall then that comment vanished and it was said last at am in Barton Mills area where it had been since . dont know why the story changed.,Corrie_McKeague,dewbt3e,1,t5_3io8n
11171741,0,t1_dext0qq,Maybe they saw the number plates on the lorry that came out but didnt check them on the lorry they were given to run tests on? Or the number plates were changed?It would depend on how people got in the HS. If they were already there or were in a building and came out into the HS then cameras could have missed them.,Corrie_McKeague,deyazbk,3,t5_3io8n

11451708,0,t1_dftyxv7,good post i agree with it all always have thought he is AWOL and i think he is abroad if he is.maybe Amsterdam its where his brothers went not long after he vanished or even USA he had friends in USAF could have smuggled him on a cargo plane .would answer his phone pinging in Barton Mills only  mins from Mildenhall where the USAF have a camp.,Corrie_McKeague,dfu1iv9,2,t5_3io8n

11538915,0,t1_dg34maq,I still think there is more to the doorway cctv too. They must still suspect awolaccidental  As technically it is not a murder yet still a missing person. ,Corrie_McKeague,dg3xsde,3,t5_3io8n
