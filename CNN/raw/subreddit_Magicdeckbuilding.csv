14837,0,t1_cefm1hr,gtAnother change I would make it to take out  cacklers and add  more Desc Demons. Your curve is still nice and low with the rest of your  costs. I would actually run a playset of Cacklers.  If anything OP should cut some ThrillKill Assassins. gtConsider adding some mutavaults for free  punches you can add on. From the looks of it you will have lots of spare mana moving later game so the vaults will be easily usable.I would advise against this as well. This deck relies a lot on having the right mana at the right time. This deck is supposed to kill the opponent by turn . gtTake out x Exava Exava works great even without other unleash creatures. Shes a  with first strike and haste. Also if OP has them Tormented Hero is great. A black  onedrop works well even more so since OP is running Madcaps. ,Magicdeckbuilding,ceg4gdy,1,t5_2sv87

I agree that its probably for the best to leave Sages Row Denizen Fanatic of Mogis and Gray Merchant of Asphodel until a later turn when its clear that we have more than enough mana to solve our problems.

90008,0,t1_ceonmx5,Yeah no problem. Id recommend looking up popular burn decks and seeing what you like. I found that mono red had too many issues personally...Like if an opponent gets a Leyline of Sanctity out I was pretty much shutdown. Edit Should clarify that I was shut down because theres no enchantment removal in red. Your options are limited.Switching to the  color burn enabled me to run things like Lightning Helix which is killer in the burn mirror match. Also it gives you access to cards like Wear  Tear to stop the previously mentioned Leyline.,Magicdeckbuilding,ceooct0,1,t5_2sv87

208149,0,t3_1wgxjp,This is not white devotion. This is white weenie with Nykthos. There are two parts to a devotion deck  building the devotion and then doing something with it. White is in an odd place here. White has probably the absolute best ways of building devotion. There are all of  cards you would not want to play if devotion were not a thing. White has almost nothing to do with its devotion when it has it. And I think youve figured that out. I think you need to take a step back and figure out what the other end of this equation is. What do you do with the devotion when you have it? If the answer is generate mana what do you spend the mana on? Your current deck has a very low mana curve with Heliod as the only mana sink. Theres not a lot of good answers to that question and Im afraid I dont have them. But thats what I see here and I think thats something youre going to have to figure out if you want to go forward this deck.,Magicdeckbuilding,cf25goo,1,t5_2sv87

Is this list made up of cards you happen to own but dont own a full set of any?You would be better off running  or  of a select few cards instead. That way you can plan strategies mid game better as you will have a better idea of what cards you will draw.If you have them or have the budget for them then get  more Invisible Stalkers and  more Kor Spiritdancers.

317423,0,t1_cfdnflf,Good point I guess red could go  Anax and Cymede isnt a better drop than Fabled Hero and Rootborn Defenses does the most important part of Boros Charm. But then again note that the deck has a lot of scrying and Boros Charm is a situational reactive card. I could cast it in response to a Wrath or removal spell or to finish my opponent off if theyre low on life after wiping out my creatures. So it doesnt need to be cast early and often. Anyways whenif I make the deck Ill definitely test it to see how well it holds up before pulling the trigger on buying or trading for lands. ,Magicdeckbuilding,cfdo4pj,2,t5_2sv87

354162,0,t3_1y5356,Welcome back to cardboard crack Magic the Gathering! I like the idea you have going a Jund Green Red Black deck. We have a name for that now! And causing some discard havoc among your friends.That being said I think we can change a few things with a very small budget. . Your deck doesnt seem to start casting and doing things until around turn . That can be problematic. I would suggest adding some one Mana cost spells to assist you. Lighting Bolt is a great card to do that. . Youre running  colors and youre going to need help stabilizing that. I suggest maybe running Borderland Ranger in order to help set up your lands. . This deck begs for Megrim. Megrim deals two damage to your opponent each time they discard. This is an effect you want on your side of the board.. Bloodbraid Elf is a card that fits your colors as well as lets you cast spells for free of the top of your deck. This is another creature I would consider.Thats all Ive got for now but good luck!,Magicdeckbuilding,cfhh528,5,t5_2sv87
362267,0,t3_1y7udx,You have a lot of things going on in this deck with all of your ofs.  I think the best thing to do is to coalesce into a theme.  For starters Id suggest dropping your enchantments and artifacts since none of those impact the game in any real way.  Sunbond doesnt have enough lifegain enablers.  Epharas Radiance is just plain bad.  Travelers Amulet is unnecessary with  lands especially for a  color deck.  If youre having trouble with your mana base just run Boros Guildgates.  Fated Retribution will blow you out probably worse than your opponent so cut those as well.After all that since it looks like youre just trying to piece together a deck with the cards you drafted at a prerelease I cant really tell you what to add but try to add more creatures.  A lot of the creatures you have here are not standard playable since they just arent as good as other ones that are available. As a rule for an aggro deck  creatures is not enough.  Aim for  and see how that feels.The best advice I can give is just take it and go play with it.  See first hand which cards impact the game and which dont.  The other good thing to do is after a loss ask your opponent if theres anything they would have done differently.  Many people are more than willing to give advice to newer players if you ask.,Magicdeckbuilding,cfibcdo,1,t5_2sv87

391882,0,t3_1yjwv1,Keep in mind Im totally guessing here because we dont know your meta in the slightest but youll probably see burn spells or black kill spells somewhere so Mizzium Skin is a good utility spell for your sideboard. Pithing Needle is great utility. Detention Sphere Id probably just roll in the main board all of them. Last Breath is pretty solid at shutting down most creatures that are scary or are getting scary.  The Azorius Charm is more good utility. Id go with those suggestions right now and an incomplete sideboard until you play a few nights and see what people are running.Edit Some counters are never a bad idea and you have the white pro color spells so mizzium skin is kinda up to you atm.,Magicdeckbuilding,cflduo4,1,t5_2sv87

435754,0,t3_1z1kyi,Im guessing this is for casualkitchen table magic if its not you should specify format standardmodernlegacy etc.The main weakness of an exalted deck is that you naturally want to attack with just one attacker which makes spot removal like Doom Blade really good against your deck. One way to protect yourself from this is to either play creatures with hexproof as attackers e.g. Gladecover Scout or use tricks to do the same thing e.g. Rangers GuileSome specific stuff for your deck. You are playing fog and birds of paradise neither of which helps your main strategy. The very basis of the exalted strategy means that youll usually have blockers available and you also have the four unflinching courage to help you with lifegain you do not need fog. Fog is only good in very specific decks. Birds of Paradise is good if you really need to build up mana fast but your curve stops at  theres really no need for them.Your deck is missing any true bombs cards that your opponent must deal with right away or lose. One that is in tune with your theme is Sublime ArchangelYour deck is also missing removal spells. As of now a simple Fog Bank can stop everything except Unflinching Courage from your deck. You probably want at least a few spells to get rid of pesky creatures good white ones include Condemn Swords to Plowshares and Path to ExileFinally in magic you are allowed to have a sideboard. A sideboard is up to  cards that you keep next to your deck. Magic is usually played as best of . Between each game you are allowed to switch cards between your deck and sideboard but keep your deck at  cards total. The normal strategy is to purt niche cards in the sideboard. By niche cards I mean cards that are really good some of the time and useless most of the time. Since these cards are normally useless you dont want it in your deck but if youre playing an opponent deck where the cards if really good you want it for game  and . For example Celestial Purge is really good if youre playing against red or black but useless against the other colours so you probably dont want it in your main deck but it could be a good sideboard card.,Magicdeckbuilding,cfpxir1,2,t5_2sv87

Maybe even Forced Fruition.  Those cards with Psychosis Crawler make for a fun time.  Theyre even more fun with Niv Mizzet the Firemind and Basilisk Collar in my opinion haha.

Thats also part of the reason for the inconsistancy. As im new I dont have all the cards i require. This deck started as the Deaths Beginning intro deck which i have slowly upgraded. so far Doom Blade has been ok because i havent faced many black creatures. I have some mates who also play one is bluewhite the other is redwhite and the third is a long time player with a few different decks. Ive only got the two mystics and until now i havent considered more purely because I havent had any mana problems.  I love this color combination before i started collecting i had played on the xbox  and i used a solid green deck. The idea of big strong monsters appealed to me and i avoided black because I didnt like the idea of paying life to deal dmg. But when I came across this combo and realised there was more to black than just sacrificing life it became my favourite. I already beat my friends easily with this deck. But id like to start joing FNM and trying my luck.Sylvan Caryatids look cool but i dont know where i would take cards out to field them. As it is i dont know what to take out for Lotleth Troll. Seeming as the play style burns though the library quickly is it worth while running more than  cards? I understand that  is optimal as you have the most chance of pulling the cards you want but If i could get the Lotleth Trolls and Deadbridge Chant in the main library I would be happy.

772428,0,t3_22zjzq,Since your concept is EXACTLY like mine I will share so you can maybe learn from what me and a few buddies have built over the last few months.The concept of this deck is all about tokens. You have a TON of removal to just keep the board as clear as possible. You just sit back and create tokens that will do damage as they come into play with Purphoros out you can keep the board clear and attack with tokens you can use the tokens to chump block THEN before combat damage is declared sac the tokens to Tymaret to do damage and still prevent the attacking creatures damage and all the while you have Trading Post which can gain you health create tokens see above return artifacts from the graveyard to discard and gain life so you can make more tokens.Ive beat every one of the top  decks with this deck. It does have a learning curve...it is tough to know what to remove and when and how to use the combos but once you figure it out the deck is REALLY good.Nothing is funnier than having out  or  Young Pyromancers and playing Molten Birth... tokens  damage if Purphoros is out and if you win the coin toss you can do it again next turn!Some notable cards in the sideboardRakdos CharmPlaying Blue Devotion? When Master of Waves comes out you drop Rakdos Charm to do a bunch of damage to the enemy player THEN kill the Master of Waves. Sucker.Pithing NeedleSelf explanatory really...adds another Artifact to combo with Trading Post AND it is a GREAT way to shut down Planeswalkers OR AEtherling dont forget it shuts down AEtherling...Ive done it before,Magicdeckbuilding,cgs2vfh,1,t5_2sv87

850658,0,t3_23vgmc,Just checked it out I love janky decks that try something else. My worry about this deck is how do you win besides biovisionary.The deck needs more win cons Kiora can be a win con and good defense courser of kruphics provides card advantage and a higher likelyhood to combo out. I would go with  kiora  courser.Cut fated infatuation  blue is just too much I would play kioras follower mana acceleration and fix plus combat tricks. Druidis deliverance polukranos provides a threat and removal is also meh in this deck you want to have your combo threat in combination with more threats. I would either not play thaumaturge or play  or  and have more stuff that makes use of the bear.I think for me the core of your deck is  Biovisionary    Progentor mimic I would play   Polymorphus Rush I would play raised by wolves as even if the creature it targets it gets killed you get  tokens or you play fated intervention as it all of a sudden brings you within range of your combo target and as said provids pressure on its own. With all the manafix you can play it. And on your turn scry to get what you want.I think there is potential to be a tier   deck as getting the consistency will be hard but maybe having a general tempo threat is all good on its own. Even if you are near zero if youre biovisionary is on the table with  more creatures you can win out of nowhere. Maybe just play clone as well as it provides optionsI have  polukranos in my deck and  clones I either get my final biovisionary or I am simply pounding my opponent and I clone my polukranos or I clone a packrat with kiora in play.

893334,0,t1_ch5no0l,Thank you for the tips! The decks only at the fun stage so far so itll take some work to serious it up a bit but Profane Command is perfect and I can drop Fling and Rancor since they were fun options anyway. I think Grim Tutor could be my best option to make sure I get at least one Marit Lage by turn  since the deck has been known to draw slow on occasion. My best draw while playtesting was to hit the th Lage on turn  assuming each one was bounced or there was no Legendary rule so if I can get anywhere close to that consistently then I think the deck could cause issues in some games.

About the EtheralEidolon combo you want to run more enchantment and less instants. Generally the instances you use are for protection or battle tricks. So those would be Gods Willing Brave the elements dauntless onslaught launch the fleet ect. As for the enchantments x Eidolon of countless battles x Ethereal Armor x Aqueous formx Gift of orzhovaThis is my personal list and you build how you want to but it gives you an almost mono white mana cost.

1101700,0,t3_26q9ji,For the love of god man get that Rooftop Storm into this deck.  It singlehandedly breaks zombie EDH decks.  I run it in my Nekusar zombie EDH and it just isnt fair.Also Id recommend Vengeful Pharaoh as a very versatile card.  However Nightscape Familiar is probably one of the best cards any Grixis deck can pick up even if it is black heavy.  Hes a very cheap zombie which adds to your apocalypse count has regenerate and works well with your commander.  Sheoldred is also fantastic as a reanimationremoval source.As for cards that could maybe be shifted out Zombie Trailblazer can be very slow and sometimes even bothersome as he removes a minimum of one creature from combat doesnt work defensively and doesnt do much of anything late game.I was never impressed by Necrotic Ooze either since it seldom had many good activated abilities to work with or was too costly.  I put in Avatar of Woe instead since youll usually have a pretty full graveyard on all sides and its great removal.Quest for the Gravelord is another meh card here as it doesnt usually trigger for a few turns after you play it and can only be used once.  Also the inability to reanimate the produced giant or the enchantment means its oneanddone which isnt what zombies are about at all.Bloodflow Connoisseur doesnt really have a place in this deck I think.  Yes shes a sac outlet but without any major benefit.  Also for a  three mana is too much especially when theres no immediate upside or evasion.  Grimgrin is much better in almost all ways.  He also has a oneturnwin combo with several cards including Elemental Mastery which Id recommend looking into given that you have several tutors.Finally I think an Amulet of Vigor would do tremendously well in this deck   one of the only downsides of zombies is that they enter the battlefield tapped half the time but the Amulet puts a stop to that.Hope some of this proves useful and have fun!,Magicdeckbuilding,chtip0v,1,t5_2sv87

There are a lot of good counterspells that go for relatively cheap and the alwaysawesome Lightning Bolt sells for only about . a pop. If youre going the UR rout the only expensive cards are Remand Snapcaster Mage and Vendillon and if youre playing casual you can make a pretty good deck without them.

1576629,0,t3_2cbq4m,If youre looking to do a GR Theros Block deck I would check out MTGTop Gruul THS Block decksA lot of these decks splash white for Elspeth Banishing Light and Chained to the Rocks. Personally I really like Fanatic of Xenagos in block if youre doing just GR.All in all you definitely want x Courser of Kruphix and if youre not doing just Block constructed x Elvish Mystic. These two will help ramp really well and the lifegain from Courser is incredibly relevant. Xenagos the planeswalker is also a must have He can create  hasty creatures andor create lots of ramp. Arbor Colossus is also a great creature to add  for  with reach and the monstrous ability shoots a flying creature.I feel like Ordeal of Nylea isnt terribly impactful... By the time you want to put it on creature you have another creature to play and its a good way to get two for oned. The only time I see ordeals being impactful is in super aggro decks or heroic decks with protection from Gods Willing.Probably the best creature you can add is Stormbreath Dragon.  Flying Haste for  protection from white and a sweet monstrous ability. That card allows GR to be so amazing.,Magicdeckbuilding,cjdwn8i,3,t5_2sv87

See while you were away the Alara block introduced shards which consist of a color and its two allied colors BlueBlackWhite  Esper for example and shortly after Ravnica introduced the Guilds to us. The Guilds of Ravnica all revolve around a dual color system RedWhite  Boros for example so its become a coined phrase to refer to a deck that only used a single color as Mono  I would recommend going on Cardkingdom.com using the advanced search engine and filter our creatures with the color white and the text Knight or Human. That will give you a list of every card with that creature type as well as any card that interacts with them.

If so you should get a playset of Bloodsoaked Champion another  Spear of Heliod too. Launch the Fleets could also be pretty good.

2327902,0,t3_2lyv27,I like where your heads at. But I think it might be a little split between play styles. I have a built a very similar deck. I think its best to ask how does your deck win. From the looks of things it seems that you have to split win cons. Either mill Ashiok Phenax or direct damage Empty the Pits Prognostic Sphinx and with that in mind I think you need to decide on one and build around it. I chose more a control route Jace the Living Guildpact and Liliana work very well together. Jace also has the benefit of feeding your graveyard for delve. The idea behind my deck is that eventually you control the board so tightly its almost impossible to have something stick for long. Then getting there with a small amount of damage over time.If you decide on a mill win con then I would suggest some different creatures. Guys like Returned Phalanx or Disowned Ancestor to give you the blockers you need early game while having high toughness for Phenax later. I would get rid of the Mind Rots and add some more bounce spells and some amount of Thoughtseize if you can. This will help in the later game when you can bounce one of their threats and then pluck it out of their hand netting you a  zombie from Waste Not. Brain Maggot is a good card but I am on the fence about him in both your deck and mine. He exiles from the hand so while it doesnt trigger Waste Not it can at least hold the card until you are ready to make your opponent discard it. It is a two for one but ideally you are blocking with the maggot saving you damage and netting a zombie so its not too bad. I wrote a lot sorry. I really like the idea behind this deck. Please let me know if you have any questions. Let me know what you think. Exciting stuff. Standard is in no way close to being figured out yet so anything is possible.,Magicdeckbuilding,clzfwrn,2,t5_2sv87

2374917,0,t1_cm57tlv,Bloom titan is a honestly pretty weird deck that uses cards like summer bloom to play bouncelands the ones that enter tapped you have to return a land to your hand but tap for  mana. These are usually horrible in modern. But amulet of vigor lets you untap them allowing you to generate a ton of mana to play something like Primeval titan. Just Google Mathias hunt amulet of vigor combo and watch a video its really hard to explain. Actually scape shift is a fairly good deck. Its probably defined as t meaning consistently does well in tourmaments. Its essentially a control deck that plays a one card combo. Im assuming its delver match up is bad but Im not sure.

Two toughness doesnt get you far.  Almost all  and  drop creatures in the history of magic block it. Making his ability rarely relevant without committing more cards to helping him.His ability isnt that good. Honestly you cant cast lands he bricks on context cards ie counter spells and you have to leave mana open to cast their cards. Good if you flood bad if you have your own game plan to win. Average CMC in a deck is  so you get on average with lands included  life per attack.TLD ability isnt that amazing hes weak for the cost easy to be removed easy to block him and  other cards youd rather have in your deck.,Magicdeckbuilding,cmjbjeh,4,t5_2sv87

3044437,0,t1_codhtum,On your other deck its very strongly focused against creaturebased strategies and in particular traditional creaturebased strategies i.e. the ones where your opponents game plan is to play a creature or two per turn and bash you with them repeatedly. If thats the kind of deck youre playing against you will probably be fine. As long as you can avoid the likes of Black Knight If you run into anything else this deck probably will not work. It usually just dies to something like a Modern Splinter Twin deck for instance. Or to your blue deck. So if you wanted to improve that deck to play against a general field of decks Id suggest trying to make it more resilient against noncreaturebased strategies.Have you read this series of posts on the metagame clock If not you should.

3157440,0,t3_2w7tc8,Very interesting. Ive been playing around with Ensoul decks since the card was printed starting out UR with Shrapnel Blast and Scuttling Doom Engine before switching over to WU with a variation on the deck that featured in PT Khans and I havent run into a Jeskai build before!  Twinflame is exciting tech for SDE and Shrapnel Blast well done there. I cant wait to test this myself! I agree that TC and DTT are completely dead in the deck  I think you might be better off with Jaces Ingenuity if you can consistently cast cmc spells Font of Wisdom or Weave Fate. If you stay on the Jeskai path maybe try Godsend as a singleton. That card is bazonkas and youll have no trouble casting and equipping it with a Renowned Weaponsmith in play. My Ensoul deck has taken quite a strange turn since the printing of Renowned Weaponsmith. Ive gone back to UR and gone allin on a glass cannon build thats doing pretty well in my local meta. Id be interested to see what you think. Essentially the plan is to either get as much damage as possible as quickly as possible with Ensoul and Ghostfire Blade or to cheat out SDE then finish with a Shrapnel Blast or two. I will post a full list when Ive tweaked it a little more after FNM. The best bit of tech I found is Ms junkiest of junk rares Chief Engineer. In this deck hes Springleaf Drum on a stick. Hes so good I cut the drum entirely. Also with two Ornithopters in your opening hand this guy powers out SDE on turn three. Ornithopter is also if youre on the play a ridiculously good target for Ensoul and Ghostfire Blade simply because attacking on turn two with a flying  is absurdly hard to beat when youre holding up Negate to protect it on turn . You can always side them out if youre on the draw in game two. The core of my deck is this  x Phyrexian Revoker x Ensoul Artifact x Chief Engineer x Renowned Weaponsmith x Ornithopter x Shrapnel Blast x SDEIm still playing around with numbers on the following Negate Reality Shift Font of Wisdom Dissolve I actually prefer Negate in the main now Illusory Angel you can cast a lot of stuff for free so switching him on on T or T is easy and now Twinflame too.,Magicdeckbuilding,cop9lmt,2,t5_2sv87

3428953,0,t3_2zgz7a,Sultai is powerful but tends to be a risky play. if you are looking to play more competitively you might find yourself spending more money than youd like. there are plenty of great decks in standard right now that can be relatively budget. Its no secret that playing the meta will leave your wallet in shambles so Id recommend reading up on all the sets in standard right now and maybe creating a rouge list for yourself.

3565333,0,t3_315j9r,I second Nivmagus Elemental for this deck I run this type of deck frequently at my LGS and its a consistent turn  kill most of the time assuming no serious removal on my opponents side. I dont know if you already have some ktk fetchlands but you can upgrade the deck easily from this point to a powerhouse with  if you do. I think didnt do the math.So basically theres plenty of ways to go with the deck but heres the core of the deckx Nivmagus Elemental Easily your by far strongest turn  play. It is practically unkillable by burn so all you have to worry about is Path to exile and Abrupt decay. It also gets huge fast.x Kiln Fiend On the other hand the weakest creature in your deck is Kiln fiend. This poor guy is obviously great if you untap with him and the opponent has stone cold nothing but the fact that he dies to almost anything from bolts to decays to electrolyzes and that he cant attack through a  powered blocker is pretty bad.  Still  the deck needs redundancy and at worst hell eat a removal spell.x Monastery Swiftspear Another great  drop creature that can come down turn  and easily be dealing  damage turn . Nothing much to say here prowess works great with what your deck is trying to do and its a pretty resilient threat. x Deaths Shadow This baby is my favorite beater in the whole deck. Really forces hard and complicated decisions from my opponent Do I attack with my etched champion? What if he has a distortion strike and kills me on the swingback?. Can easily come down turn  as a boltproof threat depending on the version youre running of course and no threat can grow as fast as this guy can. Youll have to test him to see for yourself but he is extremely strong in this deck with all the phyrexian mana spells. Speaking of whichAll decks run x Gitaxian probes x Mutagenic Growth x Temur battle rage x Assault Strobe x Tainted Strike x Ground Rift Clears blockers and storm works great with Nivmagus since you can eat the copies individually for  counters per spell cast. x Apostles Blessing. People use to run x Gut Shot as well but now that delver is out of the format is it though?? people have been cutting these in favor of other spells. I still run em and love em but its up to you. From there you need to pick what colors you wanna run. Want to run blue and white for Emerge Unscathed and Distortion Strike? Run green and white for Wild NacatlBecome Immense and Vines of Vastwood? Stay straight red black for Thoughtseize and Dismember as well as a simpler manabase? The deck is very flexible as you can see on MTGO where a lot of different versions have been having variable success on dailies lately. I personally run the RB version which is really fast but also really suicidal! I can easily go to  life turn  for a huge deaths shadow if I feel safe from burn and win from there but it of course has its risks. I wouldnt run this version in a heavy discard meta as its not as resilient as other versions and requires x Leyline of Sanctity in the side which might be out of your budget. If you have any questions feel free to ask and I hope I helped you at all! Sorry for the wall of text!EDIT In case it wasnt clear since I didnt talk in depth about the manabase you DO NOT WANT TAPLANDS in your manabase. You want fetchlands like Bloodstained Mire Shocklands like Blood Crypt and Steam vents Painlands like Shivan Reef Rainbow lands like City of Brass or Mana Confluence. MAXIMUM  basic lands. I personally run  Ive seen people run  mountains as path to exile fetch targets. Its up to you and how many colors you decide to go. ,Magicdeckbuilding,cpyoait,2,t5_2sv87

3952947,0,t3_35qo38,there are a few things a good control deck needs   permission advantage and a resilient wincon. one of the big things im noticing is that your threats are powerful but force you to spend resources protecting them. what you want in a wincon is a powerful creature that takes care of itself so you can continue controlling the game while you start trying to win.   the best standardlegal creature who does this is arguable Silumgar The Drifting Death. he has  power which is not the best...but he flies has hexproof and has  toughness. once silumgar is in play bar edict effectsboardwipes he will essentially never die. additionally if you go down the route of using dragons like him is that you get access to Silumgars Scorn and FoulTongue Invocation immensely powerful cards that require you to have a dragon in hand to get their full effects.  as for the overall deck you probably want  dreadbore  go for the throat and  doom blades. for counters you probably want  dissolve  mana leak and some other cheap counters maybe that UUR that counters every spell on the stack and cant be countered or the UB counter that makes them lose  life forget the names sorry.  as for resolved in enchantments youre kind of shit out of luck.

4143185,0,t3_384071,First of all welcome to the game!Ive used decks that steal the opponents thing andor copied their creatures. Its a fun concept that has seen many variations over the years. Keep in mind though your deck will have some definite disadvantages even before the game starts. Consider that many creatures in Magic are under  casting cost. That puts you at a disadvantage since many creature sealing and shapeshifting spells are  or more. You are spending at least one more mana at all times then your opponent. You may think high Tide will help but its just a bandaid on an occasional turn or two.Also remember by playing your opponents strategies and that isnt always going to work. Many decks work well together with creatures artifacts. lands enchantments ect. You likely wont be able to copy your opponents deck but your strategy will be to copy or steal what they have and just beat them down with it. This only works with Aggro or Stompy decks. Combo creatures are typically weaker and Control creatures often have activation costs that may not be blue and unusable to you.With that said copying the opponents deck is fun and you definatly have that covered.

4180765,0,t3_38pgsc, Nullify isnt where you want to be.  Disdainful Stroke also isnt. Those are going to end up being dead cards a lot of the time and with  each you have a good chance of ending up with  of them in your hand at the same time.Throw some burn spells in there. I wouldnt even maindeck Nullify personally. Maybe a couple in the board but eh. I also ran Radiant Fountains in addition to Swiftwater Cliffs. The lifegain is pretty valuable and you shouldnt be too concerned with any double colored spells. Also Silumgars Sorcerer seems really bad especially since youre only going to be exploiting itself. And man.  Perilous Vaults? youre a mad man lol I know UR is a little limited as far as sweepers go but definitely dont need all .  Vaults and  Angers in the main should be good. Keep the other  Angers in the sideboard too theyre great against those damned Den Protectors and Raptors.I know conventional wisdom says to run somes when possible but I think you really need to consider dropping quite a few counterspells and upping the threat count. Hell maybe even try something like Lightning Berserker or another dash dude so at least you can dash him out and pump if you have nothing else to do.  Nullify  Vault  Disdainful Stroke Lightning Strike  Reality Shift  Magma JetId definitely trade away some of these superfluous counters for burn spells. Reality Shift is also notterrible spot removal and its really your only option outside of bounce effects and burn to remove creatures in UR colors.and my last suggestion would be to remove Silumgars Sorcerer for some other top end threat. Stormbreath Dragon Sarkhan Ugin etc. Im not entirely sure what to recommend but Id just go with what you think will work best.  Keranos and  PLA isnt going to be enough most of the time IMO.,Magicdeckbuilding,crwt7c3,1,t5_2sv87

There is an outpost that your opponent loses life when a creature you control leaves the battlefield if you get a second out you can use the other effect of drawing an extra card. Also put the new  drop  damage red instant forgetting name. Get flamerush rider. He dashes out and makes a duplicate of himself or another creature you are attacking with. Alesha who smiles at death can also be a good addition bringing back Kolaghan Forerunners among others. Goblin heelcutter will dash out and prevent opponent from blocking. Mardu scout is a good  drop. I got rid of all my black dash there wasnt enough advantage to them. Instead since I run heroes downfall and a few other black spells I started running merciless executioner and some exploit creatures like quarsi sadist.

4875895,0,t3_3hn91d,The first thing I would recommend is dropping one of your Talismans in the mainboard for another Wurmcoil. I would also drop the x fabricate in favor of more counterspells. Mono U Tron shines in the late game and the more counters you have the better youll be able to navigate your way there. I know you said you are on a budget but I cannot recommend Remand enough. I know it might not seem that glamorous on the surface but it is a huge part of this deck. It counters something back to their hand and draws a card. It allows you to counter something of your own that an opponent might be trying to counter allowing you to save the first spell and even draw a card off of that while their spell gets countered. There is so much value to it and sitting at around  a copy is an absolute steal I bought mine at  each when I first built the deck.I would recommend building a sideboard too it is a big part of this deck and is how you handle a varied meta efficiently. Aggro is an issue against the deck but I have found that  Silent Arbiters in the sideboard work well and are cheap.  For my own build I am going to be getting at least  Ugin The Spirit Dragon for mainboard and  Chalice of the Void for sideboard but until then here is my current list not budget but will give you an idea of how many counters I run and how many win consbig threats I win. The deck has performed great for me and is what I play at modern events. I went through my deck and built the list on tapped out just so I could post it in this comment actually!,Magicdeckbuilding,cu958fy,2,t5_2sv87

5245461,0,t3_3mud8y,These are some interesting choices and I am not sure if they are the right ones. I dont think Breaker of Armies Eldrazi Skyspawner Kozileks Channeler Leaf Gilder and Ruination Guide should be in this deck. Id rather go for Rattleclaw Mystic Shaman of Forgotten Ways andor Whisperer of the Wilds for ramping. Maybe in combination with the new Kiora. As far as early creatures go Id use Fathom Feeder and Catacomb Sifter in addition to Tide Drifter. Important Eldrazi are Ulamog Bane of Bala Ged more Oblivion Sower and you seem to have missed Blight Herder and Conduit of Ruin. Also playing many Eldrazi you just have to cram at least  or  Titans Presence in the deck. It replaces Grip of Desolation Dispel Sideboard Rush of Ice and maybe even Clutch of Currents. I am not sure about Natural Connection. You probably have to play more to see if Explosive Vegetation or Sylvan Scrying might be a better options.,Magicdeckbuilding,cvi9mlh,2,t5_2sv87
5250933,0,t1_cvitlsc,Very good point. Right now my ramp is huge Best case scenario is Ulamog turn  average is around turn  because its mono green. Counterspells are more of a worry for me than a kill spell as that would prevent me from summoning conduit and getting ulamog into my hand. I still think my deck could take a kill spell or counter and win but it really depends on what the other guy is running. My sideboard is all blue so I can splash in some control and give myself the time for a slower ramp. ,Magicdeckbuilding,cvixcy9,1,t5_2sv87

That said I have a very similar deck and I just run a sac outlet because it also works with Rally so i dont lose my stuff. a Wrath effect is interesting though... It is better if playing march from the tomb...Serene Steward gt Bloodbond Vampire because it doesnt cost BB and it has better interactions with MarchRally... Would you rather cast Rally for  or ?

5688946,0,t3_3szoc8,im of the opinion that Hardened Scales decks are an all or none thing.  This deck only partially implements Hardened Scales with  of them and very few cards that actually create  counters.  More than half the time you get Hardened Scales out you wont get to use it.  Hence it feels like Hardened Scales Inspiring Call and even Abzan Ascendancy are wasted card slots here.  Also Avatar is pretty dependent on having other creatures already out with  counters on them to get the most value for him.  In this deck Im pretty dependent on Servant of the Scale and Hangarback Walker to make that happen.  Dropping a  Avatar on turn  is a pretty devastating blow.All that said Drana in a Hardened Scales deck designed with lots of creatures could work well.I do like your idea of adding Nantuko Husk.

6667941,0,t3_46ys41,Personally I would also have a playset of Kalastria healer as it is great for when your allies enter the field and works doubly well with your playset of zulaport cutthroat ally gain and drain then when ally dies gain and drain.

6687673,0,t3_46fi0w,I use a really easy bit of maths to figure out my land hopefully this will help you too!Say you have a BW Gain n Drain Allies deck The deck I am currently fine tuningGo through the deck and count up how many white mana symbols you have then how many black mana symbols you have including the symbols on any hybrid cards for all the spells you have in the deck not including the generic mana as this is irrelevant.Lets just say you have  white mana symbols and  black mana symbols you add these together totaling .So we have  total mana symbols now you take the white mana total  and divide it by the total mana symbols then multiply the result by the number of lands you want in the deck. Do the same for the black mana symbols. Lets assume you want  lands total.So for white it looks like this  ..  .For black  ..  .What I do then is level the decimals I tend to bring each total to its nearest decimal point unless you have both going up or down leaving a  or  total or something then I add one or drop one off the highest and add it to the lowest or vice versa.So that leaves white mana black manaNow if you are putting dual lands into this deck which you probably will be say you put  dual lands in drop your blacks down to  and your whites to  this will give you access to plenty of basic on both counts and still allow you to fix with duals but this particular part is often just about playtesting and seeing what works.You could also drop two off each or add more dual lands or any number of variations just remember that most standard legal dual lands ETB tapped especially after April and September and therefore they slow your deck down. I normally only have    max in a deck this works for my decks. Of course we dont know what SOI or any other expansionsblocks will bring so this is a very general statement.Hope this helps!TLDR  Take your total mana symbols of each colour divide the total of each separate colour of mana by the total of all mana symbols and multiply the result by the total number of lands you want in your deck fix the decimals and that should give you an idea of how much of each land you want in your deck.,Magicdeckbuilding,d0b2b3h,2,t5_2sv87

6702547,0,t1_d0ckh6k,Thats a really bad argument to cut warden. Of course you will not be able to cast it on turn  every time such is the nature of variance. If people that are using a tried list and winning IQs are playing  wardens off of  sources of  untapped green then I dont think thats too little. If we use some really generic and not very accurate statistics thats  in  cards meaning youll have one in every opening hand.  Of course thats just on paper so its not really a good argument but Id say theres no reason to cut warden. The only time playing warden is bad is when you cant play a  drop and cant play warden t.As for the HBW thats pretty much the exact opposite of the direction the deck wants to take. If we want to be the beatdown dont play slow creatures like HBW. Draconic roar is fine too  damage for  is fine plus most esper dragons lists only run  dragons granted they can dig for dragons harder but its still close. I think the deck as is looks good the only thing I dont get is the lack of murderous cut.,Magicdeckbuilding,d0clnoz,1,t5_2sv87

7131266,0,t3_4d5yq0,The issue youll have is that youre going to run into a wall once you run out of cards. Youll play your guys and any one with a small amount of control is going to wreck you. What you need is some card draw some creature kill and possibly some life gain. I dont see anafenza in your deck but neither does she belong there. Drana is way better in this case. Sorin x  allows you to see cards gain life make vampire tokens with lifelink and kill things. Ob Nixilis x  creature kill and card draw. Take out Expedition Envoy for Indulgent Aristocrat x . Since youre running vampires all over the place its way better.Take out  drana because she is legendary.Also run  gideons. His tokens arent that great anymore but his emblem is amazing.Take out touch of moonglove. Its bad in standard. Is put in something like grasp of darkness x . With this deck Id say youre looking for  planes walkers  removal spells and the rest creatures. If I were you Id also rely more heavily on vampire triggrs than allies. Zullaport isnt good because you dont want your creatures to die so you wont get value out of him with out more token generation and free sac outlets like nantuko husk. Id do thisSpells Anguished Unmaking Gideon Ally of Zendikar Grasp of Darkness Ob Nixilis Reignited Ruinous Path Sorin Grim NemesisCreatures Cliffhaven Vampire Dranas Emissary Drana Liberator of Malakir Indulgent Aristocrat Kalitas Traitor of Ghet Malakir Cullblade,Magicdeckbuilding,d1oqud0,2,t5_2sv87

7163374,0,t3_4dkks6,Cryptolith Rite is a great card dont get me wrong but its drawback is that after you get one on the board the rest are useless and having extras sit in your hand can cost you.  You should probably limit that to  copies.  Maybe replace  of them with  evolutionary leaps?  If you manage to get both out there its very satisfying to tap a bunch of  tokens each for a green then dig out a replacement for each when someone throws down languish. Ulvenwald Hydra is definitely a good card but if you are tapping creatures for mana and say pop this thing out on turn  it will only be a  for a cost of  mana although the extra land is nice.Maybe drop black?  You only have  sources for black land which come in tapped.  Those spells and creatures will require you to not only have cryptolith rite on the board but also untapped creatures that you can tap.  You have beastcaller but it will not help anguished unmaking.Hangarback walker is a great  drop especially with dromokas command.  Fantasyland You would drop it turn  for a single counter tap it on turn  for  mana to put another counter on it pump it with dromokas command for another counter then make it fight an opponents creature.  Hopefully it trades and dies and you get  fliers you can have towards abbey although this is not necessary if you were able to cast a creature on turn .  Turn  secure the wastes turn  transform abbey.  This doesnt require cryptolith rite it just becomes a sweet bonus.Converge cards are tempting but if you are not flooding your hand with too many rites then they cannot be counted on.  I have tested unified front with only mediocre results and more often than not I only got  tokens out of it for a cost of  mana.  Not terrible but for  mana I would much rather be able to toss a Gideon out there which can give me a  right away the later transform into a .I havent tested this kind of setup with Ulamog yet.  Not sure how reliable that would be if the gods shined on you you might get it out on turn  but getting it out there early would require having cryptolith rite out there and ulamog also be in your hand.Gideon would be a nice addition too.,Magicdeckbuilding,d1sensp,1,t5_2sv87

I really like the deck idea and am planning to do something like this in a casual deck sometime...That being said I feel that Lightning Axe is a better replacement for Fiery Temper because well it simply deals more damage and does what the deck is trying to do put Galvanic Bombardment and Take Inventory in the grave. It kills sunnyside Avacyn Advocate... Play both I guess if you need more burn thought I should think not with Bombardment in the deck as well. I also think you should consider some masswipe spells such as Kozileks Return or Seismic Rupture for tokens or white weenie. Rise from the Tides could be good if games go on too long but it has pretty good synergy with the deck. Just the Wind or Unsubstantiate is nice if you need to get rid of creatures a lot as well.Also I think youve read ThermoAlchemist wrong.

I personally am not sold on the masterpiece and am not currently running one. You may also want to get your hands on Choked Estuary  a piece and Sunken Hollows  a piece to help smooth out your mana curve.I personally run a mix of Gisa and Geralf More recursion Haunted Dead and Voldaren Pariahs with fleshbags and nantuko husks in the side. The reasoning here is that the husks are strong at dodging exile effects but dont have great evasion themselves. This means I normally use them purely as a sac outlet to trigger Relentless Dead and I am not sure that necessarily warrants a spot. The fleshbags I have in the side because while they are very strong they perform woefully against token decks which currently make up a large part of the meta.As for removal I run Collective Brutality and Dark Salvations. Them being sorcery hurts but I love the ability to pitch zombies into my yard for later use with CB and the ability to grow the ranks late game with DS. Anyways those are my thoughts. I also like to run a single Westvale abbey simply as a finisher if I have too many tokens that cant push through.,Magicdeckbuilding,d5sebs0,3,t5_2sv87

9510415,0,t3_5b2auw,I thunk its less important to think about numbers than understand the objective of each. Forget midrange for a moment. Generally speaking aggro wants the game to be over as soon as possible. This means its threats are fast and cheap but easily outclassed past a certain point in the game. Control wants the game to go long. It wins usually either through high power level card advantage or both.Midrange is just between these two extremes. It plays well early and late and can close out a game fast against an aggro deck that stumbles or beat a control deck that may not get its engine going or gets disrupted with powerremoval of its own.Also these are just labels that makes decks easy to talk about. ,Magicdeckbuilding,d9lczo7,10,t5_2sv87

You can also sometimes find just the planeswalker deck without the boosters for sale at your local game store for about . I bought a few planeswalker decks from my local store without the boosters. They felt that they would make more money stripping out the boosters and selling them seperately than trying to sell the whole package.So theoretically you can just buy the cards from the stock decklists and then go about upgrading them card by card.

Murder Metallic Rebuke Gone Awry Void Shatter or even x more Grasp in your MB are all worthwhile considerations to disrupt their board as is Reverse Engineer to reload your hand cheaply.  A couple of alternative win cons to consider would be Torrential Gearhulk or even Mechanized Production which combined with Prophetic Prism or even a Puzzleknot is a oneway trip to value town albeit a janky one.

10659486,0,t3_5shs0u,Theres no way you can support BB on turn  and UU on turn  with those lands and really you wont be able to support  colors at all even if you stick to singlecolor costed cards.  Even  color decks usually run ish duals along with the aether hubs and you have .  I would cut down to either UR spells or UB control and while UB does have access to fatal push which is probably the best removal spell right now I think UR has better tools for dynavolt.In terms of the overall archetype youre going for I think that you should drop cards like stormchaser mage expedite slip through space which are more aggressivetempo in nature for control cards.  This is because youre never going to be faster than mardu vehicles and those cards are almost useless on defense.  Instead something like the UR dynavolt control decks seems more appropriate. As for the other card choices I dont like the trophy mages.  In a meta dominated by aggressive decks you dont want an overcosted card that just draws you another tower.  Tapping out turn  for a tower is already a big enough cost you really dont want the second tower until later in the game so running an effective  copies of the card seems unwise.  Following all that advice gives you an extra  slots to fill.  Id start by playing  glimmer of genius basically required for control decks at this point  galvanic bombardment  Disallow assuming you have them since theyre in the SB  scatter to the winds  negate  horribly awry  brutal expulsion and for the last two slots some combination of confirm suspicions shock and summary dismissal depending on your meta.  This lets you have a ton of interaction for the early part of the game which is basically a necessity at this point with all the vehicles running around.  Youre able to play a very strong drawgo control game before and after youve resolved a TItI or tower with strong  and  mana removal  and  mana counters and still retain the amazing game  against control that comes with playing  towers in the main.  If you really find yourself behind where the counterspells arent getting use you could consider taking out the mb negates horribly awrys brutal expulsions and those last two flex slots for some combination of tormenting voice and firey temper.  This gives you a bit more draw as well as allowing easy access for lightning axe out of the board against GB or even in the main for their hightoughness creatures.  However I still think the ability to leave up countermagic every turn is more valuable so Id avoid the sorceryspeed spells. ,Magicdeckbuilding,ddfg0qi,4,t5_2sv87

Its there because I like the art on Plummet. Its there because Naturalize effects are always useful in my metaIf there isnt a clear answer cut the card. With whats left start putting in  copies of those cards. Even if they arent powerful thats fine! You want consistency.

Thats if youd want to have him with an extra deck for him to feel out. Best of luck to you and your brother!,Magicdeckbuilding,denlxis,2,t5_2sv87

11134548,0,t3_5yaalt,I almost think you should add in some white and make a mardu vehicles deck instead Gideon Ally of Zendikar would help you out a lot. I found a way to get a  turn  consulate dreadnought creatureyes continuous creature out by using siege modification. Not sure if you want to go that direction but if you want a good vehicles deck then thats what I would go for.,Magicdeckbuilding,deu39gl,2,t5_2sv87
11152858,0,t3_5yzjgd,Lunar Force is a bad card youre better off just playing more Void Shatters or Spell Shrivel or Horribly Awry if you want more counter effects.  I guess if youre plan is to play a lunar force and then tap out the next turn for an Eldrazi as a way to dodge sorceryspeed removal it makes sense but that is such a narrow situation and it still seems like a bad card in most every other situation.With  lands and no ramp or mana cheating you will likely never be able to cast Ulamog.  You could maybe run an Oblivion Sower as a way to ramp you into it but still have a body on the board.Tutor effects arent really good unless you can combo off and win within a turn or your deck is filled with a bunch of oneof utility cards.  Even then you probably dont want to pay  mana for it.  Youre better off switching those out for card draw if you want that effect especially since there is a lot of blue card draw at instant speed.,Magicdeckbuilding,dew5xr2,1,t5_2sv87
11163932,0,t1_dex0cg3,Yeah initially I was keeping it cheaper for the budget but some of the cards sploded in value. I would probably add some rb lands in place of some of the basics.I still suggest the deck Im having a lot of fun playing it!,Magicdeckbuilding,dexf4k8,1,t5_2sv87
11243611,0,t1_df68ure,Im absolutely with you. Im eager for the spoilers. Contingency Plan is a great idea I was thinking Cathartic reunion but doesnt cull through as many cards by comparison. Theres so much possibility seeing as I have no clue what Nicol Bolas has been up to but seeking power in the afterlife from some Gods? It seems pretty likely to me. Makes me wonder how big graveyards are going to be as Amonkhet cycles in. ,Magicdeckbuilding,df6g3ca,1,t5_2sv87

11457247,0,t3_63iiwo,Champions are totally worth it at least put some in board they negate  of the  top removel in the format.Personally I would drop the thunes for another martyr and a land. Take out the heights completely and run more basics and or Emeria the Sky Ruin. Standard soul sisters runs  lands and if your casting angel the game has gone on to long. If you can fit into the board mana tithe I think you have a very solid version of the deck,Magicdeckbuilding,dfuo5tu,1,t5_2sv87

11513220,0,t3_64b5u7,Id say go sultai just because it has better ETB triggers right now. My head isnt quite clear enough for brewing but Id say you want six self mill spells cmc three or less  reanimator targets  lands threeish splendid reclamation and a full playset of new Liliana. Maybe one or two Ever After...I like demon of dark schemes and a blend of bluehulks and greenhulks as your starting point for reanimator targets.Also I think ramp spellscreatures would be wasted cards in this concept. Youre cheating the mana costs already by pitching cards to be reanimated later so Id say that just demands finding the right amount of removal to survive early turns before going over the top...,Magicdeckbuilding,dg10x2h,4,t5_2sv87
11647219,0,t3_6641d2,Why arent you running Brimaz king of Oreskos. Ajanis Pridmate would be worth considering if you added basilisk collar or some other ways of gaining life. You can also throw in Ajani Goldmane for some value.,Magicdeckbuilding,dgg85jg,2,t5_2sv87

11791116,0,t3_67wx4s,Eager Construct seems to me like just filler in this deck  I dont see why the scry helps you any more than it does the opponent and then its just a bear. Scrapheap Scrounger gives extra aggro plus recursion in that spot.Also surely Metalwork Colossus has a place here?As far as lands go theres also Inventors Fair Spire of Industry Hanweir Battlements and Sequestered Stash to consider and there are three available upgrades for Cinder Barrens i.e. Canyon Slough Foreboding Ruins and Smoldering Marsh Im guessing the Ruins will work best for you.gtEventually I want to replace the Workshop Assistant with  more Metallic Mimic.... but your list shows x mimic and no assistants... did you update it preemptively ,Magicdeckbuilding,dgwk9n7,1,t5_2sv87
