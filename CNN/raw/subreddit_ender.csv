1614769,0,t3_2cqy6e,Not  certain myself but i believe the ansibles always allowed communication with ships travelling at near light speed. It just wasnt fully explained until the later books. In Enders Game in chapter  it mentions them receiving reports from the fleet via ansible. Link,ender,cjipifj,1,t5_2s23u

It cant come from the parents if you dont begin when theyre little. Thats what parenting is. Indoctrinating your children in the social patterns that you want them to live by. The intellectuals have no qualms about using the schools to indoctrinate our children in their foolishness. Teresa Wiggin in Shadow of the Hegemon,ender,cl616qw,2,t5_2s23u
3240394,0,t3_2x4c0p,Its not in the shadow series. Im currently reading all the books and I know exactly what youre referring to. I THINK its that one book whose timeline spans the end of the war up to the indian colony. But you arent crazy. She definitely tells him that. Its the book where Valentine Peter and their parents all reach the conclusion that bringing Ender home will be detrimental.Edit nvm my reading comprehension skills are lacking. Didnt fully read OPs post. Um Card says in one of the forewards that he has corrected a lot of continuity errors in recent publishings so the only real way to know is to get the most recent version of each book.,ender,coxvgwu,1,t5_2s23u
5066030,0,t3_3ihtdb,In order to answer that question you need to look at least  scenarios.. There are already carriers in the world either by natural mutations or other secret experiments and Petra is a carrier. .There are already carriers in the world either by natural mutations or other secret experiments and Petra is not a carrier. There are no other people in the world with the key switched.. If this is the case than the key is a recessive gene and because bean suffers from the affliction he is homozygoot carrys two turned Antons keys and wouldve given all his children one of the keys and Petra wouldve given a key to those that suffer from the affliction and not to those that dont but those that dont are carriers. Children born from an incestuous relationship of the carriers have a  chance of suffering from the affliction  of being a carrier and  of being perfectly healthy. amp .Because  and  will result in the same family tree I will combine them here. The family tree starts with Petra having  turned keys and bean with either  or . We can see that some suffer from the affliction and some dont that means that the gene is dominant because Petra couldnt have given her children a switched key. Because the gene is dominant there are no carriers and the children that dont suffer from the affliction wont pass the gene on to a next generation. Because there are no carriers scenario  isnt even possible.If we look in the books we see no mention of previous experiments succeeding or Antons key being naturally switched so scenario  is unlikely.This is based on my Highschool level genetics lessons so this probably has some flaws.,ender,cuwnc9q,2,t5_2s23u

8868808,0,t1_d7dv6jb,I think I can see why now that Im past the first climactic seen on Path about halfway through. This book has some wonderful philosophizing. Its packed gems. The most recent for me was We will pray for Christ to include our terrible sin in his atonement. I converted to evangelical fundamentalism a few years ago havery since left their church. They taught that if someone said this prayer a profession of belief and desire to live a life of pious commitment then they can be sure of their salvation. I like how the bishop taught me a completely new perspective! The believers prayer theologically is not about making a trade with Jesus okay Ill believe in you as long as you promise to save my soulstyle. Its about recognizing our impurity believing that Jesus died to atone for exactly that i.e. impurities generally and then asking God to include our own transgressions among the ones Jesus died for. It was just a totally new way of hearing the Gospel. Just one example of the depth the stories which in itself is just one of the many reasons I do as you say enjoy the series.,ender,d7dwms6,2,t5_2s23u
