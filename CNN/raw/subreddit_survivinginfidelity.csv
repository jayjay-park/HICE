567452,0,t1_cg48in4,Lezziewe all make excuses for our partners behaviour. It in some ways makes us less angry at them when we explain their behaviour.But let me say this...being young does not make you immature. Being immature makes you immature.I have never cheated on a GF not because there wasnt opportunity not because i have the greatest respect for my past GFs  i do but thats not whyThe reason i never cheated was that i know who i am...i know doing that would betray everything that i am. I am a man with honour and integrity when it comes to these things. Im not perfect by a long stretch but i know who i am...and act accordingly.Your man...does not have that. He has no personal integrity anyone who can lie and cheat repeatedly does not have that part of them. They can develop it...but you have to want that...he must want to be that type of person and act in a way that serves his higher self...you cannot want that for him and you cannot make him that person.Your questions are very valid but there is no answer in terms of what you are looking for. There are no guarantees whether its early whether they told you or not....those are great if you have them..but ultimately it only matters what you and he do with what has happened. That will determine what happens going forward.Is he a good person who made a mistake? Or is this part of some behaviour that is more indicative of a more serious issue.His actions now his behaviour now his willingness to accept  responsibility for his actions should be a good indication of who he is.But ultimately...you must decide if he is worth risking your heart with again. There are no guarantees...with him or with someone new. Life just isnt like that. People are not like that.The real question is...what do you want? Can you honestly see yourself trusting him again? Are you honestly capable of forgiving him? Truly forgiving and letting go is the hardest part..otherwise no matter what you two do...that will always hang over your head and heart.If you cannot let this go if he doesnt show that he is truly sorry and wants to work on things....then there is no hope. You dont want to be with someone you cannot trust...and cannot forgive.There are choices that you must make.I wish you strength and courage no matter what you decide.Sorry this happened to you.,survivinginfidelity,cg4rw7j,2,t5_2x8ez

2092097,0,t1_cl5q2wy,Thank you for sharing. The thing is he started the conversation but started it by saying he kissed someone. He said that was it but over the course of several weeks I found evidence of more. He would  reluctantly confess to the things  I found but then say that was everything and then I would find more. He says he lied because he was scared. Then it turns out the kiss that started the whole thing was a lie! He didnt kiss that girl after all he just felt bad about everything and wanted to start the conversation?? Although I have no idea if he would have ever disclosed everything? I feel like hes a compulsive liar and it frightens me. I think he really does love me but there is something really deeply wrong with him that is going to require years of therapy and soulsearching to get in touch with. And I get really mad about the whole thing which I fear makes him even less likely to tell me any truths. I feel like since Im in the situation I am blinded but if this were happening to a friend I think j would know that she should leave? I desperately want to stay but I also know things will never be the same. I feel so robbed and disrespected and lost. ,survivinginfidelity,cl5r2kf,5,t5_2x8ez

I wouldnt be surprised if she has hidden email accounts fake Facebook page and probably subscribes to various dating relating programs.  She should be doing everything she can to regain your trust.  Shes done nothing but continue to treat you like dirt.  The trust was gone after you first discovered her infidelity she must do everything she can to get it back.  Maybe I am wrong but after the first infraction you should have free reign to do what is necessary to repair the damage.  There are some great key tracking programs out there you should look into.  What she is doing to you is not love.  Its selfishness.  I am sorry to hear you are dealing with this.  Good luck!,survivinginfidelity,cmqxad9,1,t5_2x8ez

3307934,0,t3_2xywtc,Cut contact now.  He is still in a relationship with OW.  He said he doesnt think that relationship will last past graduation in a few months time.  So are you really willing to wait a few MONTHS while he decides who he wants to be with?  Youve said that you think that the only thing stopping you from cutting contact is how much it will upset him and you want to spare his feelings.  You know what?  You arent the one who created this situation.  Hes hurting because of the choices that HE made ... not you.  Its not on your shoulders to make him feel better about that.  Its not your circus they arent your monkeys.  Taking care of yourself is not being selfish.  When emergency personnel come upon a scene they are trained to assess the situation and make sure its safe as possible before they enter.  They are not being selfish for doing so.  Do you honestly feel safe getting back into this relationship?  From what youve posted I think your inner voice is already telling you no.  And thats okay.  Youre not a terrible person for wanting to heal and preserve your heart. ,survivinginfidelity,cp5byal,2,t5_2x8ez

Some wronged spouses dont want to hear the details.  Others want to hear all of it and set their minds to divorce if the cheater evades conceals or tells one lie no matter how small.  The primary motive for the spouse to ask questions most times is to try and understand why their partner cheated and the likelihood of it happening again.Sorry you had to go through this process.,survivinginfidelity,cp8nhdt,2,t5_2x8ez

If she lies to you whom else does she lie to?If you stick with this I predict that there are more surprises yet to come  that more will emerge and that what emerges will demonstrate more lies.How would that make you feel? How much of that are you prepared to put yourself through?I would like you to be happy and safe from a person who engages in relational transgressions namely cheating and lying in this case.May I ask you have you engaged in analogous relational transgressions?

I would then go to tell her as objectively as possible without any judgements on the ex or her on what happened from your perspective.

To answer your questions since you seem to be wondering if reconciling will work starts with complete and radical transparency and honesty.  Period.  You want to know if he will cheat again?  You should be able to know because you have  access to every electronic device he has. Yes he can have a burner phone but thats not very likely with someone who so far has just had a ONS.  It wasnt a mistake do not ever let him manipulate you that way. He CHOOSE to do this he chose to abuse your trust and betray you. Give it a year and if he meets all your requirements and is going to MC and IC and continues to be apologetic and remorseful for as long as YOU need it without giving you crap about asking questions or needing support then maybe he has turned himself around.,survivinginfidelity,cyws05d,2,t5_2x8ez

He was my first everything literally I mean everything. Boyfriend love first person to have sex with and I was having his kid. Well  weeks after having his son I do research on his facebook cause hes stupid and wasnt that good at hiding anything saw he added this girl from his job on there I knew something was going on with her as well. The girl who got pregnant is not the girl he worked with also I found out all about the cheating and pregnancy after we broke up. And I checked phone records and I knew something was happening but I couldnt prove it so I basically lost my mind. Post partum hormones dont help either. So we break up Im finally starting to get over him when he comes back and we decide to try to work it out. Worst. Decision. Of. My. Life. Ever heard of your first is the worst? But me being the nave girl I was thought everything would be alright. No.Things are worse than ever now I ended up getting pregnant again he still has to talk to the girl he cheated on me with because they have a daughter together and were both miserable. I work two jobs at  weeks pregnant and he doesnt do a damn thing and when I try to kick him out things get scary. If you think you can get past it then good.

6909506,0,t1_d0zeqho,I think I remember reading your story awhile ago. I remember reading something about vow renewals. I left him for about  weeks. Friends took me in. But weve been together for  years this May. Our th wedding anniversary is this August. So when he begged me to come back he said hed go to MC with me. I was ready to walk away. He brought upMC not me. I relented and came home. Hes trying. I have all his passwords and logins. He spends much less time online. He changed jobs in the same company so he doesnt need to travel. Works from home a lot more. But I still dont trust him and dont know if I ever will. Dont know if I will stay either. He knows all this. Years ago after I was laid off by my company we made an agreement that I would stay home and raise the kids take care of him and the house. He promised he would take care of me. Then he did this. So Im looking for work. Changing careers. I feel an intense need to be independent and self sufficient because I have no trust that I can depend on him anymore. I told him that I had plenty of opportunity to screw around on him but I never acted on it. I took my vows seriously. He knows its true. We are the same age but I look much younger than I am. I always have guys hitting on me. Difference is I never took any of those men seriously. I was flattered but I always told them straight up that I was married. I didnt need validation from anyone else. smdhIts only been  months. If I had been younger when he did this I wouldve walked and never looked back. But Ive spent over half my life with him. Hes always been good to me except for this bullshit. If he keeps doing everything right I think I can be happy with him but I will always wonder how long before he gets bored? Our sex life was great. WTactualF? Hes never lost his attraction for me. He seems remorseful so Idk. ,survivinginfidelity,d0zigqr,2,t5_2x8ez

He would eat the dinner I prepared shower and put on the cologne that I got for him. Put on the favorite sweater we picked out on a vacation.He would kiss me goodbye. Tell me how much he loved me. Go to his monthly poker game for ten minutes and then to her house to screw. Then come home lay in our bed wrap his arms around me and tell me I was the perfect fit. Who does that? For me that is some cruel and wretched shit. I wouldnt ever be able to be carefree and in love with him. I want to be with a man that I dont have to second guess giving my heart to and doing nice things for him. He was stupid to risk it all. ,survivinginfidelity,d0zxbqb,9,t5_2x8ez

Prior to this he was a good husband and father and now I feel like everything is a fucking lie. Now I feel like Im questioning everything I thought I knew about him about us. I keep wondering if this will ever get any easier. We decided to try and work it out after a long and painful process. But I almost feel like I won as a default You know? Like its just more convenient to stay married and he loves the kids and its just easier than trying to divide our assets with a judge.The root of it all though is an insecurity about myself that his cheating has exacerbated. But Im taking steps to feel better about myself. I set up an appointment with a counselor and Ive been active and eating much healthier. Ive already lost lbs!I really dont have advice for you. Everybody says it will get better with time.

Why she was willing to abuse your trust.  Why she was willing to lie to you. Why she chose over and over and over to be selfish and entitled and act on those feelings.If her reasons are all  her ownership of poor coping and selfishness it may be this was the first time. It may be she will do the work to restore her integrity  but she has to fully own that SHE destroyed it through her own choices and poor coping.That sick feeling you have is because you KNOW you cannot trust her  is she doing the work to build that trust back?

7319660,0,t1_d29xt6x,That is one of the things I regret most of all.  I had a car from before our marriage in my name that my husband had been wanting to get rid of for years.  Car finally gave up the ghost and we were going to scrap it.  I worked with a  couple of people that expressed interest in it but AP was the only one that followed through on removing it  from our house and fixing it.  He paid us scrap value over about  months.  I foolishly thought that It was a mutually beneficial situation.  I tried to prevent AP from coming when my husband would be there but he insisted on being there when the car was picked up.  I realize how ridiculous it all sounds.  I cant believe that it was actually me that did those things.  I have never been addicted to drugs but I honestly feel like I was strung out during that time.  I knew that what I was doing was wrong and I ignored those feelings in favor of securing my next high.  I absolutely had a choice and made the WRONG choice over and over.  Humans have incredible powers of selfdelusion.  I regret the affair.  Any validation I got from it was shallow and meaningless and it destroyed my family.  Even if my husband had never found out it still destroyed my family.  Ubombadil did not deserve the hurt I put him through no matter how bad things were.  It turned me into a person I didnt recognize.  But it was me.  I did those things.  I wish I could forget them.  I will work every day to make up for those mistakes.

He completely controlled the interaction got what he wanted out of it and then callously dropped themmoved on.  Nothing he didnt want.  No compromise no concern for any of their needs other than the sex and since hey thats his need to he was good.Your husband is not repairing what he broke. He sounds just as selfish as when he was cheating just frustrated and upset he cant get his cheap good feels. You see you are a real person with your own needs.  Scares the living daylights out of him.You are right you cannot live like you are. Stop. Just stop.Tell him exactly everything you want in order to stay married to someone who abused your trust broke your marriage lied to your very face.  Tell him he can say yes or no to meeting your needs and then act accordingly.  Get a good therapist if you feel you cannot do that or you are scared he would leave if you did expect your needs to be valued and met.if he says yes he will need a lot of support to grow the emotional maturity his cheating showed he lacks. That is not your support to give get him a good IC about the lyingcheating problem he has.  Putting your time into getting that person for him and going to the first meeting being part of the therapy is critical.  It sure sounds like limbo. Are you in MC like one picked because they work with marriages broken by cheaters and who views the cheater as  responsible for their stupid cruel selfish choices to be sexual outside the marriage?  One who can also help both of you communicate better and all that good stuff since I will bet you totally own how you can improve yourself right?I had a year like yours.  Mine also lied about how many years he had been fucking women online so when I got that a whole YEAR into trying to wrap my head around who he really was I finally got myself into using therapy about ME and not the marriagecheating and then several months later I could lay out what I needed in order to stay married to him  I had seen the stills of the naked women I had read the email  months after we were married hitting up an exGF to email sex stories about the two of them.  I read the chat transcripts he saved and we all know why and it wasnt to better love his wife... and they were all throughout the years that I felt unwanted unvalued unloved and so unappreciated it was like a physical pain sometimes.He refused my conditions to reconcile and .. I was free.  I had tried I had given him a space to redeem himself I had offered grace.  He abused my trust betrayed me and our marriage and I was wiling to give him space to repair.He refused.  Its all on him and did I mention Im free?  Because I cannot describe the joy to you it is something you have to feel for yourself.  If he says yes and busts his cheater ass to repairredeemreclaim you can also feel this joy in seeing him recover his integrity and basically dedicate it to you and your worthiness  Im not saying one path or the other is better.

She does not want you. Her actions are honest while her words can be misleading. The only reason she is pleading for you back is fear. Not love shes afraid of this transition she feels stuck thats the only reason she didnt dump you for him in the first place. Do yourselves a favor and end this.

If I were you I would explore the WHY of what something  that on the surface appears so innocuous  is so hurtful to you.  What meaning are you reading into it.  Not that I dont  agree but if you write down the whys of why it hurts you so badly and share them maybe hell understand  you thought you were special rituals and traditions that bond the loss of  that you felt during the same period that made you recognize where  went when you saw it.... I dont know.  These are all my ideas  you need to explore what your own heart says.  One thing I would absolutely recommend is to NEVER ever EVER turn down a kiss.  In fact go a step further and get a bear hug or just a bear hug if you really cant bear to kiss him.  Its what you really need.  You need the assurances that he loves you.  You are punishing yourself by not grabbing what you need... way more than you are punishing him for being bad to you.In fact shift your focus.  Focus on what you really need.  If he really is not the bad guy he will want you to have what you need within his ability to give it.  If you need a hot bath take it.  Exercise do it.  A hug expect it.

If she wants the relationship to be over if shes fucking around with other guys and wants to continue doing so then she doesnt get to have the pleasure or the comfort of sleeping beside you at night or enjoying any kind of intimacy from you.  The fact that she even asked for this beyond selfish she wants to keep you around for comfort and in case she has any regrets about being on her own.Most importantly continuing to sleep next to her provide physical affection of any sort and otherwise acting like a boyfriend when you no longer are is going to fuck up your head and delay your healing.  If shes cheating youre continually putting yourself at risk for catching an STD by having sex with her.  You need to get tested for STDs and not lay one more finger on her.If you have to live together for the next  weeks then live together as room mates who barely know each other.  No sleeping in the same bed no affection no sharing meals together picking up after one another nothing.  Youre literally just under the same roof until youre able to part.Dont let her fool you into simmering on the backburner under the pretense of being friends.  Well guess what?  Youre not friends.

Ive only had two sessions but Im confident that he will be a lot better than my first IC my first one blamed me and told me I was a horrible mother and wife after she talked to my husbands IC who was a life coach.  My husbands IC is a Christianbased one after he stopped going to his life coach who gave him a rock and said to hold the rock when he got stressed and think of something he is thankful for wtf.  He really respects the Christian one who is helping him get back his moral compass.  But I think itll be a long journey.  Its a lifetime of behavior he has to change.  I usually dont think people can change or at least permanently.  But maybe he can.And I totally agree cheating is HIS issue not mine.  It took several months just to even get that established.  The fact that I couldve cheated any time esp after having discovered the st EA  years earlier doesnt seem to click with him.  Like Im either too ugly too honest or lets face it he knows I love him with all my heart so hes pretty secure in knowing I wouldnt cheat on him.

10262684,0,t3_5myj31,Actually if hes over her and she seems pretty high maintenance especially with her marriage imploding it could be okay. What I dont like is that shes now single and looking what I do like is that your husband realizes he has alot to lose if he cheats again and little to gain if he hooks up with her  kids. I would give it a shot and I am usually the one who goes full on chumplady.com You might have to act as the marriage police for a while insist on open phones emails etc. but if hes serious about making a change then could work. Have you thought about a postnup? This would be a contract that he would sign that would basically nail his balls to the wall and lay out the terms of a seperationdivorce agreement should he cheat again. You would both need your own attorney for that gem. Obviously the terms would need to be very favorable to you. I lifted this from survivinginfidelity.comAfter DDay I retained an attorney to file for D. When FWH asked about the possibility of R I talked to my lawyer about postnups. Long story short I asked fwh if he would sign one knowing that it would be very stiff. He absolutely agreed. It took several weeks to get finalized. It was  pages long! Anyhow yes I have a very stiff very detailed postnuptual contract and I am glad I do. It gives me some comfort. Will it stop him from cheating again? No. But it will guarantee me that there will be no long painful drawn out fights over settlement if he does stray again. It also gives me some financial stability for myself and my children. It also stipulates that he have no contact with OW and only professional contact with her two bffs that facilitated the affair and even tried to befriend me to gain inside info for ow they all work together and one friend words directly for fwh. Anyhow I fully support getting a postnup.I am glad I have one. So maybe this is what you need to rest your mind especially with kids.Has he written her a No Contact letter? Here are some samplesGood luck. If hes serious hell give you the postnup and No Contact letter. If he wants cake hell balk and do a little DARVO google it whine a little try to blameshift Why do you want to hurt me with a postnup? Are you so bitter? etc.Yes I do think it can work. If he puts in the effort. Also he needs to agree to  be transparent  go to marriage counseling and take responsibility for the affair no blameshifting  get a postnup and watch how he responds to this one actions speak louder than words and  send a No Contact letter to the exAP.Good luck!!

The reality is that theres nothing that the betrayed can do to stop the betrayers cheatingand no way to ever be absolutely  percent certain that they wont do it again. Reconciling requires the betrayed to take a leap of faith at some point after a period of verifying and checking every little thing.   I see a lot of cases of so called reconciliation where they are stuckunable or unwilling to really trust againbut also unwilling or unable to keep on checking everything. At some point the betrayed needs to let go of either the need to be  certain or let go of the relationship. ,survivinginfidelity,dcafeop,1,t5_2x8ez

The relationship was never the same after that affair but I resisted realizing that by numbing my brain at night when all the doubts and bad memories resurfaced.

Almost right away after booting her I stopped drinking nonsocially cut down on the social drinking joined the gym saw a doctor to improve my health and started eating right.

11772813,0,t1_dgtlmrd,Yeah he knows im not going anywhere. If that were the case i would have been long gone. I would honestly feel relieved i think if he told me he was woth her physically now. I mean i know it would hurt uncredibly badly but at least then i would know that i knew the truth. Its sounds so stupid but i almost sometimes wish he would just say yes i had sex with her and then i would know i had the truth. I have explained this to him before and hes not budging. I just dont want this to eat at me forever. Did you lie to her over and over again even when she would ask you flat out about the the things you werent being truthful about or did they just never come up so it was more like you were hiding things opposed to flat out lying? If you dont mind me asking.,survivinginfidelity,dguhcfr,1,t5_2x8ez
