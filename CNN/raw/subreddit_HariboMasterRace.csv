3837380,0,t3_347r6h,Holy shit! I had a bag of sugar free gummies while shopping at TJMAXX. Well the horrible sensations started to kick in towards the end of my time there. By the time I got home I was doubled over in pain and I looked  months pregnant. It ended up being a pretty awful eveningnight. I wasnt sure if the gummy bears had caused it but just as a precaution I stayed away from them. Some time later at another shopping trip I grabbed a bag of gummies and started munching on them while looking around and BOOM same awful experience. I look at the bag and sure enough they were sugar free. So any idiot at that point would have put two and two together. I found out later on some forum that these things are actually the spawn of the devil. Never again. ,HariboMasterRace,cqtp0g7,2,t5_37ke0
