3872198,0,t1_cqxnn86,Southland is a realistic cop show about what it is like being a cop in south LA. Kinda like the TV show version of End of Watch. Entourage is a bro comedy about a popular movie star in LA and his entourage he hangs and gets in trouble with. Very funny show many cameos including Sasha Grey  Eminem Mark Walberg and others. East Bound and Down is about Kenny Fucking Powers who was once a famous MLB pitcher and wants to relive the glory days. Kenny is racist sexist and absolutely hilarious. He reminded me of Kyle a bit i must add. Anymore questions feel free to shoot them at me. P.S. I love you on PKA. ,Chiz,cqxnwuq,1,t5_2xx0u
