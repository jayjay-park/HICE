8072133,0,t3_4pqrk5,Jax has strengths and weaknesses in lane and in the jungle. That being said he has a strong level  gank  invade as well.Personally Jax top is the only way to play him  with how much farm he needs per game unless you snowball in the jungle or tax A LOT... you just wont hit as hard with jungle farm.,GrandMasterJax,d4ndu0v,2,t5_3euhv
