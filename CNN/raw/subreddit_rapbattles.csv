2678847,0,t1_cn889vv,They battled once before back when Dont Flop was a relatively new league and it got a bit heated back then. There was some kind of altercation at BoomBap festival a few years ago its what Villun talks about in his Unan battle. The shit about Unan crying probably isnt true but you get the picture. THEN during Diz vs Unan at BW Dizaster pulled PH on stage to finish off one of his punchlines about Unan being a pussy. Since then theyve generally just talked a lot of shit on Twitter but its never really resulted in anything close to a battle and nobodys really sure what went down between them to cause such bad blood. If it did go down it would be one of those battles between two people who legitimately fucking hate eachother which more often than not turn out to be pretty good.You should definitely watch Psychosis vs Sensa. If you enjoy that him vs HBomb and Tantrum are great battles as well,rapbattles,cn88vbe,2,t5_2sa9u

2688677,0,t1_cn9dvhr,gt I also feel like KOTD has a huge amount of staff for events who could be done by a handful of people.  Everyone on KOTDs staff is necessary.  I think to many people in here are underestimating what it takes to put on a solid event.  Using Blackout as an example KOTD is responsible for  Venue booking x days  BookingPayment of battlers   Flights for all international battlers  Payments for directors sound engineers videographers  Sponsorships  Ticket sales  PPV arrangements which takes a team of at least  people alone  Border crossing paper work lawyers  Hotel booking for event staffcoordinators battlers  Online amp Offline Marketing  Promotion teamTheres a lot more that goes into an event rather than booking a venue and making a list of battlers. We only see the final result and it makes zero sense to speculate on how it can be done better  especially when you have no idea what it actually takes to get the job done.KOTD is where it is today not because of the battlers but because of the staff.  The MCs will always be there  theyre the only constant.  Everything else is up to King of the Dot to get right.All of the above applys to Dont Flop as well.  TBH Organik and Eurgh respectively are incredibly undervalued by outsiders  if you were to ask any battler what they do for the culture is far greater than most would assume.,rapbattles,cn9j2xh,6,t5_2sa9u

Anywho yeah Soul did choke in his rd which was a shame because I got the feeling he was building towards some truly devastating material. Felt pretty bad for him.    My favourite performance of the night was from Gemini he was super composed and his punches hit hard. He had a grime round which absolutely killed. I felt Heretic deserved the win over CraftD. Craft is a better rapper imo but he had a few stumbles while Heretic just looked super comfortable up there. Kid Twist really impressed me too and Im not usually a fan of his. All in all a great day out.  Oh shit Uno Lavoz vs Pedro almost turned into a fight. Uno bought Pedros mum out on stage and then Mac Sherry! Mac Sherry then tried to EMC Pedros Mum and failed.

5975232,0,t1_cy2ifi3,From what I remember he was saying about how he was feeling overworked and it was really fucking with him so he took a hiatus but I guess it wasnt on the best of terms. He talked about how he was hurt that they hadnt reached out to him in the few months since hes been gone and how he wants to just start his own shit. He also spokeon how media in battle rap is trash and how theres not enough real journalism in the game right now. How theres just a bunch of groupie fans recording interviews on their phones and ipads just so they can get closer with the battlers. The most interesting part is when he addressed a tweet he put out saying KOTD is the best league in the world and explained what he meant by it and he was talking some real shit about how URL isnt the be all end all for battlers. Its a pretty good interview and definitely worth a listen.

Why does there have to be a reason for Flip Tops view count? Why cant we just give them the benefit of the doubt and agree that people love watching their battles around the world? Lets apply this standard of counting views to other URLDoes URLs views come from the east coast? Does most of URLs views come from people who are indifferent towards hiphop but are entertained by URL? Implying this in any fashion discredits URL and means only a few people are actually watching their content. My larger point is LET FLIP TOP BE GREAT. Calling Flip Top an entertainment platform then counting KOTDURL etc. as leagues is disrespectful. ,rapbattles,cy4vsy7,2,t5_2sa9u

6195802,0,t1_cytvo2t,gt Beating Charlie Clips shouldnt mean anything unless you go to URL to do it.It means more to beat a battler bringing their A game yes but you cant totally discount wins with exceptions imo being battles like Rone vs Daylyt if you dont even show up to battle it really doesnt mean much. That said Charlie Clips has had at least three battles on KOTD hes put real effort into Im talking about his battles with Daylyt Dirtbag Dan and Hollohan and even arguably Conceited though thats more of an example of Clips having a great performance without really having tried all that hard. Thats kind of offtopic though but I was just addressing you assertment that it only matters to beat Charlie Clips on URL. To be honest I actually think its really hurt Clips and other battlers notably Aye Verb that theyve come onto KOTD and had weak halfhearted performances and been killed by battlers like Charron and Illmaculate but anyway.I dont disagree with Pass vs Chilla Jones being a below average battle considering the names involved but I think his Charlie Clips and Arsonal battles were a lot better than his battle with Chilla and Id point to those as examples for why hes up there with the best of  over someone like Chilla Jones. Chilla had some great performances against Prep and against Math Hoffa but got washed by Pass beaten clearly by Danny lost to Cee Major somewhat debatable lost to Dialect not at all debateable and I guess the Dizaster battle was short notice but they were both terrible in that one.Having consistently strong performances and beating big names are just two factors worth considering when talking best ofs. But it doesnt make sense to favour one completely and discount the other. I was saying that Danny Myers namely had a lot of good performances but he also beat big names. Same with Pass he had important wins over Charlie Clips and Arsonal but was also good in those battles. I guess if you didnt think Pass was good in either of those battles than eh.Views hardly matter to me for considering who was the best in  nobody honestly thinks Dumbfoundead was one of the best in  do they?gt But if Ive learned anything on this sub its that your opinions are logically and properly formed and I have no doubt that youll be able to make me understand how you can have both battlers rated so highly.Thanks  I think were just gonna agree to disagree that Pass had good performances against Charlie Clips and Arsonal though haha.gt I feel like we argue all the time but personally I dont mind it and if you do just lemme know.Always happy to talk battle rap with you g.,rapbattles,cytwapv,2,t5_2sa9u

7620897,0,t3_4jp24b,Bigg K is officially my number  behind Hollow as of last night. Dude is becoming versatile af. With that said I think a lot of people could beat him. Its just hard to. Like he said last last I got  rounds you slip up its a beat down... He always has  solid rounds. Well almost always. When he battled Myers and Kannon a week apart from each other he gave Kannon the nd and had a short round for Danny too. Im rambling tho as far as who can beat him? Hollow Pat Stay is capable Diz at his A game would be a hard one for K Lux of course Maybe Nitty. Anyone can lose on a bad day but I really cant think of a ton of people who have a good shot at beating him. Like could Tay Roc beat him on a Smack stage? Yeah but itll be hard for him. I keep saying K is more than just a puncher. Hes an all around battler. He hot jokes he can freestyle really well wish hed rebuttal more. Hes good at angles as shown in his rd vs Math His voice booms and his punches are hard to stand in front of for everybody. I dont see that many battlers beating him with the trajectory hes been on for the last  years or so.,rapbattles,d38gfnp,6,t5_2sa9u

8172382,0,t1_d4yfio6,Okay I understand the gist of your point When it comes to battlers prices though I look at it as purely business negotiations and dont pass any judgment on the battles or battlers. The leagues definitely feed into this as well but its just negotiation. if someone doesnt feel theyre getting their worth and wont take a pay cut thats on them. I dont feel the leagues of the battlers are doing anything harmful. If Mook wants k and Smack refuses to pay him k thats fine by me as a fan sure you may want to see someone battle but they dont owe it to anybody to take less than theyre worth and Smack doesnt have to aquiese to their demands its simply a failed negotiation.The biggest problem with these negotiations is that both sides decide to make it publicpersonal so people pick sides. I see both sides k for a battle is a lot of money and it may be hard to get the return URL wants from their investment but Mook sees industry guys like  Cassidy who he feels he is better than and a bigger draw than get paid top dollar and im sure he feels a certain way about that. ,rapbattles,d4z3ik0,1,t5_2sa9u

8205451,0,t1_d52ko32,Love your attitude homie. For starters its not all nerd bird KOTD DF fans here. Secondly yes I think a poll used every week to dictate what the masses of us find to the best battle of the week from a league is a pretty sound way of seeing which leagues have been producing good battles so far this year. Dont think it takes a rocket scientist to connect that. Most people here are a fan of great battles first before they begin to add league preferences and bias.  Oh by the way several top bloggers also share the same opinion. KOTD has had the majority of the great battles weve seen so far this year its not because everyone in here loves KOTD more its because the events and battles theyve hosted have been better. Pretty simple logic. FOH,rapbattles,d538i8h,1,t5_2sa9u

Another that Ill buy pretty frequently is the Hop Devil from PA especially if I can find it on nitro tap. This week I had the Scorcher IPA and the East India IPA from Brooklyn brewery the Lowkey HIPA and Electric Peel from Magic hat and also the Session IPA from Bronx brewery. All were good but I have been kinda over IPAs recently. I also picked up the Schlafly Smash Pack which is four different IPAs brewed each with a single hop from a different place in the world. Eureka uses American Hops and is my favorite very herbal and packs the biggest punch. Enigma is Australian hopped and was more mild but still fun also they had from the UK my second favorite still punchy and Germanywhich was the most malty but not my favorite for an IPA.If you can get your hands on the Sorachi Ace from Brooklynn I highly suggest it but thats a farmhouse ale.,rapbattles,d6ejkiq,2,t5_2sa9u

8859719,0,t3_51lakx,Im on my last semester at college. I have  INCREDIBLY hard class that may stop me from graduating because all math courses at my college are fucking weed out courses. Fuck calculus entirely.Beyond that I havent had a lick of free time so my music content creation has come to a grinding halt. Which sucks because I was working with some producer trio from Copenhagen and they were legitimately the best producers Ive ever worked with. Maybe I should try to keep that bridge from being burned while I cant do any actual work.Life is on a mission to test me at every turn right now and its frustrating me to no end. I have no concept of free time anymore. My days start at like AM and Im doing fucking school or work or homework till midnight every day. I cant keep fucking doing this until December. And itll piss me off even WORSE if I fail this math course and dont get to graduate. I need to get the fuck out of the Midwest. I want to go back to Canada. Or maybe Texas the hip hop scene actually exists there. Indiana is terrible and dont let anyone tell you different. And my town is so bad in regards to having shit to do. You could go to the bars and drink or you could do some drugs or you could just leave town and go do something somewhere where its...remotely exciting. It also doesnt help that my job while being in my field and is great experience pays me such SHIT pay. I understand that being a student worker basically means they can pay me whatever they want but living is fucking HARD when you dont make much and literally cant make more time to work because you have to make time to do the ridiculous amount of schoolwork you have to do. Fuck my life. Just... fuck it.I completely feel ujuicemw when he talks about breaking points. I keep feeling myself get closer and closer to mine.

9460859,0,t3_5aboae,I didnt watch the video yet so excuse me if he touched on this but I seen this live... On Surf vs Rex aside from a few ok lines it seemed like Surf was about to start bombing that shit. So I think he was like fuck it if it aint URL... And Rex was cooking but it was short for a  Round unlimited though. I did hear something about a Tsu x Rex  Rounder was in the works before this battle but still. Surf says that Top is a nigga he wants to kill and he hasnt had that feeling since wanting to battle Hitman but idk how hell do now. Hoping hes really about that URL life. John John and Daylyt was lackluster to. Aside from Daylyts first he was garbage. John John was iight though people was still saying Day won idk why and I dont think that Im going to watch that shit again. BMagic vs Cortez and Serius vs Ars were dope battles but the audio was trash live damn near had to guess what they were saying. Gotta wait for the VOD for the fixed audio. Fab vs Clips was dope Fab won to me of the strength of him going way longer then Clips Im gonna have to watch these battles again. NOME  looking a little bit shaky to me just based off of me not knowing how Surf Daylyt and Clips is gonna show up now. Before I was iffy on just Clips. Edit My recap is trash compared to Blacs but i agree with what hes saying. Surf is lowkey corny not for spreading that propaganda that If it aint URL it dont matter but for doing bullshit on other leagues. Shit does nothing but hurt you. If Im Mr. Fab I gotta know shit like this aswell as BMagic having a battle a day before Clips not being consistent etc. Basically  for Clips vs Fab Cor vs Magic and Ars vs Serius. And Blacs right even as a fringe league cards like this hurt Battle Rap as a whole. That donating and paying for a live stream to watch on the spot outside of URL and KOTD cards that interests me are out the window. This greasy fat nigga Norbes better not come out with another Lets see if the fans support it donation page ever again. ,rapbattles,d9f8bn3,3,t5_2sa9u

That being said Days first round fell way flat for me. I watched live and I have rewatched the PPV stream  times before this dropped. The youtube video doesnt do the crowd justice. Even then His mineralmine scheme didnt do anything for me. Caught it the first watch but it was like doing a Kata in the middle if a UFC fight. You might land an incidental hit but nothing is connecting with meaning. Gjonajs also feels worse watching the youtube video but live I said he took round one. Round ...Was clearly Gjonaj. Day recycled and choked. I thought he was pulling some shit where he was referencing Gjonaj vs. Diz. But after watching it that many times Im convinced he choked.Round ...was goddamn nuts. Im not a fan of the I am Jesus bar. I saw it coming a mile away live. It rocked the fucking room but anyone other than Day wouldnt have got a reaction. His BINGO bar...that was stuck in my head for a month...so Id say that hit.Also Gjonajs What room Im in bit kills me every fucking time. The delivery is perfect.Gjonaj  IMO.

10308834,0,t1_dccjs0e,No that is not the point and this just shows the fundamental difference between US and Canada battle rap culture. When hiphop originated a rap battle was just two dudes rapping at each other. Ja Rule recalls one of his first battles against Method Man in which MM started using material that he already put on an album while Ja was still spitting throwaways. So Ja considered that a win.Rap battles were just that. Rap battles. Its evolved which is cool but these generic gun bars that you talk about have literally ALWAYS been a part of battle rap. You dont seem like a fan of hiphop but really a fan of KOTD. Which is fine. But thats why gun bars are good.,rapbattles,dcck8tc,13,t5_2sa9u

10540591,0,t3_5qvwff,Ave looks too unbeatable right now for me to really give anyone the win against him. He might just be in his prime right now but until I see him have an underwhelming performance Im giving him at least  in any matchup.I want so badly to give Mike a win since hes yet to have a bad showing but at this point its like people are scared to lose to him and constantly step their shit up. Brizz might not be for me overall but I think hed comfortably take a  here. Chess just got beat and whoever he faces next is prob in some shit. Trez is nice but if this was going down in a small room where Chess thrives I think hed for sure be walking out with he win or at the very least have the best round of the battle. Saga with the  fuck Tink.Ryda impresses more with each battle I think he just needs one real shot at being a room shaker. I dunno how Wavy did at BL but Ive noticed he usually has a couple major haymakers sprinkled onto a big piece of filler for each round. Like his battle w Shine had some great quoteables Shotgun in the pants legI dont just go over heads but the rest of his material falls flat for me. Ryda  maybe even .Might catch some shit for this but as much as I love NJTs explosive energy Prez is a dude who can control an entire room from bar one. Tworks slow build structure is really powerful and make a his haymakers feel like knockouts but Prez can have heavy energy going for an entire performance and is more versatile than NJT imo think about it. I see him taking it with a  and I think this would for sure be the loudest battle of the night in terms of crowd reaction.Prep drops  by freestyling all three rounds. ,rapbattles,dd2w61k,1,t5_2sa9u

This is similar to what Chilla Jones does when reusing words.Conceiteds slow it down is different because he says the same entire thing each time. Only he pronounces it differently so that you get the other meaning. Usually you hear a triple entendre once and you pause and think about it until you get all three meanings. Conceited just helps you get each of his meanings by reemphasizing for you.,rapbattles,dg16k10,7,t5_2sa9u
