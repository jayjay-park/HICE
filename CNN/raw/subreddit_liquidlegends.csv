4269162,0,t1_cs6uct8,Idk about that Malphite if you can convince him go for it though. And it depends on the pick. For example I consider Tristana to be an offmeta pick that works well with our strength. I also think Lemon is onto something with his Ardent Censor rush Karma in double AD comps. Generally though I need to see it in a scrim before I can say whether a pick is good or bad and there are a number of other factors that contribute so experimenting too much can also be a bad thing.,liquidlegends,cs6uol1,3,t5_35qr9

Xpecial had easily the worst season of his career.Every ADC Xpecial has played with have been better for it. Chaox was in contention or best ADC NA with Xpecial couldnt even get onto challenger teams without him yes he did try. Wildturtle was again in contention for best ADC NA with Xpecial immediately fell off after losing Xpecial still looks mediocre even with Lustboy. Cop went from being just a KDA lord with minimal game impact to a legitimately outstanding ADC. Piglet came off of easily the worst season of career so bad that no teams in Korea wanted him even after the exodus and now people are calling him the best in NA.Id  rather have Xpecial.

Piglets whole deal is winning his lane and farming at the expense of everything else in the hopes that hell just able to just get swole as hell and solo carry at some point.  Adrians exactly the opposite.  He probably spends less time in lane than any other support in NA.  Every team hes been on has been about sacrificing bot lane pressure to win elsewhere on the map.Would just be Doublift x Yellowstar .,liquidlegends,d867w8k,0,t5_35qr9

I think he went around talking about it the wrong way but that is clearly and issue and I can understand his frustration at it. I do think the outburst to Steve was insane though its like he doesnt realise that this is a job and how your supposed to act in a job environment. Also wanted to add the thing that made me lose the most respect for him as a player had to be the calling it quits and saying its game over in the middle of an lcs match. Honestly if i was piglet I think I might have left too after that. I wouldnt want to be teammates with someone like that regardless of skill. One thing is to be like its game gg lets  finish and start a new one in a scrim. In the actual official match where your representing a company whose paying you. You dont do that.

Matts super solid when he follows piglets lead and goldenglues kind of a wildcard for me Hes had moments where he can be a great player and underwhelming at times too.

10236872,0,t3_5mfu6p,Just wanted to say that often choking isnt a nerves related thing. It comes down to peaking performance and how the games are played. Link would do some weird things in playoffs and try to do things his team couldnt maybe things he couldnt do either. Choking can come down to so many things nerves being only one and often only true if the choking comes for someone playing for the first time on the national stage. The sport I can relate this to most is the one Im most familiar with Track and Field. I have known athletes that had great seasons and went to Nationals only to do very poorly for the results they were seeing during the season. The reason is nerves sometimes sure maybe a part of it all the time. You should be nervous that is if you care enough. However the choking often comes down to training. A lot of kids dont expect to qualify for Nationals and do it in their last meet or second to last meet and that meet is where their performance peaks because thats what their training program was meant for. If LCS teams are training for good regular seasons it can create big problems come playoffs. ,liquidlegends,dc4en9i,1,t5_35qr9
