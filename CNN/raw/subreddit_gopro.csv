87091,0,t1_ceo0s2i, I talked with  few GoPro Engies about hydrophobic vs hydrophilic and they encouraged the use of hydrophilic substances instead of stuff like RainX.  The reason behind this is that while RainX helps the water bead up and run off the bead of water will distort your image and be very visible.  Hydrophilic coatings like saliva do the opposite and flatten out the water causing less distortion.  You have to attend to the lens more but at worst your shot looks slightly blurry instead of having a giant droplet on it.,gopro,ceocen4,1,t5_2rvat

We dont play a game of well they may release this summer without substantiating it with something like a market trend which is currently indicating a yearly cycle.

1502468,0,t3_2beo2j,I think it computes the total space required based on how much would be needed to convert the FULL video even though you only have a small clip selected. As a result if you select  short clips it will complain if you dont have enough space to convert the full video  times. One thing to try is to start the conversion for one clip and then add the additional clips to the queue after it has started sometimes it lets me get away with it without complaining about space issues.The GB limit comes from a limitation in the FAT file system which is why the GoPro breaks up recordings into GB chunks so if your destination directory is on the uSD card or other file system with FAT formatting you can run into issues.,gopro,cj4lwbq,1,t5_2rvat

I like to keep that at  but it can be    or  as well depending on your lighting. X and Y are your exposure times. Heres the chart that shows you what values equal what exposure duration.

Instead do this Dont start filming yet Install gopro studio Watch gopro studio tutorial here Pick a template from here suggestion pool party and download it Import template into gopro studio Carefully observe how many cuts you need. Think what you can film to replace those cuts that is relevant to you in other words construct a rudimentary storyboard in your mind or on paper Go out and film. If you dont know what settings to choose film everything in p with auto low light ON Observe what you filmed. Is it nice? Should it be closer or farther away? Does it have enough light? Is it shaky?

The zoom in camera works because the sensor is more than p so in wide it captures k and downsamples. When you zoom narrow it captures with a  x  actual pixels in the center of the sensor. Keeping the quality while zooming in. Many high quality cameras do the same though it has many names. ,gopro,couo75e,3,t5_2rvat

On that note I would expect some sort of product refresh in OctoberNovember but it most likely wont be a hero . It might be a new product line or an improvement to the current hero lineup.I have wifi on the hero  and I have the wifi bacpac for the hero  and to be honest I dont find much use for it.

4150406,0,t1_crtbo98,gtThe problem is everythings a mix amp match and I was wondering if there was a simple way to work with FPSFPS and FPS p and just slow down the clips where I need to.The way I described above should work normally. When you drop the clips in every clip will play at  by default no matter what fps it is. You can then use the time remapping effect as you normally would.This may help you optimize your system to prevent bottlenecking. The biggest issue our systems have are the AMDFX CPUs which are just not very fast. My next upgrade will probably be a  or core i or Xenon or whatever is best when AMD and Intel drop their new series in .Ive heard that sometimes Premiere may not like fps footage but since I usually work with  and fps I dont know for sure although I think it worked fine when I did try. If thats the case make your sequence fps and prerender any higher fps footage to fps by slowing the clip down to  you can use GoPro studio for this then import into Premiere and speed up to normal speed by changing the speed to . From there you can work with the footage as you normally would.I dont think you should have any audio issues since I believe the audio is recorded the same regardless of video settings. ,gopro,crtczhq,1,t5_2rvat

4155867,0,t3_38c5sk,What do you mean by it does not really seem to look right? Do you have an example you can share?Lighting is a huge factor when recording videos though I must say the GoPro does a great job adapting to light. If there is little light go down to a lower frame rate. taking fps videos in a poorly lit place means the camera has to use high ISO and therefore the video will be very grainy and shit. What are you viewing the videos on? A p  video can look choppy and glitchy if the computer isnt powerful enough to handle it. Im new to GoPros myself so Im not going to recommend any output solutions as Im still trying to find them myself but keep in mind that an HD video at  fps takes quite a bit of processing power from the graphics card of whatever you are viewing it on.,gopro,crtzby7,2,t5_2rvat

Assuming you have  fps playback that will be about    seconds of footage or about  minutes which should be more than enough youll probably edit down to about  or . So if youre taking  photos over the course of  hours you know  hours is  seconds so   .. So if you were constantly filming for  hours then you would want . second intervals to end up with  minutes of footage. I would either use GoPros  or  second option.Just as a reminder with  second intervals you need to not move the camera for  minutes to get one second of footage. So if you want to get x seconds of footage you need to keep the camera in place for x minutes. With ten second intervals if you want x seconds of footage you need to keep the camera in place for x minutes. Your external battery pack should be more than enough. Just know you will need to be out of the waterproof housing to keep it plugged in.Let me know if you have any more questions I can help with D,gopro,cy2lc2h,9,t5_2rvat

6087990,0,t3_3yy3dm,You have just fried your camera. The skeleton case is not designed to be waterproof. At best its splash resistant and I actually throw them in the garbage whenever I buy an accessory that comes with them. My cameras are either in the Frame mount dry situations or in the waterproof case with the waterproof door any time the camera will be anywhere near water. I experienced an identical situation to yours so Im speaking from experience. The camera was never the same again and because it was my fault GoPro couldnt help me. I tossed the camera into the garbage and it was an expensive lesson.What you should have done before applying any power to the camera is immerse it in a bag of uncooked rice for  hours. This process usually removes all the moisture from the camera but its still not a guarantee it will work again.If you were at the beach was it fresh water or salt water that got into the camera? If it was salt...you may as well just throw the camera in the garbage. Salt water does very bad things to electronics.,gopro,cyhm3vg,2,t5_2rvat

You can also stick a stickymount on there but i wanted this to be bombproof! I wanted the possibility to mount my waterproof light on top so I got me one of these tripod mounts Aluminim because I broke the original plastic one. Then you need some   bolts to attach the handles to the flash brackets. I ordered two of these to replace the bolts so I could do this tool less when I travel.I needed this part to attach the handles at the top use the  rings to get it tight Some normal nuts will do but I want to go tool less.In total this cost me  ish.

7166977,0,t1_d1s1g54,Spot meter is for situations where you might have both dim and bright areas in your shot. For example if youre in a car and you want to capture whats going on both in the car and outside. Without it the camera would adjust to either the brightness outside the car and everything inside would be dark or to the dimness inside and everything outside would be too bright. Whether or not you need it depends on the environment youre shooting in. But yeah thats the general idea if you want a better explanation you can check out one of the tutorials on Youtube.  Btw heres my video if you want to see how it turned out just a correction to what I said earlier I think I had protune on. And I added a filter during post production in GoPro studio.

9265373,0,t1_d8q0grl,Before we start are you sure its your computer causing the issue and not a bad card? Did you use one of the recommended cards?If youre interested in Apple I can strongly recommend a  MacBook Pro and Final Cut Pro. K editing is silky smooth and I havent had a single issue in the three weeks Ive owned it moving away from Windows and Sony Vegas.For Windows nothing less than an I sixseries and  GB of RAM would do  GB RAM best in order to futureproof yourself. Video editing isnt heavily reliant on the video card mostly processor so you can get an inexpensive GB card and know youre going to be ok with it. If youre set on buying a laptop the Dell XPS  would be the Windows version of the MacBook Pro.You didnt mention which editor you use but I can recommend both DaVinci Resolve or HitFilm which are free and studio quality editors both of which would be able to handle your K footage without any issues.Edit I forgot to answer your ? with regards to SSD. YES!! By all means always use an SSD to edit your footage and make sure its not the primary drive c if your computer! Having a USB  or internal PCIe SSD definitely makes editing easier smoother and quicker.,gopro,d8qga2m,2,t5_2rvat

Or you could use their Dash product in Mode  and use a wall timer to activate power at your desired time.  It will turn the camera on and start recording. When the timer turns off power it will then stop recording and turn off.I have the Blink product but I wasnt paying for it so wasnt so fussed on cost  just needed to get the job done  I can say it has  well.

Even though youve got it mounted well and potentially ziptied those two tabs that hold the camera to the mount are notorious for breaking at highimpact speeds.A floaty is  and probably the best insurance policy you can buy to protect your camera in this situation.
