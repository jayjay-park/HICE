2414543,0,t1_cma4p0g,Aliaga is the hatedandfeared for biology. I took both Maines and Byrd and had a good experience.Maines looks scary but is extremely fair and gets you prepared for tests she records all of her lectures and posts them online sends out text notifications when there are EC events or test changes and has inclass discussions that break down questions which happen to be on the test later D.Byrd is very friendly and really goes out of her way to help you if youre struggling. I didnt find her lectures as engaging or helpful as Maines but she grades tests a little bit easier. She really does care about her students she came in on a Saturday with her two kids just to unlock a lab for me so I could finish running tests.This is all for Majors bio. Ive heard good things about ClarkShanks for nonmajors but I havent taken her personally. ,TCCStudentsConnect,cma5a1n,1,t5_31tlr
