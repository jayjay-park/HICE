747871,0,t3_22mp6p,Im into rare cars in GTAO. My garages are like a laundry list of the hottest vehicles that dont spawn online or spawn rarely. So that was a big factor. Basically I just wanted a garage of turbo charged cars since I dont like racing in GTA and will probably never unlock LSC fully. And I felt that I just wasnt getting what I wanted with regards to customization options.I like to create cars. However LSC is piss poor with options for paint and plates. We should be able to put a custom tag on any car for the right price. Forcing us to use a buggy app that puts the same plate on every car permanently with no option to change it again is beyond retarded. If all my real life cars had the same plate the cops would definitely want to have a word with me about that.LSC just sucks in general. I should be able to buy Yankton tags for the right price and have the whole color pallet available for rim painting. Many of my cars now have an unattainable silver rim color that cant be duplicated at LSC. To me that is the ultimate prestige. Anyone can buy or steal nice cars but they cant make them look quite like mine.My strategy was to fill both characters garages with the best of the best. No high end cars I am waiting for the second garage to start rebuying Supers. I sold my Turismo and Z Type replaced them with a sleeper Stanier and an Oracle . Im sure you think me quite insane for doing that but I can always rebuy those high end cars and they werent even tuned since I suck at racing. Now I have my custom tags and colors on every car and Im very happy with the outcome.,gtaglitches,cgpafe2,3,t5_2z590

830823,0,t3_23n1xt,There is some sort of parole system in place that Rockstar never officially announced. I got out of the bad sport lobby twice in the past week by doing this. This thread is a few hours old so I doubt youre still in the clean lobby but its easy to get back in one.  Just simply wait  minutes in a lobby with other people you cant be alone and your dunce cap will disappear along with bad sport from your player status.  Now of course thats not all so go ahead and get into a new session.  This session will be a clean lobby full of good sports.  The same thing will happen in this lobby your status and dunce cap will disappear after  minutes but youre still not there yet.  Depending on your sentence you now have to stay in this lobby for a certain period of time.  I got out of my  day sentence by staying in a lobby for  hours.  I got out of my previous  day sentence by staying in for approximately  minutes.  Logic says a  month sentence should be  hours.Easiest way to do this is go into passive mode find a place where your guy can infinitely walk in place so you dont get kicked then tape your analog stick down.  Come back a few hours later to good sport status.  Now the hard part is making it through without freezingdisconnectstimeouts.

1257688,0,t3_28hsni,Yes the problem is.. In . rock star have changed the crew editor on social club. You used to be able to use an image instead of making your own emblem. Whats happened since . is you cannot use an image anymore svg exploit you also cannot change to an existing svg emblem even if you already have one published for your crew. If your crew currently has one ingame the logo will disappear when you call your mechanic. If you place the emblem on your car and drive it inout of your garage each time then the emblem will stick. As soon as you call mechanic you must reapply the emblem. Shame they patched this!,gtaglitches,cib3sf2,1,t5_2z590

1477112,0,t3_2b3hfa,Can we get platform flairs? Yes. Will we? Not sure.Other subs seem to assign a platform iconname to a user flair which clan prove a little difficult in the glitches sense as theres some people who run both PS and XBOX platforms and theres no way for us to know unless they tell us which they dont always do which platform theyre using to reportupdatecomment in terms of a particular glitch.My own personal view is that we could assign a post flair something in addition to the usual Speculation Glitch Question etc. for example Speculation ltXBOX logogt. However even if we did that it may be going forward and not the old glitches  because as I said earlier theres no way to know what platform somebody was using unless they tell us.Its a nice idea and I like it in principe. The mod team will discuss it and one of us will get back to you. Thanks for sharing.,gtaglitches,cj1fjy0,1,t5_2z590

Once you get to level  and can buy a tank doing Blow Up II and killing cops for  minutes on a star wanted level will give you a ton of RP.

Next Gens best one might be  gtHouse  in  Regions  Video which works on Next Gen only because it was created when Rockstar converted the map data into the form that Next Gen uses. I say its in  Regions because if you scan the area that the property covers youll see the map say Banham Canyon Pacific Bluffs Richman and Vinewood Hills all on the same property. Theyre probably evading their propery tax on all This motorcycle flying under the map glitch was patched for a few weeks after a post was made on rGTAglitches maybe a year ago... they made it to where the motorcycle didnt have the forward boost when you leaned it back so youd just keep falling at the same spot and not go anywhere... which must have messed with the inair physics too much for the rest of the game which is my guess why they reverted it back.

6280842,0,t3_40gcbh,Ive been doing this glitch for the past few hours and weve had some unexpected results.  Below are some lessons learned.  Upvote for visibility.IMPORTANT NOTESMake sure someone is near the modded car at all times!  Since there is no loss prevention on it it will despawn when someone isnt near it or you stop looking at it for a min.  Seriously I moved  feet away and it was gone and I was out k.  Just have your friend stand ontop of it.Dont break the door off the glitched car!  Once you do you will no longer be able to glitch into it and you are done duping it.Below are things we have figured out while messing up. If the one vs one invite disapears when you drive into the garage all you have to do is have your friend kill you again and send him another one vs one invite it will still work. If your friend accepts a mission or job invite instead of the one vs one invite he can just back out and kill you again. If you drive into your garage with the modded car and the message doesnt disappear automatically just park it next to the wall and block the other door and restart from there. If you accidentally get out of the car while the cargobob has it picked up just have him pick it up again and get back in. If you get out of the glitched car and you accidentally open the door on it close the door with your body This is really important if the door gets broken off you are done with the glitch move it away from the wall and pick it back up with the cargobob and get in. If your friend gets cops when he kills you dont worry about them he should be able to accept the one vs one invite before the cops get to shoot at him and that will instantly remove his wanted level. If there are too many cops around and they wont go away use the full auto shotty and kill them all then quickly kill yourself.  No more should show up.  You can then use the cargobob to remove the cop cars.Noteworthy ItemsYou can dupe around  cars to maximize money and it will take about an hour.  The first car you dupe go ahead and go sell it immediately while your friend stays by the original glitched car.  Then replace the car you just sold in your garage and dupe  more.  Once you dupe the last one go and sell it then dupe  more car again.Go to Legendary Motorsprots and buy the Elegy  times since its free.  If you are able to buy it you can buy  of them fairly quickly.  It faster and easier than filling your garage with random street cars and the cars are only used as place holders for the glitched ones.Use the running car glitch to save you a little time.  Park a car right in front of your garage and get out.  Use your attack button and instantly hit Y or Triangle to get back into the car.  Once you get back in and turn the car on get back out and start running instantly.  The car should still be running with the door open.  Then when you respawn just run back to the car and hop in and drive it in.When your friend goes to accept the one vs one invite just have him hover over the invite on his phone not actually go into the invite and hover over the accept button.  You do it this way because if you get a job invite wile inside another one it will kick you out of the first invite and you will accidentally accept the second one.  When you are ready for him to accept he just spams the X or A button a few times and you will be good.Dont pick slow old cars as the trash car to drive into your garage.  Pick a decent car that has a quick off the line speed.  This will shave off a few seconds when you are trying to drive in before the one vs one invite goes away.You will need more than  cargobob so you can either plan ahead and get  or keep it in mind while using the glitch.  They will take damage over time from either the car swinging around too much on it you picking up too many vehicles or from hitting light postsbuildings etc.Have a friend kill you a few times so you can get a general area of where your going to spawn that way you arent disoriented when actually doing the glitch.  Make sure when your friend is standing on the dupe car when practicing your spawning because spawns can be influenced by where other players are located.I dont know what we did but we had  people  stood next to the garage door at all times to make sure the car doesnt despawn and the car wouldnt be invisible.  It was about a  success rate.,gtaglitches,cz3k83f,8,t5_2z590

7715056,0,t3_4jipcz,I just wanted to comment as of last night the glitch is still working and the first part is extremely quick to do. The longest part is literally waiting the  minutes between duping  selling. So duping a garage takes min. Also I was able to sell all my duped cars back to back. Some notes to take into consideration. When modding my low rider I added remote bomb which kicked me out of the garage and told me I could no longer mod my car. If you get in another car by accident or for whatever reason in the middle of this it will not allow you to request your personal vehicle low rider you can reset this by going into your garage and sitting in one of them. Then just leave and you will be able to request it.I had an issues with about  of my duped cars where it would not let me sell them for some reason possibly the remote bomb or because I sold them in the wrong order?

Edit but the full sale number gets back after a week or so.,gtaglitches,d8lenw0,1,t5_2z590

9415446,0,t1_d979u7q,The problem is that R has made an incredible game. Its seriously fun well thought out and overall great. But the pricing of things means that unless youre rich or buy Shark Cards you cant have fun. So players look for an alternative. Why spend  in shark cards when you can spend  on a modded account that will have exponentially more cash a higher level better stats etc. Now for a very small amount players can play the game to the full potential and enjoy it. Sure a lot of players wont be affected by this. But everyone will eventually get sick of the grinding for tens of hours for a single vehicle. ,gtaglitches,d99h1vl,7,t5_2z590

9996018,0,t3_5irr15,They cant really ban you for exploiting the pac standard glitch exactly.Theres no real way to prove it obviously if you do something retarded like record yourself doing it with your username in it.As for money drops no one has ever been banned for receiving money. Maybe if someone sent in footage of you literally asking for money then receiving it I guess they could ban you but they simply cant ban someone based on suspicion alone because if it was possible some random cheater can roll into your session drop money on you and get you banned.The worst thatd happen if you received money from a cheater would be that your cash gets resetreverted.,gtaglitches,dbaicwd,21,t5_2z590
