15406,0,t3_1uadoi,Basicly what I did was I took zuchini slicedampdiced brocolli chopped to prefered sizes and mushrooms sliceddiced and some scallions. I then sauted them in some oil untill I was satisfied with the consistency and then I put them aside in a bowl and then I cooked the diced chicken and added it to the bowl with the veggies. No seasoning besides salt amp pepper but thats just my preference. Next I took some leftover brown rice that I saved from the day before and fried it on the pan for some minutes just enough that it would gain some colour then I added the veggies amp meat and heated it together. Lastly I added scrambled egg directly onto the pan with rice amp veggies amp meat and cooked untill my likings.

Altering the structure of a protein is called denaturation which takes place during digestion anyway.  Also sometimes extra denaturation cooking before consumption makes protein more bioavailable.

464915,0,t3_1zf1uq,Not helpful but I am lucky enough to live with people who give  fucks if I dump my yolks into their eggs usually appreciate it. If it is an option its irreversible and I find myself not feeling jealous upset or anything over it. If people arent always eating eggs when you are I definitely went through this for a minute. they freeze until you need them. I ended up hoarding them because of this. Keep track of calories but it often doesnt hurt to put one or two yolks in with your eggs. Theyre not actually as bad for you as you think. If you crack six consider keeping two yolks in there. Its not much but it gives them a little more filler. Also if you are in the mood to boil eggs or fry them just enjoy the yolk or at least half of what the actual egg would give. Its more satisfying in the long run Ive realized. Baking cooking things with eggs and scrambled eggs are the only times I feel like it is a similar experience without. Also if you LOVE scrambled egg or cooking with egg liquid egg white is cheap and SO EASY.  ,fitmeals,cft41wi,4,t5_2sd23

535731,0,t1_cg0xq24,I dont agree with this based on my experiences living in China  years ago Im sure this is more true now.. people there arent exactly stick thin and its not just because of McDonalds. A lot of the food we think of as Chinese food is more accurately classified as banquet food or special occasion food. Businessmen go all out for business dinners with huge elaborate spreads and tons of fried saucedup notverygoodforyou food. Every restaurant big enough to seat more than  people in my city had a private banquet room. Apparently some of the reason that Chinese people are gaining weight is because this food is becoming more common at the expense of more healthy plain dishes.Basically I dont agree that Chinese people are this culture that doesnt believe in enjoying meals. You should see how long Cantonese people drag Dim Sum on for! I also dont agree that Chinese food is inherently healthier. My mom gained quite a bit of weight there before she realized our Chinese cook was using TONS of oil everywhere. My mom asked her to just use less and the cook was like what and burn everything? Further yes Chinese people eat vegetables but where you see a benefit of having vegetables with everything I see a menu where every vegetable is covered in oil and meat. And trust me there are many dishes that DONT have meat its just that beefpork is considered a flavouring.This isnt to say that SOME Chinese food isnt very healthy. And dont get me wrong I ate my way through my city. Best food of my life. Its just that its more nuanced than just fetishizing this ideal of the Chinese lifestyle.,fitmeals,cg163t2,3,t5_2sd23

4882703,0,t3_3hrmh8,Pulses. Lots of pulses. Theyre very high in protein and fiber can cook into a soft paste or blend easily into soups. Cook on the stove or crockpot beans until very tender. Drain and reserve liquid and mash adding liquid back in until a good consistency like refried beans is achieved. Add whatever tasty toppings or sauce you like or have it as a side dish.  Add a can of white beans rinsed and drained to your pot of potatoes before mashing or to creamy soups like cream of broccoli cream of mushroom potatoleek etc. Red lentils cook into a nice soft nutritious mush and are the basis for a lot of tasty soups and dals. They may look like they have some definition when done but they will melt in your mouth with the slightest pressure from your tongue. Hummus is made quite easily and you can customize the taste to your liking. I have admittedly eaten it by the spoonful when lacking anything in the house to spread it on.

Also sprinkle over sage cumin salt and pepper. Shake the tray so that the cubes are all evenly coated and put in the oven.For  peopleDice  onions and a couple of sweet peppers any colour but yellow or red is best. Lightly fry these in a large frying pan. Add in a couple of cloves of crushed garlic. After about  minutes of frying check on the squash and shake them around a bit to make sure they evenly cook. Then put the kettle on and put two stock cubes in a mug. For this many people I use one veg and one chicken if noone is veggie. Keep stirring the onions peppers and rice. When the water boils add it to the mug and dissolve the stock cubes. Then add about  table spoons of it at a time to the rice. You want to add it a bit at a time and stir it in well to make the risotto nice and oozey and creamy. Keep adding the stock in a bit at a time and stirring it in. After about  minutes of last checking the squash check it again and maybe shake it about some more. Its done when you can easily squash it with a fork. It should take about  mins to do depending on how big the chunks are. Youll need more than a mug of water for the risotto so just add warm water to it when the stock is gone. That way you ensure all the flavour from the stock is added rather than making up a lot of diluted stock and not using it all. Also if the squash is done before the rice is soft just turn the oven off and keep the squash in there so it stays warm. When the squash is done youll want to mash half of what youre using. A mediumlarge squash is enough for  portions. You can freeze whatever you dont use. When the rice is soft add the mashed squash. Stir in a cook for  minutes. Plate it up and put the chunks ontop for a different texture. I usually save the neatest looking cubes to put on top. This also goes really well with chicken. You could roast a chicken if youre making this for  or more people. Or you could just roast a thigh per person while the squash is roasting too.,fitmeals,cvtj9u8,1,t5_2sd23

For snacks you can make your own energy barsgranola bars that are much less processed than what is found in store.  As far as meals go Maybe the best thing to do is to sit down once a week and try to plan out your meals and mealprep.  At that point you can analyze what you need to get you the calories you need and plan accordingly.  Foods that are high in healthy fats can really pack in the calories.  Also for your sides go for the carbs you need them potato sweet potato pumpkinsquash is really going to be helpful.  You can also throw in some pasta meals.  rMealprepsunday will have a lot of good resources on meal prepping.

7704700,0,t1_d3hx6mn,Well as for your question on mozzarella I have never had the generic store brand burn it has always melted for me at lower temps.  Blasting it at f and broiling is burning the rice flour coating that low fat shredded mozzarella has added to it.  Obviously buying high quality mozzarella and shredding it yourself would be an alternative but at that point Im going all out and making actual rpizza.  I just looked up the pizza sauce I use for the ghetto tortilla ones and if anything it has less calories and sugar than your puree.  Its made of tomato paste what about that would be high in caloric value?  Im sure the final product doesnt taste quite as good but for  the cost of your ingredient list Im going that route.  My main point was that if you cook it at lower temps for longer you can achieve roughly the same final product without any of those ingredients.  As you mentioned the taste portion will be subjective.,fitmeals,d3hz1hu,2,t5_2sd23

7924550,0,t3_4nsrro,Patience. The secret is patience. First store it upside down until youre ready to open it. This forces the oil to mix a bit as it settles to the other end of the jar. Then after opening it start slow and shallow gently mixing the top half inch or so until it has an even but still runny consistency. Slowly dig deeper incrementally thickening your slurry as you go. Keep repeating the process of adding a little peanut by digging deeper then mixing until the slurry on top is consistent. Once you have a consistency youre willing to eat make yourself a peanut butter sandwich because you can. Thatll take some substance off the top and make the rest of the mixing easier.Finally after youve mixed it store it in the fridge. I know I like mine smooth enough not to devastate fresh bread and I can eat an entire jar long before it comes remotely close to going rancid but refrigeration also helps to prevent separation which is where we started. ,fitmeals,d46sm5l,2,t5_2sd23
