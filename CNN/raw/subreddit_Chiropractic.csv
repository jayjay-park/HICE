The point of an adjustment is to move the restricted joints when You self adjust the joints that are already moving are the ones that make the pop. It wont help to restore normal motion to your spine. Those stuck joints are still going to be stuck the joints around it compensate and move more than normal.,Chiropractic,cgz4dpy,3,t5_2r82y

Many people have pars defects or spondylolisthesis and never know it because their connective tissue and musculature have adapted to give them adequate stability. so while you might not get cured in the sense that its like it never happened it will still be visible on xrays with proper treatment and time you will get to the point where youll never think about it day to day and will feel normal. ,Chiropractic,ch0t9tl,3,t5_2r82y

4705210,0,t1_ctnm1hc,I disagree. Now in full disclosure I did just start doing reviews for prior authorization for a managed care company.If it wasnt for managed care there would be no need to do active therapies no need to institute home exercise or management programs and no need to release patients from care. In fact it would be a really bad financial decision to release anyone from care before they reached their yearly limit. Given the cases Ive seen and the responses they get vs the requests for visits and the terrible documentation I am seeing as a reviewer there is a huge difference in the providers intent and andor skill. I see one doc who finds the exact same findings on every person I can predict the side of antalgia the incorrect dermatome or myotome assignments and the dx codes he will use.  That doesnt mean that the patient isnt injured but if you cant get someone from  to a  in  visits then there is a problem and when I get  cases in  days lie that it paintrs a clear picture. Add in the providers who want to bill  units of pt every visit icestimtractionthera ex and you know they are doing at least  of these at the same time with no progression of care and you can understand why we need managed care companies.I honestly think that managed care companies are a good thing. It pushes us to be better they collect data that could be used for research it also has taught us how to communicate with other provider types who are used to clear cut objective numbers.Do I think they are all good? No I hate dealing with one in particular and I have a conference call next week with another between myself and a list of higher ups about why they are fucking up my claims going back over a year and how they are going to fix things.

I hired a company that does my verifications authorizations and processes all of my claims. They charge  per verification and  of all collections.

9335239,0,t3_58bfxz,Cant see the article but the first line says that  of the money Medicare paid out to chiropractors was medically unnecessary following an audit in .I either have to believe this article is not true because there is no way Medicare would audit THAT many chiropractors... It would have made a lot more news. That is huge to have  of payments be incorrect. I could also believe that there are one or two major players who make up that  and have messed up greatly and are likely bankrupt now. Maybe similar to a ChiroOne situation or whatever that big group was but it would likely have to be bigger than that.Another possibility would be that Medicare simply paid out on services that are not covered for chiropractors. Mainly paying out for therapies exams Xrays.. But at that point it is Medicares fault rather than chiropractors.If someone has a copy or could just copypaste the article that would be great. I am just skeptical about their findings.,Chiropractic,d8zb5vm,3,t5_2r82y

What happens when it IS worse. What activities you can do with no pain. All this info is extremely helpful to your doc. And that will get you on the right track.

10386539,0,t1_dcktiul,If you consider all the stress your neck has to deal with it makes sense. On a daily basis whether you sit at a desk all day drive or live an active startle and work out your neck is constantly working to be stable  Especially considering poor postures.

10425734,0,t3_5p9vhw,Abdominal bracing exercises help a lot with maintaining disc issues. Your chiro should be able to help out with that. Popping your own neck feels great and all but if theres a fixation then youre just mobilizing the joints around it. Short term meh. Long term you can create ligament laxity which equals instability. So a higher propensity to hurting your neck in those areas. Frequency is a big part of this. Overall its not a great thing to do but if youre seriously annoyed by a tweak in your neck and wont see your chiro in days thats up to you. There are worse things in life.

10804461,0,t1_dduds3n,This is more so old school medicine. Most of modern medicine understands that things have patterns. Its not just chiropractors that will look at an ankle and see how that it is unstable which is leading to core weakness which is causing a patients shoulderelbow pain when throwing.Understanding alone isnt enough to get patients well unfortunately. Its the application of that knowledge that will and as we speak allopathic medicine de facto method to healing and well being comes from a bottle of drugs or surgery. Keep in mind that this discussion is about chiropractors being licensed to prescribe these drugs and as such absorb the symptomchasing mentality that rarely improves the patients condition rather than absorbing mordern medicines understanding that things have pattern. We do not need to absorb any of that since our philosophy already is as the founder put it adjusting causes rather than treating effects.What people dismiss about chiropractic is how subluxation causes cancer or diabetes or asthma. And therfore fixing a subluxation will cure cancer diabetes and asthma.Not every chiropractor believes the above.,Chiropractic,dduek3r,2,t5_2r82y
10898425,0,t1_de41zzn,You do realize that if you collect payment up front that legally as the doctor you need to put this money in an escrow account and you can only touch the money once the service has been rendered for the EXACT reason that you state.For example If I say you need  visits to clear up  based on your history examination objective findings ect... and you pay for  visits up front totaling  visits and  for the initial examination. You pay me . I have to put that  into an escrow account and can only touch  of it as of this moment right now because the exam was performed so you can collect the exam fee.Lets say then it only takes you  visits to get better from . There is still  in the escrow account that cannot be touched because you havent rendered services for  visits that were already paid for. That  since you havent touched it can be returned to the patient. Thats how its done legally.Do you have a problem with that if thats the way a prepayment plan operates? ,Chiropractic,de43fru,2,t5_2r82y

11290906,0,t3_612ol5,I know you didnt mention Palmer but ill throw my  cents in because Im currently in the program. Not matter what school you attend the classes are going to be relatively the same because national boards dictates the curriculum at schools. If they add a section to boards the schools are forced to teach it or their students wont do well on boards. I would argue that the main difference between schools is prestige cost board scores and philosophy so those are the areas you are going to have to consider. Cant speak for any school other than Palmer but ill cover eachPrestige With Palmer being the first chiro school with a solid alumni base combined with public trust id say prestige is solid. My uncle graduated from Palmer  years ago and has told me there are people who will strictly only see Palmer grads.Cost Palmer is slightly on the more expensive side mostly due to the prestige that they offer and the amount of students that want to attend due to that but I dont believe that they are the most expensive school out there. Tuition price aside living in Davenport IA is actually really cheap compared to other areas so that helps minimize the sticker price of the school.Board scores These are required to be publicly available by all chiropractic colleges so Id recommend searching school ncbe scores and taking a look at those for any school you are interested inPhilosophy This is always an important aspect for students because it can dictate techniques and scope of practice. Every school is different with some schools on the vitalistic side with some falling in the middle and some with wide scopes. Id say Palmer would fall somewhere in the middle. The school does treach philosophyhistory  classes in the curriculum but I wouldnt say the classes revolve around it. You will find student that loath philosophy and some that live by and everyone in between. If you have any questions feel free to ask and good luck on your search!!,Chiropractic,dfbt3cg,3,t5_2r82y
11298078,0,t1_dfclvej,Hmm... didnt know they had EMC in Georgia to. We get  GA autos a year im in FL and they always got cut off at  regardless. And it is really common to get part of the settlement. Obviously if the case is a pure Letter of Protection with no insurance involved but the settle covers part of the  that insurance wont cover. It really depends ont he lawyer as well though. Some lawyers care than the medical professionals are compensated and some are greedy jackasses who ask for  reduction of bills. Really just depends but the shit one rarely reduce their own bill and a lot of times inflate it. ,Chiropractic,dfcmc42,1,t5_2r82y
