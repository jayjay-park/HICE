1752803,0,t1_cjzyljj,The connect isnt ... The connectamp is. And an amplifier is more expensive of course. Also the Camp has more jacks and also works as a bridge like all sonos components so thats pretty cool! You dont need anything but your own speakers and the ConnectAmp and you have your own Sonos system with passive speakers. The price is actually pretty cheap if you compare it to other decent amplifiers and add the fact that it got the whole Sonosnet in there. The Margain really isnt that big D,sonos,ck03ki7,1,t5_2ucpt

That way I could upgrade the speakers in the kitchen its an open kitchen to a eating area to the living room I could add stereo to the drinking roomdining room and I could put a speakers in the second office.I work from home and spend most of my time in the office so I wanted the best. I dont mind paying the premium if its something Ill use for hours a day.

6472086,0,t3_446ksy,As everyone has already said a ConnectAmp is your best bet as the sound source for inwallinceiling speakers. As far as it being the best or most economical solution probably not. Most economical isnt really a selling point for Sonos. Most of the gear is actually selfcontained standalone devices where you can simply provide power and go. The Play  Play are both speaker and source so it doesnt require anything else. If youre looking for something less expensive consider your use case. If you can run speaker wire through the walls to a central location where you connect a multizone receiver thats likely to be less expensive than multiple ComnectAmps. Its also likely to be marginally more difficult to use and harder to expand in a year or two after the walls are closed up. Id also suggest thinking about what you want to listen to. IMO the strength of Sonos is the list of supported streaming services although there are a large number of people with significant local digital music libraries. Generally you wont be dropping in a CD or just flipping on the radio with a Sonos system although a huge number of radio stations will stream  just be sure what you want is available through a supported service if thats what youre interested in. You also wont be pushing music from your iPhone to Sonos although Android is slightly more flexible in this regard. The speakers are minicomputers and they do all the work. Your phone is a remote control via the app not a music source. And no you cant connect to Sonos via Bluetooth or AirPlay. Most of the negative posts that show up here start off with I bought a pile of Sonos gear but it doesnt do X to meet someones requirement. As with any large purchase the buyer has to understand what theyre buying and how it will meet their needs. Please take the time to read reviews the product web site etc. to be sure you understand what Sonos does and how it does it and more importantly what it doesnt do.  They have a very specific product with very specific market placement. Its very good at what it does but terrible at what it doesnt do. Nothing wrong with that but you absolutely need to make sure that what you want to do is going to work. No product is everything to everyone so the right decision for you may be to go in a different direction. ,sonos,czorcco,3,t5_2ucpt

7709184,0,t1_d3ih076,No I dont think theres a correlation. I stated my opinion fairly succinctly Im not sure why you keep trying to press this point. I think that voice integration appears to be their next big thing I would be surprised to see it before CES . I think well also see true play for the home theatre setup but before the end of the year. I dont foresee new hardware anytime before voice integration. All IS well. They are working on Audible just like they were working on integrating Apple Music. Its niche but itll get done. The system works as advertised as it has for ten years. Needs for wholehome audio havent suddenly changed or accelerated people still want easy to use distributed audio and they like the wireless convenience of Sonos. No one else is doing it as well in my opinion and no one else has the brand name recognition in this space. Now you know what I think... Which isnt any different than what Ive posted above. We have a lot of armchair analysts in this sub none of whom have solid arguments in my opinion. Theres a lot of pearl clutching and hand wringing and I think its a lot of time wasted.

9789195,0,t3_5fevra,Hello and congrats on your purchase. I am afraid that you are not able to connect your Play speakers to your TV.  They are not designed to be TV speakers and in fact do not have any inputs that would allow you to connect to a TV.  The  and only Sonos product designed for TV use is the Playbar.  There are workarounds including using a Connect or a Play but they are not recommended for a number of reasons. If TV use is vital you might want to consider returning the Plays and using those funds toward a Playbar which will also play music.  Personally I think a pair of Plays sounds better than the Playbar for music.  And further I feel that the Playbar really needs a Sub to shine.  So we are not talking about an even cost exchange in moving from  Plays to a Playbar. I would try setting up the system without the Boost.  The recommended method of setting up Sonos is to plug at least  of the speakers into your router via ethernet.  This will create what is called SonosNet which is a wireless network that rides alongside and is more stable than wifi.  Further when running on SonosNet each speaker will mesh and actually strengthen the overall network.  Essentially plugging in a Play is like adding a Boost to the system so you can save the  on the Boost if you can reach a speaker with ethernet.,sonos,dajqbua,5,t5_2ucpt
9865954,0,t3_5glnj3,. SONOS only streams music from a device if you tell it to play a song from This device in your available list of sources..Sources are typically your Pandora Spotify or dozens of other accounts you specify inside the SONOS app.When you start a playlist from Pandora Spotify or others using an iPad or other device which has the SONOS app Sonos actually streams from the internet to the speaker not from the device to the speaker. So you can hit the play  pause button on the speaker and it stops and starts the last source you were playing from.The only thing that cancels it is unplugging the speaker from the wall. In which chase you would need to open the SONOS app and browse to the speaker choose your source and start playing again. In the middle of  SONOS updated their software to eliminate the need for their Wireless Bridge now called Boost. Essentially this wasis a device that needed to be hardwired into your internet router and supplied a wireless signal ONLY for SONOS equipment this wireless network is called SONOSNet. Its SSID is invisible to other wireless devices.These days you can use your own WiFi as the wireless transport for streaming to and from Sonos speakers and other equipment. If you only have a couple of speakers in a small space there is no need for a bridge and it doesnt use much bandwidth. However for larger implementations like what I have we use a SONOS Boost to separate the wireless network from my regular wireless Access Point Apple Airport Extreme so SONOS has its own wireless network and my Apple Airport Extreme isnt overworked or saturated with wireless signals.Hope this helps.,sonos,datk1nr,2,t5_2ucpt

9941371,0,t1_db38j9r,Ceiling speakers is what Im looking at for my new house. I was gonna go airplay and that is only  per AirPort Express. However my SO like Sonos that she uses at a friends and I like the fact that the client is on the speaker not continuously streaming from the phone like airplay. I think Ill get the amps and ceiling speakers and sub cables installed and try wired airport for a few months and see how it holds up. But I do really like Sonos....,sonos,db3dvnf,1,t5_2ucpt

10673427,0,t1_ddd2h1f,I agree. The hub and spoke integration model of Chromecast means that service vendors have to do just one integration with Chromecast to work on a rapidly growing ecosystem of audio and video devices. It would be a really shortsighted management decision for Sonos not to commit to having one of those spokes go to Sonos devices. ,sonos,ddgvt5z,0,t5_2ucpt

11188775,0,t1_deyvcex, I appreciate the context provided by PonyDogs because without his context I would have misinterpreted the article. As far as I can tell there are no outright lies or any misstated facts in the story. The story is wrong for me bc I leave it with a mis understanding. Thanks to PonyDogs i know i need to go look up patent law procedures bc this article brings up more questions then it answers.  Does the articles editorauthor have a duty to anticipate my questions? No. In my subjective opinion I think the authoreditor couldve tried to add another  words fleshing out the context of how these cases work.The cynic in mean thinks that it is easier to write less and write something that fans flames of discontent rather than further inform and educate the reader.
