1462244,0,t3_2awln1,If A and B are like cats and dogs like you suggested to bleb then the reviewer is correct you should do a way ANOVA. Heres how to interpret itLets say A and B are the species variable you havent said what it actually is so Ill pretend and then stress is the other variable with stress and no stress as the levels. You measured some dependent variable in all four levels.A significant main effect of species means that species A in general and ignoring the stress variable is different from species B in the average dependent variable.A significant main effect of stress means that adding stress changes the dependent variable regardless of the species.If the interaction is not significant it means that main effects dont change when you consider species and stress together.If the interaction is significant it can mean a few different things but means that species A and species B do not react to the stress in the same way.A confusing thing can occur where stress is not significant but the interaction is. This can occur if the mean level of the dependent variable among BOTH species is no different in the stress vs. nonstress group but if adding stress made species A have an increased dependent variable but species B have a decreased independent variable.Oh and by the way having to revise a paper does not make a VERY URGENT question.

Consider yourself warned.Depends partly on where you try to patent. With the US patent office for example all bets are off.You can patent a process. Which can be embodied in code but its not the exact code youre patenting rather its the process it embodies. I can make a trivial change to the code or reexpress it in a different language and its no longer the same code but if the process is covered by a patent that would make little difference aside from making it slightly more complex to prove that the patent was being infringed.It would have to satisfy the usual requirements to be patentable including being new  not covered by prior art This in particular is why I complain about the US patent system. They frequently allow patents that are clearly covered by extensive prior art. I presume they dont have the funds to actually research the applications and just grant   them if nobody tells them about the existence of prior art requiring anyone who knows the area to take the thing to court to fix up  leaving the little guy up shit creek.,rstats,d8utn2s,2,t5_2r8n0

9889548,0,t1_dawc42g,gt What should you not use Feather for?gt Feather is not designed for longterm data storage. At this time we do not guarantee that the file format will be stable between versions. Instead use Feather for quickly exchanging data between Python and R code or for shortterm storage of data frames as part of some analysis.,rstats,dawmq5n,2,t5_2r8n0

10181279,0,t1_dby0psk,Thanks for your time I appreciate it!gt Probability density functions are probabilities  the sum of all probabilities should be . In this case the data is continuous so the integral is one.Yeah Ive read that somewhere. And it makes sense since the probability that a random value falls anywhere in your entire range is  aka .Im  sure the results of kded are what Im looking for. The problem Im having at the moment is this certain areas of my heatmap imply a high likelihood of a new value being in said areas. However I currently cannot tell how high.Another problem is that the college course Im currently in doesnt give direct access to statistics courses yet theyre asking me to dive into youve guessed it statistics. But thats a story for rrant PStatistics  time youre mentioning probability density distribution and probability density function. Are those different things?Lastly I had proposed cutting xs and ys into a grid and doing the  thing ages ago but that got shot down.,rstats,dby3ro7,1,t5_2r8n0

10212311,0,t1_dbznu35,gt  On all others languages I know java C ruby they are all derived classes vector from array matrix as an array of arrays and some simple operations like multiply and transform some matrices could be very clunky to develop.This is why Im glad that Python added the  operator in ..  It makes matrix multiplication far more intuitive.,rstats,dc1mfyp,2,t5_2r8n0

10606428,0,t3_5rrenb,gt But how often is that a good idea?Always.My data analysis code is  functional. In fact procedural programming has absolutely no place in data analysis. This means No sideeffects. Every expression has exactly one effect and that is conferred through its value.     Things that require sideeffects input output are abstracted away and ideally only occur at the very beginning input and end output of the workflow. Abstract early build your functionality up by combining small functions.     Design functions such that they can easily be combined. That often means creating generalpurpose functions. One of the hallmarks of functional programming compared to procedural programming is the abundance of very general helper libraries and very little domainspecific code. Unfortunately base R provides almost no tool to support this. Im using a small library of helpers to facilitate combining functions in different ways. Use OOP to abstract and describe your data. Many people think that OOP and functional programming are somehow opposed but thats false. OOP comes from functional programming. S works perfectly well with functional programming. S with its slots and R less so.     Relatedly use type information liberally. R is weakly typed but it still allows you to tag your data based on its purpose.I do occasionally resort to a less functional style for generalpurpose programming in R since some algorithms are easier expressed iteratively than using higherorder list application and recursion. But these are rare exceptions.,rstats,dd9yzvh,9,t5_2r8n0
