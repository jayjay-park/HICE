120521,0,t1_ces4u1f,There is a very simple and very cost effective solution dont forget to charge it up and plan ahead.And a kWh battery wouldnt solve the issue it would just mean that if you fail to plan ahead and arrive at a destination with no charge left you have an empty kWh battery instead of an empty kWh or kWh battery. It may even be worse because if you have driven the maximum range you have more distance to cover to get back to civilization.Again charge time is the bigger factor here.The only place a bigger battery makes a difference is in long road trips. If you could have five hundred or more miles of range you could drive all day but even at  miles of range you are approaching the point where extra range is irrelevant because if you charge at a supercharger during lunch and once for an afternoon snack and arent in a rush you will be fine.

1015375,0,t1_chjis30,gt Imagine if the next new car you bought lasted the rest of your life? The Tesla Gigafactory could make that possible selling new batteries to old Teslas.gt So theoretically replacing my internal combustion engine every so often means Ill only have to buy one car? Phew! I thought other parts might wear down over time for a second there!You misunderstand.  With proper maintenance and driving some ICE cars can last for k.  An electric car will need to have its battery replaced long before that and no amount of careful driving or fluid changing will alter that fact.   Really though other parts dont wear out super fast especially in an electric car.  The brakes are regenerative and dont wear out the pads nearly so much.  Electric motors can last for decades the bearings are of much higher quality than any ICE engine and an ICE engine operates at several times the RPM of an electric motor.  The transmission and everything is sealed and lubricated.  No clutch to wear out.  No piston rings no valves no carbon buildup.  Even the cooling fluid lasts longer than an ICE car.,teslamotors,chjpef8,2,t5_2s3j5

1042871,0,t1_chmofjb,Power Japan Plus is claiming that their dual carbon  batteries can be manufactured in much the same way that lithium ion s are with minor modifications to the process. Fortunately PJP plans on proving the feasibility of manufacturing s specifically for the purpose of use in electric vehicles.  I suspect that their relatively smallscale production run will make or break the technology.So where does this leave Tesla and dual carbon?  Well we know that Tesla plans to build a gigafactory in the near future that will roughly double the current rate of lithium ion production manufacturing billions of  batteries per year based on  battery packs per year and  batteries per pack.  Given that much of the factorys tooling and manufacturing equipment could be used to manufacture dual carbon s as well it seems that Teslas gigafactory will allow them the opportunity to switch over to dual carbon production at a much lower capital cost than they would face if building an entirely new dual carbon factory.  However there is still the supply chain concern.  As mentioned above Tesla plans to reach all the way down in order to optimize cost efficiency  which creates a lithiumionspecific workflow and makes it more difficult and costly to switch over to dual carbon production.  Still if dual carbon is really as great and easy to manufacture as PJP claims Tesla Panasonic and probably the majority of the lithium ion industry will switch over to it as quickly as possible even if that transition comes at a large cost.You can sort of think that Tesla is hedging their bets when it comes to dual carbon and their gigafactory.  In all likelihood dual carbon will have some fatal flaw and not be ready for mass production in which case Tesla will go about business as usual.  However on the off chance that dual carbon really is the way of the future Tesla can switch over at a cost which would ultimately be negligible compared to the revenue that they would be making off of an EV that could charge in a few minutes.  So if youre interested in the future of electric vehicles definitely keep an eye on dual carbon but dont get your hopes up until PJP has proven the feasibility of manufacturing it at a competitive cost.As for the separation between their car and battery businesses Tesla is extremely vertically integrated.  While some of the batteries produced at the gigafactory will be sold for home energy storage most will be shipped straight to Fremont or some future factory.That information is true to the best of my knowledge.  Im not a Tesla employee yet so none of this is official but let me know if you doubt anything and Ill see if I can find a source.  ,teslamotors,chmtuqh,3,t5_2s3j5

1392652,0,t1_cipzam1,Well I mean honestly the last car you bought was or how much you paid for it doesnt matter in terms of whether or not you should get a Tesla now. The Tesla is a luxury car no doubt about it so its kind of by definition not a good buy if youre looking to save money. A k Civic will always win out right?But yeah in my opinion k after all the incentives is definitely more expensive than your CC but on the other hand the Model S is really really nice. Looks like a CC gets about  mpg so over the course of k miles youre saving somewhere like  dollars probably more since gas prices are already over  and imo likely to rise making the Tesla more like a k gas car. So if you can afford the up front payment and be willing to get the savings over the course of the next  years you could do it.But Im usually a pretty frugal and riskaverse person I wouldnt have bought it if I hadnt been in a really sound place financially  if the Model S had put me in debt or put my financial future in terms of retirement or kids in college or whatever at risk I wouldnt have done it.

Imagine the theoretical although very unlikely scenario where someone does manage to figure out how to bypass all of the layers and are suddenly able to steal every Model S.  It would be worth a fair bit of investment to figure out how to do that and enabling more ways to start the car also enables more ways to steal it.As far as investment accounts go you have an entirely different issue of how to steal money anonymously even if you get access to the account.

2238236,0,t3_2ksm2q,Tesla doesnt report sales monthly because it doesnt let them game the sales numbers the way they have been.Tesla has more demand than they can keep up with.  This is evidenced by wait times of several months to get cars.  Teslas sales numbers are not evidence of demand for the product but evidence of how fast they can make the car.  The order numbers they dont publish are the demand.  Most people presume that the sales numbers are demand so much so the Q letter tries to explain that it isnt.Tesla has one factory which means orders going overseas have a long transit time.  Tesla doesnt book those sales until the vehicles have been delivered.  In order to maximize their sales i.e. minimizing the inventory they carry across quarters they make cars that have a long way to go towards the beginning of a quarter and cars that are closer to the factor towards the end of the quarter.  If Tesla reported sales numbers by month they really couldnt do this.  A month isnt enough time for them to play this sort of game.Other car manufacturers dont have these problems.  Theyre usually building cars faster than theyre sold and buyers are typically buying cars sitting on the dealer lot.  They often have factories in major markets not just in one place.  Allowing them to reduce their transit time.  So reporting sales monthly isnt a problem for them.,teslamotors,cloc0jo,30,t5_2s3j5

The efficiency of a fuel cell combined with an electrical motor is betterYou also get to use a small light and fast reacting electrical motor instead of a big heavy and slow internal combustion engine with a big support system including a bigger cooling system that requires a higher intake of air which in turn is bad for the aerodynamics of the car.,teslamotors,clplpzf,2,t5_2s3j5

The amps used at Supercharger stations is insanely high.  Something about the way the single or dual chargers are set up they are completely bypassed and the current flows directly into the main battery at SC stations.  You may want to check with your delivery specialist this is about as detailed as my knowledge is.

2368413,0,t1_cm4f0xm,Eh I own the first Model S and I am not in the category you describe.  Yes there are people like that out there.  But what percentage of current owners are they?  Im not sure but I see a lot of people posting about the MS who never spent this much on a vehicle in the past never intended to until the MS came along and intend to drive it for a very long time.  There are only a little over  on the road today some of which are in Europe and Asia.  Anyone who bought a  I would imagine is not going to be looking to buy at the price point of the D otherwise they would have bought an  to begin with.  People who bought the S if they had enough extra money to throw around probably would have bought a P.  So I dont see a lot of people driving the S who are going to spend another K transaction costs to upgrade otherwise they would have bought all the bells and whistles to begin with.  So ultimately those who will pay a premium to upgrade are probably those who bought the P and of those what percentage will want to spend the extra money?  Then you have to factor in the fact that orders for the D will be filled over a few months people who want to upgrade would not all flood the market at the same time because some of them will be waiting on the new one to arrive.  So for all of the reasons I dont expect a precipitous drop in pre owned prices.    Seems to me there are a lot of people rooting for pre owned prices to fall off a cliff.  I dont intend to sell mine so it really doesnt affect me but I am really skeptical that this will happen.

Musks latest blog post says that the rated range for a roadster with all the updates battery aerodynamics rolling resistance will be    higher.Looking at this graph we can see that the rated range of the old roadster   mph was about  miles. If the range of the new roadster is  higher then it will be around  miles at  mph.Obviously this is not the best way to calculate the new range. The updated drag coefficient for example might have a disproportionately big effect at high speeds. But unfortunately I do not know how to do the calculations that take all those things into account. If anyone does please do so. I would be happy to be proven wrong.Also one thing to note according to that graph the rated range of the roadster  miles was calculated for driving at  mph. The rated range of the Model S however  miles was calculated at  mph.The rated range of the old Roadster at  mph was actually a bit under  miles.EDIT I was wrong about the Roadster being tested at  mph.

Driving at a slower speed with less stops at superchargers would be better if youre trying to get to a distant place. BTW another thing to note is that in Europe the MS can take up to  kilowatts  more than the US MS version. Slightly more faster supercharging. Interesting. I think I saw somewhere that  kwh is equal to  gallons of gas in terms of stored energy. Electric engines are much more efficient so you get hundreds of kilometers out of  kwh. ,teslamotors,cnydqrt,5,t5_2s3j5

3800083,0,t1_cqp7285,Most baseload power is nuclear because it doesnt spin up or down very easily and because its super cheap to generate all the cost is in plant construction. Baseload means the output power varies only slowly over the course of the day if at all it can only roughly approximate the expected load curve on the grid.Nonbaseload power can be spun up or down more quickly  so it can better match flucutations in grid load  but tends to be more expensive to generate. Coal and natural gas turbines are frequently in this class.If load exceeds capacity then more nonbaseload generation needs to be brought online. This can be very expensive frequently costing the utilities much more than a residential customer pays per kilowatthour. Thats part of why the utilities discourage very burst power loads including supercharger stations .. and also part of why irregular generation from solar and wind is difficult for them to manage.If capacity exceeds load then either nonbaseload generation can be turned off or the excess power can be dumped into energy storage. Today this storage is pumped hydro but in the future battery or hydrogen storage may be more common.With a set of EVs connected to a smart grid the grid could potentially control both EV charge and discharge back into the grid allowing them to shape the demand curve as well as the supply curve.,teslamotors,cqpftmr,0,t5_2s3j5

Our annual defense spending is  billion dollarsyear and our military is running around in desert camouflage.Clearly not ALL of our defense spending is because of ongoing conflict in oil rich countries but with  million taxpayers  billion dollars works out to  per taxpayer per year to sustain the military and certainly the cost of ongoing middle eastern conflicts are part of that.We should make an effort to move away from oil dependency for national security reasons alone because many influential people and groups in the middle east are batshit crazy.,teslamotors,crthvxc,3,t5_2s3j5

4158058,0,t3_38d3jk,. It aint that bad but it also is not good. Driving in kmh could empty your battery in maybe  minutes. If you supercharge to half of your battery you would be traveling for  minutes and supercharging for  minutes which may be not most effective way of traveling too much time spend on chargers.By my calculations ideal speed is somewhere around kmh you would be traveling maybe  of time and charging  of the time for every hour traveled you would be halfhour on charger.. If you are going somewhere for several days in winter it is best if you could get any charging at hotel even normal V outlet is good enough. You can do it even without it but you wouldnt have to worry about anything. And there is electricity in every hotel so it is possible everywhere where they want to satisfy customers.As for the actual data it is under kmday maybe even kmday if you dont wake up car through the day.Also big hog on battery is to heat your car from cold state  it aint that problem for one long trip maybe km is used to heat the car and the battery but if you do several short trips and the car cools down meanwhile it can seriously reduce the range. So for example if you drive for  km from hotel somewhere every day each short trip can take km of range.If you go longer it is not that big problem as you have to heat the car only once and then only maintain it which is much less powerconsuming. But it can still reduce range maybe around  less range in really cold weather.TLDR. kmh is ideal. get at least V outlet in hotel if you stay for several days,teslamotors,cru8add,12,t5_2s3j5

4783878,0,t3_3gb75w,Sometimes but they discourage it if it is not in your best interest battery packs become personal after a while due to wear and tear and there is a big penalty for trading it in when it is not near the end of its life in the dollars per value calculation.  So basically not yet has any current owner in normal circumstances had this as a viable sensible option.  It is considered that this WILL be a common option in the future FOR the purpose of replacing an old endoflife battery pack and done as regular maintenance a rather expensive item but expected nevertheless but not as simply an upgrade thing in the middle of life.  Also there will be some much less common cases where a battery pack with decent life left in it will become less sufficient for a current owner in their new or extended circumstance and it becomes a better value option for them to upgrade early before their pack dies this is going to be probably most likely rare.  Currently even in this case its better for them in terms of  value speed of transaction resistance to transaction facilitation and ease of transaction to just trade the whole Tesla car in for another Tesla car that has the upgraded pack.This is the current thinking.  Newer battery technologies may behave different but no such change in behavior has been widely publicly predicted.  More likely than that I think is the marketplace getting better at predicting quality of used battery packs which would then be traded on the open market for better value than they currently are so that upgrades become less of a penalty and the case of it being a good value for someone whos circumstances have changed will be more common than it would be currently.  I dont know if it will ever eclipse just trading in your Tesla for another Tesla with a higher capacity pack.None of this upgrading the pack has even happened yet with only one exception so . of the market.  Tesla will let you upgrade but it is such a bad idea for everyone to do right now they basically kind of close the door on you when you ask unless you can yell through this figurative door that you actually have a valid value reason to do it in which case they will make it available to you at an insane cost.So the technical answer is yes but usually no.  The actual answer however is no but technically yes.  It has been done but it is not yet a proven repeated event.  It will become more common but it will always have to be weighed against trading in the whole car.,teslamotors,ctxjqic,2,t5_2s3j5

Mostly technological differences like parking sensors seeing  bars instead of  or the cameras seeing the speed limit signs.  Maybe a little more noise from the new motor in the front.  But launchwise and spirited driving?!  There is a major noticeable difference.  Did you ensure insane mode was turned on during your test drive?  Did you push the accelerator down as quickly as possible during your test drive from a stop while in insane mode?  If you gradually push down on the accelerator youre NOT going to notice the difference.

Over the life of the car thats  in gas at your prices  per  km.My electricity prices are significantly lower than yours EV plan with electricity also locked in with solar panels on roof. I get  Whmile or  Whkm and maybe . per kWh so  worth of electricity. So over the life of the car thats savings of . At your electricity prices thats definitely different though.But I dont see why you shouldnt factor fuel prices into affording a car or not. It is definitely rolling the dice as you say but you can at least come up with a reasonable range that you guess what the price of gasoline will be over the life of the car. If you buy a  Honda Civic over  miles you will absolutely spend a significant amount of gas.

5157689,0,t3_3llhyq,gt The cost of the Powerwall  kWh battery is . centskWh under daily cycling. This price is lower than the cost of electricity from the grid in many parts of the world.This is just the levelized cost of the battery itself not the cost of the energy being stored in it. If a homeowner installed the Powerwall by itself without having solar on the roof they would have to be on a timeofuse rate plan with a differential of at least . cents between the nighttime offpeak rate and the daytime onpeak rate.Given that this is highly unlikely a more reasonable scenario would be to pair solar and storage. For tax incentive and interconnection reasons you have to charge the battery almost entirely from the solar system and cant discharge the battery to the grid. Again the levelized cost of solar power needs to be at least . cents below the daily onpeak rate. Where home storage makes the most sense right now is in places like Hawaii with very expensive  centskWh grid power and lots of solar. This means that the peak timeofuse rate is in the evening so daytime solar production should be saved for later in the day. It also means that the utility is on the verge of eliminating or sharply reducing the net metering tariff so people with solar systems will no longer get paid the retail price of electricity to export power. California is headed in that direction too. Also the  figure you used is just the wholesale price of the battery itself. The actual cost after adding an inverter wiring and laborprofits for the installer is probably something like .,teslamotors,cv7oznr,1,t5_2s3j5

The middle seat and outboard seat moved at the same time but it may have been that the operator toggled both seat buttons.Ideally we could have all three seats in the second row and fold down the third row for storage but your solution would work too but theres no middle seat in the third row.  Third row car seat installation would probably be best on the drivers side so you can move the second row passenger seat forward for access and sit in the third row passenger seat to strap in the baby on the third row driverside.

5423680,0,t1_cw4jk4m,LIDAR is a great technology its provides more precision then video so it takes much less software and processing to understand the immediate area. Its down side is two fold its not really the kind of tech that you can seamless integrate into the cars body and its has issues in weather as water reflects LIDAR just as well as solid objects.Cameras with very advance video processing to back them up can be a just as effective but it takes some very advance software. Special cameras that take more than the standard view ultraviolet infrared or low light can also be used to provide more information than available to a human driver. So yes Musk is right cameras can do the same job and possible provide a better solution but programming would be much more complex and therefore more susceptible to software bugs. Which is why Google was able to produce a working autonomous car very early in the industry but they cant yet go full scale as their system isnt weather proof. Now the Google guys are very smart so they figure out a way to make LIDAR work in an all weather situation but I know Teslas camera system will eventually get there once they perfect the system. Which is why they are collecting all this data with the autopilot system so they have real world data to finish building a software package that can not only see the road the surround area but understand what it sees.,teslamotors,cw4xjkz,7,t5_2s3j5

5491105,0,t1_cwdch3w,Spent some time sightseeing yesterday visited Badlands national park Mount Rushmore and the town of Custer SD which apparently is the sight of a Tesla rally so there are HPWCs all over the place!Spent the night in Wyoming after a scary nighttime drive in which I almost hit a few deer.Just got back from Devils Tower and am charging at the Gillette WY Supercharger.South Dakota and Wyoming are teaching me the impact of wind on my range. On long stretches westbound on I I noticed high power consumption over  Whmi despite relatively flat ground. Using my weather underground app I saw I had a  mph headwind.Speed limits are sometimes as high as mph but I dont really like Autopiloting at that speed range losses notwithstanding.Heading down to the Lusk WY charger after this... mostly noninterstate so well see how much use I get out of Autopilot.

5543360,0,t1_cwk69dm,It is a radically different approach because no one else is doing it. Of course Google has their research cars connected but the number of cars is absolutely tiny compared to what Tesla has going on. Google may have simulated cars but using real cars is radically different form using simulated cars. Also those Googles cars are operating in under preselected driving conditions not whenever someone wants to drive somewhere. On top of that Google has to spend millions of dollars doing that testing while Tesla collects the data for free from paying customers. That means that Teslas development path is much cheaper.But all of this is kind of missing the point. The author of this article is saying that Tesla can not possibly arrive at a selfdriving car with their method of development. Thats almost certainly not true. As the autopilot gets better and Tesla is more confident in its ability to handle different road conditions they can increase the effectiveness of the autopilot. Realistically they could implement point to point now as long as the could count on the driver to be ready to take over at a moments notice which they cant. As far as all of the fancy it can tell a rock from a road cone kind of stuff thats nice but it may be totally unnecessary to having a selfdriving car. You probably dont want it to hit anything in the road. For one thing obstacles that appear to be harmless could be concealing real dangers. For another thing image recognition is not good enough to select these things correctly . of the time. But suppose Tesla looks at the data and concludes that they do need this capability. They might have to improve the cars sensors or computing hardware and software but they could add these improvements incrementally. The idea that they wouldnt be able to is frankly absurd. So there is a huge benefit to the fact that Tesla only has to develop necessary technologies as they go along while Google has to have it all working right out of the gate. They have to make guesses about what will be necessary while Tesla only has to develop technology that they know is necessary.Think of it like SpaceXs rocket landing program. SpaceX is launching rockets with landing hardware in order to flight test them and work out the bugs. The rockets are paid for so the research is much less expensive. The stages they are landing were going to be destroyed anyway. Compare that to the Space Shuttle where they did a topdown design and everything had to work from the very start. By the time the realized the shuttle was more expensive to operate than an expendable launcher theyd already sunk billions of dollars into it. On the other hand if SpaceX ultimately finds their reusable rockets arent cost effective they still have a good launch platform and they havent lost much.I guess what Im trying to say is Tesla sells cars with an autopilot today. Even if it never goes beyond that they still have a good business model. On the other hand if Google cant get their robotic cars to work theyre out quite a lot of money had have nothing to show for it. If it were my money I would rather do it the way Tesla is doing it.,teslamotors,cwk7dz0,1,t5_2s3j5

5780640,0,t1_cxdjzez,Then these lowspeed sound alerts need to be added to modern ICE cars as well because theyre really quiet at low speeds. Near my parents house in London the noise from a busy main road near a smaller suburbantype road always drowns out the noise of a car approaching at low speeds on the smaller road which you cant always get a clear view of because cars are parked on the sides of the road. As long as these noises arent disturbing the neighbourhood at night Id be fine with them. But to be honest having lived in a city Im much more inclined towards accepting anything that means less noise. Maybe cars could automatically emit a low pitched doublebeep if it detects a pedestrian instead of having a nonstop noise every time the car slows down. I feel like this will just increase noise pollution where it wasnt there before i.e cars at low speeds.,teslamotors,cxdn5ok,2,t5_2s3j5

They do take up much less space than  kW of solar though.Then there is battery storage.

6018089,0,t1_cy825b9,I have a few problems with your approach to the situation. First I dont understand the need to think everyone is stupid. We should act like Elon and expect people to be intelligent and hold them to a high standard. Expecting everyone to be the lowest common denominator and dumbing everything down for the common folks will ruin society.Second I get the impression that you havent used or tried autopilot. Its not perfect its can be like a skittish teenager. But sometimes like on the freeway or in stop and go traffic it works amazingly. Its not meant really to be a full on replacement at the moment but it relieves a large cognitive load and allows you to relax or carry on a conversation. When its good its really good. Please dont tear something down that you havent tried.Third try to understand how the system works. It has cameras and some sensors but it really relies on optical recognition of the surroundings. If its a white out obviously the computer is not going to be able to see the road or the lane markings.Humans can do great things but not with a naysaying attitude.

I know some dealership contracts have exclusive rights to perform vehicle updates but that doesnt mean that all contracts have to preclude OTAs.Supercharging points are not supercharging locations. There are only like  locations in the US. Now a location might have  chargers. It might have  but almost all of them are out in the boonies. Theyre for road trips. SDCs are going to need urban infrastructure eventually. I just figure that eventually Tesla will transition over to a car service instead of a car sales company since that will be the most ecofriendly way to run the business so opening dealerships today would give them brownie points with the establishment in the short term while allowing them to get a head start on putting in some urban infrastructure that will be crucial in the future. ,teslamotors,cz40krb,0,t5_2s3j5

Its late after all. When is the  going to ship? The X was very late so presumably the  could slip until costs become workable. And will the gigafactory scale actually drive down cell costs the way Tesla hopes? All three of those are major question marks joined at the hip. Tesla may not making it to shipping the  if they dont get costs under control and the  takes  more years or if demand for the S drops off or the X rampup takes longer than expected. The alternative is they set a realistic price for what can be built in a marketreasonable ship window  say  months at the very outside. And they have to price the car appropriately which is not based on those wishfulthinking drivetrain costs.If they take  months to ship theyll be competing in the yes this is a cheap car but I want to help the environment market the Bolt and the other EVs are targeting and GM can be a whole lot more aggressive about its entry into the market than Tesla for the same reason they can justify a pervehicle loss on the Volt.  In that case they need to come in with a lowluxury market vehicle to compete with BMW and Audi not things like a Prius or Bolt.  And that will cost more. Edit I should add if I was a betting man Id bet they come out with an early adopter version that is kish and they use demand on it to fill the pipeline until battery packs drop enough.

Part of the resistance may have to do with just being resistant to something they dont feel intuitively yet I know I dig my heels in when someone tries to force an idea onto me I dont quite believe in an aggressive manner but if the data looks good I reflect on it and more often than not will change my mind to match whichever data I feel is more accurate.Itd be really interesting to have a generated survey plumbing the psycherational for the resistance or skepticism Im not necessarily against skepticism Im a big fan actually.Im guessing some folks find Elon hagiography offputting.Others are defending ICE companies due to familialkindredfondness esp. if theyre getting thrown under bus hardcore.When the right framing is used the roundingerror arg can be good perspective check but often its used as a blunt or unthinkingcantankerous instrument.For instance my arg. was WRT to profit.  But WRT to total fleet penetration on new sales or WRT to total existing road fleet the rounding error arg has more weight but those are uninteresting and obvious and it can come off as just getting cheap points or pseudotrolling.

They knew the plan and knew it was superior to their current plan for developing autonomy.It is brilliant.By  Tesla will have over  vehicles on the road and nearly every inch of every road will be trained.I remember many Model S owners talking about how on local roads the autopilot was like a student driver at first and literally every day it got a little better. Within a month it was doing any road they drove on regularly perfectly.

7137822,0,t3_4day16,Id like to throw my  cents in here.  Im a newer owner of a PDL and have a mental deformity that makes my right foot approximately X heavier than my left so range anxiety was a HUGE thing for me.Prior to delivery I purchased  HPWCs and put one at my home and one at my office  miles away because Ill be damned if I get my car towed for being out of juice.Then I took delivery and took it on a road trip the next day.  The mapping w charging locations is very good and even incorporates the time you need at each charge point into the overall trip time.  But where it really fell into place for me was planning.  One of my hobbies is flying and as such am used to planning out fuel usage based on weather plus  minutes of reserves before every flight.  The penalties for being wrong in that scenario are much more extreme than having to call a mobile charger as Im sure you can imagine.  Once I started looking at extended trips in my MS just like I would in a Cessna  it all made perfect sense and my range anxiety disappeared.Of course I still keep her plugged in every chance I can but thats got to do with my lead foot and not the limitations of the car itself. ,teslamotors,d1phqz9,6,t5_2s3j5

The I have been waiting for this for a long time devil tells me to go buy a Model SX as soon as possible.My  year energy plan for our family  EVs and a solar system for our home.My plan to get there Keep my Model  reservations. Likely buy a used Nissan Leaf for the interim and potentially longer term. Research budget and install a home solar system that will fill our home power and car power needs. Pay down our mortgage as much as possible in that time. Closely monitor the Model S CPO at some point there will also be a Model X CPO inventory. When the Model  is ready to go I will decide which Tesla vehicle SX or  makes sense for our situation and commit.I have spreadsheets coming out my ears for this stuff. Total cost of ownership time value of money depreciation expected life of car predictions of family needs etc.  I find that I keep trying to gear those calculations to justify the outlay of K.  When that happens I take a break and reset by slapping myself.Lets extrapolate your numbers  over the last  months x  months to Model    saved.  Install a solar system for say  after tax credits incentives etc. and you have  left.Thats a great start for any vehicle you choose  years from now and the resulting monthly payment should be within your comfort level.Verdict hunker down and see how things develop.  EV progress is the next chapter in our fairy tale lives its not far.,teslamotors,d1sa1fe,3,t5_2s3j5
7162353,0,t1_d1s6yv2,I think almost all examples of accusing the media of having some set agenda are probably inaccurate. We are the largely the media now. The stories people want to see are the stories people see because theyre shared by people. If they have an agenda its only to make money same as any other endeavor. Theres not some vast media conspiracy against the establishment that lets Trump get twice the airtime hes just good for ratings because people love a train wreck. See number one. In this case this is simply an example of hearing from both sides. A approach that is so firmly planted into the medias heads that they cant consider it a fair piece about the Holocaust without giving equal timeparagraphs to some nutjob who thinks Abraham Lincoln faked the whole thing. The problem of course is that there isnt always  sides to the story and while you can say this is a principal where their heart is in the right place it can cause issues. For example the american public being semi justified in thinking that Climate change is an open debate with numbers on both sides because all they ever see it presented as is Host Scientist and Denial Guy on equal footing.  The media implies there even is a the there which there isnt. Theyre not some singular being.,teslamotors,d1sah7g,3,t5_2s3j5

7164291,0,t1_d1sewol,Thanks for the tips.I did some reading online today and found quite a bunch of chargers in my city. Almost all of them are V A though so its gonna take a while to charge but some of those are free like at IKEA. There are also one or two Chademo chargers at kW and a couple in other places that have  kW. So its not all bad.gt You can ask your complexproperty about their plans to add stations thereMy building doesnt have any parking at all instead were assigned spaces in the neighboring parking garage owned by the city. In that garage there are two outlets actually but youre only allowed to stand there while charging. The city has a newer parking garage in another place that actually has rented spaces where you can leave your car plugged in! Which is exactly what I want. So I requested that they add that to my assigned parking garage. Lets hope more of that happens in the coming  years.BTW Im in Sweden so I dont expect getting the Model  until at least  years from now. I could have moved by then the charging infrastructure could have improved. Im gonna chill out for now since it doesnt look as bad as I initially thought. ,teslamotors,d1sif59,1,t5_2s3j5

I wonder how much longer they are going to stick with claiming that hydrogen is the future. I understand the Japanese government is subsidizing this tech so possibly they will keep the program going for a long time maybe even to the point of rolling it out as a mostly Japanonly thing. Too deeply involved now to drop it entirely and admit they made a big mistake. But if they dont start investing seriously in EVs in the next few years Id be extremely alarmed if I was a shareholder. Regardless of the time scale for Tesla Nissan GM Ford etc. to really start replacing most ICE sales with EV sales the further behind Toyota gets the more it will cost them.

One day a seismic activated the volcano and just like you would shake a coke bottle all the CO evacuated all in one shot in the atmosphere. Due to atmospherical physics the massive CO cloud came running down the side of the volcano and finally hit the small village. Everyone in the village died within minutes due to the CO wave that had replaced all the surrounding air. CO is deadly.Talking about CO this one is just as deadly but you get a better death.

7424261,0,t3_4gzhlf,I share this concern.Tesla is by far the most interesting forward thinking audacious car company I can think of and Ive been following them with great interest for years. I got in line early and had my Model  reservation placed within  minutes of the Chicago store opening and Im impatiently excited to receive mine when the time comes. That being said given the production issues and quirks riddling both the model S amp X even at such small production numbers Im sad to admit that Im a little terrified of what this could mean when Tesla is cranking out a cheaper vehicle in much higher numbers to attempt meeting demand. Its not that I think theyd ignore production issues its that I share a concern of them literally being unable to keep up with customer service issues due to higher demand and production.For little things like squeaks creaks rattles amp problematic doors glovebox or otherwise what does the company do to alleviate those concerns for you? Obviously its a quality control issue so Im wondering if theyre willing to address these things. If not it worries me even more.,teslamotors,d2m392l,38,t5_2s3j5

At that point it seems as if the dealership model would be no better or worse for Tesla than it is for anyone else. Tesla certainly shouldnt be allowed work under different constraints forever given that these differences would eventually result in an unfair advantage.

Its essentially saying you are more likely to survive an accident when you are driving in the direction of stopped traffic VS a head on freaking collision. WELL DUH. I dont need a PhD to tell you that. The number that SHOULD stand out to everyone is that  in  accidents happen while lane splitting.

7490803,0,t1_d2tlryi,Honestly I could see that in the future but for now the supercharger network is a huge boon for Tesla.  Many people here event state as much Why buy a Tesla? most folks will respond with the current supercharger infrastructure as a prime example of why.  If you start to add the adapters to the end of the cables then you have less reason to buy a Tesla and more reason to buy any EV which currently doesnt help Tesla.I would expect Tesla to be able to A Open up the network with adapter dongles over time.  B Work with other manufacturers to bring their cars into the fold by either supplying them with a dongle or having them use the Tesla cables.Eitherway I view this as a sort of supply and demand issue.  If the charging network supply was vast for all EV manufacturers then any vendor could skirt costs by just having someone else build the infrastructure.  By making it semi proprietary you get to keep your edge and keep demand for you product up.Within about  years though I could see Tesla opening up their superchargers to work with other EVs as their infrastructure become the proverbial go to place.,teslamotors,d2tnwif,2,t5_2s3j5

The secondary market is just shares traded between investors so the company doesnt see a dime on that. The only way they would gain more capital is if they decide to issue new shares but I dont see that happening for two reasons. For one thing they just issued new shares in August of  and for another it would dilute the current shares outstanding which isnt usually a great thing. At least it wouldnt be in this case.

7640503,0,t3_4jymfr,Its a lot of sensors and multiple motorized hinges. And if any one of them doesnt do its job right fails or just erroneously detects an obstacle it stops working right. Furthermore it gets used every time you get in the car at least the front drivers door does so a door that works  of the time would drive you half crazy. In no other car do you have to deal with doors that dont work especially in the  price range. Doors are typically the simplest thing on the car. You get in. You get out. Tesla has challenged that with the Model S motorized handles which have been redesigned as recently as  and now the selfopening and FWD on the Model X. The reason it makes sense to do cool things with the doors is that its a feature every owner and passenger will interact with multiple times. Its distinctly different and it creates a sense of high tech. The down side is that all that articulation is complicated and hard to make  right  of the time. And for something as simple as a door thats extremely irritating. ,teslamotors,d3aolai,24,t5_2s3j5

You could even raise the charge the longer you sit.  They know the models and presumptively know the charge level of the car.  Maybe if the car reaches greater than  charge at the Supercharger you enter into premium charging cost and if the car is sitting somehow at  super premium charging cost.  And you can be smart about this too because the only time this matters is if the stalls are full.

So if a SUV rolls over on its roof it needs to be tougher in order to be similarly resilient as a sedan or hatchback. But all that doesnt negate the higher COV. Besides a higher probability to rollover a higher COV also increases the number of times you will rollover.

The best reason for that would be discouraging use. No one is going to supercharge for shits and grins. The absolute last thing anyone would do in a payperuse situation is top off a daily commuteWhy would a day pass makes this better? At best a day pass and pay per use are interchangeable concepts and at worst a day pass encourages overuse because you have the same all you can eat better eat my days worth problem youre trying to avoid.What is it about a day pass that makes it magically only something that would be gotten on a road trip vs pay per use?The only thing I can think is youre thinking when people say pay per use they mean people would pay like  cents for the electricity they used. Thats not what it necessarily means though. It could be something like  to hook up and  an hour prorated. No one is going to pay that just to top off. People will almost certainly top off often if they spent  on a day pass though because they would want to get their moneys worth. The pay per use model I gave penalizes sitting. A day pass doesnt.

For instance if youre right in front of a wall and mash the accelerator unless the system doesnt even allow full throttle in front of an object there just isnt a physical way to stop the car in time.  for a time drivers are still the ones in charge.

Black paint has a better reflection after polishing and waxing than white paint. If it snowsrains a lot where you are at then you should also take that into concideration. It all kind of depends on how much time you have to keep the paint looking good. I say these things from experience. Ive been detailing cars now for a while and typically the owners never consider the amount of time it takes to maintain different colors. With a car as expensive and beautiful as the D youre going to want to keep the paint as undamaged as possible which means time.Sorry for rambling a bit. I would have formatted this better on my desktop.Tldr White paint is much easier to maintain than black but the darker the paint the more flash it has after a good detail.,teslamotors,d479xeb,2,t5_2s3j5

Stops are more frequent but most stops are still min because I stop at each Supercharger to maximize the rate of charge.

8150785,0,t1_d4wai0f,Before making judgement I believe the intersection in question needs to be better understood.  There are scenarios where it would be the semi drivers fault. They use the word perpendicular and pass under the tailor  for this accident. That makes it sound like the semi was making a left from an access road with a stop sign and the Tesla was going straight on a road without stop sign. If this was the scenario technically the semi must stop and proceed only when safe to do so. Since a car with right of way hit him it was not safe for him to proceed and therefore he would be at fault. Again the intersection and positions of each vehicle are extremely important to say who was at fault.EditSemi was making a left coming from the opposite direction. Still when making a left you must ensure it is safe to do so. ,teslamotors,d4we9c7,1,t5_2s3j5

8218825,0,t3_4rwz2w,gtAn autopilot whose sensors cannot distinguish between the side of a white truck and a bright skysimply is not ready to be deployed on public roads. Tesla should immediately disable theautopilot feature on all your vehicles until it can be proven to be safe. At a minimum autopilotmust be disabled until the complete results of NHTSAs investigation are released.Its not just this its also that the radar if I understand correctly tunes out if something looks like an overhead sign to avoid mistakenly braking. This is actually a safety precaution because if it autostopped based on one or the other there could be false positives.  False positives could lead to extreme braking on a highwayroad that could lead to accidents.gtYour customers arelulled into believing their car is safe to be left to do the driving itself.Only stupid customers that dont read the manual and ignore the warning every. single. time.  This is essentially their entire argument people get a false sense of safetysecurity and get lazy so the technology should be removed because of a few stupid people!.gtThe result of this disconnect between marketing hype and reality was the fatal crashin Florida as well as other nonfatal crashes that have now come to light.That was not the result.  The owner was fully aware of the limitations and had talked about them and posted about them many times.  He knew full well and decided to push the limit and not pay attention.  Thats on him.  Yes it is blaming.  Too bad.  Just like the other drivers where autopilot worked EXACTLY as described in the manual and updatesalerts.  Some of the other crashes we dont even know if AP was really even on at the time.gtIf autopilot is proven safe to deploy Tesla must assume liability for any crashes that occur whenthe feature is engaged. Both Volvo and Mercedes have said they will accept liability when theirselfdriving technology is responsible for a crash.No thats not how liability works in the law.  There could be full or partial liability among one or many defendants.  Did you notice the qualifier for VolvoMercedes?  Accept liability when selfdriving tech is responsible for the crash.  That is already the law arguably under products liability statutes.  And the owner would have the burden of proving the tech was responsible for the crash. In this case the selfdriving tech is NOT responsible due to its own limitations and the owner needing to pay attention at all times.  Volvo saidgt Volvos president and chief executive Hkan Samuelsson said the company would accept full liability whenever one if its cars is in autonomous mode.Volvo hasnt officially elaborated exactly what accept full liability means but we assume it involves who would be held accountable if a selfdriving car is involved in a crash the driver or the automaker. Google and MercedesBenz reportedly said they will accept full liability if their selfdriving vehicles cause a collision. Samuelsson also called out federal regulators for not taking charge to establish a framework for regulation and testing of autonomous vehicles. So do we have a definition for full liability and autonomous mode for the VolvoMB cars?  Does that mean the drivers assist features or they will ONLY take full liability when the cars are released with a real autonomous mode.  Right now the cars are only level  autonomy.  Do all levels count as autonomous mode or only when the cars are at ?  As a lawyer I can argue these definitions and responsibility of the tech and cause of the crash alllllll day.  You better believe that those companies insurance lawyers like me would argue in every single one of these cases that the tech was NOT primarily responsible nor the cause.  Or argue the drivers assist tech is NOT autonomous modeself driving by definition because it is not really acting independently.gtTesla is rushing selfdriving technologies to the highways prematurely however as the crashesdemonstrate autopilot isnt safe and you should disable it immediately. If autopilot canultimately be shown to meet safety standards and is then redeployed you must pledge to beliable if anything goes wrong when the selfdriving system is engaged.Well we better also take off the market driver assistance like cruise control active cruise control lane assist blind spot detection parking assist etc.  Those lead to a mistaken feeling of safety and there are crashesfender benders every month perhaps every day that include one or more of those.  Using their false sense of safety argument and responsibility and cause  you can extend those arguments pretty far.TLDR False assumptions on tech false assumptions on the multiple crashes false interpretation of the law false application of the law undefined statements to make other manufacturers seem better false analysis under current products and general liability statues... and overall a bit silly.Edit typos.,teslamotors,d54wqeb,14,t5_2s3j5

Being able to make the monthly payment I would say is if you scrape by or reduce the amount you are putting in long terms savingsinvestmentretirement to pay for the car you cant afford it. If the monthly payment simply comes out of your expendable monthly budget the budget you might set aside for fancy vacations or big luxury item purchases then you can afford it. However I can certainly understand the mindset of not spending money you dont have to. I have definitely been accused of being a penny pincher. While I am planning to buy a Model  with options bigger battery and autopilot and am currently saving for it I also think about how I can get a great ICE car like a top level Mazda  that will get me from A to B for probably  of the money. Sound financial advise says to buy the Mazda  but sound financial advise also says people dont need  foot camping trailers. TLDR  Everyones financial situation is different.

Theres been some really stupid owners taking their most advanced and immature technology far too seriously and blaming the company when things go wrong. But Tesla just pull the logs and walk away. You bet your ass the time they disable a car in spite it will be in the news. Youre being pretty paranoid if you expect Tesla to suddenly turn against a customer like that.

8785990,0,t3_50gdgd,As a Tesla fan these departures to FF are unsettling to be honest. Part of the reason is that FF is secretive about the fact theyre a Chineseowned company there seems to be something fishy about the way they present themselves.Some people say its vaporware thats definitely not true wishful thinking they are legit and probably the most dangerous competitor to Tesla. The big car makers are less dangerous because  they have different strengths and weaknesses so one can expect that there will be some market segment where Tesla would have an advantage and  theyre slower more resistant to change.But FF is very fast and a very direct competitor to Tesla. They have the same access to SV talent same market no legacy to slow them down. Plus they seem to have more money wouldnt be too surprised if the Chinese gov helped them a bit with that and have advantage in the huge China market more friendly regulators. You could say FF success is good the more competition the better means faster transition to EV. Maybe. But I also think its good if Tesla and Elon Musk makes money. Because they are known to spend it on pushing boundaries. In other words I prefer Elon Musk getting rich spending it on something new and innovative than Jia Yueting getting the money and spending it on... who knows what but so far he has made a Chinese version of Netflix and a Chinese version of Tesla.,teslamotors,d73x71y,11,t5_2s3j5

All the electric diehards make this argument that no one drives very far on a typical day which is true but is also missing the point of why people have cars in the first place. Its the freedom of being able to fuel up in  minutes and leave on your own whim. If you pay  for a car or  for a car you want to be able to use it like youve used every other car and that isnt yet the case for electric cars. What do you mean? Like Chevy Bolt? The BMW i?

8971093,0,t1_d7q0r6e,If she was stranded the first time how much charging time did she need to get to her destination?  That should be a measure of how much she really needed.  Hogging and locked to your charger for  hours means her car was already full for a couple of hours before she disconnected and she didnt care if others couldnt park there and needed a charge.  Shes totally taking advantage of you and you are paying for her inconsiderate and discourteous behavior out of your own pocket.  Freeforeverybody is only going to get worse for you as more Teslas hit the road and the cheaper Model  rolls out.  Theres always going to be someone trying to take advantage of your generosityfree at your expense.  I know because I help maintain a couple free Chargepoint stations at work and theres always a bad apple or two who dont behave finds some way to gameabuse the system and make it worse for the general community either by accident or just because theyre being selfish.  Being nice doesnt work setting hard rules they cant break do.  Therefore you need to make some hard changes.Unfortunately Teslas HPWCs are dumb in that theyre not programmable so its easy for Tesla owners to take advantage of.  Theyre like regular house plugs in that you just plug in and immediately get power but worse because the car locks onto the plug.  Smarter stations like Chargepoint let you see whos using it create a list of registered drivers who can use it ban specific drivers charge them an hourly rate or not charge them an insane hourly rate only after a certain number of hours to discourage abuse etc.  Unfortunately theyre not free and dont deliver as much power as an HPWC.  Sadly the only thing you can do with HPWCs is to lock it up the oldfashioned away either via some sort of physical lock blocking off the spot so they cant use the spot or turning the power off like some have suggested.  Hopefully Tesla will make a smart charger some day but I dont see that happening.Destination chargers should be first and foremost for your patrons.  If a Tesla is stranded thats their own fault for poor planning.  If youre afraid of someone being stranded they can come in and ask you nicely if the spot is available.  Charge them a reasonable fee if theyre not a patron so they know its not a freeforall.  A stranded motorist will gladly pay for the use.  If theyre stranded at night theyll just have to wait until the morning.  You need to draw a hard line to prevent this kind of abuse.,teslamotors,d7q6u53,3,t5_2s3j5

9022901,0,t1_d7tx3e6,Hrm.  I actually had wondered why he hadnt merged with Solarcity a long time ago.  A few related points Damodaran not saying at all that his words are sacrosanct btw just good point he brought up had mentioned WRT Tesla before in interview? that getting upset at early life stage companies for spending heavily including debt spending is like getting upset at children for behaving in immature manner its a natural outcome of high growth at lifestage. I had wondered about solar roofs well prior to their merger and why they werent one party yet Homes Cars often rank as high ticket items.  Solar roofing is just capturing fragment of that market. one benefit being siloing w pros amp cons pro semiprotected from each others messups neg more arms length dealing and each action ostensibly needs netpositive for shared action to take place whereas a combined entity could do pawn sacrifice types of moves where they can take one step back before going forward at cost to different business unit e.g. Solar or Tesla interchangeably .   Tesla was also protecting its primary position as power provider for SCTY.  If SCTY were to be bought by another party in bankruptcy e.g. that relationship would be threatened. This move is also to assure speedresponsiveness with fast growing PV market which is well on S curve ramp.  Akin to how how Elon noted the Gigafactory location was place not for cheapest price necessarily but had a critical requirement of speed or moreso of nodelays.  Tesla by virtue of being on aggressive leveragingtimeline is more sensitive to external party delays same reason why I presume they inhoused seat manufacturing.  Making sure SCTY is stable preserves NYC subsidies branding which is perhaps and shouldnt be surprising critically nontrivial IMO i.e. if capital raises based on high confidence is part plan in order to maintain expedience and Powerwall cell capacity spillover hedge for unit sales and any negative repercussion of any guaranteed cell volume contract between Tesla amp Panasonic. Its important to keep in mind alleged opportunism or any degree of selfdealing irrespective of presence is not necessarily a sign of badinvalid strategy.  Elon Musks earlier self purchase of shares in  or  as a personal buyback guarantee probably helped him lots of shares for him but at the same time lent critical confidence necessary for bankss to give good rates Tesla leases and public confidence in company that lead to one of its first few stock breakouts also combined w early govt. loan payment from private market which indirectly allowed Teslas faster pace of growth via leveraging equityampdebt funding raises.  SCTYs cash flow was artificially depressed due to misestimate of PV demand and overhiring sales and other overhead this year among other factors. the interest rate raises etc..  Their numbers look artificially bad if one ignores the tax credits from VIE Variable Interest Entities from the Tax Equity Investors see related   The story in a way is that Tesla is getting SCTY while the market is having an overreaction to short term pullback.   Itd be ironic and not too surprising if pullback was partialy due to Solar PV credit extension to  so people now felt less under the gun to install Solar PV early where it was to expire in .  But there is extreme gargantuan growth in PV market to capture stateside as we converge to cost parity rapidly in more and more US regions.  Theres distinct possibility status quo folks are in denial or oblivious to it IMO.  SCTY ostensibly now making available company cash flow friendly more loan based rather than PPA offerings and theoretically cutting down on redundant SGampA after merger should make things look better going forward if they should happen to merge. These kinds of risks come wElons ventures to some degree.  Kind of textbook highrisk highreward.  Its far from being a nice? see  dividend stock not that Im casting aspersions in any way on your investments or implying thats what you were searching for.  Im just noted Tesla is isnt high predictability... although if they have any of the tenacity ruthlessness UX focus of Nvidia Amazon Apple respectively its auspicious to me at least.,teslamotors,d7wetob,1,t5_2s3j5

He said he was going to put a sleeping bag on the production line to get it done but now we find out they havent even filed the appropriate permits to expand the paint shop??Let alone my point about takt times... car per minute is real. A lot of manufacturers take longer. No way to get to k on  line without cutting takt times to  seconds which is unheard of and likely impossible.Now could Tesla produce k cars in ? Maybe. But again the article suggests there are structural and legal problems with this timeline too.Ive seen people asking if they should put their life savings into Tesla stock on this very thread. Thats frightening. Theyre doing it because they dont see Musk for what he is  a marketing genius who knows how to get away with bending the truth.For their sake  and the sake of all of Teslas employees  I hope articles like this one from Nerdermeyer help teach the public that Musks statements cant and shouldnt be taken at face value.

Honestly it doesnt matter what it actually does but the fact that you know is HUGE! For instance you can never guess what a human is going to do and each human will do something different but once you know exactly what a vehicle will do in a situation everything can be designed around that.For example we know trains wont stop for people cars etc. So we build our infrastructure so that hopefully most roads go over or under tracks.

But we live in a world where healthcare resources are spread thin.I doubt any emergency physicians would be on the phone while someones en route to the hospital.....they are dealing with patients physically in their ER. Also prepping the room is completely dependent on how sick the patient is. We need someone with experience to physically assess them and take a good accurate noneexaggerated history currently paramedics or doctors if they are in a different hospital being transferred. Since we are talking about hypothetical future scenarios we can hope to have some sort of blood pressure cuff with a pulse ox that records vitals? Devices like that would be a small  of the cost of a Tesla. People who arent in healthcare have an enormous variety in experience so it would be tough to rely on someones self taken vitals. If I walked  people through taking vitals right now I bet  would take them accurately. There is also the whole legality issues associated with directing peoplegiving them medical advice en route to the hospital at least in the US. And there are a variety of scenarios where autodriving cars should be hurrying people to the hospital. But how hypothetical are we being? I think we will still depend on ambulances with paramedics to stabilize people en route. Sorry for the downer response just being realistic from experience in healthcare.

Owning a gun isnt always about shooting the gun. Sometimes all you need to do is show it or shoot some warning shots. In facts you can take your pick of studies but they show that on average guns stop anywhere from k.million crimes a year. Obviously the VAST majority of these end up with NO one being shot and killed. So lets make our facts in line with the reality shall we? Edit some proof of this outside of  studies from  and  showing what I said is true that can be found online. Heres a CDC study  stating gtThe CDCs findings  that guns are an effective and often used crime deterrent and that most firearm incidents are not fatal  could affect the future of gun violence research..But that was done a progun politician! Wrong was done by Obama. gtmore likely to die.This is a load of crock shit quite honestly. Yes owning a weapon has a chance of being misused and turning deadly in the same way owning a pool has a chance of someone drowning. Its like saying owning a pool increases your chance of death by drowning!!! No one should ever own a pool!!! Its total nonsense.  Owning a gun is worth far more than how many times you shot someone in self defense. Its about the fact that its there if its ever needed or need to be shown as weve seen above. gtstark improvement in quality of life when police dont have to be armed.Care to dive in anymore to explain? Because that doesnt make any sense. Quality of life is about housing food education etc. Unless you are meaning public and police relations.

People who commit suicides with a gun isnt gun violence. Its the person. So really you are looking at k people per year who die due to gun violence. On top of that all those regulations you mentioned about the swimming pool especially the building requirements isnt so much to do with safety but with land management and other factors. Youre not required to put a cover over the pool when its closed you do it so stuff doesnt fall in the pool like limbs and leaves and other garbage. gtI have to have warning sign on the stepsWell first time Ive heard of that I sure as heck didnt nor did I need a privacy fence. The only thing the permit was for was to make sure I could build there.As far as the cars argument there are some good regulations as you mentioned with the crumple zones airbags etc. However requiring someone to wear a seat belt not so much. Anyone with a brain would wear one. gtUsed to be legal to drive drunk.Nah its called reckless driving. I still think thats how it should be. If youre recklessy driving drunk or not you need to get off the road. No need for another charge on top of that. gtPlease tell me exactly how private firearm ownership does anthing to deter this undefined tyranny that you speak of?Ok easy look at the Bundy Ranch ordeal. Now before you BUT HE WAS ILLEGALLY GRAZINGINGANFNDKFN!! We dont know that because it was still being muled over in court. But that isnt the point. You know what is the point? They took his cattle and started killing them. Now what happened when they illegally took his cattle instead of just getting it off theirstate land land? Well a bunch of militias showed up and got those cattle back and the BLM had to stand down. They tried to coup everyone up in little first amendment free speech zones nope guns came in and saved the day. The guy got his cattle back and they are going to court like its supposed to have been doing. gtOur rights have been heavily encroached over the past  years or so... by the time small weapons matter there wont be a government to fight against.So you said a lot of stuff here yes I agree our rights have been taken away. Are you suggesting we should just give up all of our rights because we have lost them? And by the time small weapons matter.. dear lawd man I can tell youve never shot a gun a day in your life. Or at least learned any history of guerrilla warfare. Yes small arms in large enough groups will have a significant impact against any military in the world. Especially people who know the land know how to shoot and are decently educated. Most are even past law enforcement and ex military. So its not as abysmal as Europeans might think it would be. gtI also find it ironic that the NRA is endorsing the closest thing to an actual tyrannical dictator the US has ever seen.Im not a NRA supporter first off. Secondly yes I find it ironic they are endorsing a candidate that would take away arms without due processno fly list. As far as ever seen... Nah weve had presidents who wielded far more power and done far more than Trump ever can. Andrew Jackson and trail of tears you had Woodrow Wilson that basically abolished the constitution you had FDR put japanese in interment camps. Just stop with the hyperbole haha. Trump is bad I know and Im not voting for him. Ill probably vote for Hillary even though she should be put in jail. gtin fact Amerians are  times more likely to be killed by a firearm than you are in the rest of the developed world.So thats including suicides even if you dont include we are still statisitically higher but again when controlled for gang related shootings we drop down very low to only k deaths per year.  million gun owners to k per year that are mainly by people who are close to you? Ill take it. You know why? Because if the average person in the US is walking down a normal street not in the ghetto their chance of being shot is on par with every other nation on earth. Thats pretty cool ey? We have a right to own guns and just as safe as anywhere in the world when only accounting for fire arm deaths. gtIf you look at the numbers with any sense of integrityIve broken it down countless times.

9524406,0,t1_d9mtab2,It isnt just this.  The Tesla electric motor is extremely compact for its power output.  Hard driving pushes it beyond the point of effective thermal manageability.  The fact that it can safely produce a certain amount of power does not mean that it can do so in a sustained fashion.This is much like WEP in older military aircraft.  WEP basically allowed the engines to be pushed beyond rated power.  This was done by removing certain loads loosening governors for higher RPM allowance increasing throttle watermethanol or other chemical injection or any combination of those or other items.  This could give a substantial increase sometimes  or more in power in a life  death or escape situation.  It was of course at the expense of overall engine lifetime and the risk of catastrophic engine failure.The reason this can be done on a regular basis with electronics and electric motors is that the thermal cycles are a lot shorter.  The motor heats up quickly and then cools down quickly when the loading is reduced.  As long as temperature doesnt pass certain points which the system does not allow there is no damage so it can be done over and over without cumulative effect.,teslamotors,d9n325a,1,t5_2s3j5

I personally will never get unimpressed by its acceleration and parking abilities.Not a day goes by that I get in my car and I dont marvel at the technological wonder in which Im travelling.  I dont have autopilot or even parking sensors and the car is still amazing.gt Is anyone worried about being hit with battery expenses after the warranty is up?Its somewhat of a concern.  It depends on what the price of a battery repairupgrade is estimated to be at that time.  It may be cheaper or about the same to buy a newer preowned vehicle which I will strongly consider doing.gt Should I do it?If youre counting on using it on the Tesla network to reduce your cost of ownership Id think about the reality of that proposition.

And end of Q  just so they actually take delivery not postpone it. But you are ignoring the fact that its not a promotion but a price hike so it does not matter when it starts or ends the bottom line is you had a free a few years a go they charged k for free charging then they decided to just raise the price of the base model and call it free so actually if you think about it they are double charging for free charging feature that now will cost money but you are calling it a promotion its exactly the opposite of promotion.,teslamotors,da4rlck,1,t5_2s3j5
9668844,0,t1_da4vq9y,Not going to happen for a car simply accelerating fast.  You generally need spinning tires or side to side movement demonstrating loss of control to get anything like that.Tesla has traction control it isnt sliding.  There is no reason ludicrous mode isnt perfectly safe as long as you stop at the speed limit.gtIts irresponsible to accelerate too rapidly in congested areas where you cant reasonably assure nothing will pull out in front of you.That can happen at any speed or any rate of acceleration.  But guess what?  Accelerating to mph means I am going slower than mph at all points in time until I reach mph.  So everyone who catches the green light and didnt have to stop is going faster than me and would have a higher tendency to pop out of nowhere to a pedestrian not paying attention due to their faster legal speed.That is the beauty of facts if you cross a point where a pedestrian is at while going mph on your way up to mph that pedestrian has more time to react to you vs the car going mph already because the light didnt stop them.,teslamotors,da4vyjb,1,t5_2s3j5

You dont want those components flexing at all if you can help it. You want all deflection to happen in the designed way and managed by the springs and struts. Even if we assume that chassis and suspension components flexed by some amount under load increasing camber would not mitigate any of the issues resulting from that.

The Times ignored it. Trump denounced it and last year in a tweet he called Hurt a dummy dope who wrote a failed book.gt gt The part of the book that caused the most controversy concerns Trumps divorce from his first wife Ivana. Hurt obtained a copy of her sworn divorce deposition from  in which she stated that the previous year her husband had raped her in a fit of rage. In Hurts account Trump was furious that a scalp reduction operation hed undergone to eliminate a bald spot had been unexpectedly painful. Ivana had recommended the plastic surgeon. In retaliation Hurt wrote Trump yanked out a handful of his wifes hair and then forced himself on her sexually. Afterward according to the book she spent the night locked in a bedroom crying in the morning Trump asked her with menacing casualness Does it hurt? Trump has denied both the rape allegation and the suggestion that he had a scalpreduction procedure. Hurt said that the incident which is detailed in Ivanas deposition was confirmed by two of her friends.gt gt Hurt held on to his copy of Ivanas sealed deposition for years. It was sworn testimony he said. But eventually when he was cleaning house during his own divorce he said I threw it all out. He went on The larger tragedy is that Trump might be elected President of the United States. I never imagined in my wildest nightmares that it would come to this.gt gt Before Hurts book came out Trumps lawyers pressured the publisher W. W. Norton to paste a clarifying statement from Ivana into the flyleaf of every copy. In it she confirmed that she had said in a deposition that her husband had raped her but added that she did not want those words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense. She also said As a woman I felt violated.

Only Tesla can negotiate or demand improvements for that location as well as for any other SuC station.Making that matter public is not really about complaining and speculation but creating awareness because chances are better that Tesla will react if its not just a single Tesla owner sending an email to Tesla support.

10027083,0,t1_dbdvcnz,Why do you believe EV costs will continue to come down?First lets agree that the major cost of an EV is the battery pack  everything else is a shared component with an ICE car andor some other vehicle in the world.  Aluminum body panels suspension parts electric windows switches touch screens...if the cost of these items will fall all car costs will fall right along with them.Maybe Tesla can save money on their electric motors but that strains the imagination...electric motors are pervasive. I highly doubt that there cost savings measured in orders of magnitude to be had. Same goes for D camera systems software etc. Im sure they can save a few thousand here and there but were not talking tens of thousands of dollars.As for the battery pack Teslas own projections are to get the cost down to about what GM is making Bolt battery packs for maybe a bit less. kWh is what GM is allegedly paying  how much lower can Tesla get? kWh as GreenCarReports said earlier this year? kWh?And even if they get to  per kWh then what? On a kWh battery pack the cost is . At kWh the cost is ...only k in savings. is great but its not going to make a k Model S into a k car.My point Whatever cost cuts there may be I dont know why everyone assumes theyre going to be dramatic...its not as if battery packs are going to become free or theres some great leap forward in reducing costs for electric motors.Teslas Model  is priced at about the same amount as Chevys Bolt and Nissans Leaf. The Bolt and the Leaf are relatively bare bones they use parts from existing platforms to cut costs and theyre produced by global automakers that can get the best price on everything.

10116465,0,t3_5krdre,I test drove both and ended up ordering the D. It felt more connected to the road and all around more refined to me. I didnt notice much of a difference in terms of performance though. Have you test driven both versions? If not you should set up a test drive and drive the D and nonD back to back and see which one feels better to you. Its all a matter of personal preference. It seems like you understand the technical differences but you wont truly know if the D is worth the price to you until you drive both. So far Im loving the D. The car can accelerate out of turns beautifully and it has tons of grip. There is a small amount of motor whine from the front motor but I kinda like it. It sounds like a spaceship.I live in Arizona but I have family in Colorado that we visit some winters. That also influenced my decision to get the D. Last time we visited we took my Honda Fit.

10176407,0,t3_5lohho,I hate to be the bearer of bad news but according to the numbers Tesla has released in their financials regarding reservation money suggest significantly more than k reservations. It seems closer to k reservations after subtracting out estimated pending S and X orders. If this is true and Tesla ramps up to the full k a year production k is quoted when including S and X starting July st a new order would be completed at the end of  at the earliest. Realistically knowing theres a ramp up to full production volume and Tesla is notorious for delays  is a much safer bet.All this being said placing a reservation now is pretty low risk. If something comes up you can always cancel it. The opportunity cost of otherwise investing the thousand dollars would at best be  over two years  interest rate.Im also pretty optimistic myself about Tesla delivering on time. I think theyll manage to get all prereveal orders out by the end of this year if not all the day one orders. This puts them only one quarter behind the immediate full production scenario described above. EDIT Fixing cost numbers to use  instead of .,teslamotors,dbxjvly,10,t5_2s3j5

Unions are not definitively bad or good.  Workers deserve the right to collectively bargain as defined in the National Labor Relations Act of .

The fact that theyre single source and cant scale is the main issue.As far as I can tell they have no plans to have separate sites for making parts.

10888827,0,t3_5viqis,Call Summary Notes that drag on way too long Jason Wheeler to leave Tesla in April to pursue public policy Deepak Ahuja will return as CFO Adam Jonas asks about Elons balance of time between Tesla and SpaceX Elon plans to stay with Tesla until hes kicked out. Potentially accelerated Mars mission thanks to Trump administration will not change his balance of time between companies. Adam Jonas asks about Tesla offering insurance due to massively increased safety and John McNeill says they are piloting that program in Asia. Elon thinks insurance providers will do a good job adjusting appropriately thanks to safety improvements Elon talks about Model  production simplicity compared to S and X  screen vs  screens .km of wiring vs km no selfpresenting door handles better suppliers compared to S and X and general amount of increased automation.  Also touched on Model  components produced at Gigafactory did he say power electronics and chargers? and significant engineering resources put into the factory rather than the car itself. Elon touches on how production is only as fast as the slowest component so over time they are minimizing issues with these problematic suppliers. Elon bemoans being a public company because a small delay can significantly affect a single quarter. re less than expected revenue from AutopilotElon says there were challenges in transition from MobileEye to internal. They originally wanted to have both running at the same time but MobileEye refused to cooperate in that manner. They had to cross the Rubicon with Tesla Vision. Safety is their primary concern could have released high speed  months ago but want exhaustive testing process. Might get to mph next month. Jason touches on increased effort for solar sales vs leasing reduced customer acquisition costs on solar nothing really specific here Is the lack of second half numbers on S and X in the second half due to potential disruption from Model ? JB says effectively says no not really. Its just a matter of when the s curve happens. Any word on when configuration for Model  might open? Elon ignored this because hes pissed about Unions hot take by me. Unionization? Elon says there is a strong effort by the UAW. Elon will be posting blog update in the next day or two Elon time he wants to get it right. Injury rate is less than half of industry average. Including stock options compensation is by far the highest in the industry. He says there are only disadvantages to UAW and doesnt find it likely to occur. Elon mentions how environmental regulations and subsidies have only come up briefly but his response is that hes OK with removing subsidies if its done across the board for fossil fuels. Administration did not give a response to that input. Elon says if incentives disappeared tomorrow Tesla would have a competitive advantage. Touches on how ZEV credits are effectively worth x to Chevy compared to Tesla because Tesla sells so many EVs. Thinks its ironic that getting rid of it would help Tesla. Decline is deposits on balance sheet was from Signature Model X that had yet to be delivered. Jason says they are still in great shape on Model . Elon says they are still antiselling Model  and Jason? says they dont want to make the line longer. Model  will not be profitable on Day  early Model  will be horrible negative margins on Day . As they get closer to week Elon expects gross margins close to S and X. Elon feels preeetty not really confident that Tesla will reach week by the end of the year. Elon throws shade at US Intelligence agencies about not being able to keep secrets when talking about suppliers. Harps on suppliers being able to deliver but also admits he is sometimes too optimistic. Some number of people will always be late all it takes is  and Tesla has to make those parts manually at great cost or slow down the production rate. Great cost could be x x x more. Parts need delivered parts need built into cars and cars need deliveredall of that goes into that goal of week According to financial plan no capital raise needed for Model  but its really close to the edge. Elon says thats probably not the best thing for shareholders so it makes sense to raise capital to reduce risk. Did not give a timeline for potential capital raise. From the very beginning of Model  costing was front and center and key of every discussion. Part by part basis looking at physical commodities in that part reasonable fabrication etc. Volumetric efficiency at the Gigafactory is a huge factor. Solar City was a cash generator. Deferments from trust with suppliers so theyve been able to stretch out payables to more favorable terms. Average is now ?  days. Beating the ZEV dead horse. Elon thinks California should do more to support Tesla. ZEV credits are not important at scale will have almost no impact on Model . Elon not sure if makes sense to show final version of Model  before start of production initial set of cars goes to company employees for good feedback loop. At least a few months maybe even July before revealing final version. More polish and refinements a few more detailsI guess in some ways it will be a lot better. If  kWh average pack size possible and Gigafactory  could eventually support around  million vehicles a year and GWh of storage. Thinks storage will grow at twice the rate of automotive. Currently think they can have a  vehicles in total next year is the most likely outcome and with a couple more years getting to a million units seems like most likely outcome. Deepaks return is long term not interim. Solar Tiles RampD will look cute next to Model  amp Gigafactory Customer configurations for Model  to public will be pretty close to production  months away but it will be open internally to employee orders sooner leaks plz Building out the stamping facility in Fremont now it will be running well in advance of Model  but real question is how long will it take to work out bugs. Elon will be personally there. Elon doesnt expect the stamping line to be a potential schedule problem but rather issues they arent aware of yet. Not much to say about updates with Panasonic Elon wants to keep powder dry I missed what products this was regarding Ramp from kweek to kweek will be easier than k to k. Better for capex to make the line go faster vs making another line. Elon cant imagine capex being more than  of  to  to get from  to . Elon laughing about not being able to fit people in the building and says parking is one of his biggest nightmares. Missed some stuff at the end about capex cashflow and margins from Model .Signing off cheers everyone.,teslamotors,de33shs,133,t5_2s3j5

11122892,0,t3_5yjc5l,since the charging power is determind by charging rate C times pack capacity i think the supercharger V is meant for larger packs like in a tesla semi. you need kW of power to charge a kWh pack in an hour obviously and i expect the tesla semi will have an even bigger pack.its also worth to mention that a supercharger has currently  stalls that share the kW that it can output. so if both stalls are charging they both will only get around kW instead of full spead because the supercharger cant handle it. a kW supercharger could easily charge three model S at max power so maybe its just to build less supercharger with an equal amount of stalls.another thing to mention is that batteries can be optimized either for chargingdischarging speed or for capacity. here is a lecture of a battery startup that has done many simulations about how to optimzie LiIon cells if you are interested. the part about cathode thickness and how it influences the capacity and charging times is at about . that means that tesla could easily produce cells that can be charged much faster but they would loose capacity for it. and since elon has said that the kWh will be the maxium for a bit i expect further battery reasearchoptimization of tesla to go into faster chargingdischarging times. so maybe C is possible in a few years while still maintaing the same pack capacity.ofcourse thre are other technicall difficulties like Amperage at V that would be almost kA and you need a pretty thick cable to handle that kind of power and sufficient battery cooling but they can be solved with a little engineering.source i study electrical engineering work with a student team to build an EV where i am doing the BMS Battery Management System and am a notorious tesla fanboy.,teslamotors,desrr80,1,t5_2s3j5

Read everything about the car loved what they were doing and was extremely excited about it.I went to the local showroom and sat in one and was ... quite underwhelmed.  While I absolutely do take into consideration the exterior looks of whatever car Im going to buy Im of the mindset that you spend  of the time inside the car versus looking at it. So to me the interior has some requirements  comfortable quality materials attractive visibility tech storage amenities etc.  Where the Model S overly exceeds in tech I felt it was strongly lacking in comfort and quality.  The leather quality was mediocre at best  It seemed to me that the rear seats were something of an oversight.  The whole drivers cockpit area just didnt have the oomph I expected it to.I fully anticipate they will continue to improve on the quality and amenities of the interior so I havent given up hope.

The closest thing around to the Tesla Semi is probably the Nikola  prototype by Nikola Motors This is a hydrogenelectric hybrid with a  kWh pack powering a kWNm bhp ftlbs motor. It claims a range of km   miles on electric power alone for a total range of  km  miles.My guess is that the Tesla semi is going to have a range of around km  miles based on what your average truck driver will cover on a good day. Assuming a similar efficiency to the Nikola One this means a battery pack of at least . MWh if you want to go without charging. This seems like quite a large battery. Presumably however the idea is that you can also charge the battery during rest breaks. Assuming two  minute breaks per day this amounts to . hours of charging. Current Superchargers can do  kW which would mean that you only really need a roughly  MWh battery pack. Its interesting however to note Teslas plans for a  kW Version  Supercharger. This could mean that youd only need a . kWh battery pack to get through the day. ,teslamotors,dg869xy,3,t5_2s3j5

11683117,0,t1_dgk8d4f,Exactly. This is especially true for tech companies. Especially in software intensive products they change so fast that people learn to trust the brand over the product. Midtolate adopters who are naturally resistant to change think to themselves i dont understand how it works or what it will become but i believe this company will guide me better than the other companies. Its why my grandma owns an Apple tablet instead of an android tablet.The same thing will play out for Tesla as the world switches to computerpowered electric vehicles. Tesla will stand out as the company that is so good at guiding the transition to EVs that it guided its own competitors to making them. So when the mass majority look to take the leap towards EVs they much more likely to prefer Tesla over the OEM that is just mimicking Tesla. Now take this and factor in tha Teslas are going to be produced at larger numbers for a cheaper price while simultaneously giving Tesla good margins to continue expanding and its game over. This exact scenario has happened countless times since the s and not just with Apple Amazon Google etc. I highly recommend the book Crossing the Chasm if you want to read about more examples.,teslamotors,dgkar0h,5,t5_2s3j5
11684215,0,t1_dgkdwc5,The reason why i think it will be true in the future is for two reasons  Tesla already is the worlds top producer of battery EVs. Tesla has the most aggressive year battery EV production rate growth targets than any competitor. If Model  is successful it will enable Tesla to build Gigafactory  for a profit making it impossible for competing OEMs to keep pace. Model  is in such high demand that Tesla is already production constrained.The argument that traditional OEMs can simply flip a switch and produce EVs is a perfectly rational argument but its not a good one in my mind for the following reasons It completely ignores the history of tech disruption. Nokia Blockbuster Kodak are good examples of incumbent powers that had enough resources to flip the switch yet they still failed. Harvards Clay Christenson goes into much better details explaining this phenomenon. Recommend reading the innovators delimma if you want to know more. Just because OEMs have the technical capacity to achieve something doesnt mean that they can stay solvent while doing it. The latter is the more important question. I agree that Teslas gigafactory is something that a competitor could build if it wanted to. Whats more impressive is that Tesla was able to build it without going bankrupt. They have been able to continuously raise support and capital to build it whereas competitors havent. similar to  just because an OEM can build it doesnt mean customers will buy it. Its not safe to assume that OEMs will have the same level of demand for their EVs than Tesla does. The Chevy Bolt is a perfect example of this argument. Chevy spends orders of magnitude more money than Tesla on marketong their Chevy bolt yet they sit on a dealerships lot.,teslamotors,dgkf8m3,3,t5_2s3j5
