97838,0,t1_cepk8ac,Go to control panel gt uninstall a program gt find Babylon and uninstall it. Then go to your program files and make sure everything in there is uninstalled as well. Go to your browsers settings and check if the toolbar is still there. I may be so just keep going through your system and deleting the Babylon crap. Change your homepage that it most likely set to searchconduit other names such as Babylon search are also common back to whatever you want. Navigate to the area where it says upon opening browser open x tabs and reset it to default or change it to whatever you had set. Ive uninstalled several of these in the past and theyre very pesky and hard to uninstall but ive done it as recently as last week. They are installed onto the system when you install a program. Youll go through the installer and click check and usually blow through the installer thinking nothing of it but there will be a few check boxes there that you ignored that agree to the terms and installment of this toolbar. Itll load your browser up with ads that cannot be blocked by adblock often times and a toolbar and an annoying search bar as well as search engine upon startup. Hope this helps.. source I uninstalled babylon successfully several months ago. ,gfycat,cepkhb0,3,t5_2y6h2

616109,0,t1_cg9yz1s,It doesnt look like it is possible to detect incognito mode which is probably for the best in general browsing.  There used to be some css tricks that dont work any longer.    The best alternative idea I can come up with is to do the notifications only after the first visit.  We could save a cookie or localstorage item on the first visit and then only perform the action if it has been more than one day.  The idea being that an incognito session is unlikely to span more than one day. ,gfycat,cgaawv3,1,t5_2y6h2

888513,0,t1_ch59c1d,Ok I can see that top one in the main panel isnt quite lined up perfectly.  The height vs width are slightly off so the play button sits a little too high and the controls too low.  Ill have to see why that is.    The small one in the top right you dont have the play button set for.  But thats a good example of a smaller one.  Width is px height is px.    Current logic    the default size px wide px high.      If width is smaller than px then the width scales to px  width.  eg px scales to px wide.      But this is all arbitrary.  As an example what would you suggest is a good max height for the button on your video which is px high.    ,gfycat,ch59zxh,1,t5_2y6h2

1632362,0,t1_cjjmjmm,Yes we have found that variable frame rate video is really poorly supported so we cant use that in video.  What we do is count the frame delays and pick the most common one and from there we duplicate or cut frames to match the original gif variations.    But in this case I think the actual gif is playing wrong in the browser.  There are three different frame delays used  and .  The browser is playing back at delay  instead.  We already found this out for frame delay .  Instead of playing as fast as possible browsers choose to take  as .  So for GIFs with delay  we specify the frame rate to match what a browser will do.  But that case should probably extend to all frame delays less than .,gfycat,cjkxa6d,2,t5_2y6h2
