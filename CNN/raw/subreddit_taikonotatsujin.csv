2955020,0,t1_co3xwyg,Oh yeah! My tatacon is actually modded the sensitivity was just awful before and I didnt want to have to hit it so hard for it to register. Its better now but its probably not sensitive enough. Im familiar with both of those techniques but I havent gotten the double stroke down and I can only get about  hits with the rebound.Ive seen a lot of videos on the mod but I could only follow it visually because I dont know Japanese so I probably dont understand the mod completely. Maybe I should show you some pictures of mine so you can see what I did wrong. Your tatacon mod looks really neat by the way!Is the end of Ura Angel Dream considered a sofuran? I can full combo that one no problem. Ura Rotter Tarmination however is a little trickier for me Ill definitely start practicing that now.,taikonotatsujin,co400ge,1,t5_2wsta
