My heart was pounding the whole time I was in there waiting for someone to log in and catch me or a trap to go off.Anyways I doubt I will last long next month but if I last I will stay out of your way,HardcoreSMP,cjnaa1a,1,t5_2t03i

4833159,0,t1_cu3r919,Well if it takes you  seconds to check a container and there are  containers on the surface of the mountain itll take  and a half hours to search them all.Potential raiders will need to spend  and a half hours searching the containers checkerboarded to they cant gain the benefits of axes or picks. All the chests will be single chests of course.Should make for a nice pvp zone and should also attract xrayers.,HardcoreSMP,cu3rbzv,1,t5_2t03i
