5622010,0,t1_cwtu4so,No I dont mean either of those sorry I wasnt clear.What I meant was for integrations at the platform level I really think they have to be implemented by the platform creator. I have no specific knowledge of details of MicrosoftYouTube integration but in order to release that software Microsoft has to write it and release it as part of a software update I think.For a gaming app  e.g. an app that would let you consume gaming content on the Xbox  I think that YouTube would be the on writing the software and Microsoft or any platform maker would just have to approve the software but for tying directly into the game UI to support streaming youd really need that to be integrated into the system software.Since other companies have already done the integration points to get the YouTube streaming integrated into their platform I dont think this is a case of missing APIs on the YouTube side It just has to be a popular enough platform for Microsoft to want to build the support into the Xbox...,youtubegaming,cwtypp0,2,t5_2u1oc

6639128,0,t3_4699bv,As a former streamer that gained views and followers rapidly over a small amount of time. I have a few tips for you!I started streaming And didnt really know what game I wanted to play. I didnt have good video quality. I didnt have a schedule And also didnt have a very good mic. At this time I was only getting on average  views everyday. Although it wasnt a lot I enjoyed interacting with these people. As my stream grew older A lot of those people still keep in contact with me til this day!I noticed when I got better visual quality And mic quality more people came to the stream and stayed because they enjoyed my voice. I didnt really understand that But im guessing its just because I was excited to be there streaming and I finally had a decent mic! At this point I was gettting on average  viewers But I noticed a lot of these viewers were random. Lots of people told me that they couldnt watch because of the different time zones. When I took different time zones into consideration I decided to make a schedule. My schedule was MF  am  pm.  Hour break Then pm  ??? Till we time I decided to get off. The pm  ??? part Allowed me to transfer into late streams for the viewers who couldnt catch the stream earlier that day!Saturday amp Sunday were my off days But I would sometimes stream because I felt like interacting with the people who gave me the time of day. I absolutely loved when people told me how much they liked my stream.When I started this stream schedule Within a week I noticed a huge incline in constant viewership of my regular viewers And also lots of new people coming in. I kept this schedule for about  months with an average of  viewers. Going up by the week. When I fell off of my schedule The viewership took a huge fall and I eventually stopped streaming when I didnt have money for good internet. Basically you want to have good quality. No lag. Interaction. Good schedule that benefits most of your viewers. And try to make things fun No one likes a boring stream. OH Almost forgot. If youre young Or you spend money on bills. Make sure to have a donation button. I never asked for donations Or even applied for a sub button And that was a huge mistake. Donations Even the smallest help any stream Tremendously. Someone with a headset mic Could always use a studio mic. Dual monitors New mic Mixers Computer parts Lots of stuff goes into making a good stream. ,youtubegaming,d061kcb,3,t5_2u1oc

You can then use those videoIds with videos.list to get the concurrent viewer count.With that it should be possible to build a mechanism that autodiscovers the proper stream without the manual update each time.,youtubegaming,d59nalm,1,t5_2u1oc

10079333,0,t1_dbla271,Ill tell you what I tell everyone who asks me this and what Ive personally done to grow my channel Set a schedule and stick to it. This might be the most important thing. Whether youre uploading content or streaming people need to know when they can find you.  Pick the right game. I wouldnt start out playing Call of Duty or any other hugely popular title because your videos will get buried. Pick a game thats a little bit older but still has a following. But something you really enjoy playing too. And if all you enjoy is the hugely popular games so be it. Just know that when you play the newest game the week they come out your views will dip because everyone is watching the bigger channels.  Be yourself. Talk to your viewers. Interact. Use a face cam if you can. People connect more personally with you if youre not just posting gameplay videos.  Dont ask people to check out your channel by offering to sub to them. You dont want their sub because they will be inactive and you wont ever watch them either. Ive been doing it over a year and have just over  subs. I dont know if thats amazing growth or poor or what. It doesnt matter. Its just a number and it doesnt make my channel any better or worse than any other. Theres not a shortcut to getting views or subs. You just have to put the work in. And if you follow rule  youll see that happen. Just create content and have fun and everything else will follow. As for overlay stuff theres tons of different tools you can use and opinions on what should be on the screen. I try to keep mine pretty simple. I have a concurrent counter how many watching sub goal counter and like counter  all of which I got from www.chrisplaysgames.com which is a wonderful resource. Chris is a regular here as well as a YouTube developer. Donation and sub alerts also vary. Are use tipeeestream.com for both which Ive found to be very effective and reliable. I hope this is helpful for you. Best of luck on your channel!,youtubegaming,dblcvxr,3,t5_2u1oc
