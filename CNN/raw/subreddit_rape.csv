He manipulated and raped you and its disgusting. I cant imagine a more calculated situation.Ive also been victimized and I know that foggyheaded feeling. Im not an expert so you know take this with a grain of salt. But I attributed that feeling to anger that I couldnt let out. When I blame myself I cant fully let myself feel the feelings that I need to feel. And youre probably really fucking angry. You should be! I hope you can a safe place to really vent your anger. Whether its a therapist or maybe a friend who is knowledgeable about rape culture you need a place to vent where no one is going to judge your actions or even your reaction. Because if youre anything like me youve probably got a lot of anger and shame stored up inside.,rape,chwmn5i,3,t5_2qosw

3248374,0,t3_2xbknk,I think that a few of the best things that you personally can do are being attentive to her needs listening and prioritizing intimacy over sex. Sounds like youre already on the right track so props to you. My fiancee was date raped several times in college  even though its really hard stuff for me to hear Im crazy about her and it pains me to think that someone could do depraved things to the most beautiful person Ive ever met Ive tried to listen when she needs to talk about them and continually communicate that I dont see her as being damaged goods.Id definitely encourage her to seek help via counseling as well. Thats a bit trickier but I honestly think that avoiding the topic of rape when you bring it up will help. Her depression and anxiety are both good reasons to just talk things out with someone and when she feels ready to discuss the events youve mentioned with her therapist itll happen.Keep providing her with a safe relationship. My fiancee has mentioned many times that feeling safe with me is one of the biggest draws to our relationship for her. I dont encourage this for manipulative purposes whatsoever but its seriously one of the most important aspects of helping any individual come to terms with the fact that having been a victim doesnt devalue them as a person in any way whatsoever.I sincerely wish you all the best in providing her with support. Helping someone along with their recovery process can be pretty enigmatic as you already know but Im wholly convinced that it mostly requires time and if youre the romantic interest of a victim  as in our cases  putting aside your own selfish desires when she just needs you to provide a safe place or a friend to talk with. Patience is really key.,rape,coypb0u,2,t5_2qosw
3363863,0,t1_cpbn0zy,gt what would keep the button fromThat is a design challenge that I am thinking about. Of course it has to be something that does not get accidentally pressed but at the same time easy to access at the time of need.gt  If there were such a button Id think it would be better to contact emergency services rather than friends or familyThat is true and that is one of the options that would be enabled. The idea is that this product is useful in developing and underdeveloped countries also where emergency services are nonexistent almost. In those situations friends and family would be more effective and quick. Though emergency services infrastructure is lacking in many countries many many rural areas people do have a basic cell phone not smart phone but a basic one to receive texts. But yes it could be an option for a service to go with it for folks who can afford it. gt Youre most likely to be raped by someone you knowAgain I agree completely.

5649656,0,t3_3shvit,This kind of thing is both very common and very difficult for assault survivors and difficult for nonassault survivors to get.And I think thats part of the problem here.  Its less about your assault and your reactions from that.  You are healing and doing your best to take care of that.  Its tough and awful and will take time as long as you are devoted to working through it.The problem is that he isnt giving you that space and that time that you need.  And maybe he isnt the one to do that.  Only you can decide if you are ready for a relationship but your partner has to decide if he can be in a relationship while you work through this.  There are many guys who can.  Maybe he isnt one.  Or at least not yet.  Hes young as you mentioned.  And maybe he needs some maturity.  Based on some of his behaviors sexual assault history or no he doesnt sound like someone ready for an adult relationship.If you want to continue to try making it work you can try this.  Give him a signal.  An easy to see physical sign that you are done.  It could be a hand gesture or facial expression anything you agree will let him know you want him to stop whatever hes doing.If he continues to ignore you then I dont think you are the person for him.  He just isnt ready to handle what you need right now.How does that sound to you?,rape,cwxe81r,3,t5_2qosw

Many many survivors posting their stories support ideas community strength etc.  Its on our sidebar as Pandoras Project.  Its free and you can register anonymously.  Id also recommend Courage to Heal if you can order books where you are.  Its the classic survivor recovery manual written primarily for child sexual abuse survivors but with good information on rape recovery as well.  A strictly rape recovery book thats also free for download although please buy a copy if you can afford to as the author keeps it free for those who cant pay is Resurrection from Rape by Matt Atkinson.For handling anxiety attacks in the moment there are a number of good grounding exercises to keep you in the present when you feel lost in memories of what happened or losing yourself.This is a basic grounding exercise to use when you feel it coming on or in the middle. When its done for a couple minutes it forces the brain to shift away from the anxiety trigger and relax. You made need to do it a few times to get in the habit but it works very well.Sit quietly in a chair feet on floor eyes open. Pick a color doesnt matter what it is. Then begin looking around the room and naming out loud everything you see in that color. When you run out pick another color and do it again. After a few minutes of doing this you will find your mind relaxing and moving off of whats bothering you. Its that simple.You have to practice it to get your mind in the habit of knowing how to relax. For people who get really anxious and cant even pick a color to start I have them work off a list of colors. Just start with the top one and go down.You can also do this silently in your head if you are in a place where you cant talk out loud say in class or in a public area. It still works. You can change it up to shapes objects any other categories of things you notice. Try that a few times and let me know how youre doing.,rape,cycd688,1,t5_2qosw

Unfortunately I havent found the solution to this to not be affected anymore.If you end up going there though the only advice I can give you is to try to get occupied as much as you can  go out play video games whatever puts your mind more at ease so you dont think about what happened every minute. And most important  dont stay alone. Even if you dont want to tell your family what happened try to stay with them or your sister so you dont end up alone in this place.

6460533,0,t3_444ulx,Youre welcome to talk about this here and in rsecondarysurvivors which is for friends and loved ones of people who have experienced assault and rape.  I think that yes therapy could help her  but only if she comes to that decision herself.  You are absolutely on target that she needs to be the instigator for any kind of action taken.  Rape is a crime that robs the target of control and so maintaining that control afterwards during the healing process is critical.  It may be that if the dreams continue to be bad for her she may open up to other kinds of interventions.  Meanwhile there are a few other small things that have helped me that might be less frightening to try.  I feel like writing about my experiences helped a lot  just in my personal diary nobody else ever has to read it.  Secondly I found yoga to be very healing.

Thats wrong too and still rape but honestly... I think its almost certain that he knew. Also he wouldnt have gone around telling people that it was consensual that you wanted it if he didnt know this was not actually the case.

7057557,0,t3_4bx1im,Hey there.  First off yes this was rape.  It was absolutely  rape no doubt about it.  For one you were underage and he knew it.  For two you were in fear of your health and safety!  You cant have consensual sex when you are afraid of a person assaulting you if you dont comply or if you do the wrong thing.This guy is a predator and I suspect that he will have done this to several different young women over the last few years.It is likely that the cops wouldnt find anything at the guys home now related to your situation.  However it might be valuable to report him because he might be doing this to other girls and there might be evidence for that at his home. Or it may be that another person reported him and would benefit from reinforcement from another victim.  It is completely up to you and it isnt your responsibility to report but if you want to it can be valuable.Have you been able to see a therapist or counselor?

You wanted him there for comfort and not for other reasons which he evidently knew yet still ignored it and did as he pleased. I had the same thing going on in my head I was  too at the time nearly  now wondering whether I was mistaken and it was my fault for two weeks before I spoke up to a relative and it eventually led to me reporting it to the police.

9035428,0,t3_540r9b,Definitely sexual harassment not sure on assault however you can still file for that especially if you verbally said no on more than one occasion and he tried to push your head. The primary issue you will run into is that you did not immediately remove yourself from the situation as well as letting him take off your top if her did it very forcefully thats another matter but if you allowed it to happen that will come up against you.Immediately going to your parents about this sounds uneccesary but I would suggest you speak to someone at your school a counselor being the best choice getting their opinion and if need be and they agree go to the authorities.Just keep in mind for the future if you are in a situation like that leave immediately and be vocal about saying no. Staying in the situation will build more issues that the other individual could use to say he did nothing wrong and thats no good. Also if you talk to anyone about this which I suggest be very upfront that you did say no however you did not leave and allowed the removal of your top. Then it cant come back to bite you as you were totally honest about it. Good luck and if a guy invites you over even if you have a boyfriend dont expect he wont try something. We are a dense gender and figure of course a girl wants to hookup if she agrees to come over. Dont trust a guys intentions until you know for a fact what he may be expecting.,rape,d7xwysz,1,t5_2qosw

Im very much considering going back to therapy. I went for a while after it initially happened and I felt like it was to good to talk to a specialist. Im starting to believe that I may need to go to either a doctor too or see a psychiatrist to incorporate medication. Self harmeating disorder behavior has been my crutch for years but I have been doing better this year and would like to try to be truly happy. Im very tired of feeling like Im alive just because I cant handle the thought about hurting others if I decided to commit suicide even though its been on my mind a lot lately. Im currently sitting on a fresher pile of emotions than usual because my boyfriend has recently gone keyboard warrior on the internet and has been posting detailed and deeply depressing posts about it. Im struggling with how he is handling his emotions while trying to stay on top of my own. I love him so much and know that he loves me but I also know that he is still so enraged about this happening that Im worried that he may actually be going crazy. I found that he messaged the rapists mother on Facebook multiple times through out the day on the anniversary. I kind of feel bad that hes been very verbal with what he is telling her but she could call the police and report him for harassment or have her rapist kid sue for defamation of character and possibly win because of the whole part where he walked free of any wrong doing previously. ,rape,d8pvid0,1,t5_2qosw

Theres no one way you should feel  feelings just happen and none of them are wrong.,rape,db89fav,1,t5_2qosw

10377079,0,t1_dcj4y7q,Thank you so much and your right its deff not easy telling. As a child you just feel your the one in the wrong and that youll be punished. I hope and pray to god that she didnt hurt any other child. I cant help but feel guilty. Writing theses words helped me a whole lot. Especially if someone else could see and feel the courage to stand up for themselves. I hate that others know how I feel all to well. Wish that I could put a stop to all the sexual abuse in the world but sadly I cant. I can however try and help another person going through it. Again thank you and all the best to you as well. ,rape,dckb0ar,1,t5_2qosw
10624969,0,t1_ddbtbgd,Oh yeah absolutely you can just ask straightforwardly.  I wouldnt go for the past question though  theres not a lot you can do about that and in my experience asking about the past can just mean hurt feelings without a lot of progress.  Like if you screwed up  years ago and she brings it up now  youre probably not even the same person.  So Id say if you ask that kind of thing as is there anything that would be good for me to avoid or to ask you before we try it to make sure youre in a good place for it?Also keep in mind that sometimes this stuff can be confusing.  If youre trying to problem solve she may not know right off the bat what the problem is.  If that happens  she seems frustrated or uncertain or gets emotionally distressed by a question  just back off it and let her know that its okay you two can tackle it when shes ready.  The human brain is complicated and it resists being rushed into healing very strongly.  Being pushy or impatient is the enemy of progress.,rape,ddbvuor,1,t5_2qosw
10897812,0,t3_5vqd1k,Hey there.  That is absolutely rape.  When someone who is larger than you and stronger than you has shown without a doubt that they are going to physically harm you the best thing you can do is protect yourself.  You emphatically did not consent.  If you had fought him you might have been injured severely or worse.  Im glad your bf agreed to go to counseling.  Hopefully this will be explained to him there as well.  Its easy for an outsider to imagine how they would fight or do some kind of heroics in an assault but when it actually happens a persons body may not cooperate with those ideas.  I think you did the best possible for yourself.,rape,de415th,8,t5_2qosw
11322288,0,t1_dfeuxqs,I guess the notion that I offered to blow him made me feel like its consent. I have a hard time being compassionate with myself anyway and even though Id never victim blame its really easy to do to myself. Thanks.,rape,dffd1pz,2,t5_2qosw
11672575,0,t1_dgj3mnj,thank you so much i really needed to hear that. ,rape,dgj3pbk,1,t5_2qosw
