After making sure my family was comfortable Id buy modest apartments in the UK and Europe as home bases for travel in those regions and buy a decent house and an RV for exploring North America. If were talking mega millions here throw in a private plane and pilot or maybe join one of those charter plane networks so I could travel anywhere in privacy and comfort and skip the hassle of commercial travel. As I got older I would probably enroll in some of the better schools in the world not with the goal of getting a degree  just to learn about things that interest me and to keep my mind active in old age. Think Pierce Hawthorne in Community. As for charitable works I feel that the public school system in my hometown is pretty shitty I wouldnt want to send my own children there so Id like to find a way to supplement it with a free education center that kids could attend on nights andor weekends where wellpaid tutors could help kids with their studies at their own pace.

6160509,0,t1_cypr8bz,Its not  million in taxes. Its around  million in federal taxes in a no income tax state.  Itd be around a  million in federal and state taxes since the state taxes are deductible from income for federal income tax purposes I believe if there was a  percent state income tax.The reason that you are walking away with  to  million from a  million jackpot is not just because of the taxes.  Its also because a  million dollar jackpot is not actually  million dollars.  Its enough money to buy an annuity that will pay out  million dollars over  years.   In this case that would be  million dollars.So again the  million dollar jackpot is not  million dollars.  Its  million dollars of which youll pay . percent in federal taxes or if you pay a state income tax youll pay that and then pay . on whats left.So with a ten percent state tax rate...Jackpot   millionActual Value   millionState Taxes  . million .   millionFederal Taxes  . million .

7520740,0,t1_d2x0iuf,gt The likelihood of Kidnapping robbery murders etc increase with lottery winners. Not just from friend and family but strangers who watch the lottery winner announcements.This is exactly why my first stop would be to a lawyer to figure out how to best be anonymous or have a trust claim the money. If I couldnt do either well Ill already live in a private condo with a doorman and  security on a high floor with no balconies. That alone should resolve a lot of the problems as Ive worked in buildings similar to this before and if youre not on the list you dont get up period. Theres no wait by the elevator because security will remove you or call the cops to remove you. While it would suck to be imprisoned in my condo its not like I really leave my current apartment anyway outside of work and groceries. Id just call room service or order in and pay cash with a fake name. Should get me through the first year or so until Im basically forgot about. Ideally though none of this will be necessary and no one will ever find out Detached Wins MM Lottery. Id rather just win a small lottery where I only take home like MM after taxes right around the time another major lottery wins so the focus is on them and my lawyer can anonymize me. Actually now that you mention it I should play a state game instead of PowerBallMega Millions..... They never get huge and could easily get me financially secure with even the lowest win. ,ifiwonthelottery,d2x2ktt,3,t5_2vgya
