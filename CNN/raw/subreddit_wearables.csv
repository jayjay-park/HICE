4649830,0,t1_ctf9p9l,Im a Mechanical Engineer and was involved in the early stages of the design of a wearable medical device that we initially planned to look something like this. What we concluded at that point of time was that the device that you have shown is possible but the end product will probably be extremely different than the one that you have shown. The cuff would likely be not continuous like youve shown but would have to be rather discrete and segmented like a metal watch strap with at least one rigid region to house your electronics. Also it likely would have to be a bit thicker than what youve envisioned  The most common biological sensors are oximetric sensors and temperature sensors  The circuitry for pulse rate sensors that use IR LEDs tend to be a bit big and also you may have to have a layer of insulation around the temperature sensor. Besides this your specs call for Bluetooth integration a  set of accelerometers a microphone a battery a set of speakers a coil for wireless charging besides the processor and memory. Putting them all in one place would probably increase your thickness. Also  if you were to distribute them over the whole device you would have to increase thickness everywhere. Also for your biosensors to work you will have to make sure that the device doesnt move around a lot i.e. Make sure it doesnt shift from the underside of the wrist to the topside etc and so youll have to find a way to lock it in place. All this will mean that youll end up with something that looks similar to a standard smartwatch. Of course this was just our conclusion at that point of time and you may be able to  come up with a unique way to manufacture a smartcuff and I would be very interested in using one.In any case Im interested in hearing more about this project and if you want to talk more about it you can send me a PM.,wearables,ctgo8z0,1,t5_2vzq2
4651379,0,t1_ctgo8z0,Thanks...once I hear back from a couple of people about certain things I may just do thatYour comments are broadly in line with what others have been saying..We were looking at flexible circuit boards and given the small size of the chips involved figure we can go for a semirigid body...Depth wise cm should be achievable dont you think? To be clear were at a very early stage with a few CAD drawings being progressed and some basic research into which chipsetsdevboards would be doable...Obviously the next step would be a working prototype..at that point if I can assemble a larger team with people not only cable of doing the prototyping but also business marketing etc. then I imagine a kickstarter..but were nowhere near that yet.,wearables,ctgv8us,1,t5_2vzq2
