6780046,0,t1_d0krcvv,I am a broker and I agree with everything you say and I know you dont collect a lot of times.  Yes the issue is communication or more refusal to vie the broker as a client.  Drivers will often saywell I talked to so and so but if my company is paying their invoice then my company is their client.,FreightBrokers,d0ksw9b,1,t5_32bkf

10279564,0,t3_5m30kk,You should think about finding someone to edit your work.  Youve got grammar problems on the website and this thread.  As a potential consumer I can tell you Im not paying  to read through an eBook if your grammar is this rough.There are websites online where you can hire people to edit for you if you dont have someone closer to you.,FreightBrokers,dc98tpr,1,t5_32bkf
