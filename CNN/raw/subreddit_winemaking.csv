Stuck ferments arent an uncommon thing with professional winemakers in proper facilities and that would be my guess as to what happened with you.  Even if the timetemperaturebrix sugar were perfect the little yeasts might not have been up to the task.  To answer your question did you muck something up?  Maybe.  Did something get mucked up?  Most certainly.  How many different things could it have been?  An infinite number of possibilities.  If Ive learned anything in the past five seasons working in wineries its that ultimately we cant control everything and no one is completely prepared for whatever nature can throw at you.  Unlike fermenting premade beer wort like those cans of Coopers at most brewers shops making wine isnt a step a to step b  success type of endeavor especially when you lack a lab and lab staff glycol temperature controlled tanks and a degree.,winemaking,cwuxomp,3,t5_2qo1z

Some of our wines can make spec with just DE filter and no crossflow while others can make spec with just crossflow and no DE filter. But for our wines to consistently make spec we have to do both DE filter through FP powder and crossflow.Other possibility besides pectins plugging your filter is glucans. A couple years back a different bottling facility kept pushing back on us blaming our wines for plugging their sterile filter. They said our wines had high amounts of glucans and it left a slimy residue on their sterile filters.

7457238,0,t3_4hei9q,Nearly all of the caloric content of a dry wine will come from the ethanol it contains.  So to get a close estimate of the calories in a dry wine simply multiply the ethanol on the label by the quantity of wine to obtain the mls of ethanol present.  Ethanol has a density of . gml so multiply mls of ethanol by this number to get the grams of ethanol.  Then multiply grams of ethanol by  to get the number of calories.  For exampleA ml bottle of wine at  contains ml of ethanol.  ml of ethanol is equal to g of ethanol.  And g of ethanol contains  calories.  However even dry wines may contain tiny amounts of sugar.  A typical amount is . g in a  g serving.   . g of sugar contains  calories.  There are  servings in a ml bottle so a whole bottle of dry wine would contain  calories from sugar.For sweet wines youd need to know the percent sugar.  Unfortunately most wine labels dont indicate this so youd need to test it or try and ask the winemaker.  Once you have the sugar youll multiply that by the volume of wine to obtain grams of sugar.  Then multiply that number by  to get the calories from sugar.  Wine does contain some other carbohydrates and acids which can contribute to the caloric content.  However its very difficult to know specifics on a given wine without lab testing.  There are general guidelines out there on the internet which would give you an estimate though.  ,winemaking,d2puacf,4,t5_2qo1z

8494755,0,t3_4vxnuf,Great info from other users.. here is some quick tips to make sure you have smooth sailing...at the beginning of fermentation a little bit of oxygen in the must is a good thing helps yeast start and multiply... yeast in an aerobic environment  will breath co and concentrate on making more of them selves... yeast in an anaerobic  environment will eat sugar breath co and produce alcohol.Second after your primary in the bucket oxygen becomes the enemy.. try to keep the wine from contacting it.. the co produced will create a blanket over the mustwine.Keep everything clean.. invest in sanitizer and dont be lazy about cleaning everything... wild yeast is everywhere spoilage  yest too which cause off flavors or worst case vinegar..unless thats your goalhowever I dont imagine this is the case.After you confirm the end of fermentation.. typically below . sg and you begin stabilizing with pot.sulf. and sorbate this is when you need to degas the wine.. without proper degas sing you will have extremely long clearing times.  With a fruit wine I would not use bentonite that stuff is a stripper and will not only pull sedimate out of suspension it will also strip colors and flavors. Look into citosan  or keisolsol are your easiest to use. I dont know about egg white finnh with berry wine. And ox blood is a traditional fining agent but we will skip over that ahha..Also if your still havent pitched your yeast treat that with some pectin enzyme save hazing head ache later i check the ph if you have the ability I usually stay around .. for all my wines.. and dont forget to ask for help along the way!!!

11347266,0,t3_61xejq,red wine colour is extracted during fermentation from the grape skins. all red wines are fermented this way whites can also be but its less common. things influencing the colour extraction are heat produced by the yeast during ferment plunging or agitation of the skins during ferment or the addition of prepressed red grapes skins to the ferment to increase the skin to juice ratio. colour can also be negatively effected by oxidation of the wine post ferment polymeric pigment will actively bind with oxygen and drop out of solution. This will result in a loss of brightness or browning of the colour. When sulfur added post fermentation the polypigments bind with the sulfur molecules keeping them in solution i.e. more stable colour.
