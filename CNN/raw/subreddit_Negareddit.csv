110220,0,t1_ceqz5m3,This is the kind of hyperbole that makes me frustrated with reddit.Youre greatly over exaggerating how much most people say in edits. Ive never seen someone have an edit like yours in their comment. Most are Edit Thanks for the gold stranger! or something similar. Which is just polite. Its honestly funny how offended you are by that.Really though I sincerely hope you see how exaggerated your example is.Also..gt edit and now my highest upvoted post ever is about gold thanks reddit.I wasnt even talking about that kind of edit. Thats not the same kind of thing at all now is it? Youre not thanking anyone just making a lame but harmless joke. I guess you just added it in to exaggerate your caricature further. But yeah grow up. Really.Youre insulting people for being thankful. Would you do that in real life? Well no because youd look like an utter cock. Why do it online?I guess because misery loves company right? You hate reddit and every single tiny little trend on it and wont be content until any person with a shred of happiness on this website is brought down to the same level of cynicism and shares your Im better than the average redditor philosophy.Just leave people be and let them be happy with their gold. Its not their fault youre so utterly pathetically offended by someone thanking a stranger for their good deed.,Negareddit,ceqzc5u,1,t5_2vsbl

366275,0,t1_cfipp6s,gt Most ESLers wouldnt be as comfortable in a situation where they have to make a distinction between ss I agree.The reason I brought this up is that in Dutch it is almost the exact opposite. s is commonly used for pluralisation as is just s alone now that I think of it for some words amp s alone is used for possession though most people from the genitive with van  meaning of.gt  I think we can all agree here that if one has the ability to speakwrite with proper grammarspelling colloquialisms excluded one should feel some responsibility to implement such proper grammar and spelling.But its not that people go out of their way to use the wrong theyretheirthere etc. It happens because theyre not sufficiently comfortable with it to get it right without thinking. Arguably this happens to people who are comfortable with it who can always answer correctly if you ask which is appropriate simply because typing fast sometimes means that people will write homophones of the intended word by accident.,Negareddit,cfiq9zg,1,t5_2vsbl

2548193,0,t1_cmr61mf,Yes Buddhism is a religion that doesnt make it the same as Islam. From the start i said the Bible was great because it was so influential. Historians are not agreed on what the source of western morality is but its probably not Locke. It does matter the Bible is older because in influenced the way people thought even your thth century liberal philosophers were influenced by the bible. Yes morality exists outside of the Bible that does not change the fact its important... ask a Christian why they believe what they believe and they will more likely say the Bible than because ancient philosophers once said something very similar. Buddhism is spiritual. Defend my choice for why the Bible is a great work... ive already said its popularity and influence not to mention its entertaining and has some solid poetry. Why is influence and popularity a measure of greatness? i dont know you strange person because it is... I didnt invent the word and language isnt my discipline if you have a better definition of what makes something great say it otherwise i think you have to accept the Bible is a great work. Going out on a limb im guessing you havnt studied this topic for years maybe your in highschool maybe your not. University degrees dont denote intelligence but they do mean you know a lot about a subject and im telling you dude there is so much more to society and morality than th century liberal philosophers yes they literally influenced the French and American revolutions you have to see the western world as more than USA... think Greece Italy Germany.. the Occident man Edit you know what forget you think im wrong i know your wrong.

4407235,0,t3_3bihe8,I dont know if this relates or not but I had to watch a documentary years ago sadly I dont have the name about white supremacist groups and how they recruit people. Basically this group would throw a regular party like a BBQ in a park or whatever. No race motivated parties just a party. Then they would send out their most charismatic members and talk to certain people. They would drop certain slightly sort of racist phrases to see how certain people react. Things like its tough being white today. Or something like that. They try to recruit those who agree and slowly integrate them. Maybe have another party but whites only and when the N word is thrown around the charismatic guys tell the new recruits dont worry they get a little loud they are just mad and venting so not to scare them and eventually slowly but surely these new recruits through talking to members reading their literature keep going to meetings that portray black people as the enemy become angry white supremacists and agreeing to everything the group stand for.  Why am I even mentioning this? Because I cant help but feel thats what subs like coontown are doing. They know screaming the N word will not do anything but saying things like Im not racist BUT! slowly poisons the mind of redditors and now we have rampant racism on the default subs and people slowly going over to coontown or whatever. I mean jesus the subreddit style of coontown is all white people killed by black people with no context just another scare factor to show a us vs them mentality. ,Negareddit,csmfhm7,47,t5_2vsbl

In general sin was once and to some extent still is defined as going so completely against ones nature which is why some regard polyamory as sinful if they believe humans are naturally  or are supposed to be  monogamous why some people regard homosexuality or transgenderism as sinful etc. Nonhuman animals on the other hand are considered incapable of going against their natures  they kill only to feed or protect themselves or to secure mates and not for cruel pleasure they mate with multiple partners because thats how theyre programmed.

4743324,0,t1_cts5gqg,I wrote this before in this sub but I will write it again. I watched a documentary about white supremacist groups and how they recruit I cant remember the name this was a good  years ago They throw a normal regular partyBBQ in a public space. No white power no anything. They then send out their most charismatic members to talk to people and throw out slightly sort of racist shit like  Its hard being white today or whatever. Then whoever responds the best they invite to another cookout but with whites only. Then when shit gets racist the charismatic members say dont worry they are just mad get a little worked up or they are drunk or whatever. Slowly but surely through more cookoutsliterature meetings these new recruits become white power racists.I say all this because thats what the racist subs are doing. Reddit was always racist but now its fucking rampant on defaults and slightly racist phrases are thrown around like I hate black culture or I am not racist BUT... Hell if you go to coon town right now their subreddit style shows off all the white people who were killed by black people wit no context just person x was killed by person y. It immediately creates a us vs them mentality that will stick with some users. Reddit has definitely become a even more sexist hostile and racist place than when I originally lurked a few years ago. Anyone who says dont be a dick to each other gets hit with did I hurt you fee fees? or did I trigger you? or whatever. The mods pretending they are upholding free speech because they allow hate subs to stay on even if they find them wrong is fucking stupid. I am all for free speech but when this bullshit  subtly leaks onto the defaults and racists propaganda slowly becomes fact its a problem. When users feel threatened because someone says stop being a dick to others you dont like thats a problem. When someone shoot up a church screaming racist propaganda he got from the internet and your site hosts the same rhetoric thats a problem. I really do think reddit is the worst its ever been and the modsadmins ignoring shit behavior especially after all those racist and sexist Ellen Pao memesphrases just shows how cowardly they are and how they let immature enlightened man children ruin the entire site under the guise of free speech. ,Negareddit,ctsfvhx,10,t5_2vsbl

6740961,0,t1_d0e1rvs,gtHeres my take. As a physicist I can say that Republicans for the past couple of decades have always funded high energy physics nuclear neutrino ect. better than the Dems do. I know climate change is a big issue right now but people disagree to the degree not the existence. As it stands imposing green laws world wide could cripple economies of third world countries and even hurt ours. The technology now is not efficient by any means. My opinion is that we are not on the verge of an eco disaster and have the time to develop more efficient technology most likely from the field of high energy physics. So our time is best spent developing new technologies rather than implementing ineffective and economically disastrous old technology.O RLY and here I was thinking that GOP politicians regularly denied climate change. Also America shouldnt stop polluting the environment because that would cripple the economies of third world countries. Somebody please explain to me this causal chain. Finally STEMworship.

The wage gap exists the only debate is on how significant of a gap it is.gt Reddit supports min wage overwhelmingly. No they dont. They support middle class Americans making more money when its in comparison to the ultra wealthy but theres an overwhelming sense of disdain for burger flippers demanding to be paid a living wage. Even when redditors do support raising the minimum wage they dont think hour is a legitimate demand.gt Nothing against the arts but how is it fair that peoples taxes are paid for someone to study something that doesnt feed back into the economy?Who do you think writes scripts for the media we consume or does concept artstoryboarding or plays the actual roles in televisionmovies?

Saying someone is attractive in no way endorses it is ok to rape them.  I think there needs to be a distinction here. We cannot conflate the two concepts it lessens the seriousness of an actual assault. Also lets not forget women also do the same thing too to some extent. Now constant harassment unwanted verbal advances even after protest to stop or threats of rape these things are definitely rape culture.

I am a Japanese speaker in linguistics. My undergrad also involved a shitton of anthro classes because I didnt want to do any lit. I would consider myself qualified to make some responses to what you have written. gtwhich is culturally homogenous and the polar opposite of most western cultures. No and no. Japan is probably one of the more western countries in that area due to the huge influence of America on the region from WWII forward. We basically wrote their constitution inspire by western democracy and they adopted western business practices by the s. Its also not nearly homogeneous as some would like it to be. The number of halfJapanese is rapidly increasing and there are still plenty of economic migrants from the Philippines and other countries in East Asia not to mention the Zainichi population. Just because the government chooses to ignore these groups largely doesnt mean theyre not there. gtBefore Christianity was introduced the Japanese attitude towards sex was a lot like Americas attitude towards violence in that it was not feared to express in art and stuff to a great degree.The way this is phrased implies that  a change in attitude towards sex occurred at all and  a change in attitude occurred because of Christianity. Both points are false. gtAs for the prevalence of young looking highschool girls thats likely just due to the fact that Japanese women naturally have a slighter and straighter build than what were used to seeing.Not really.

7748728,0,t1_d3mt3a8,Wow. This is an INCREDIBLY reddity answer. gtIC IG has explicitly said classified material found in her emails were not classified retroactively but classified at the onset. It wasnt just diplotalk but information from the intelligence community and even some in SAPs. Clinton has zero say over what is classified and what isnt outside of the State Department and based on your comments it seems like your understanding of how things are supposed to work is on very shaky ground.You are intentionally leaving out the part that these emails were sent to her rather than sent by her.  They did not contain classification markings and were not disseminated anywawy.The shaky ground here is your understanding of actual events as they occured. gtShe didnt fail to find a few emails she deleted thousands of them including backups within a specific time period. Hard to claim that was accidental.More very particularly coded language. TECHNICALLY my own GOVERNMENT EMAIL is subject to FOIA. However I am free to delete anything I deem irrelevant or personal. What you are doing is using a rhetorical device to sway potentially ignorant people who may not understand this.My sending cat pictures to my work neighbor and responding to my endodontist that Im going to make an appointment are not affairs of the US even though they have officially passed through my government email. This is the nature of the email that were talking about and she deleted them in preparation to leave her position and hand over the remaining emails.gtNo it is a serious investigation by the FBI that has spend thousands of manhours extradited a Romanian hacker suspected of penetrating the server slowly interviewed their way up the chain of people who worked for Hillary etc. No unbiased observer with a working knowledge of this topic would say there are no grounds for this investigation.This is conflating two very different things. People hacking into systems is a reason to investigate. Republicans pointing fingers is not yet here we are. You think the two are related but in reality there arent at all outside of this theater we are witnessing. gtNo at worst she willfully violated procedures to protect classified information for the sake of convenience which made it easy for that information to be stolen. This implies that state department email would have been more secure.I am also not hearing any bitching over Colin Powell here.gt And if some random Romanian with a talent for guessing passwords could access it an organization backed by a nationstate most definitely could. By all accounts the people managing her email server werent very competent which is why despite going through the trouble of deleting emails and backups of those emails the FBI was still able to recover them. Or maybe they were actually private email and no special measures were taken to scrub them since who cares really if someone finds my cat pictures and doctor appointment confirmations?gtThe level of denial here is about on par with people who still think global warming isnt a thing. And here it is. This is Reddit.Com. DAE Hillary emails are the holocaust? gtThe FBI is taking a long time to build an airtight case because when you go after somebody very powerful you better not fail.The FBI provides no opinion.

8303264,0,t1_d5fgdxo,Not necessarily. I think the difference between remakesreboots and adaptations is more of intent to franchise. Or maybe a reboot is inherently a franchise into a second franchise. Like there are tons of different adaptations of The Great Gatsby but none of those are considered remakes just different adaptations. But like with Spiderman there was the Raimi movies and then it was rebooted into Amazing Spiderman. But maybe the Gatsby ones are remakes because its literally the same story each time? Maybe its a question of the prestige of the thing being adapted. So Gatsby gets to be an adaptation because its a classic novel but Spiderman is a remake because comics arent held as in such high regard?I think reboot implies franchising intent remake would seemingly imply like a shot for shot recreation and an adaptation is specifically taking something from a nonfilm medium and making it into a film? Like you wouldnt say that something like Amazing Spiderman adapted Raimis Spiderman movies into a new movie.But remake seems to be used sort of informally for kind of whatever it needs to be used for so Im not really sure. Maybe an adaptation has to come from a specific source to really be considered one. Like you wouldnt say you adapted Spiderman just as a concept to really be an adaptation I think youd have to adapt a specific Spiderman storyline. So maybe it could be called a remake by virtue of being another movie about the same characters doing a similar story without a specific source material to be adapted from. This is a really interesting question since some of it is informal fandriven stuff and some of it is studiobased marketing stuff and some of it is just weird inconsistencies in how we as people use words. Im not really sure theres a complete answer to thisTlDR I think reboot is ending and old franchise and starting a new one adaptation is from a specific nonfilm source material and remake is casual nonsense used by fans with no specific meaning and adapt in any form stops looking like a real word after you type it more than like twice,Negareddit,d5fgrpt,2,t5_2vsbl

Every wave of Stormfront invaders and bored teens and those guys who read one book and need to share their totally unique and profound insights has left their mark in that place. Every drunk uncle History Channel documentary and pathologically nationalist East European public school textbook is a legitimate source. The mod team demonstrably could not handle the sheer volume of Nazi apologia if they wanted to and Im not convinced they do. It is a midden of lowest common denominator antiintellectualism that sincerely holds the position that a TV news personality is as qualified as a tenured professor from an Ivy League university who has spent their entire career on a subject to comment on say the origins of the American Civil War or the Civil Rights movement. In short it actively spreads ignorance to the very people who need and want to be educated the most and there is no viable solution short of handing over the sub to a new mod team and let me tell you as a mod in that place I would make Stalin look like a fucking Anarchist.,Negareddit,d6k535o,6,t5_2vsbl

9166176,0,t1_d8diu5o,Interesting comparison to make given that Seinfeld both IRL and in the show was a massive fan of Superman.But even in those days through all of Seinfelds run part of the humor of Jerrys various Seinfeld references was that it was so out of place. Superman was considered mostly passe at the time.  When the character would get super excited about Superman its basically spotlighting the fact that the character is a goofy outoftouch manchild.The mainstream perception of superman was still the foultaste of the later Christopher Reeve films which sortof tried to do a camp tone but for the most part failed at it.  In those movies not counting the first one Superman really is pretty boring. His timidness and morality makes him really endearing but the struggles and conflicts he has to deal with are all mostly pretty unexciting or just plain confusing.Compare that with Tim Burtons Batman which came out the same year as Season  of Seinfeld. That was the first darkgrittyviolent superhero flick and holy crap did it blow absolutely everyone away.  The coolness of the  Batman was so huge that it took most everyone quite a few crummy sequels to figure out that it too was slipping into that same realm of poorlyexecuted camp as opposed to the s Batman TV show which is glorious camp.,Negareddit,d8dvok2,9,t5_2vsbl

They scare even MRAs and PUAs. We may as well start calling neonazis victims and worrying over how they feel when were deciding how to deal with them. It is peak liberalism to care more about the feelings of fascists and other violent hatemongering extremists than their victimsactual victims.Even if they didnt have some revelation and they didnt break from patriarchy it takes a special kind of evil and fucked up to turn incel.gtthe root of this incel problem which is patriarchy and capitalismsure but this excuses nothing. capitalism patriarchy cishet culture whiteness etc. cause a lot of terrible things. understanding why we do things is one thing empathizing with monsters and excusing their behavior is entirely another. we all deal with capitalism and patriarchy. only some of us turn fullblown evil.

9661221,0,t3_5dc3yq,gt The primary concern here isnt personal safety but receiving justification to actually legitimately kill people.Spot on but with one modification. I suspect that when people are talking like this about BLM protesters blocking freeways they are not in their mind killing people. In their head they see a shouting black face but its not a human face to them its a stereotype or an idea someone they have dreamt up as the perfect villain. Perhaps they know black people in real life maybe some of the good ones are their friends. Perhaps they dont know any black people at all. It doesnt matter. This dehumanisation is one of the reasons guns and cars are such dangerous weapons as well as being useful tools. You can distance yourself from your actions. You dont have to look into someones eyes and remember that they are human in order to end someones life. They can always be a shouting black face devoid of humanity right up until they are under your wheels or dead from a gunshot wound.,Negareddit,da3y4jc,13,t5_2vsbl

And Id like to note your example for a news network is practically the only rightleaning news network on tv.As an aside Id argue many of your points are valid yet partially misleading. To have a main gay character only stands out because heterosexuality is the default not necessarily because of homophobia but because heterosexuality is the majority and more people relate to it. And when considering filmmaking every decision outside of standard has a reason. No reason to make a character gay unless it serves a purpose. I wouldnt argue that is rightwingthe purpose that decision serves however is where the problem may lie.As to your assertions about female leads I think that does hold more credence. However from what I know about the movies your examples dont seem to really show what you think. The theory of everything seems to be a film for anyone because of the fact Stephen Hawking is so well known while Still Alice is not about a celebrity and seems to focus more on the inevitability of getting old and dealing with that as a mother. But Id still agree males are the default for leads in films especially powerful positions although I think thats changing.Allinall I think you overstate the rightwing bias in commercial media but my original comment was referring to news which I believe is generally pretty leftleaning.,Negareddit,dc0u00r,0,t5_2vsbl

Tench Coxe The prohibition is general. No clause in the Constitution could by any rule of construction be conceived to give to congress a power to disarm the people. William Rawle View of the Constitution the governments of Europe are afraid to trust the people with arms. James Madison Federalist Papers The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the United States. Noah Webster Leading Principles I ask who are the militia? They consist of now of the whole people except a few public officers. George Mason Virginia Convention The people are not to be disarmed of their weapons. Zachariah Johnson in defense of armament as a means to protect religious liberty Conceived it to be the privilege of every citizen and one of his most essential rights to bear arms Roger Sherman This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty .... The right of self defence is the first law of nature St. George Tucker The congress of the United States possesses no power to regulate or interfere with the domestic concerns or police of any state it belongs not to them to establish any rules respecting the rights of property nor will the constitution permit any prohibition of arms to the people St. George Tucker The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as the palladium of the liberties of a republic since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers and will generally even if these are successful in the first instance enable the people to resist and triumph over them. Justice Joseph Story Supreme Court judge And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press or the rights of Conscience or to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms Samuel Adams To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of people always possess arms and be taught alike especially when young how to use them Richard Henry Lee Their swords and every terrible implement of the soldier are the birthright of Americans. Tench Coxe The great object is that every man be armed Patrick Henry Virginia Ratifying Convention A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined George Washington To disarm the people that was the best and most effectual way to enslave them. George Mason The supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian while on the other hand arms like law discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world as well as property. The balance of power is the scale of peace. Thomas Paine The people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms. Tench Coxe Here every private person is authorized to arm himself John Adams A militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves... and include all men capable of bearing arms. Richard Henry Lee If the representatives of the people betray their constituents there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of selfdefense which is paramount to all positive forms of government and which against the usurpations of the national rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. In a single state if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers the different parcels subdivisions or districts of which it consists having no distinct government in each can take no regular measures for defense. The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms without concert without system without resource except in their courage and despair. Alexander Hamilton Federalist Papers ,Negareddit,dcv6crk,-1,t5_2vsbl

10813672,0,t3_5uipvg,Back in the s I noticed how a lot tech people on newsbulletin boards were racist antisemitic and had conspiracy affinity. I feared that with more use of the internet some lone people would radicalize when they werent able to discern true from false and hate propaganda from fiction stories. Luckily the left was faster and better at winning ground in the internet except for the young gaming teen population  in which slurs and IRC trolling were part of growing up. Then I noticed that older people started to use more mobile phones and get email boxes. I wondered what change that would result in and thought about how centrist and racism of the middle might become more prevalent. Back then I was mostly wrong as the content creators werent actively contributing to primary racism. Then the Nazis the Right etc. won. With their second and third internet generations and more expertise at creating content and using social media websites they were able to dominate the discourse and radicalize single people quite well. Since the way to seduce people online with hate is easy and the affinity of the centrists to shout and hate others they had an easy playing field. To think truth wins out is and always was a dumb idea when you arent discussing in a setting of friends  facetoface. TLDR  Nazis and the Right needed  generations more to be able to use the internet effectively then it was easy for them as the majority is prone to propaganda which lets them hate and dehumanize others. ,Negareddit,ddvcr6d,11,t5_2vsbl

People need to continue making life a living hell for their elected representatives organizing largescale protests like the womens march or JFK and taking legal action where possible.

While they may support the free international trade that hurts domestic jobs they also express serious concern for those drawbacks and will support plans to alleviate them.

I say this as someone who honestly feels more comfortable when its overcast and rainy outside regardless of whether Im outside or not. Also there are plenty of times throughout the week when you arent at workin classneeding to be productive. There are weekends it can rain at night days off breaks early in the morning. Maybe you work or take classes...indoors. I like being inside in the rain because its dimmer and the sounds of the rain are comforting. I sometimes just dont have as much mental energy on sunny days as I do overcast.
