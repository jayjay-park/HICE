6751153,0,t1_d0hi2sz,Thanks for sharing that. I guess its probably the shock of it all in at least some cases. I mean the shock of religious betrayal where such trust and faith was placed and then finding out important information was withheld.,Exmo_Spirituality,d0hmk18,1,t5_3chj2

7707068,0,t1_d3i6hgc,Absolutely the Catholic Church is guilty of trying to whitewash. However correct Information is usually not hard to find.  As to the reformation I agree. It did not happen in a vacuum. The church at the time was not engaged in the best of behavior and many people who loved the lord spoke out and said enough. The church then launched the counter reformation because it realized it needed to get its act together. The thing Former Mormons have to adjust to is that the Catholic Church claims to have the keys like Mormonism does. However the organization does not claim to be lead like Mormonism does. The pope isnt like monson who claims to be in constant communication with God. The Catholic Church contrary to what the media portrays is not nearly as centralized as Mormonism. Bishops are largely autonomous in their dioceses and the pope has very little influence on the day to day goings on at the local level. Catholics believe the gates of hell will never prevail against the church but the church much like you and me is capable of being righteous and of being not so righteous. When we are doing what we should God walks with us and the same is with the church. When the church acts poorly the lord will humble it. What works for me is that Catholic theology is very consistent. The rituals are Christ centered. Unlike Mormonism which is mostly a religion of outward expressions and check boxes Catholicism is much more about internal discipline and being in relationship with Jesus as the two of you work on you becoming a saint. I also really enjoy all the things Catholicism has bequeathed to the west.  The university system the hospital system the notion that all humans are intrinsically valuable jurisprudence and court system philosophy the bible all of the ancient texts that the church preserved the countless billions given to charity every year and these are just a few of them. ,Exmo_Spirituality,d3i8q7e,2,t5_3chj2
7825984,0,t1_d3vomzt,I agree. I dont think the Mormon church is unusual in that way or in its subcommunities of divergent thinkers. When people organize theres always someone who takes authority and then others naturally take checkandbalance roles. One of the problems in Mormonism is that because of the binary thinking those roles are not validateddissent is muted or silenced.Im in an extended nonconversation meaning that Im trying really hard not to be pushy at all with a family member who has given up on the truth claims and on the commandments but still feels some kind of commitment to change from within. I hope eventually she will realize that being an equivocal Mormon flies in the face of what the church leaders want the church and her to be and requires a double life.,Exmo_Spirituality,d3vpgqy,2,t5_3chj2
8723620,0,t1_d6vpxv0,Thats certainly an interesting take.  I usually find experience to be more important.  With experience I am not stuck with competing ideas but rather I have clarity as to what my experience has helped me understand.  With theory I can create multiple disparate theories that are in conflict with one another and be stuck at a place where I really dont have a way to prove which of those theories is correct without some type of experience in any case.  So do I pick a theory blindly and stick with that theory?  No thanks  I prefer to test the theory.  But a lot of supernatural theory cannot be tested so I leave it to the realm of theory.,Exmo_Spirituality,d6w3dxe,2,t5_3chj2

10703221,0,t3_5t0xuh,I like your bridge analogy. Mormonism drills a scorched earth policy into our heads constantly. If Mormonism isnt true nothing is.  If Mormonism isnt true nothing is. If Mormonism isnt true nothing is. We got this from the day we entered the church and we still get it even though we are out.  It makes sense that so many exmormons become atheists when they leave Mormonism. Josephs myth the profit did an amazing job at poisoning the well. If you ever just want to chat about Christianity let me know. I love helping exmos get better acquainted with Christianity. ,Exmo_Spirituality,ddjyhkd,5,t5_3chj2
11340319,0,t1_dbgrx7p,The way I picture it is akin to a box of legos. All these different forms are created from scratch they live their lives. Then at their death they are thrown back into the giant bin of Legos mixed around and fully dissolved so that new forms can be made from recycled parts. So yeah you died insofar that who you actually are is ONLY that body and mindsoul. But if you subscribe to this Eastern idea that who you actually are IS Life or the Universe itself then you never die. I think at the moment of death Life shows you that you never were just a human you were all of it everyone and everything and now youre back home! hahaI actually grew up Mormon too then became an atheist in my teens. After learning all about this incredible philosophy I dont consider myself atheist. Im not without God I AM God...  Really in debt to Watts. Death used to seem SO lonely now it seems like the ultimate gettogether lolol ,Exmo_Spirituality,dfhelv1,1,t5_3chj2
