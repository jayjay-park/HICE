56777,0,t1_cek9xst,Im confused are you saying that you never actually were saved or that since youre an atheists you could not have been saved?Also I totally agree about even saying you dont understand a verse is dangerous. Ive been asking my parents questions the past few days my mom always ask me to tell my dad and my dad rarely gives me a satisfactory answer. I asked them a few nights ago while we were eating dinner why God had to put the tree of knowledge in the middle of Eden my dad said to give Adam and Eve a choice to choose sin or not so naturally I asked after why their choosing sin had to affect everyone after them. I saw my mom and dad exchange looks and then my dad said Because sin effected the whole universe at that point. and I knew I had to drop it after that. It just doesnt make any sense though if only the act is sin then why allow them to act in a sinful way I mean isnt that supposed to be what heaven is going to be like anyway? I dont know its just so confusing and the more I think about these things the more confused I become and it scares me. Anyway thank you for sharing. ,exchristian,cekw7c9,2,t5_2r95q

96248,0,t1_cepd3in,gt Killing children was not the bestcase scenario at all nor do I consider it ethically acceptable. It was a lawless barbaric period in history and there are a lot of complex moral issues that arise from the story. But I think those narratives get a bad rap even though countless civilizations practiced total war as well. Again I am not justifying it...More apologies for a different era that was much more barbaric and lawless than today Which makes it okay for god to participate you are suggesting. Not exactly the best place to start on an exchristian thread talking to atheists. This is what Im talking about. I dont normally do this but this is just a carbon copy of arguments I see all over the internet and in real life.. EVERY SINGLE thing that we see as wrong with belief in a monotheistic god ChristianityJewishMuslim can be justified apologized for or explained away. Its mildly infuriating. No branch of atheistic morals or ethics Which are completely real and possible without a god or science or understanding has the same insecure stubbornness and resistance to challenge that theistic religions have. ,exchristian,cepdysk,6,t5_2r95q
96750,0,t1_cekf19g,The thing that bothers me the most about literalist interpretations is the reduction of the concept of God to this character appearing in the oldtestament who acts all petty and intervenes in human affairs. The bible was written by humans many centuries ago based off even earlier myths and has been translated and mistranslated numerous times since. Anyone who regards scripture as the literal documentation of the workings of a divine being are going to find all kinds of discrepancies and contradictions and scientific inaccuracies and yes even moral quandaries. Are these the result of simple misinterpretation mistranslation or deliberate attempts to brainwash people? Whos to say? While these are cogent and lucid arguments for leaving the Christian religion in my opinion becoming an exChristian does not equate to automatically becoming an atheist. Rather the Christian myths and the Hindu and all the rest are distorted shadows of this weird idea we once had about the unknown. As more and more of the unknown becomes known I feel like that opens up the possibilities of the unknown. That attempting to define something indefinable is going to fall short but it presents the idea which I think is the important part. I take religious myths for what they are rich symbols of human experience and perhaps something more but I dont use their fallibility as my spiritual compass. God has been boiled down to this anthropomorphized ManintheCloudsWhoJudgesUsandSetsRules. The very term God has become so corrupted and misused its ridiculous. Faith another term thats acquired a negative connotation does not mean ignoring or rejecting scientific evidence which contradicts scripture. It means opening up your heart and accepting that there might be something else ineffable indefinable incomprehensible even which unfortunately has to share the moniker God with all the other juvenile attempts to characterize It. Does that make sense to anyone else?TLDR The god that atheists reject is not the same God Im speaking about.,exchristian,cepg0rd,0,t5_2r95q
96804,0,t1_cekf19g,Ive actually heard of several people taking this tack on things.  Its like that Penn Jillette quote more people should read the bible because we need more atheistsI think its kinda weird.  I was never really forcefed the whole Biblical literalness thing.  Once I was old enough for Critical thinking I always read the Bible as... well.. more like any other myth I guess.  It always sounded to me like people trying to comprehend God rather than actual events.The store of original sin is an interesting one in that its a myth about why humans are different from animals.  Its about why we are able to sit here and ponder right and wrong and control our destinies.  And its bothersome that what is essentially gaining selfawareness is treated like a sin.  But at the same time you cant sin without selfawareness right?  I guess the message is that animals dont sin because they dont know what theyre doing.Anyway excuse my rambling.  Just some thoughts on Biblical mythology.  ,exchristian,cepg8pp,2,t5_2r95q

97503,0,t1_cephoii,So why is free will a gift?  There are two not necessarily exclusive possibilities I see with God choosing to given us free will. One some of us will choose poorly i.e. dont obey Gods word exactly without question according to your interpretation and those people are dammed for it. In this case why would a good god want to create a situation in which we are damned? And two the act of choosing to obey God brings us even close to him or has greater rewards or something. Why if God wants us to have these good things doesnt he just give them to us? Is he not actually allpowerful? Does he not like us all that much?  Maybe we simply cant fathom Gods ways... in which case why are we expected to try to? Why should we bother? It never made sense to me whereas logic and historical study seems to indicate that gods as most religions understand them probably were created by Man. If I am still just if I care for my fellow man I would hope any God would favor my actions even if I did not go to church or even believe in him. If he does not favor me because of these things then he is petty and not worth listening to anyway. I want to finish by saying I really liked how you interpreted the story because I have never had it explained to me that way. ,exchristian,cepj3wk,5,t5_2r95q

98670,0,t1_cekf19g,You are forgetting that if God really does exist and created everything and we are made in His image then some of our bad comes from Him. Also God utterly failed in managing the world so many times that He had to wipe people off the face of the planet several times. Seems like He finally gave up and after some time His son decided He could do a better job and came in to fix stuff.gt Simply put were better than him.Haha sure... We treat the things we create or less intelligent life as we please using them as substitute for our own suffering or work. We keep rats dogs and cats as pets love and take care of them but yet we also test on them train them expect obedience and eat them hmm.You are assuming that God is our equal but then you dont believe in God in the first place because God is supposed to be a superior being who created us and does as He pleases. If you dont want to believe in God do it because you dont agree with the idea that there is someone superior than you not because that said superior does things you dont agree with.You are looking up and judging someone that lives in a total different reality than you with a vastly superior knowledge and brain power and pretending to be better. So dont believe in God because there is absolutely no evidence that He does exist not because if He does exist you dont agree with Him. Its seems like a silly premise.,exchristian,cepnwbo,1,t5_2r95q

But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go. Exodus  other translations give different wording but the same meaning.There are apparently according to other commenters other times when Pharaohs heart hardened where its given in the passive voice or where Pharaoh hardens his own heart so the choice of wording hereGod actually doing something instead of allowing it to happenseems pretty clear to me.Not just that but Gods actions at that timethe Exodus the wanderings and the conquest of Canaanare all of a piece.

Has he ever had doubts about God? Just listen to his answer and dont look to challenge it or disprove him because it wont help as his reason probably wont be anything more than a feeling hes has in his heart. Remember hes a victim of religion just as you were once.You went through a period of doubt just like your friend and when you finally decided to look for answers with an open mind you looked everywhere and figured these things out for yourself. How can you possibly claim your religion is the right one without knowing the other possibilities. There are Muslims who believe in their religion just as fervently as your parents so how can they know that they arent the ones being tricked by the devil if they cant bother to see the other side of things. Even Jesus lovingly hung out with sinners nonbelievers and its your dads God who will allow him to watch his daughter burn in hell for all eternity while he sits in heaven.I know all of this is easier said than done.

Hes so afraid to think for himself that he flat out refuses. Well theres always the problem of evil argument. Any time he says that God cant save you because you wont let him point out that he just admitted that something is impossible for God. He will naturally counter saying that God wont violate your will and again  so youre saying its impossible for God to both save my soul and not violate my will regardless of what my will is? .The next step is hopefully he points out that it would be a contradiction in logic for him to both let you into heaven and honor your wish to not go to heaven which is how he sees your actions and you may be able to offer this as an explanation as he searches for one. But the counter to that is so God has to obey the laws of logic then? Not the other way around? What kind of God isnt all powerful? Its really just an elaborate extension of the can God create a rock to heavy for him to lift? question. The god concept is one big contradiction so maybe poking a few holes will help him back off. But he will likely point out that you are trying to weaken his faith. There are two options here. One you could argue that doubt is healthy. If you never question your beliefs no matter what they are how do you know youre right? The other option is to lay off and say that you understand that he like many humans throughout history is afraid of a life without purpose.

467486,0,t1_cfte12m,It is hard to know what to say.  The main reason in my experience is that you have different vocabularies now.  Words have different connotations.  For her to pray for you is a good thing  shes trying in the only way she knows how to give you something good.    You see it as her ignoring your wishes and that you dont want her to pray for you.    Neither of you is wrong.  She is trying to give you something she thinks is good and she is ignoring your wishes.  What does having a great relationship look like to you?  Write down what you need to do to make that happen and what she needs to do.  Then ask her to do those things.  Maybe she doesnt know how she is supposed to act and you can guide her.  Maybe this is an activity you could do together.  Each of you take  minutes to write down what a good relationship looks like.  Make an agreement that to the very best of your abilities you will make reasonable requests and honor reasonable requests.    Then talk about what you want and why.  In NonViolent Communication they say to approach conversations like this    . Articulate what happened from your perspective I became an atheist and our relationship changed  include specific behaviors on both your parts.  . Say how it makes you feel it makes me feel far away from you and the distance hurts me.  This step is done without BLAMING anyone.  . Articulate your need I need to feel like you love and accept me even though I am an atheist.  . Ask her to meet your need in specific ways I need you to talk to me and not my atheism.  I need you to not talk to me about god.  . Then listen.  A lot.  Listen for what she is feeling not just to what she is saying.  She might say I think you are rebelling.. She might just mean that she is confused about your choices and is trying to make sense of them and that is how she is doing it.      Thats one approach anyway.  I have used it to great effect.  I hope it is helpful to you.  To me this relationship hasnt hit the critical stage yet.  You are hurt and angry but I think there is room for this to get back on track.

621204,0,t3_219egt,First of all I would also post your story to a subreddit that specializes in sexual advice because even though religion is important to your experience a lot of people feel the way you do without religion being involved! Your feelings are very common.But to give my own two cents sex was an important issue in my deconversion so I can sympathize with being very nervous. What I always tell friends looking for advice is that in my experience the more you know and like someone the easier it is to share your feelings with them and the easier it is to feel comfortable with them. For me that feeling of being okay to be me is the most important thing in intimacy. That could just be me and my partner though. Specifically I had a lot of shame about my sexuality due to Christianity that has taken a few years to get over. If you have something similar comfort is especially important.However if you decide that you want this guy or any other to be your first thats great! The great thing about leaving religion is your body is now your own and you can do whatever it is that will make you happiest and most confident and comfortable.

642204,0,t3_21fx0r,You know whats the source of all the worlds problems? People not government. At least with a stable government there can be property rights and recourse for those wronged. In anarchy nothing would prevent anyone from coming to your house and murdering your family in order to take your resources besides your ability to defend yourself. Thats not a social structure its going back to where we were before civilization was founded. And before you suggest any sort of cooperation or social agreement that would prevent that any of them would be considered forms of government particularly if they had the teeth to enforce said agreements. Anarchy relies on a naive view of the world that suggests that people could live together in harmony without the government to maintain property rights and provide law enforcement. That just doesnt work people would simply take advantage of their respective abilities to gain resources by taking them from weaker individuals. ,exchristian,cgd9p74,2,t5_2r95q

To a nontheist the biblical take on hell is a nonissue its pure fiction.  I can see that all your points make sense if you are working out your feelings about hell from a theist or even agnostic standpoint but not from an atheist one.Please correct me if I have misunderstood in any way what you are saying.

792885,0,t3_23821e,First thank you for sharing with us!Second just so you know you are OK right where you are at.  It is natural for a person to ask questions and even more natural to be confused as to what answer they find are real for them or which are not appropriate to them. Confusion means that you are thinking through what you have been taught and what you are now learning.  Our brains literally need to rearrange old thought patterns to make room or adjustments to accommodate new ideas.  Questioning thinking and even confusion are good things as you are pushing and testing what you have been told to think. Plus new ideas and new knowledge lead directly to ... wait for it ... more questions!  Seldom does a hard honest question lead you to a definite answer.  The world of ideas does not fit into one of two boxes  either black or white.  Ideas comes in the full range of greys.I would estimate that most people go through a long period of questions seeking information learning and wobbling between believes before they finally settle into either choosing religion or choosing atheism.  While I have meet people who never really believed in religion I have not met one that woke up one morning and decided to become an atheist. Its not whether you finally chose to go back to religion or chose to believe atheist thinking Its that you make the choice that is right for you because you come to know that you made it  not your parents or your upbringing or your pastor or your friends. I suffered with agoraphobia for a long time.  As much as I hated it panic attacks do have one plus that I still need to remember in my life.  They were warning signs to me that I was or thought I was somehow in danger.  Today I dont have panic attacks because I have learned how to recognize situations as you described.Because you are thinking and questioning your anxiety may be telling you that you no longer want to be pushed into something that is not right for you.  Take it as a good sign because you are acknowledging that you know what is best for your life!!!!!Either way you chose you will find yourself on the path that is right for you and your life.Good luck and please let us know how you are doing.,exchristian,cguekwj,3,t5_2r95q

926719,0,t3_24pksj,I grew up in an evangelical church. This culture was pounded into my head from the day I popped out. When I was about ish or so I received a purity ring from my parents. I thought it was so wonderful at first. But it became a massive headache. My parents would use it against me you know guilt me into being a pure girl because I had that ring. My mom always thought I was doing bad things. Always having sex or whatever. Even though I had never even touched a boy. Anyways. At about  I threw the ring away. It was so liberating! After that I started experimenting with my sexuality and basically taught myself all about sex because no one else would. All I can say about that culture is that its sick twisted and perverted. I dont support that sort of bull shit. Waiting till marriage like youre some kind of gift to be given away. Like your virginity is what makes you a good person. I think someone else said this but its so true. So many dumb ass kids got married just so they could have sex without judgment. To later realize that not only is sex not that great not great enough to wait for. Also that they werent marrying the person for love but out of lust which is a sin in their beliefs. And now they cant divorce that person beside god says he doesnt like that. Ugh. Such a stupid cycle. I could go on forever about how stupid the culture is.... it fucked me up in the head and its taken years to get over.

1420495,0,t3_2aeatf,As others have already expressed youre welcome here. I too recently went through the process of losing Jesus. I very much missed the emotional highs that came with worship in my Pentecostal churches I was never a pew jumper but I was often deeply moved by lyrics to the point of tears. The idea of the son of God giving up heaven to come die on earth to save all mankind is a beautiful touching story. Sadly I eventually had to acknowledge that as beautiful as it was it simply wasnt true.I still havent found anything to replace those emotional experiences and I did miss them at first especially when I would visit my parents and attend church with them. But theres simply no truth behind them and lying to myself for an emotional high is unhealthy and even dangerous.Unlike you I dont still believe that theres a god. If there were someone who was both omniscient and omnipotent but who allowed evil to exist I wouldnt like that person very much.I also dont believe that there is a great Designer omnipotent or otherwise. I understand how you can believe that life is too complex for it to have occurred without intentional design. If it had happened in a only a few steps I would probably agree with that. Instead I see how starting with simple particles that existed at the creation of the universe however that may have happened those particles eventually combined with each other in stable logical ways to create other particles that also combined in stable logical ways. Thus through billions of steps we have atoms the elements stars planets complex molecules selfreplicating molecules the substances that life is made of simple life and then more and more complex life. Matter has taken the next logical reproducible step billions of times until from tiny elementary particles you and I are sitting at our computers on a planet revolving around a star near the edge of a massive galaxy and talking to each other through humandevised language and technology. And for me just a little bit that reminds me what it felt like to be the child of an omnipotent Creator except this time its real.You may not agree with that and you dont have to. But I dont believe that theres an omnipotent untouchable deity who will be distressed if you kill yourself. What I do believe is that you have children who arent omnipotent and arent untouchable who will cry if you do and isnt that really far more important?,exchristian,ciuc532,9,t5_2r95q

Most people draw a lot of comfort just from having a caring hand on the shoulder or the likes when was the last time god put a caring hand on anyones shoulder? The tension in the home is an interesting one and something I experienced as well. I think it is that everyone is wary of being judged so doesnt want to say something which will make them seem less christian or holy where as with a secular home there isnt that air of judgement constantly hanging around. People are just people.The churches stance against gays is a big part of my deconversion story too. The debate was raging here in New Zealand as to whether samesex partners should be legally able to marry and I knew my opinion was yes of course they should but when I was still in the church I felt I had to pretend that I thought they shouldnt. I raised it in bible studies etc framed in a kind of getyouthinking style question but really I was wondering if anyone could provide me with a persuasive reason that they shouldnt. The only answers I ever got where because God says it is wrong. I then asked should we then be pushing for the outlawing of sex before marriage? which stumped most people.

1605581,0,t3_2ca2oo,I was reading a book called The Human Brain and in the section about memory I learned that we can pretty much make ourselves believe anything. We can even make ourselves remember events that never happened to us. The things you remember and the way you remember them are colored by the narrative you impose upon the memory at the time of telling. I had some strong encounters with God in my Christian days but at the times I had them I really wanted a strong encounter with God and I let my brain create those narratives.I was in a car accident a few years ago. A car cut me off I swerved to avoid collision and went flying off the side of the highway into the woods. Fortunately I maintained enough control to come to a screeching halt about  inches from a tree. I and my car were fine aside from now being located in the woods. Less than  minutes later I was giving my statement to the police. I told my story. She asked me whether the car that cut me off went in front of me or behind me after the event. I started telling the story again this time imposing logic of what the other driver must have done in response to my presence. I stopped talking midsentence. You realize youre changing your story she said.Yes thats why I stopped talking I replied. I had no idea what happened to that other car. In fact I remembered very little in terms of physical facts. At the time my brain was throwing out all the advice learned in drivers ed about skids and stuff. But as I relayed the story my brain was churning hard to construct a narrative that made sense and filling in the gaps in my memory. In response to a simple questionwhat happened to the other carI now had a complete memory of its journey but because I recognized that the story was changing in real time I also know that story is completely contrived.Read a book about brains and memory.

Obviously being confident in yourself about how this relationship is fulfilling and meaningful is one thing but Im finding many Christians in my life are unable to comprehend the idea of fulfillment outside of God. So while its nice to be able to lay out my reasons for them expecting their support and approval is another thing entirely. Another thing I would suggest paying attention to is the expectations you consciously or not may be placing on your SO. There have been several instances where Ive found the ideas and pictures given to me in church have manifested as unhealthy markers of the quality of a relationship andor my partner. The fact that youve mentioned marriage in a title of a post about a guy you recently started dating may point to an example of the kind of thoughts I mean or you may just be a comprehensive question writer couldnt say p.

2779654,0,t3_2rw8g0,The article was a miss for me. I cant really relate to any of the reasons that the author listed as to why believers are leaving the church. Speaking for myself I left for a number of reasons I made a very serious effort to Find God when I was younger. I prayed as hard as I could. I lived correctly. I read the Bible...and nothing. There wasnt anybody on the other side of the telephone. I wasnt listening for some miraculous audible voice but I didnt feel anything. No tug on my heart other than the conditioned morality programmed into me by my parents.  I was raised to believe that the Bible is authoritative perfect and absolutely literal. No one had a substantial and satisfactory answer dealing with very serious theological conflicts that I encountered. How can God be omnibenevolent and omnipotent and command something like a global flood? Was the flood his first attempted intervention? Shouldnt he have tried something less drastic first? Those efforts must have failed then...but if his efforts failed how is he perfect all powerful all wise etc? Mankind isnt that wicked and if mankind is that wicked then God must have created a flawed product...but how can a perfect being create something so flawed that he has to destroy it and start over?  Why does God allow Satan to tempt him in the book of Job yet curse Satan for tempting him in the wilderness through Jesus? Why does God allow Jobs people to be slaughtered for the sake of a debate with Satan? Doesnt he love those people too? Why does God punish the innocents in Egypt along with the ruling elite? The fisherman and farmers along the Nile werent involved in exploiting the Israelites yet they were visited with plague and death along with everything else. The list goes on and on.  How can a just creator condemn individuals to Hell for eternity? If he is infallible then as a design we must be performing as he intended. In my opinion the concept of Free Will as typically served in rebuttal to this issue is deeply unsatisfactory. If God has no choice but to punish sin as Ive often heard then he is not omnipotent since he is slave to this compulsion to deliver punishment. Its extraordinarily cruel to create a physical body for a dead spirit specifically so it can feel agony then toss it in hell to suffer. If thats an actual literal truth God is evil but its precisely what many churches teach.  The Bible itself and much of Christian theology was decided upon through political process via a series of ecumenical councils. It didnt arrive hand delivered by God. Many of the authors are anonymous or unknown. Some of the choices of translation were editorialized to satisfy church orthodoxy or were simply the result of the editors themselves grappling with the differences between Hebrew Greek Latin and English. How can I take it as the literal word of God is this is all true? The list goes on and on but for me those are the reasons that I left. I dont really know about anyone else. ,exchristian,cnk1cny,38,t5_2r95q

Thus since were shit behaviorwise we may only be saved by Grace. They view the guidelines and commandments laid out in the New Testament as The Law The Extended Edition wherein it is revealed that all along its supposed to have been about holy grace and love and obedience. Its the whole faith vs. good works argument again.

After many issues with specific people in my church specifically the girl the tried to get me to commit suicide I had started to see all the little things that people did that werent part of scripture.  I went to a Christian college and started realizing more that the people in the college were not following church doctrine and were very much writing their own rules. The church that I attended in college was one of those big super churches and it sucked the sermons were lack luster and it felt like baby food. It also didnt help that I knew a lot of people in that church and what they did outside of church. I didnt renounce my faith at that time though I became Wiccan! It was pretty fun practicing but it really got me to question everything about everything I had learned so far. So after a couple years a messy divorce and a lot more research. I became a deep closet athiest. When I met my sons father I started going to mass which the rest of my family being catholic was super happy about. And then my son was born and stopped going. I was really tired of pretending. We split up I won custody of my son and decided to raise him without religion. Im now in a relationship with another awesome atheist and we both agree that just religion in general is just stupid and a crutch.

Growing up deeply believing something that as time went on matched less and less to what I actually saw in the world was very hard and caused me a lot of stress during a time when I should have been learning more about how the world works and doing some growing up. Like uKennyLoggins I was a real Christian by your description. I read the entire Bible. I was in church every time the doors were open. I was active in my youth group and in the youth leadership of my denomination. I had a deep personal relationship with Christ. I did everything right. And what I got in return was nothing but misery and stress because I wasnt good enough to resolve what I was actually experiencing as a human with what I believed.Losing my faith was honestly the best thing that ever happened to me. I can build my own morals and ethics now based on how the world actually works not based on how some Israelite exiles thought it worked  years ago. I can work towards a more ethical world that provides the greatest happiness to the greatest number instead of supporting a corrupt church that teaches children that gays and Mormons are going to suffer for eternity and that they should feel guilty for masturbating.I understand why you believe the way you do but you are working hard to try to reconcile your belief Christians are better people than nonChristians with your observations lots of Christians suck and lots of nonChristians are great people by convincing yourself that good nonChristians are good because they used to be Christians or that bad Christians arent really Christians.

I was never allowed to go to a public school wear shorts listen to regular music the whole  yards that comes with being a fundy. it wasnt that fun Anyways Im the youngest of . All of my siblings had moved out of home and gotten as far away from the church as possible.  My older brother had moved out a few months prior to this happening. I eventually told my father amp pastor that I didnt want to go to the Christian school anymore. My pop gave me the choice to stay at home and keep going to church and the church school or go live with my grandfather an outspoken atheist who lived in the middle of the woods on a beautiful lake in Arkansas. I chose the lake house of course.      So the next day we start our drive to Arkansas from Texas turns out I was taken to the boys ranch instead and dropped off. I was  yrs old. I wasnt into drugs alcohol in trouble with the police always had a very healthy respect for all types of authority. I wasnt getting girls pregnant being disrespectful I simply didnt believe in his religion.     So we get to the boys ranch the director guy gives my mom amp pop the BS about hard work making a man training horses yada yada yada BS. So my pop seems happy my mom is crying she didnt want any part of the church by then. At that time in her life she had already had a nervous breakdown from being treated like shit in the cult. However as you all know women have no say so and are second class citizens.       So they leave and Im stuck there. I was feeling pretty shitty depressed and generally fucking hopeless that was the most alone I had ever felt in my entire life.       As soon as my parents leave the demeanor of the directors and people in charge changed drastically. I dont remember exactly what I said but I do know that I asked a simple question and was immediately told I was not allowed to speak unless spoken to for the first  weeks. I also had to have a buddy with me wherever I went at all times.      One of the things that really stood out to me as soon as I got there was how all the boys were pale and covered in pimples. I was able to talk quietly with one of the other kids and he explained to me that it was due to lack of sunlight. I asked what about the horses live stock farm work all that jazz? He replied that the church hires people to do it for them.     About a week later this same kid told me that if I go out this one door make a left head north across the street then head east I would find some rail road tracks and those tracks go straight to a flying J truck stop in a small town called Checota Ok. That night I felt much much better and started planning my escape. ,exchristian,cp2kxq5,20,t5_2r95q

It is considered a more liberal view since it requires a more poetic or allegorical interpretation of the Bible which ironically used to be considered the standard reading. Strict Biblical literalism is a relatively recent fad and Christianity has suffered a lot for it. Personally even though Im not a theist I think the distinction is valid.

Dont put away the legos as soon as you finish building a model spanked for not listening the first time.Ask why you have to do something spanked for failure of first time obedience. Dont want to go to church forced then grounded with your punishment ranging from writing a single verse over and over and over again to transcribe this whole book of the bible. That on top of this detached feeling i got from my parents. Nothing was ever good enough and when it was it was because of them and their parenting and their god that i did something right not because i was actually doing the right thing. It taught me to lie really well like really really well just to avoid the punishment. I really started acting out in my teens mostly because i had so many emotions and feeling that they just were totally unprepared to help me with but the spanking didnt stop until i was physically big enough to rip the paddle from my fathers hands and tell him This is the last time you will lay a hand on me in anger or youll never see me again i was .

4203224,0,t3_38ymc5,Yes! I still lived with my mother and father in law when my husband and I first deconverted. We wanted to keep pretending so that meant we had to go to church to keep up the charade. I went to a church of Christ and we had a preacher that was way too old to still be preaching. He would forget half his sermon and just get off on a tangent usually about how the gays are destroying the sanctity of marriage and how God wont bless an America that accepts the perverts. I got so angry listening to the bigoted drivel. By a couple weeks of being a staunch atheist and still going to church I would beg my husband to just stay home that week. The one time we tried his mom came to our room and guilt tripped us hard so we ended up going again. It was such a huge relief when we found an apartment we could afford and got the hell out of there.

I tried to see God in every mundane thing. Not that bad things of courseGods not responsible for those only the good things. The times I thought I heard Gods voice...it was probably just my own voice saying what I wished someone would say to me or what I believed I needed to hear. I bet this is the case with camp people and youth group people. But once I got more real about it it just seemed like an incredibly abusive relationship filled with promises of happiness but instead I got ignored.

When I was in middle school we had to go to catechism for even longer after the morning service and study the bible.

There was another youth group I went to in high school that was more like a Wednesday night worship but it was catered to the younger crowd. There are also things called Life Groups at the church I went to. Its when adults get together in groups and do life together.

I didnt realize as much until afterwards but the presentation was overall uninformative left you with more questions than answers and my friend was way too willing to bend over backwards to spend time with me and another random guy even though were mostly just acquaintances and it was incredibly awkward. I realized that he was doing this in a similar vein to what I did while I was a Christian in trying to gain trust so that the other person would feel that Id be easygoing and open to any questions about the religion. I did some more research later and learned about their conferences and shit. It basically works in a similar way as religion. You get charismatic leaders who make you feel better with conferences. When you start to feel doubt the leaders reassure you that your prosperity is coming and you just need to work harder. Youre told not to worry and to ignore the criticisms saying that its a scam while being told twisted truths in order to make the whole thing seem legit and to hold off the nibbling questions in the back of your head. You have to learn marketing techniques to try and attract people to join a lot of which involves gaining trust keeping up an image and telling halftruths. You try to bring a friend to presentations in hopes that they get excited enough to sign up too. And the presentations are very emotionally driven but doesnt actualy answer many questions hoping that youll just ignore them and sign on. Too familiar.Oddly enough my friend has just graduated with a bachelors degree in math at a highly accredited university with very famous and competitive Mathematics faculty programs.

I dont think I cant really blame religion for this because I mean we grew up episcopalian we never believed in biblical literalism at all. How they grew up to be so credulous Ill never understand. Giants and demons and witches oh my! But then one of them accuses me of being an ideological colonialist unwilling to acknowledge the lived experiences of people who visit and make use of witch doctors in other countries keep in mind that I have a degree in ANTHROPOLOGY and grew up overseas and am very unlikely to be anything other than respectful of others beliefs just because I dont take it on faith that when someone says they were possessed and having a witchdoctor pretend to pull a centipede out of their belly button cured them...... ARG. I dont even know where to start with that.Im just so frustrated by credulity masquerading as skepticism. Believing a claim despite the fact that it is unsubstantiated and in fact because it contradicts the established understanding of a given phenomenon is NOT skepticism. Its the opposite of skepticism.

5648260,0,t1_cwx2ycz,I have to admit that a big part of it isnt reason. I had a near death experience as a child where my consciousness left my body went to an indeterminate place outside of what we know as time and physical reality and communicated with other noncorporeal beings. The longer I was dead the more I could remember. It was like as soon as I formed a question the answer was there so I knew that I had other lives. Given the choice to come back and continue this life I did.But even if that was all one hell of a hallucination caused by lack of blood flow and oxygen to my brain via strangulation as other people Ive told have suggested its clear to me that were the tiniest speck of dust in the universe. Its possible and maybe even probable that there is something out there that would qualify as god to us and if there is we wouldnt be able to detect it let alone measure it or communicate with it in a meaningful way. Likewise we are limited in our ability to measure and analyze consciousness. If I were looking out a window and saw a car go by it would appear that the car came into being when I could see it and that it no longer existed once it was out of my view. We have the ability to open the window or step outside and see that the car continues existing but in regards to consciousness weve only got the window.

If you are no longer living with them why tell them at all? Unless they force you to go to church or shove religion down your face will telling them really make you happy?

5720353,0,t3_3tdn35,It causes troubles because of the bullshit that was fed to all of us about being pure.  The idea of purity plays on our most basic human insecurities.  Oh no my wife fucked another guy before she married me.  I bet she thinks about fucking him all the time.  I bet she thinks about him while fucking me.The christian church gives tells women they arent worth anything except being baby machines and earning a mans love.  No wonder these women are having issues if their husbands had sex before them.Young men are insecure jerks.  I know I was.  The patriarchal teachings of the church just reinforce that someone else fucked your women before you so she really isnt yours.Healthy men and women dont worry about whos pee pee went in whos hoo hoo.  They focus on the parameters of the current relationship.  Does it include total fidelity or is it open.

6078986,0,t3_3ysu76,Sometimes I feel like I wasted my youth on Christianity too. Sort of like you I became passionate about my faith by age  participated in all the youth group things I could devoured spiritual literature and kind of fell down the rabbit hole that took me over a decade to come out of. I went to bible college for  years because I loved theology and didnt feel I fit in with my other nonChristian peers. I became very conservative and carried a lot of stress and guilt about little things like what kind of entertainment I enjoyed. My Christian friends were generally more judgmental than loving. I overanalyzed every happening and tried to spiritualize it. It turned me into a paranoid person. I went through several bouts of depression.Moving away after college was the best thing for me. No more pressure to conform to that group of people. I attended a more liberal church which opened my eyes to new ways of thinking. I decided to take a step back and not feel the need to have all the answers to allow myself to question why. I decided that love was the most important thing and that changed everything because I realized that the type of Christianity I had been involved in did not care about love. They were like the Pharisees.Since then bit by bit my Christian beliefs have fallen away as I reevaluate them with what I know now of the world. I dont know what I believe anymore. I dont want to give up God and Jesus and the good things. Sometimes I like ritual and the belief in something...more. But I find I dont identify with Christians anymore and walls go up whenever people start interpreting the bible to make a point. Ive seen Christianity used in so many abusive ways.The only advice I have to give is to count your blessings so to speak. Relish in your newfound freedom to do what you want without religious guilt. Be thankful you are only  and wont waste  more decades. Know you are not alone and there are a lot of good blogs books and internet communities that you can go to.,exchristian,cygfsoh,3,t5_2r95q

She was very insistent that I not label myself despite my knowing I swung both ways since I was  and was  when I told her. She instead wanted me to refer to it as a samesex attraction that I struggled with because if I dignified it by identifying as bi thatd be me giving into the sinful LGBT movements propaganda.Apparently this is common practice among many Catholics and Christians not to just see a persons gendersexual orientation and disagree with their lifestyle but to say that the attraction to the same sex or being transgendered is just a temptation until you validate yourself with labels appointed by the growing liberal LGBT movement.She had no illusion that I could pray the gay away she was rational in that one regard but she gave me some rather dubious sources saying that emotional abuse and neglect in childhood could have created my samesex attraction and I started going to therapy a positive experience but not one that was very helpful until I left the momappointed Catholic therapist and started seeing a secular one that would lead me into temptation and validate my samesex struggles.Good to know that years of struggling with said emotional abuse cyclical depression and anxiety to the point of me being suicidal for months on end during a downswing wasnt enough impetus for her to get me mental help but my coming out as queer was the straw that broke the camels back.

Within a whole world created were everything dies to make room for everything new why wouldnt God allow us the same physical makeup as everything else?  Why would God create us different than any other thing within this type of system?You say God could have made a world that didnt have suffering and He did.  Everyone seems to call that place heaven.  What that place is what it really means as heaven a word meaning a different universe dimensions location? is anyones guess.  Until we no longer live in a  dimensional world we wouldnt have any clue as to what this heaven is all about.Pain and suffering on this planet is designed to be a warning system.

6697266,0,t3_47csur,My Christian fear trigger was actually the rapture not hell. I was terrified that I wasnt really saved and so if the rapture occurred my parents would be taken and Id be left alone. That led to a pathological fear of being alone to the point that Id have what I now realize were panic attacks if I was left in the car while my mom did an errand even if it was as short as going inside to pay for gas. To this day as a grownass adult I still get very nervous if Im home alone. I think teaching children that theres any possibility that their parents will leave them forever is immoral at best and abusive at worst. I do also think that teachings about hell are completely inappropriate for children. I wouldnt let my children watch a movie or tv show or read a book that deals with torture  why would I teach them about it? Especially teaching that it is  real and will happen to them and everyone they love if they dont believe a certain way. Its coercive and fearmongering.

When we were there we visited two buildings that used to be churches before they were massacre sites during the genocide. The first one Ntarama was left largely asis broken glass bullet holes etc. but the skulls were stacked up on racks in the back of the building. For the second one Nyamata there was a guide there. She was one of maybe four survivors of that particular massacre.Warning descriptions of violence follow in this paragraphif you want to avoid it skip to the last paragraph. The woman who had survived by lying underneath bodies showed us around this church also had a collection of skulls and bones as well as a wall of namesbut those were in a separate building. She showed us the main church. There was a skeleton that I believe had been enclosed in a casket or I just couldnt lookI forget whichI believe she had been pregnant and she had been killed with a tree branch. But then the woman pointed to a section of the wall which was stained with blood and she said this is where they threw the babies and the young children.I didnt deconvert until years later but when I read through the Bible a couple years before my full deconversion I came across these verses describing things similar to what I had heard of things where just seeing the aftermath  years later haunted meand haunts me to this day. Much of my becoming a pacifist comes from seeing those churches and the rows of bones and skulls.

A true believer said yes! Whether that be out of genuine desire or social pressure Ill never know. Once the study leader got a roomful of people nodding that they would he read a passage of the bible where god called upon his followers to kill. He asked us if god bid it if god asked us what would be frowned down upon by the worldly would we obey? Even if the world was against it for damned fucking good reason? Would we kill for god? We were asked for a show of hands for who would be faithful and there was a room of smiles and lifted palms. Well everyone except for me. Then all eyes on me ever the killjoy. You could have cut diamonds with my frown. I am usually a mouthy motherfucker but here I was dumbfounded sweaty shaking palms down to gather my things.

Unrestricted abortion access wont stop men from beating their girlfriends and women from being poor or getting fired because her employer doesnt want to pay for health insurance.

7218044,0,t3_4dr90e,Yes I am more prolife now than before.  It never made sense to me that a inutero child could be considered less valuable than a born child.  So as a Christian I could at least console myself that maybe those children still existed somewhere.  Now?  Not so much.I dont advocate for any specific laws but rather Im a critic of abortion as a cultural practice.  Today we have decided that certain practices such as child sacrifice or letting unwanted children die of exposure are barbaric.  While we have laws on the books like dont abandon your newborn baby by and large those laws are not what restrain the practice.  It is the fact that we collectively agree that leaving newborn babies to die is pretty shitty thing to do.My hope is that in the future we come to a cultural consensus that abortion is also a pretty shitty thing to do so most people wont do it.  The problem comes in when people extol abortion rights they are moreorless saying that aborting your child is aok because calling something a right is a pretty strong moral signal that you approve.  If I had to pick the laws Id do something similar to what Scott Adams recently suggested.  We should make it illegal but have no penalty.

Theyre not human beings with honestlyifnotdisagreeable religious beliefs which shape their worldview theyre dem mooslems and mooslems are incredibly easy to hate dismiss and commit atrocities against. Its fair to say that the groups who participate in these events likely have  goals.  To help deescalate rhetoric by humanizing the other side while also providing humanization for your own.  Delivering the fundamentals of your own beliefs with an attractive friendly face in a setting designed to help you explain why you have good reason to believe what you do. While the second goal is certainly ulterior and fairly cynical and selfish the first goal is an entirely common interest deescalation is a direct benefit to all members of every faith who participates since it is those members who most seriously suffer when the escalation goes too far. Is it a perfect solution? No it has many flaws. Does it actually solve those differences?

Its good that theyre encouraging this kind of thinking especially if they attract viewers who are less likely to question anything theyve been taught.

From my own experience seemingly very similar to yours  I suppressed my conscience and the Holy Spirit and biblical counsel to pursue the relationship. A lot of damage was done. I had to learn it the hard way and maybe you will too. I agree with your Churchs discipline on this. The truth of the matter is that Christians are fundamentally different from nonchristians to the depths of our core. We have different affections longings hopes and dreams all informed by living for the glory of God. Eventually those differences will butt heads and you will have to choose to compromise or cut the relationship. If anything pray for her that she would hear the gospel and believe. I started going to people for advice that I knew would approve of the relationship. That should be a red flag if you catch yourself doing it.

Your mother is clearly conflicted about this. On the one hand she deeply loves you but on the other your beliefs or lack thereof are incomprehensible to her. Im not trying to make excuses for your folks just trying to give you a bit more perspective. No matter how silly offensive or downright erroneous their words may be know that they come from a place of love.As for how you should respond or whether you should bother I would ask you this what would be your goal or intentions in responding? Speaking from experience there is no point in engaging your folks in any kind of debate. So if you have a desire to prove something to go tit for tat then my suggestion is not to respond at all.If on the other hand you would like to show your parents how strong you really areand give them an idea of how successful God will be in His attempts to break youI would respond with love and humility. I would thank her for reaching out to you and your ex during this difficult time in your life. I would thank her for affirming her love and support the fact that she will be there for you if and when you hit bottom and so on. And lastly I would tell her that youre openminded and therefore open to the possibility of God but that the definition of God set forth in the Bible is irreconcilable with what you believe at present. She expects you to shut her off refute say nothing argueso personally I would surprise her and do the unexpected.

To me the awe and wonder you experience from reality and understanding how things work is a lot better than the awe of an imaginary being in which there is no evidence of it even existing. Honestly I have experienced much more awe and wonder than I ever did while I was a Christian. As for my purpose it is to serve myself. Make the best out of my finite life before I am gone forever.

7829503,0,t3_4mjgms,I think the reason I didnt really go through any grief like you describe when losing my faith is because I feel like Ive gained more than I lost. The only thing I really lost was the ability to fall back on the idea that there is a God who loves me regardless of whats going on in my life but being that God is silent I never perceptibly heard God or had any kind of absolute certainty that any given thing in life was  God orchestrated. Of course I tried to train myself to see every good thing in life as a gift from God and adopt that mindset but I always had that still small voice of reason suppressed down deep reminding me that I could never know for sure. In that sense the faint traces of doubt were always there and it was simply the act of giving myself permission to examine Christianity from an outside perspective that let me finally give it up.That all being said in giving up the thought of a God who loves me and has a plan for me I gained confidence in my own ability to navigate my own life without second guessing myself without wondering if Im accomplishing exactly what God wants me to without wondering if even some small sins were holding me back or causing God to be disappointed...on and on.

While most of Europe was going through the Enlightenment and changing their views on religion and tradition Portugal remained a Catholic stronghold. And had one of the most destructive earthquakes in history. On a holy day which was on a Saturday so all the Christians and Jews were in their respective places of worship. Tens of thousands and possibly up to a hundred thousand died. People ran from collapsing buildings to the boats in the bay and rivers to get away from the buildings falling a tsunami washes all the boats inland also flooding the town and then a fire breaks out. Not too far away a monastery full of corrupt monks with slaves in an extravagant building were unharmed. This was the beginning of modern atheism. Why would an all knowing and good God let so many people die AND giver everyone a really good reason to doubt him knowing they would never trust him? Far more bad would come out for him than good. ,exchristian,d64y28e,2,t5_2r95q

8616349,0,t1_d6ilryo,I dont know if I can teach you much of anything but if you want to know how I got over a lot of my own Christian guiltcomplex it was by perceiving my own empathy in the moment and realizing that that was coming from my own being. God is not gracious enough to grant me the ability to be kind whenever I am kind I am kind when I am kind because I am fucking kind. Just as I am not to blame for some imaginary jackass eating a forbidden fruit several thousand years ago Jesus is not to thank for my kindness and my decency insofar as I have it. This was the beginning of the end of my neurotic guilt complex. If I feel bad because I did this or that or because I was an asshole then thats my conscience and that is legitimate guilt. Its more difficult in the way it should be in so far as I cannot ask for Gods forgiveness for something I do to you. The neurotic guilt complex where forgiveness must be granted by the Father is replaced with a real partnership society where we are responsible to each other and our own consciences. And to think that we are all just bewildered primates flying around on this rock for a few years trying to make sense of it all clinging to loved ones while trying not to hurt them and trying not to think about death too much...its hilarious and kind of adorable. This cosmic perspective makes it so easy to forgive ourselves and each other. ,exchristian,d6in4hl,3,t5_2r95q

They slowly started avoiding me and not including me in their plans for reasons I still dont totally understand. It didnt force me out but Id been confronting a lot of difficult things that made it easier to leave when all my personal connections were dissolving.. Fear. I feel like fear and intellectual curiosity are the two most powerful influences in my life and sometimes they feed each other. I was scared to death of being left behind. I felt certain I wouldnt go to hell but I wasnt sure god wouldnt let me suffer through the end times as punishment for sins yknow all those big deathdeserving sins you commit when youre an average  year old. So my fear of being left behind made me double down on studying the bible in an effort to appease godassuage my fear but instead it made me more scared which made me study more on and on and on until I developed an anxiety condition I still carry with me. Thankfully the intellectual curiosity eventually spun me out when I started encountering irreconcilable differences in easily provable history and the biblical account.Also Jesus said we are gods and that shattered everything.,exchristian,d7rxp83,4,t5_2r95q

9330222,0,t1_d8yge4s,I think both Christians and Atheists place far to much weight on choice when it comes to morality.A sinful nature is not a decision making framework its a character trait. People with anger issues dont choose to be angry nor do drug addicts choose to be addicted. Same with sinning its a condition you will sin even when you dont want to or mean to.The Christian perspective is that A. Our nature is corrupt and therefor we will inevitably make mistakes and commit sin often without explicitly choosing or even being aware that it is wrong. Temptation deception oppression addictionB. That right and wrong or good and evil exist as objective truths not determined by individuals choosing for themselves. Otherwise nothing is either good or bad because everyone gets to choose their own definition C. That Christ God as a Human represents perfect and sinless behaviour but as men we will never be perfect and will always make mistakes. Because we will fail along the way we need God to transform us this is where the Holy Spiritthe helper advocate comforter comes it etc.D. Because we will never be perfect as long as we aspire to conduct ourselves inline with Christs behaviour then we are forgiven of our mistakes and sins. The whole thrust of Christianity rests on the belief that God is the agent that transforms a person into behaving better not the individual. It directly refutes that you as an individual can make yourself perfect. I.e you cant pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. Im not solely advocating that I have the correct answer Im just saying that choice is not the biggest or most important aspect of defining moral behaviour. ,exchristian,d8yo9gt,1,t5_2r95q

For the earliest ProtoChristians salvation was limited to the ongoing cycle of establishment and violation of covenants with their deity.That relationship became a viral story and was misinterpreteddistorted even today we are still subject to the long narrative of Christianities. The so called Judaizers condemned as heretics by Church fathers were likely connected to the actual original movement and GentileHellenist sects were the heretics. Later sects were termed as Ebionites or Nazirites and they are thought to have been closest to the Jerusalem Church mentioned by Paul.YHWH is a culture specific diety and Jesus or Jesus Christ is no more capable of salvation then any other religious figure. Sure a person might be saved from a dysfunctional lifestyle by following Jesus or devoting themselves to a way of life but in regards to fundamental truth claims about being and notbeing salvation is not going to happen for anyone in this time period nor was it likely for st century Judeans who called out for a divinely chosen king to drive out the foreign invaders.,exchristian,d94ultu,1,t5_2r95q

9837409,0,t3_5g5c3f,Im still not sure if going to a religious university slowed or expedited my religious deconversion. What led me to eventually no longer believe after three or four years of actual doubt was a combination of lots of little things. Small examples It always irked me that some people were always the type to raise their hands in worship. In my mind they were either actually being filled with the spirit of Jesus or they were just purposefully doing it out of emotion or a desire to pretend they were having a spiritual experience. After a while it dawned on me that it was always the latter option. Other things like learning about evolution helped to shape my new beliefs and ideologies. Want to know something kind of funny? I have no clue when I started believing the earth was more than  years old or that evolution was indeed a factual thing. Literally no clue other than that Im pretty sure when I was a kid I would have parotted the idea of a young earth from my parents. Im not even sure if I started accepting evolution in high school or in college. It was such a gradual process I have no clue. When I came out as atheist my parents asked me if someone had influenced me and had somehow warped my sense of reality. I had no such person and I proudly responded that I arrived to atheism all on my own surrounded by the religious and with no help from anyone whatsoever. Thats not entirely true though since I have some random atheist youtube channels and reddit to thank for a lot of it too. I gradually fell out of my religion just like I gradually was indoctrinated into it. I cant even give you a month for when I no longer considered myself a Christian. The best I can say is that the majority of the first half of  was when I was starting to leave the faith. The Fall and Winter was when I really started to become certain. ,exchristian,dapu59f,5,t5_2r95q

9957982,0,t3_5i39ux,Satan did not make hell God created it FOR satan. There are many people who worship satan both knowingly and unknowingly. One of the biggest deceptions in the world is that none of this is real. Satan deceives people into thinking that heaven and hell are not real and that both God and satan are not real. A lot of people believe that God and satan represent the good and bad within ourselves. Others believe that God is the bad guy and that satan is trying to save the world from God. These same folks believe that hell is party central and that all of their wildest pleasures will be in hell. I could go on and on. Satan has had a lot of time to manipulate humanity and it seems he had set in place a deception for everyone. The devil is a liar and he knows that his time is running out.

Fear is how they keep most people from falling away because intense scrutiny would reveal that its all nonsense. I spent  years in the church and I can tell you that most of the people there are currently questioning have questioned or are constantly questioning the religion but that fear of hell will prevent them from going a step further. The church I was part of seemed to have an answer for most questions you could think of but they were usually vague or stretched the scriptures to their breaking point just to convince you it was true. The preachers and elders had those answers readily available too because so many people have questioned the beliefs over the years. I would imagine most denominations have their readymade answers for most questions after years of having to answer all the doubts. When that many people are questioning whether its all BS or not they gotta adapt to stay alive. So its either keep them through fear or cherrypick the religion down to something more palatable. Thats why there are a lot of denominations that will just stop preaching hellfire and brimstone altogether and turn Christianity into more of a motivationalemotional service. ,exchristian,db5t5e4,3,t5_2r95q

10113245,0,t3_5klylp,. Baptized Roman Catholic as an infant stopped believing totally at .. A. The sheer amount of TOXIC and hypocritical people I encountered within Christianity started to make me think twice about what I was doing. Literally almost everyone I knew who was Catholic or Christian was either salty two faced or just plain sheltered and ignorant. If someone I knew wasnt a snake or a bigot they either were not religious or were having a good day. Most of the people I knew closely that were hardcore Catholics fell into  categories Ignorant about life in general and following Catholicism to the utter T andor completely toxic human beings. Their attitude toward priests as well was anal. You had to give them utmost respect no matter what but they could shit talk you and everybody would laugh. It got to the point where I never wanted to ever be associated with Catholicism or christianity ever again.   B. The lack of response I got from ANYTHING divine when I prayed desperately for god to end my battle with suicidal depression and hospitalizing anxiety was staggering. I was literally wasting my energy talking to nobody. The fact too that the only sympathy I got from anyone was God is testing you hes making you stronger by not answering your prayers! was sickeningly aggravating to put it without being completely nasty.C. Talking to people who were not religious or had left religion. Reading Fredrick Nietzsche socrates and researching the claims of other religions about miracles and orthodoxy made me realize that Catholicism and christianity isnt anything special. The knockout blow came when I learned what Nietzsches phrase God is dead really meant. In church they told me all sorts of nonsense about it being a denial of gods power and nature by saying that he could die that it was a grave sin to say that because the man who coined the term was utterly evil and that it was an angry statement etc. God is dead and we have killed him means more than anything to me that the age old idea of a moral system based off of an ultimate perfection a perfection reflected nowhere in this world but in myths is no longer acceptable in modern life.D. One more. Ive come to see this next experience as a metaphor for my abandonment of religion lol. There was a girl a very catholic girl that I pretty much loved who had moved far away from where I lived for a few years before she was going to come back to continue college or something I dont quite remember. I was around  when she came back for a visit. Through the whole time shed been gone I had been writing her letters sending her gifts the whole  yards sending her signals about what I thought of her and such. I had to do it lowkey because of her ultra conservative parents even so after a while it was more than obvious how I felt. When she finally did come back instead of a thank you or nice to see you or even a hug nothing. It was as if she had never met me. I learned later that their whole family was under this archaic guise of God is more important than love and Human love is of the world. The moment I learned that I totally lost interest and moved on. It made me laugh because her older sister had gone through relationships with men who always seemed to leave her now I knew why. Religion was a similar experience I spend years giving it my all and when the moment comes that I need it the most its as if it was never there in the first place. Goodbye.. I would never go back to put it concisely. After giving up christianity my life just bloomed. I enjoyed human interaction more because I wasnt worried about whether they were sinners or not I could hit on girls even if they wore dresses above their knees  I enjoyed basically everything more as if a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I even ironically quit feeling driven to watch porn and felt a thousand times better about myself. Never not in a million years.amp. Really theres nothing I miss that much so no regrets to be honest. Other than the environments of various churches themselves and maybe some childhood nostalgia of midnight masses and candlelight I see nothing to miss really.   ,exchristian,dbprjjx,3,t5_2r95q

Dog was freaked out by something before I got there but I got the barking tantrum therefore in childperspective I did nothing wrong and the dog is just mean.Most dogs react to fearanxiety with the same or with aggression anxiousfearful dogs tend to bark a lot and appear aggressive. So even though the dog that barked at me when I was a kid wasnt being aggressive with me I decide that all dogs are mean. There are no nice dogs. So I react to the presence of dogs with fear and anxiety the dogs react with fear and anxiety. My belief dogs are mean influences my actions which causes the dogs to react in a way that proves my point. And because the evidence reinforces my belief my approach doesnt change so the dogs reactions dont change.Its not until I meet a dog that is the complete opposite often a very welltrained dog with a very good human that I start to question my beliefs.

If you know anything about Science and what it takes to get called a Scientific Theory then you would know that the Scientific Theory of Evolution is about as controversial in the Science field as the Law of Gravity is. Evangelicals dont question the Scientific Theory of Evolution because they genuinely believe it to be based on faulty science and research it isnt. Their issue with it is it questions with plenty of evidence backing it up their literalist interpretation of the Book of Genesis and Adam and Eve.I dont know why Christians adopted a literalist interpretation of the Bible but I believe it to be one of the many wrong turns in the religions history at least for certain denominations.,exchristian,dchkbct,8,t5_2r95q

When I come to this sub this banner always helps me feel relaxed and mellow after a trying time on reddit because you know how filled reddit can be with trolls smartasses and timewasters.To me this banner very much does reflect the nature of this sub.I think it reflects the the sense of wonder and awe at this vast universe that most of us are FINALLY opening our minds to after having our hearts and minds closedheld hostagebrainwashed for so long by Christianity. I feel it also reflects the FREEDOM we feel in our hearts and minds to explore the universe that was denied us for so long.Also just because weve woken up to the sad truth about Christianity doesnt mean weve got life and existence all figured out! I think this banner reflects that as well...that there is more to existence than what religionbible tells us. Unexplored horizons! Freedom! To boldly go...heh heh you know the rest.And while Im at it I dont think a banner with a bible is the way to go.

10615285,0,t3_5rx20e,Many here have had similar experiences but everyones deconversion is unique. Ill briefly recount mine.It started it off as a deep anger at god. He said he was a father. He said he loved me but my life and everyones life did not match this divine claim. The anger and hurt probably lasted for  months. I raged at him all the time in my heart. I started seriously doubting. Where is this divine father?My regular routine when doubts came knocking didnt work anymore. I would always repeat the same arguments to myself why christianity is fundamentally true there has to be a first cause there is objective morality and I trust the bible is fundamentally true document. I taught these to groups at church and was working towards being a teacher for the congregation.But the arguments didnt hold any water anymore. They ceased being an effective defense against doubt. The first two are laughable and they didnt work for me anymore. The last one took some homework but it was shown to be false as well. I stopped going to church and renounced my faith.gt I was never angry at God for not existing that would be pointless and absurd. I was never angry at other people for believing in God and teaching me about him because I assume their belief was sincere.Im angry at myself for believing it and not looking at the arguments honestly. I always went into investigations knowing what I would find at the end. So much wasted time.gt Just now I realized that I was also grieving was the loss of something else deep spiritual truth. Spiritual truth feels good it feels solid and makes you feel special and want to share it with other people. It was hard coming to terms with the idea that this physical world is all that I can experience in this life. We were told over and over how terrible this world is and now its all we have.However what would have surprised me as christian I found meaning and purpose in my apostasy. I found true freedom. I was no longer the slave of a divine being. I am my own man accountable to no one. I cant tell you how much I value that its truly priceless.

10649612,0,t3_5sbhd6,Heres my take. Complexity does not require a designer. Simple rules working on a system can result in beautiful patterns and complexity. Look at turbulence or Conways Game of Life for two very different examples. People thought the solar system had to be designed because of its structure everything in a single plane and in nearly circular orbits but turns out all you need is conservation of angular momentum and gravity. Two simple rules.  Saying the earth and water are perfect assumes our life is the only type of life possible. It is conceivable that aliens on an ammonia planet would opine the perfection of ammonia for life. I love uDevilDocPyronight quote from Douglas Adams hereThis is rather as if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking This is an interesting world I find myself in  an interesting hole I find myself in  fits me rather neatly doesnt it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well must have been made to have me in it! This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as gradually the puddle gets smaller and smaller frantically hanging on to the notion that everythings going to be alright because this world was meant to have him in it was built to have him in it so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.  The brain is complicated no doubt but our ignorance is not a reason to shout IT MUST BE GOD!!!. This is a classic theist argument. It combines arguments from incredulity and god of the gaps. Also its not like the bible has an accurate model of the brain and consciousness that we can use aka god is not an explanation.. This argument is based on both an outdated understanding of physics and the mistake of using a heuristic that works at human space and time scales and applies it to all of reality. Sean Carroll says it better than I can but to summarize  The idea of causes is deeply embedded in an Aristotelian view of the universe. This is not how we think about the universe any more.  The big bang isnt necessarily when the universe started its more like the instant where our models of the universe start. We dont know what happened before then because we dont know the appropriate model. Maybe one day we will.  Even if Aristotelian causality was a fundamental truth of the universe which it isnt why could we extend it outside the universe? We cant its complete speculation. Maybe causality doesnt work out there or in other words the universe behaves differently than its constituent parts.. Yet another god of the gaps argument. Just because science doesnt understand something doesnt mean god is the answer. A rather silly example economists dont understand the economy. Its so complicated. Therefore god exists.. Evolution is a much much better explanation for DNA than god.. I have no words. Because we think about god a lot he exists? Thats the heart of this argument? Maybe we think about god a lot because we live in a culture saturated by christianity? Vague feelings are not an argument.. Bad arguments aside all the evidence for these claims are based on a book that was written by biased zealots who were more interested in making theological points than writing history.

Church in some lives extends through all those phases and can create an extra strong community through that.

Why do you only care about proving the god of the old testament? Why did you use prophesies that relate to Jesus if you only care about the old testament? What topic at hand? Isnt this about the reasons I apostatized?Edit  Here are my thoughts on the article you linked. Im tagging uJayAyyWhy so you can see this edit. My general critique is he the author presupposes the truth of the bible. That is not history its theology. I specifically asked how do you prove miracles happened historically?. That site did not answer that question. Here are some more specific thoughts He says Our presupposition that the Bible is true is therefore justified by the existence of uniform laws of nature regardless of whether or not such laws are immutable. This is essentially his defense for his presuppositional brand of apologetics. This argument falls flat for several reasons  No scientist takes these uniform laws as an assumption or brute fact or absolute truth. Most scientists would say they are probably a good approximation our shared reality based on  years of experiment and observation. The argument is a straw man.  Even if science presupposes that the universe is logical and orderly and that it obeys mathematical laws that are consistent over time and space this is not evidence of a christian worldview. Its just evidence of a worldview that assumes an underlying order in the universe. For example it could be evidence for Islam or Judaism or the ancient Greek Pantheon or Paganism or the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  In the linked webpage that I also cited above Evolution The AntiScience as part of his argument that scientists are able to make predictions only because there is uniformity as a result of Gods sovereign and consistent power this is an outdated Aristotelian view of physics that no scientist uses as a basis for doing science. Its  years out of date. He uses the reactions and accounts of these witnesses are mentioned in Scripture as proof for miracles. This is not convincing. Of course the bible would affirm its own miracles.Im not impressed. To sum up his arguments for miracles are an orderly universe is predicated on a belief in the bible we can trust what the bible says about itself and the bible describes supernatural events that go against the ordered universe it implies. Not great proof for miracles. It all relies on the trustworthiness of the bible and is somewhat circular.,exchristian,ddvhhw9,1,t5_2r95q

10942027,0,t3_5w9fj4,Very similar experience here.  As a teen I used to read the Bible and evangelical sources on the Bible voraciously.  A lot of people would comment on how I was bound to become a pastor or theologian or something.I remember a few key early moments that really shook my thenworldview were. When it occurred to me that messianic prophecies being fulfilled in the gospels could be the result of Jewish authors selfconsciously spinning the story to confirm the prophecies in the person of Jesus of Nazareth rather than evidence of supernatural design I actually felt really stupid when this finally occurred to me for not realizing it sooner...think I was about . Realizing that its not just tricky to trace Gods hand in the process of the development of the NT canon its impossible  because the entire process was a thoroughly human political one.. Discovering the simultaneous unity and diversity of the synoptic gospels.  How can they be SO similar and why would God give us three nearly identical books whats the point? yet chock full of irreconcilable contradictions in all the minor details where they do differ?So yeah I agree  I opened myself up to more critical works like Thomas Paines Age of Reason later but the first cracks in my evangelical worldview definitely stemmed from studying the Bible itself supplemented by evangelical sources.I also remember reading Case for Christ around this time probably as an attempt to convince myself back into the evangelical fold  I read a whole lot of apologetic works with this goal in mind and all I could think was this is embarrassing.  If this is the best defense that evangelicals can put forward is their particular view of Christian history and theology then theyve truly got nothing.I also owned several big fat hardback books in the genre of every supposed Bible contradiction explained away.  One was by Norman Geisler but I cant remember the other authors.  Anyway reading those also convinced me that there truly was no way to reconcile the Bible with itself without tying yourself into the most fabulous knots of pretzel logic.  I still think that anyone who says the Bible says it I believe it thats it must virtually never open their Bible.  Because if you poopoo the cultural and contextual arguments used by liberal theologians to explain say Pauls statements about homosexuality...well then you certainly must never have really tried in a determined way to reconcile the Internal contradictions in the NT gospelActs narratives or youd find yourself bending over x further backward to justify your view of scriptural inerrancy than any liberal theologian has ever had to do in their attempts to harmonize biblical morality with st century social ethics.,exchristian,de8lcum,8,t5_2r95q

They would have you believe that billions of people hate the idea of a god a Christian god so much that we will reject any proof of the existence of god. But they have it completely backwards. Millions of people reject the idea of a Christian god because there is no proof that this god exists. Sure you can look around and tell yourself that god is responsible for this or that but there is no observable proof that god exists. There is only the Bible. And just to shed light on the irrationality of using a religious text as a scientific source of information there are hundreds of religious texts out there and yet Christians reject all of them but one. Why? Not because it somehow proves the rest of them as false but because they have chosen to believe theirs holds the truth and all the rest dont.This is something that commonly gets left out of the creation vs evolution debate.

I would classify myself as a theist with Christian tendencies at my earliest years  years old.Then around  or  I realized that prayer didnt really seem to work and it didnt seem like a god was interfering with existence at all so I gradually formed into a deist with a belief in hell as the sole thing holding me onto this god. I believed that if I stopped believing I would either go to hell or something terrible would happen.At age  I decided that any god that would send someone to eternal torture in hell is a monster that I wouldnt want anything to do with. This let me question what I believed honestly and without fear and l found it to be unbelievable.  With this realization I became what I called agnostic when in reality I was an atheist.When I was  I started listening to some physics lectures and found Lawrence Krauss on youtube. I liked what he had to say so I looked for more videos with him and found a video that included Krauss and Richard Dawkins. I vaguely remembered Dawkins as a terrible atheist that only ever mocks Christians so I wanted to hear what he said. He gave a speech on cuckoo birds and how evolution affected which nests certain cuckoos lay their eggs due to the coloring of the eggs. I was fascinated hearing this and wanted to learn more so I looked up Dawkins books. The first one I saw was The God Delusion and I thought I would try it out just to see what he said in it. In the book there is a scale from  ranging from basically a  gnostic theist to a  gnostic atheist. I found that I agreed with position  which was that god is less than  likely but not incredibly low. This is when I found out I was an atheist I previously didnt give it much thought and didnt know the definition. Then by the end of the book and a bit of thinking I identified as a  on the scale meaning a very low probability. After the book I then went on to debates books whatever I could get in audio form while I was at work. I now identify as an agnostic atheist an ignostic atheist an antitheist and antireligion.Edit I just wanted to say that I was extra lucky that I wasnt indoctrinated from birth like many others are. It most likely would have been immeasurably harder to correct my thinking if I was indoctrinated soonermore often.,exchristian,df8x49x,3,t5_2r95q

11279098,0,t3_60s2u0,Well it depends how you define questioning?I would say serious questioning really really wrestling with the doctrines  months. Actually less since thats what it took to reach the atheist phase I reached the deist phase much more quickly.If you mean the stuff that really shook my faith that led to me questioning I would say about . years. I went through trials for a while before I got to the point of seriously questioning. Trying to work out issues within the faith before the entire thing just imploded. Or if you want to get even more technical about  years if you count the peak of my faith to the eventual deconversion. For years my faith was eroded by education and facts but I kept rationalizing this erosion away. As the whole why im not a christian series points out when dealing with religious faith youre dealing with a network of self reinforcing views. A few nodes of this network wont really cause the entire thing to collapse. But eventually if enough of them do youll reach a breaking point in which the entire system collapses.That saidDestruction of nodes on the network  yearsHitting the critical node that eventually caused me to question the whole thing . yearsActual deconversionquestioning phase  monthsMethods wise ratheism helped a lot in those last terminal  months. They really knew how to frame the issue. My faith was imploded and these guys were like...why do you believe in the first place? And I didnt have an answer. Thats the real kicker. I ran out of reasons to believe. I used the scientific method I asked a ton of questions from a scientific viewpoint and I based my views on the evidence. By the time I reached this terminal phase I was in my last semester of grad school and I had a ton of research methods at this point I knew how to get to the bottom of issues. I just applied what I learned to my religious views looked for supporting evidence found nothing and whenever I went back to ask Christians their thoughts I got the same runarounds that caused me problems in the first place. When one side is telling me to follow the evidence and the other side is asking me to take things on faith is it really a question I went with the whole evidence side of things? Seems like a no brainer.

11319320,0,t1_dfeqoso,Yuuuuuup. Inerrancy is actually part of why I deconverted. Maybe if Id grown up in an its all metaphor church Id still be there dk. Prolly not cuz reading scripture solo without apologetics kinda killed it for me. Or he was getting physical goods out of it and found a nice group to scam. He mentions in one of his letters a care basket hes been sent or something? Though he also says he busted his ass working for himself so no one could say anything? Idk the whole never heard the Gospel received it from God or we thing is a pretty big tell imo if hes serious about killing Christians professionally. Its kinda funny how ChristiansExC will say a phrase floated into my head or something like that instead of I had the thought of x. Still holding on to that god talksdevil talks phrasing? Either way thats pretty much it right there. The Bible selfrefutes. I actually think going outside the Bible is pointless. Better to let the script eat itself.Youd think the mental map is intense but I spend a lot of time talking to myself cuz Im stuck in a tiny town where almost everyone goes to churchhas a cross somewhere. Any time a new thought pops up to try and scare me back I find the counter. By now Im sitting on several tons of ammunition though where I put specific types I tend to forget. Still all I have to do is look around and I see all the ammo I have against the indoctrination and remember its all a mental battle that Im stocked up for. Still that good ol fear o Godwhat if Im wrong? can be problematic even with all the data and the fact that Ive asked countless times for God to speak to me directly in order to make me stop if Im doing the wrong thing. My mindset is that if religion is false I should oppose it. If its not obviously even if I disagree my job is to keep people outta hell. Buuuuuuuuut if its false then my job is to keep people outta hell mentally. At least thats how I see it. ,exchristian,dff0y56,2,t5_2r95q

11331968,0,t3_5y6jcj,I am late! Sorry bout that. Ill just be using the linked version. I like ESV anyway.  Chapter  God teaches Moses slightofhand so that everyone believes God Himself talked to Moses. Its very impressive if youve never seen slightofhand before. And sometimes the magician is just really good at slightofhand that its impressive even if youve seen similar before.   Throw some dirty river water on the ground and itll be blood! You sure the probably red dirt doesnt just cause the water to look like blood all by itself?  Moses is also worried about not being able to speak well so he recruits Aaron to do that for him. It was gods idea all along of course!  Moses then rides off to Egypt with his wife and sons does this mean he had no daughters that he left his daughters behind or just that daughters arent important enough to mention? to do magic tricks for the pharaoh. But god says that hell strip away pharaohs free will just so he can cause destruction and death. God must be really bored since that time he promised no more worldfloods.   This paragraph interrupts the flow of the story because god decided to kill Moses? But Moses wife SAVES Moses by circumcising one of her sons and touching the chopped off bit to Moses feet. Gross. No but seriously why was this placed in this particular spot?   Back to the story at hand Moses and Aaron meet up and tell some people all the cool stuff God told Moses and show off the magic tricks and the people are just super impressed!  Chapter  Moses and Aaron make it to pharaoh and ask for some time off for all the Hebrews but pahraohs like Im sorry what? Theyre like the entire country. I need them to be working! presumably because the system would fall apart without them because there are just sooo many of them.  So Moses retorts that his god needs a sacrifice or bad things could happen and he doesnt really want that.  Pharaoh thinks theyre just being lazy to have any time to pay mind to some trickster so he makes everyone work harder. That way they cant think about stuff.  But now having to gather materials for their work the people had no time at all and didnt make the daily quota. This complicates things and no one is happy. Except probably God. Hes probably amused by this mess.  Chapter  Moses is discouraged but God super promises this time for real you guys that Moses and his people get the land god promises Moses ancestors. God tells Moses to get a move on and go try to convince pharaoh again.  And then some genealogy. Was this interesting to anyone even back then or was it just proof?  Chapter  God again tells Moses and Aaron to go to pharaoh and show him the magic tricks. God ensures it wont work! But he seems pleased to be able to crush Egypt.  So Aaron performs the tricks for pharaoh but Pharaoh is unconvinced because his own magicians can do the same thing.  So the next morning God commands Aaron and Moses to just go turn all the river water into blood. They do so andyou guessed itpharaohs magicians can do the same thing! So pharaoh remains unconvinced. Thats gotta be some red dirt to make the river all bloodcolored right? Maybe it even does this every year or few years and they just timed it well?  The rivers bloody for an entire week and then!  Chapter  Gods got it this time. This time for real! He sends Aaron to plague Egypt with FROGS! But pharaohs magicians can conjure frogs up as well.  Pharaoh doesnt seem to like frogs so he begs Aaron and Moses to beg their god to stop the frogs. So they did and pharaoh changed his mind about letting anyone go. I wonder if everyone just had frogicide poison ready? Maybe frogs just happen sometimes? I like frogs.  The book says nothing about Moses or Aarons emotions and thoughts on all this but Id venture to guess at least Moses is desperate at this point. He has Aaron strike the ground with the magic staff under order of God of course and turn all the dust into gnats to plague Egypt without even talking to pharaoh this time. Pharaohs magicians cant do this one but pharaoh wasnt informed so how could he have guessed? With all the water being red and stagnate and gross thats probably where the gnats bred and this was just amazing timing.  Now God commands Moses to go have a little talk with pharaoh. That talk is a threat of swarms of flies. But these are special flies. They only want to be around Egyptians and not Hebrews. When the flies come pharaoh is ready to give up. He lets everyone go just to get rid of the flies. But when the flies are gone pharaoh changes his mind. Would it not have been easier to go on a journey while the flies are around and have the flies disappear when the Hebrews come back from the sacrifice? But god wants it done this way probably because it lets him torture pharaoh more.  Chapter  Pharaohs threatened with the death of all the Egyptian livestock it happens and hes still unconvinced. I am too. What if its the fault of the water supply?  Moses then throws some soot in the air and boils break out on every Egyptian. Including all the dead livestock it just said beasts but whats even still alive?. I wonder where that disease could have actually come from?  Then came the hail. Anyone who took Moses and Aaron at their word gathered their servants Hebrews? Theyre supposedly the slaves right? and livestock no those things are dead! What?! under some roofs so they wouldnt die. And anyone who didnt listen had their servants and dead livestock die some more. But when the hail was gone Pharaoh both hardened his own heart and had his heart hardened. No one was allowed to go anywhere.  Chapter   God says to Moses Hey go to pharaoh. I overrode his free will so you could have an awesome story for your grandkids! Go ahead and check. I paraphrased but thats basically it!  So Moses did and explained the situation to pharaoh. There will be locusts and they will eat every plant left. Pharaohs servants panicked and pleaded to just let these Hebrews go make a sacrifice to their god before Egypt is irreparably ruined. Its only mostly ruined right now.  So pharaoh calls for Moses and Aaron to get the details. Moses wants to take every living Hebrew including the livestock. Pharaoh says no that sounds suspicious. I agree with pharaoh it does sound suspicious.  Then there were locusts. This almost gets pharaoh he promises! But god hardens pharaohs heart. Sorry pharaoh you are but a puppet in all this.  God commands darkness in Egypt and pharaoh gives in but tries to compromise just leave some livestock. But Moses isnt having it. He wants every living creature under his or his peoples rule with him. Everyone and everything. So god hardens pharaohs heart again. No ones leaving. And no compromises ever.  Stay tuned next time to find out if Moses ever gets his way!  ,exchristian,dfggjru,2,t5_2r95q

I called it a royal straight flush and we mustnt be a fool about the way we play it. They cant get along without our help and industries and we have coming into action a weapon which will be unique. This was always a quote in reference to the atomic bomb that stuck in my mind. That their main concern was how it would look to the Russians after the War with Japan and Germany was over. He refers to the bomb as a Royal Straight Flush. Just seemed like there was more motives than simply not having to invade the Japanese mainland.Truman was an avid poker player in fact he was playing poker when he first heard FDR died. I wouldnt be surprised that calling a bomb capable of killing over  human beings in a single act was the equivalent to a Royal Straight Flush in his mind.For that matter we had them militarily defeated even without the bomb. Months prior to the bombing we did a massive firebombing of Tokyo that killed over  Japanese civilians.Japan at that point in the war posed very little threat to America outside of their mainland.,exchristian,dfkk2vw,1,t5_2r95q

He has a very strong presence in the New Testament that is a bit weird and some of the things he said are contradictory to what Jesus says.Lets do a bit of a thought experiment. Lets assume for a second that Jesus was real and he was the messiah etc. Now even in this case Paul is extremely untrustworthy. He was a guy that was a major part in the persecution of early Christians but he has a sudden change of heart and somehow becomes the leading apostle even though he never met Jesus prior to his crucifixion. Now how does a guy like this become the person with the majority of the New Testament under his name?

11674521,0,t1_dgj17bs,In addition to this we kind of enforced it through our own selective breeding.Those who follow the same system of beliefs are more likely to band together giving them space to rear more children more people to take care of them higher survival rate. Add a thing in there like god demands you make more babies! and youve got more babies born to those who believe more strongly. Then you get to the point where they kill or exile those who do not believe and youre mostly left with those who are susceptible to this kind of of superstition. Ive noticed that the people who are susceptible to religious indoctrination are usually the same people who are fanatic about team sports of course a specific team or a certain political affiliation. They are absolutely driven to be part of a whole part of an identifiable team even if if means completely abandoning any sort of logic and reason. ,exchristian,dgjbn8m,7,t5_2r95q

11771695,0,t3_67wmva,I dont think youre being condescending and I appreciate your thoughts. Its easy to misinterpret written text but in this case I see no reason to read too far into it  I dont get the impression you think everyone has suffered hugely. Personally there were aspects of Christianity I found unhelpful and anxietyinducing but I have also had many great experiences in Christian environments and have known terrific people with Christian faith  I include my parents in that and to be honest while I wish Id changed my mind earlier their Christian influence on me and my sister I feel has been very positive. At times I can be very cynical of indoctrination and this forum has influenced these views but at the same time I feel many parents do an excellent job of bringing their children up well with Christian values while giving them the freedom to believe what they want. Its very sad when any faith or no faith can negatively impact relationships between parents and their children and it shouldnt be that way!,exchristian,dgucq8p,4,t5_2r95q
11787726,0,t3_6860ak,I didnt personally witness this because I wasnt born yet but my mom non Christian describes it like it was yesterday. So backstory my mom was going to church with my aunt at a very Pentecostal revival type church. This guy comes to the alter and wants to be prayed over because he struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts. The pastor says something along the lines of the guy being possessed by the spirit of depression and calls the elders and the prayer warriors to cast the demons out of him. According to my mom it looked like a scene from the exorcist. Looks like the guy is having a seizure swearing shit like that. Three. Fucking. Days. Later. The guy commits suicide. Leaves a suicide for his family saying I guess they couldnt get the demons out.,exchristian,dgw6f87,62,t5_2r95q
