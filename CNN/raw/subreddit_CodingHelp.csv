7855095,0,t3_4mwjt9,unickutahs solution works for me except the xboxs margintop isnt enough to be completely below the header for me. My CSS suggestion looks almost like his but I also wrapped the xbox playstation and other divs in a main div and then do a margintop on that I am by no means a CSS expert and Im sure there are better ways to do it besides having completely fixed values for margins but if youre looking for something basic thatll do,CodingHelp,d3yzf6s,2,t5_39s7p

9509208,0,t1_d9cg6g8,Sorry for the really delayed response. From your description it sounds like none of the javascript is actually getting executed potentially because there is some error with the code. Can you look at the console and see if there are any errors when the page loads? Pressing F should bring it up and any errors will likely be in red. Since it sounds like all you changed was the artist info make sure there arent any straymissing commas anywhere. What you linked looks good but doesnt show everything so I cant check it all. Also maybe check that the div names are exactly the same since its case sensitive. Other than that Im not exactly sure why your site is having issues.Heres exactly what I have under settingsadvancedinjection And heres what I have in the Page Content for my artist page ,CodingHelp,d9l7n3y,1,t5_39s7p

9713231,0,t3_5e0s9c,I think you main issue might be in supercoolAI but there might be other spots that are causing issues as well. On line  you have the statement while winboard   which means that the only way supercoolAIwill return is if someone won which in many cases wont happen. Additionally on line  you have a while condition to check for boardxy and then immediately change it basically making it the if statement if boardxy !   . All you are doing from lines  to  is making sure no one has won and changing the single xy value which could also cause issues if the other player went there since x !   . Im in a bit of a time crunch right now so cant explain as well as I would like but those are some things to definitely look over.Essentially rethink your supercoolAI function. Start from stratch think about what you want it to do and try to translate it into code again. Also as a sidenote on line  you say print printboard but printboard doesnt return anything so that wont print anything its the stuff inside printboard thats doing the actual printing.,CodingHelp,daad6cw,1,t5_39s7p
9757864,0,t3_5ewmug,Just like was already mentioned it defines the function so that the python compiler knows that what it is dealing with is a function. Similar to JavaScript for a function has the word function in front of it. A function is able to take and pass parameters and arguments. Many times modules are created using a single function or a group of functions. For  it doesnt have to be inside a desperate function however if you wanted it tovar x var y def mainx y    var z  x  y    printthe sum of  x    y  is  zmainThe first line defines and sets the variable x equal to  the Second line defines and sets the variable y equal to  as well. The next line defines a function called main and is passed the values of x and y. In the next line the variable z is defined and set to the sum of x  y. The next line prints out the concatenated string.  The last line calls the functiona function doesnt run unless somewhere in the program it is called. Also note that there are a million  ways perform what you asked mine and the other are both correct,CodingHelp,dafvihk,2,t5_39s7p

11017601,0,t1_deg2xtv,No worries I always cringe when I see people buying some  machine to start learning  unless youre trying to do serious graphics work game dev or heavy data analytics its definitely not worth it.Ubuntu or any Debian variant would be the Linux distro Id recommend to get started and for VPS providers you can take a look at Digital Ocean OVH Vultr and Linode for big popular ones if you like AWS theyve added one too Lightsail? though the standard caveats apply about watching bandwidth so you dont get a surprise x bill one month. If you can choose a datacenter thats geographically close to you for a better experience  at least the same continent but if youre able to get something in your region like eastern North America or western Australia or southern Africa that kind of thing. You can search reddit for vps providers or similar to get lots of personalized reviews but its pretty easy to justify trying a few out at  or less for a couple months. Plus you can always upgrade the machine if you end up needing more RAM CPU whatever. Good luck!,CodingHelp,degtbvc,1,t5_39s7p
