Youll hardly find any.No electricity starvation everywhere and no sense of normal life. Pretty much no schools and no work. An entire generation getting PTSD. Not to mention the decades worth of intolerance we just got our hands on.,Yemen,cv7dvrk,1,t5_2sbii
10910782,0,t3_5vmaut,the war in yemen is a civil war where the majority of the population is shiite and the government has engaged in state sponsored discrimination against shiites including trying to underreport their population to make them look like a minority. the houthis rebelled and won so al qeda stepped in. saudi arabia is just the air force for al qeda. the united states military is aligned with al qeda in yemen so the houthis have attacked them or attempted to attack them at times. if you support US or saudi policy in yemen you support al qeda. your position should be to sanction saudi arabia and support the houthis against al qeda.,Yemen,de5dbn6,1,t5_2sbii
