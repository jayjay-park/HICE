9542481,0,t3_5bko6m,Its definitely unique. Depends on what youre going for but there isnt really a sense of a chord progression. A few lines I liked but it doesnt seem like the lyrics are telling a clear story. I liked the sound design. Vocals were a bit plain sounding and the melody doesnt have much interesting movement. EDIT yikes didnt mean to start anything. Sorry everyone. ,MadeThis,d9pb4fb,0,t5_3ezg0
