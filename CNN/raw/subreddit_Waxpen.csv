With these tube style ones the reclaim builds up in the tube and melts down back to the coil. Sleek stealth clean look and it hits just like a globe. I just got two of these in the mail and im quite impressed.

Similar construction to the Terra cart and Divine tribes donuts but built by me before theirs were ever ordered from a factory in China. here is a pic of what I built I found very poor vapor performance up to .v but pretty good flavor. A lot of seepage past the donut.

So far my favorite cost effective cartridge is the UP Tech Globe with Titanium coil on top of an Omicron power unit with the AW  battery.The best vaporizer cartridge that Ive used has no wires at all. It uses a ceramic heating rod in the center of a titanium wick coil donut for even heating and also no possibility of a wire breaking.

5906906,0,t3_3w6vaz,This is caused by either one of two things.. The cartridge was over loaded. One coil can hold a half gram of extract I suggest loading a new coil in two .g chunks so that you load a buffer into the coil and melt that in with a second or two heat pop the mouthpiece on then load another quarter gram which is the vaporizing load on top reassemble and pulse power gently until you get vapor. Over loading will cause oil to dump into the lower reclaim chamber and eventually leak out.. Not enough air was drawn through the cartridge while the oil was hot so it dumped into the reclaim chamber to cool down. The Hercules can get very hot and while its titanium coils will hold cool oil indefinetly hot oil will want to run out of the device through the air inlet holes. This is an intentional design in order to eliminate the chance of overheating and cooking your oils while they sit next to a super hot heating element theyll flow downwards to escape excessive heat if left unattended.To prevent this be sure to draw air through the Hercules at the end of your hit and in between you hits for a few seconds in order to keep the oils up top. You can hold the Herc horizontally if you wish.Then at the end of a session be sure to cool down the unit by drawing air through it until the stainless core has cooled and is no longer warm to the touch. This can take just a few moments after a puff or two but might require a minute or two of gentle cool down draws after a serious session.Once youve learned to use the Hercules well enough to perform cool down draws and keep your oils up top and recognize when it needs a reload loss of vapor production or any excess time needed to achieve good vapor youll be able to simply add .g chunks at a time and keep vaping for grams on end. Many Herc power users report using a half ounce or more of extracts between any major maintenance on their Hercules.,Waxpen,cxtxflq,6,t5_30gcq

It works well well compared to every other pen and portable Ive used for now but Im curious your temp settings did you try temps around  Celsius?  Lower was not as good and higher caused lots more splatter which was messy.,Waxpen,cxvqxm6,2,t5_30gcq
5955263,0,t1_cy05iiq,So in vape speak a mod is a battery. The original term came from modified battery cases I believe. We have mech mods box mods and stick mods. A stick mod is like an Evo a box mod is a box and a mech mod is batteries in a case with a switch and no chips for regulating voltage. Coils have names too like fused or twisted or claptons. You build coils to whatever spec you want. You can make little guys for egos or big ones for mech mods or whatever you want as long as it doesnt draw too much power from the battery. The coil dictates how much energy is needed to create heat. Thicker and or longer wire means less resistance which means more power is required to heat it. It also means more surface area which means bigger clouds. So if you have large dual coils with low resistance you can create a good heavy vapor at low temps which gives you good flavor less chance of combustion less coil wear and less chance of harmful vapors being produced. ,Waxpen,cy09kh9,3,t5_30gcq

The best options for wick out there are the fc black ceramic and quartz for inertness.  The best wire out there will be ti gr gr oxidizes faster until research proves otherwise.  There are ceramic donut heaters that are safer than metal wire but they tend to be for smaller lower temp hits.  I personally use a hercules sr which is the only true ceramic heating element with gr ti sponge to hold the oils.

I also dont know why you assume that if you dont have temp control youre going to crack the donut when TC is just another way to display the wattage. Knowing the right wattage is the same thing as knowing the temp so that argument is invalid.

7122082,0,t1_d1nfc1p,You guys are both incorrect and Im not trying to be a dick at all by downvoting you but it is incorrect information. The VTC is both VVVW. When you adjust the watts you are adjusting the voltage as well look at the screen.The VTC mini absolutely has more than enough power to properly fire the white . volt rod. It operates in DCDC and steps up the batteries voltage unlike some other mods. An  by itself can only push out around . volts simple circuit I.e. Ecig mechanical mod. However the chip in the VTC is capable of pulling more than twice the voltage out of the  granted for a much shorter amount of time through computer chip magic that I will not pretend to understand. The thing that sets it apart from some other mods as far as the Hercules is concerned is that it is also using DCDC. The resistance of the rod will change when it is heated and because of this DCDC mode there will be a constant . volts applied throughout the heating cycle during a hit. The VTC will act as if the resistance isnt changing.Other mods Im looking at you Sigelei  are not using DCDC. So even though it is a  battery mod it doesnt work with the Hercules. You can actually see while hitting it the resistance change from . up to . As the rod heats up less and less power is being applied. No Bueno. My dual  Sigelei is basically useless at firing the herc. The VTC hits like a train with only one battery.Fun fact with the VTC you can flip the screen by holding down the  buttons with the device off. This way you can see the hit timer and repress the button before the  second timeout.,Waxpen,d1np32y,3,t5_30gcq

7402620,0,t1_d2jlqlf,Im cool with how much the AC v can hold.  I was just commenting on what I had inferred about using the donut which may improve flavor but may only be useful for loading a very small amount.  The gen  Kiss carts likely would be the same as the AC v in that they can hold an adequate amount but lose flavor after the firstsecond hit.  In either case good flavor but only one or two hits OR deep enough tank but nonexistent flavor after one or two hits Im wondering if there are greater possibilities or whether I should just buy midlevel concentrates for the omicron.  As an aside I dont really understand why people buy the herc.  It looks big and unless you construe portable as going to your friends house to use in closed quarters it seems to inhabit a place between a rig and a pen.  For my purposes that has little value.

7568557,0,t1_d32cc68,The burnt taste is likely coming from bits of plant matter or other contaminant left behind in extraction. Thats built up around the coil and when heated causes an off flavor. it also creates a thermal barrier preventing proper heat transfer from the heated wire to the oil forcing you to heat the wire hotter so the heat will radiate and conduct through the layer of buildup.I suggest checking out our coil cleaning guide at  and once cleaned trying a different extract You can always check a questionable extract with the foil test too.,Waxpen,d32iaqr,3,t5_30gcq

It will also make the Herc very dirty and will require extensive cleaning. It is most certainly not recommended but possible yes.The newest unit from puffitup Herc SRZ comes with a . ohm heating rod. This requires a mod box capable of . volts. The other heating rod sold from WTech is the . volt rod. I use the Herc srz on my evic vtc mini and it works just fine at  watts.

8066318,0,t1_d4iscfk,First I like the way this being handled and Im very impressed to see how open mod team is to suggestions. I agree and understand that someone needs to facilitate the making of the rules and I think youd be a great person to do that. It would be great for the community to create the rules together but even if we do that there needs to be at least one person ideally a few that makes the rules official and like I said I think youd be great for that. If you dropped your moderator status then I suppose you wouldnt have permission to write the rules to the sidebar but I really dont think the writing of the rules is a very big deal overall. Its the enforcement of the rules that gets things murky. As far as I know theres no way for a user to see which posts or comments are being deleted by the moderators. If youre saying the problem is that if you were to step down the current team isnt active enough to handle the important and necessary work of removing spam and enforcing the rules then thats a bit of a different problem. We certainly cant have you step down and then have an overwhelmed and ineffective moderator team. Is that the problem?

9482982,0,t1_d9hxzfv,Battery safety is the most important thing. Over at relectroniccigarette theres a guy named Mooch he takes the time and tests out batteries to see which are safe which are correctly labeled etc.Ohms law is a simple formula to understand but theres a fantastic website to learn from There are a few types of mechs from the single tube type to the dual battery type. With a dual battery setup it can be either series or parallel battery configuration. With a single tube you can have either a hybrid top or a pin.Confused yet? Good no not really. This is stuff you learn along the way but here is the critical thing about mech mods knowing the limits of the battery and the build on your RDA.Let me give you an example.Lets say I have a single tube mech mod doesnt matter the type. And I am going to use a Sony VTC Battery. This is a mah battery rated at  amps.So its time to make my coils now I have to make my coils according to my batteries. So there is a range you need to be in to stay safe.If I make a . Ohm coil then I am only using  amps I am safe and well under my  amp threshold.If I make a . ohm coil then it jumps up to  amps. Still safe but that will drain the battery quicker.If I make a . ohm coil then Im pushing  amps this is a nono zone this is where failure can happen this is when batteries pop this is when you see some kid in the news because his mech mod exploded. well besides putting loose batteries in the pocket with keys and coinsSo making sure you have the correct build paired with your battery is the most important thing.I know this is a lot of info to take in at once but if you want to learn something you will learn it. Its not bad once you get into it. Gotta remember to always use the resources to find out what you are doing what is safe and what is not.Mech mods are great because there is nothing to mess with. Setup your coils to your battery and go. It just requires a bit more safety and due diligence when using and handling these devices.Any more questions Ill be happy to answer or check out relectroniccigarette and dont forget about ,Waxpen,d9hzcow,5,t5_30gcq

There is always some material in there somewhere.But yeah check the reclaim chamber.COOL DOWN the unit.Otherwise it will all leak and youll be stuck smoking your reclaim which isnt the ideal way to go about things.The herc offers full flavorful hits down to the last hit. which the rest of the guys only offer for the first few puffs.The maintanance and learning curve are a bit of a hassle but it is not too hard.I recommend iso alcohol prep pads.Have a bunch laying around.After every use take the heatshield off and giive the whole unit an exterior wipedown. Also wipe the screw threads on the outer pieces otherwise you gonna end up getting the mouth piece stuck when the wax hardens.It takes a while for this thing to become second nature.I am two weeks in an so far enjoying the journey.

They have to put work into it to keep it perfect but they are obsessed with that signature Harley rumble. Herc users are similar learn how it works and you can get rips as large or small as you like and the flavor is better than any other option.

10632480,0,t1_ddc2wu5,Yeah the Sai is the Atomizer  its the part that you put your wax into and you hit on it.BUT the atomizer needs power and thats what a mod provides  safe regulated power.The mod allows you to control the power level to the coil  its not JUST a battery in fact manymost mods you have to buy the battery that goes into the mod  it makes sure you dont burn your dab and that you dont blow your face off.Dont let me scare you theyre very safe as long as you operate them properly.Dont stress this stuff is actually easier than you think  just a bit of new terminology  do lots of reading here and on the internet and you can get very comfortable with this.The cool thing is you can get a REALLY KICK ass rig for a pretty damn good price.  HVT has some great units but if you have a mod or access to one theres no reason you cant or shouldnt go with a better option  you do need a SUB OHM capable mod if youre going to pick your own make sure of that  oh and a nice to have feature is TC or Temp Control  thats nice to have with the Stainless Steel coils.Anyway keep asking questions and reading and its simpler than it first sounds  if you want background info a google search for vaping  will provide lots of background info from the ecigg vaping world  we borrow lots of terminology and devices and technology from them  in fact the current recommended mods were developed as ecigg devices they just also work as dab devices which is really good for us.,Waxpen,ddcnr7q,1,t5_30gcq

10639900,0,t3_5s9wrb,Forgive me if m istaken but those Yocan coils look like they are  threaded if they are then they should be compatible with a more high powered box mod I reccommend the Pico Wits fairly small and very powerful and can be had for around  it will give you much more versatility and will be compatible with every other popular wax device so you only have to buy one device as opposed to buying devices with proprietary battery connections which are usually crap anyway and only made proprietary so these companies can sell their crappy ego batteries at a  markup.This suggestion all depends on the Evolve plus coils being  compatible Which I cant test because I dont have one.If you have a friend who vapes nicotine ejuice on a variable wattage box mod see if he can screw in and fire your coils on his mod If he can I would say def get the Pico now and upgrade to a Saionara later.edit  the coils look  threaded but the atomizer housingmouthpiece appear to be ego threaded in which case you would need an ego to   adapter like So if you were to get the Pico it would be like  plus  for the adapter and around  for the  battery this setup would be light years ahead of the evolve plus in versatility and would be ready for you to pop on pretty much any other device of your choosing,Waxpen,dddfa3g,1,t5_30gcq

11228747,0,t1_df4hnns,i personally fucking love my herc but the AC is seriously some antiquated shit. reminds me of the days i fucked with kandypens and puffco. pretty basic shit all around. gave it to a homie that needed a device while his herc was out of commission. its really kinda depressing me how this is going because with an attitude like this his business isnt gonna make it and hercs arent going to always be around. i absolutely love my saionara as well. theyre both the top of the line for what i want. i cant tell you that if i had to choose one id choose the sai i love my herc that much. i do like that hes heavily invested in his materials and has literally no plastic bs inside it but teflon is a very strong material that holds up til like c and its not in direct contact with anything. doesnt seem to worry me. i remember being very confused by sams firing. dude really really cared about the product. says a lot about this dude to cut someone so fucking dedicated loose for wreckitralph. cmon gary get your shit together. we need you to because a mini herc  would be fucking amazing and forgiveness is always possible in such a warmloving community like the cannabis community. nobody is out to get you. we all just want the best productservice like we all deserve.,Waxpen,df4rhzj,4,t5_30gcq

Frequent use on the highest setting White will present a shorter lifespan. We recommend the middle setting blue for daily use. Packing the chamber beyond capacity may cause damage to the chambercoil. Also please be aware that using any tool to pack or clean the pen can damage or short the chamber.

I figured you were looking for a generic one to reverse engineer didnt realize you were looking for something to hold you over.  is around the throwaway price point for me.

IF you can disassemble a coil and reassemble it correctly. orIF you buy the preemptied coil sets and put them together.Both of those are completely  possible and completely out of grasp for most mainstream Im trying not to use the word normie users. RDAs won over the vaping crowd because it was complex but not too complex. Simple enough once you do it once or twice but certainly prone to a lot less failures as say rebuilding an oldschool Kanger coil. Which also was possible. These two markets mirror each other in so many ways its practically funny. The wax scene no doubt in part because of legality issues is about  or  years behind thats all. ,Waxpen,dfkhffv,1,t5_30gcq

The Sai is easier to open and close than the AC has better airflow and better flavor in most cases. If you want a glass globe as well as the metal top the AC would be the best route or the Miracle S. The Sai doesnt have a glass globe unfortunately. I dont think the Divine Tribe does either. Could be wrong though.,Waxpen,dgydauc,1,t5_30gcq
