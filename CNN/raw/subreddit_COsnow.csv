2011686,0,t1_ckvl17k,Vail is a shit show on the front side stay in the back bowls hit up some of the tree stashes by Outer Mongolia and in Blue Sky then the trees over in game creek are filled with pow for days. My best day of the season last year was at Vail at the end of March. I knew some guys that knew all the good spots that werent all skied out by people and it was fucking amazing. If you suck and can only ski groomers why waste the money on a lift ticket there anyway. Just go to Keystone with the rest of the gapers.  TLDR Vail sucks if you dont know where to go get there early and get to the back where Vail shines. ,COsnow,ckvlsok,1,t5_2sznc

3382307,0,t1_cpdskex,Find a bootfitter no amount of research will help you fit a boot better than hands on experiences of a boot fitter.Booys are the one item to buy full price in person.Also get the cork footbeds and pay the extra fee for custom shaping.It will make you a better skiier and your boots can fit so well you forget to take them off at the end of the day.,COsnow,cpdt4no,2,t5_2sznc
3382776,0,t1_cpdrtin,A surf shop in Cali??? For ski boots in Colorado? Haha no. You onviously didnt go to a reputable boot fitter your advice is not helpful at all.Reting ski boots will not help they are not fitted and not premium at all they will be soft flex crap with lots of padding and while comfortable will egativly impact OPs ability to ski.Heat molding will only make a boot worse if it is the wrong boot to start which means heat molding isnt the problem at all.TLDR  Dont listen to this users advice on anything ski related.... Guns and reasearch chemicals are his thing not sports equipment.,COsnow,cpdv20y,-1,t5_2sznc

If you plan to go even when there is storm dumping in the mountains snow tires will have many benefits and worth it.
