210452,0,t1_cescwkz,Yeah but he best watch the middle range it has a terrific amount of power and if you wind it on and let the power build they can catch you off guard. Just saying these are monster bikes with huge power and we should make sure OP knows that. When a  runs up the revs breaks traction and has a slide its quick but after a second your out of power and the bike just flaccidly screams it head off bouncing on the limiter. In contrast the throaty boom of the hyper bike will burn you if you fuck up. I saw a guy on the highway put a wheelie down in second he brought it down going maybe kph. The front bounced and he ended up with his weight all backward and he whiskey throttled that thing into a wheelie back up to or so. He binned it looped it out and it was a long way from out of power when his wrist left the clip on. now s do make peaky power but its not going to loft you up like that as an offering to the highway at a hundred miles an hour. TLdr get the bussa. The engine has predictable power. A lot of predictable power. ,CalamariRaceTeam,cf2ey34,1,t5_2ufz8
305113,0,t3_1xki28,I blew this up after two weeks on it. I was putting down m wheelies and progressed to I guess a km in the two weeks and it went bang. Well it went tat tat tat tat rat rat rarrt raggghhhhh ............ Bang.My advice would be to just play on it. Use the clutch try different rpms speed clutch inputs and amount of preload. Its a complex equation based on feel so just get feeling. Start off with little lifts and just keep rocking it higher. You will suck for a bit but dont rush. Rushing takes skin in big chunks. Once you get it up for a second practice using the brake to bring it down. Make the brake second nature to bring it down and you progress faster than you would if you just kept practicing wheelies to the balance point. Note that sv has a limited life while you learn to wheelie. The easiest wheelies by far are close to redline where the power is muted and the compression braking is strong. Unfortunately this screaming revving with the bike at balance point starves oil fast. Easiest place for you to wheelie is the exact place you will lunch the engine. You will wheelie like this for months as you progress find balance point and begin to slow down the wheelie. Your sv doesnt have months. I suggest playing on this bike while you can only wheelie for a few seconds which is fine and then moving on to something else when your wheelies hit five seconds duration.TLdr have a potter on the sv but if you find yourself getting long wheelies and wanting to progress further you need to change bikes. ,CalamariRaceTeam,cfce4pq,6,t5_2ufz8

1755183,0,t3_2ekceg,It doesnt take anything special to switch from a sportbike to a sumo.  If anything the riding position is much MUCH more free and open  you can still drop a knee in a corner or you can stick a leg out if you prefer.  There is debate as to when to use which  from what Ive read and experimented with kneeout in the long sweepers and legout for sharptight turns.  Or just do whatever feels fun.  You can also stand up to see over traffic and absorb bumps speed bumps become your bitch.    Sumos also got me interested in dualsportdirtbikes.  For some reason I was not interested in riding dirt until the first time I took my WRX off of the asphalt and on to some rocky dirt.  Right away I recognized a lust for adventuring off of the paved path and now the only thing keeping me from riding my bike somewhere weird is fear of getting caught and slapped with some fines which I think is not something you have to worry TOO much about.  Being able to ride legally until you decide to do something more mischievous is what makes sumodualsport so fun to me.IMO the only tradeoff is that supermotos are not as sexy as sportbikes.  Even the coolest fastest shiniest sumos just dont have the sleek curves compact profile and overall reputation as even a Ninja  to the layman bystander.  I sold my  Fireblade a month after I got my sumo but only because I was already seriously dating someone that didnt give a shit about either bike.  ,CalamariRaceTeam,ck0ecy5,3,t5_2ufz8

It was precipitated by me filtering to the front on a set of lights something legal where I live. I gunned it m and looked back he ran to his car so I turned left at the next red lights legal after stopping and then slowed to normal speed I thought thered be cars between us but then all of a sudden he was approaching with speed and honking I split up the centreline for a bit and then made a hasty right turn legal but there was enough traffic he couldnt follow then made a few more turns to find a busy petrol station almost fell over parking my bike because my legs were shaking so much. There nerves made my riding very sloppy technique wise and making smart judgement calls is difficult. Id say Im a pretty smart guy normally and enjoy working under pressure but that much adrenaline makes your head seem all foggy. Considering my driving record isnt too bad and I dont carry anything illegal while Im riding Ive decided in advance that I will never intentionally run from the Police.

The buddy kinda cuts off some cager in a Corolla with a really bad paint job. Cager starts riding his ass and Im behind the Corolla. Were on the onramp to the interstate and my buddy takes off when it finally opens to the straight.So this fucking cager decides that hes going to block me from merging onto the interstate. He stays in the merge lane and then moves over exactly when I do. Then moves over another lane exactly when I do. Then back to the right exactly when I do.Now the merge lane is still open and Im pretty pissed off at this greenteal paint job old Corolla. I drop it down to second gear cry as Im opening that throttle so hard and painfully and whip it into the last bit of the merge lane. It runs out and I have to cut across the emergency lane for a split second and get around this damn Corolla.Cue car in front of me that I really honestly wasnt paying too much attention to. Cue slamming of brakes. Cue back tire skidding. Cue whipping it around this car I didnt see before and splitting between him and another car.

3801251,0,t1_cqpjbro,gt How they say noise isnt a good alerter on the road aswell is a tonne of bullshit. Because theyre right.  First its been studied the Hurt report found it had an effect of basically a rounding error ie no effect at all.  Wearing a hiviz jacket or a white helmet produced a margin of safety literally orders of magnitude higher. Second physics works against.  Waves propagate in the direction theyre started until they can reflect off something which means the sound from your pipe goes backward not doing a lot to warn anyone in front of you.  You can even measure the change with a dB meter behind the bike can easily be  dB while a reading at the headlights will be .  And decibels are logarithmic.Everyone loves the adage because it justifies bonerinducing pipes and it sounds catchy but in the real world it just doesnt bear any truth.  It sticks around because on a calm night you can hear a loud bike for three miles in any direction so it seems logically consistent everyone just forgets that under those same conditions a human voice can heard for enormous distances too but we dont espouse the benefits of screaming at oncoming drivers. If you want to use sound as an alerter you can because the manufacturer kindly fitted a forwardfacing noisemaker to your bike.,CalamariRaceTeam,cqpkmkh,2,t5_2ufz8

Sat around his bike for a min till he came back to his bike from the woods. Arrested him waiting for a call on what color the bike was. This bike was white. He got the call and then realized the bike was a different color and held him while searching the woods for dumped weed or whatever. He asked the guy why he was in the woods guy said he pulled off to take a piss. Cop was looking around but couldnt find anything. I saw a pile of black in the white snow on video but the cop didnt see it. The edges of the white bike were slightly black where it had been peeled.

The normal force is greater on the outside wheel so it has more traction and therefore drives the vehicle more than the inside tire and this works because he doesnt allow any wheel to completely gain traction only greater or lesser traction.

Not even making this shit up.When pulled over in my cage for speeding once when I was  they called about  additional cars  a drug dog to sniff the outside. Ultimately they let us go because I refused to let them search my car  even though they pressured me for about  fucking minutes.

Im unsure of electronic wastegates if theyre controllable on the fly from a dial etc. If most of the boost is going through the wastegate youre running the wrong turbo or its a street tune at  psi when you run  when racing someone. Modern diesels Im not sure. I know the turbo Im holding in my hand has an internal wastegate I havent delved into VGT Turbos or how modern stuff is. Most recent Ive worked with is  Dodge Rams with a VGT and an internal waste gate. Depending on the turbo you buy you will need a waste gate if it doesnt come with one or like me dont want to run the internal one because its junk in relation to a standalone. EDIT new stuff may have a computer that reads boost and controls the impeller location inside the turbos to get x boost at y rpm and a z max. ,CalamariRaceTeam,d8ses7m,1,t5_2ufz8

Snow drifting up and down my road in the miata and my funhating neighbor jumped from his bush in front of me mid slide. Hes lucky Ive got bald all seasons because he managed to not get hit since I was going so slow. He literally walked faster than I drove to my house to tell me how dangerous it is. So is walking in front of moving cars big guy. Thats not the first time hes jumped in front of me either.I dont even do bad shit other than the one time in the miata. I know everyone in the neighborhood and all my other neighbors love talking to me about my bike and they had no problem with us testing out the go kart me and the boys found and fixed up. He called the cops on us like dude your fucking rideon is louder than the kart was and we werent on the thing at  in the fucking morning either. WHO MOWS THAT EARLY IT WAS SUMMER I WANTED TO SLEEP. He even knocked over the trees we used for cover in the woods for airsoft when we were in high school. Were polite we dont throw crazy ass parties everyone loves us.
