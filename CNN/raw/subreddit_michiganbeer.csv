4438140,0,t3_3bvpd2,I think you are going to see a lot more experimentation in this space in michigan. The problem with sour beer is that for a standard brewery it is not that easy to make sours. You have to deal with longer fermentation chance of infection and an increase in complexity that most places arent ready to really lock down. Shorts is experimenting with sours though for example the bucktricutioner is a pretty good Berliner and  of their new Stache series have been sour.What michigan needs is a brewery dedicated to the craft the likes of hill farmstead de garde sara etc. i hope one day soon it happens though.  Jolly Pumpkin comes close and I feel they have had a recent uptick in quality so maybe we will continue to see better and better things coming from them. The  recent semi limited offerings have all been fantastic.,michiganbeer,csq4258,4,t5_2s9ev

5462784,1,t3_3puz5c,So on their first day of business you expect them to be perfect?! What is wrong with you? Give them a chance to get their footing. Closing a kitchen at  is pretty much the standard time for every restaurant everywhere especially in smaller cities the obvious exceptions are Dennys and Steak n Shake but Id be willing to bet that theyre going for something a little different than those standard bearers. ,michiganbeer,cw9x7cw,5,t5_2s9ev

6423988,0,t1_czfjcgr,My biggest problem with this limited beer allocations.This may be an unpopular view around here but it seems like breweries that expand end up sending their flagship limited beer allocations away from Michigan.
