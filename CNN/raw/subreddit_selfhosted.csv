3675334,0,t3_2zzndj,A home server is one way to go but depending on what you ultimately want to use your servers for a VPS might be a better option.I have a couple of cheap VPS instances from providers I found on lownedbox.com  These usually use OpenVZ or something similar and offer a selection of preinstalled distros.  When you set one up you normally get a VM running your chosen distro assigned to a static IP  you set a root password via the web interface SSH in and start setting things up on the shell.The primary things Ive got running are OwnCloud for file sync Mozilla sync for my browser CalDAV and CardDav TTRSS for my feeds ZNC for IRC SimpleID for OpenID and COPS for OPDS access to my Calibre Library which is stored in my OwnCloud directory.  All of these are webapps so Ive got Nginx as a generalpurpose web server as well which I use for static page hosting and a few PHP scripts for personal use itd naturally make a good development testbed for webapps as well.I personally dislike using web frontends most of the stuff I use my VPS for is to serve as a data storagesynchronization host for applications I use primarily on desktop or mobile platforms.  I use the OwnCloud client for file sync on my various PCs or access it as a mounted WebDAV share.  Its Mozilla sync module works with my Pale Moon installs on Windows Linux and Android.  The CalDAV and CardDAV functions synchronize my calendar and contact list between Thunderbird on the PC and various Android apps on my phone.  ZNC provides the connection point for Quassel on the PC and YAIRC on Android.  COPS gives me access to my ebook library from FBReader and Aldiko on my phone.,selfhosted,cqb7n8j,1,t5_32hch

7070209,0,t1_d1hpyqb,Im going to say not really. As long as you take decent steps to secure your server e.g. Disable Password Auth Change Default Ports etc... you should be pretty much fine. Also follow the basic email server hardening guidelines as well such as disallowing unauthenticated SMTP and ensuring all nodes are encrypted. As to security against password breaches by hackers Im going to say that its even more secure than something like GMail. I find it unlikely that a hacker would spend a significant amount of effort against a wellhardened server to collect about  email addresses and passwords when they can do mil.I do have a secondary layer of protection for my primary email server though which is my XEAMS appliance. All SMTP transactions must first go through Xeams and is then routed when insured to be secure to my main mail box. All IMAPPOP is accessed directly to the main box but IMAP can only be compromised so much. Xeams does a great job with security and actively weeds out any threats it detects like unauthenticated HELO and inbound viruses. So to make it short there shouldnt be any issues as long as you follow online guides about securing your servers. ,selfhosted,d1hrrtl,1,t5_32hch

You can have a pool of  addresses or whatever you like it doesnt matter but you want your home serve to always have the same address.Now with your home server connected to the VPS you can install something like postifx and have it forward email to your home servers address.You can get creative with an OpenVPN router at home routing protocols and whatever.  I use postifx on my VPS and have it connect to my exchange server.The VPS needs to be a server because its static and on the internet unlike your email server.
