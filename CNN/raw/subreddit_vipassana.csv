Eventually I used those thoughts as a trigger to bring me back to the present. Some thoughts are subtle and before you know it your mind can be far away but I noticed these recent concerns had a pretty distinct flavor so I could use them to remind me to go back to something simple like breath and start again.Ultimately it takes time and work. Just never forget that there is value in every experience no matter what it is. Just observe.Have you done a  day ?,vipassana,cnvgt7n,3,t5_2s5ys

6582203,0,t3_45rzef,First of all Id like to clarify whether or not you mean a Goenka retreat.  If soA friend of mine did this last year she did the retreat in MyanmarBurma and went to Cambodia and Thailand after.  While traveling in general seemed fine after she complained of the large crowds in southeast Asian cities being far to loud fast and chaotic for the first week after.  she had lived in Asia all year so was otherwise accustomed to crowdsShe said she wished she could have avoided big cities for several more days and said that she kind of panicked and got on a train to the coast ASAP and everything was better in a few days.  It will definitely change the dynamic of your trip.  I went to Mardi Gras two weeks after mine and it definitely positively influenced my trip. ,vipassana,d005jfs,1,t5_2s5ys
