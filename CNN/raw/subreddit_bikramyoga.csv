814585,0,t3_2232p2,I practice  daysweek. Because of my work schedule I often practice early in the morning  AM. But my body always feels much better at the end of the day  PM or  PM classes. I am more warmed up and I find I am less sore post PM classes. On the flip side I feel a bit stronger in the morning. The difference in the way I experience class isnt so much about the days of the week I practice but rather the time of day.,bikramyoga,cgwveg9,1,t5_2sd0g
2914947,0,t3_2tiv5t,For me when Im in the zone I go  times a week. Everything is easier about it when youre on a schedule like that. I feel stronger in the classes and it requires less motivation to show up. In fact I hunger for it. The holidays knocked me off my schedule and Ive been having a hard time getting back on. Going once or twice a week makes the classes harder to get through and tougher to get myself to show up. ,bikramyoga,cnzfqva,3,t5_2sd0g

Any clothing made from sports fabric should be fine  these are often marketed as dryfitmoisture wickingquick dry. I prefer snug clothing crop tops short shorts as it both stays in place better and has less fabric to soak up sweat. ,bikramyoga,dewclr9,2,t5_2sd0g
