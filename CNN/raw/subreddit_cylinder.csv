340789,0,t1_cfg2yi5,Wow. You bought  things and act like its a lot. I have  repos with no loading problems. A handful have less then  packages in it. The only time youd have problems with loading or maxing out packages is having a bunch of pirate repos. ,cylinder,cfg3cia,2,t5_309w3

438946,0,t1_cfq956i,Let me get this straight I dont want to misinterpret youYou believe that Wave is too fast so you tried to modify it and your modified version of it wont work. I just want to make sure what I wrote isnt buggyAre you on an iPad? The icons move at a pace of .x where x is the percent offset of the currently moving icon this gives them a feeling of acceleration and I only tested on an iPhone so on an iPad that could have them end up moving pretty fast.If that is the case Ill look into capping their speed. If that isnt the case then idk It animates almost exactly the same as Barrel does at least on my iPhoneA video would help me understand too.,cylinder,cfq9fl4,1,t5_309w3
