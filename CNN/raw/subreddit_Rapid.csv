183241,0,t3_1vtxy3,Hey everyone!As you might have guessed my name is Matthew and I joined the server on Wednesday. Ive already joined up with two other members and have begun work on a decentsized village that rests on a mountain relatively close to the new spawn border. Im a huge fan of building towns and anything that brings people together so let me know ingame if youre interested in joining my project!As for my reallife self Im from Texas and currently work as a middle school special education teacher. I graduated from UT Austin with a degree in Psychology and intend to return to school within the next couple years to obtain my masters in Clinical. Im definitely a people person so dont be afraid to start a conversation with me!Looking forward to meeting everyone ingame and thanks again for having me!,Rapid,cezb3mi,2,t5_2ya1w

And I was thinking even smaller than the Mindcracks  radius  provided we had enough animals and biome variants in that space I find it much more enjoyable to build very close to others P.Also another idea we could build some kind of shrine that would increase the world border when something is done or something is thrown in diamonds?. This way we could all work on a common goal and would regularly return to the centre of the world. Im sure this could be done easily with command blocks and hoppers so Bukkit wouldnt have to be present as the borders are only available in snapshots while Bukkit isnt.Then the only problem is BungeeCord access to creative worlds etc wont be available in the snapshots nor chest protection or horse protection. If we update to the snapshots  which we definitely should . has been out for  months  we would lose these and would have to be stricter on who joins but that wouldnt be too bad.,Rapid,cjbqpns,2,t5_2ya1w
