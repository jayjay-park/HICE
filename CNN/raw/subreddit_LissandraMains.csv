6232590,0,t1_cyy22bw,I could line up Qs to poke on her. But I wouldnt get enough to proc thunderlords. However her QW chunks for more than my single Q. And this was the problem. There was no trade I could win. Id have to dodge three Qs in a row and land all my Qs still no thunderlords proc. Meanwhile she had more MR than I did runes and then chalice.In a perfect team environment I could certainly manage to dodge one rotation of hers timed with a gank. Basically make her miss her Q then E onto her WQ along with jungler coming in. Pre were sure to get a kill.But my jungler left me alone. Alas.,LissandraMains,cyy2sy3,1,t5_390en

8094577,0,t1_d4o35v1,i tend to agree with morello gt roa for burst. but liss doesnt have alot of range and one of your best moves is engage and bursting the team to half so the rest of your team is on clean up. being squishy seems not that good. ,LissandraMains,d4pwj5q,1,t5_390en

8708357,0,t1_d6ru7ag,In the early game where a large majority of your damage comes from base damages  mpen is huge especially since opposing mids usually only have  MR unless they build abyssal.,LissandraMains,d6u6i2j,1,t5_390en

10803904,0,t1_ddu1njz,Same. But do you have the problem of it still targeting an enemy if your cursor is anywhere near them?Maybe I have a target self with R instead of an ult self if you get what I mean... Ill check next game.,LissandraMains,dduchnc,1,t5_390en
11329579,0,t1_dfcfuvl,It looks like early mana costs are down late mana costs on W are slightly up but her base mana pool and mana regen is significantly buffed.,LissandraMains,dfg6t86,1,t5_390en
