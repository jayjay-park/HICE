230626,0,t1_cf4navf,Because Windows takes up so much storage a gb device would probably leave you with gb of storage left.  Thatll be enough to install a handful of programs but I think youd probably hit that limit really quickly.  Almost all the reviews Ive seen for gb devices mentioned they wish they had gotten the gb version.  You can expand storage up to gb with a microSD card so theres that option as well.  But I think if youre gonna spend this kind of money spend a little bit more and get something that you wont be disappointed with.,tablets,cf4nhs2,3,t5_2rh7l

379729,0,t1_cfjvdsm,Sorry driver.  When I bought mine in late November people were complaining about how bad the pen was.  An update came out and seemed to resolve this so I installed it.  Later another update or more came out and brought other issues.  I only installed the first one and it seems to work fine.The major issue with the Dell pen is if you use it with the Dell case the proximity of the pen to the tablet in the elastic holder causes the battery to detect use constantly and youll go through a fresh battery in a day.  I have to keep my pen somewhere else which means when I want to use it its no where nearby.  It was kinda a waste of money  esp considering a nonpwered pen with a fine point would do a better job and not require a strange hard to find battery AAAA,tablets,cfk4hjj,0,t5_2rh7l

2340013,0,t1_cm0w6qv,I dont have an exact number for the data transfer speed of the Micro SD XC card but its a Class UHC  which I also got from Micro Center for . I have Skyrim The Orange Box and Portal  installed on the card as well an offline dump of the Wikipedia database with WikiTaxi and as far as I can tell theyre all loadingrunning as fast as if they were installed to a local hard disk. Skyrim takes slightly longer for the splash menu to pop up around  seconds but once youre in the game the load screens are fine and it plays perfectly normally.Speccydxdiag says the GPU is Intel HD Graphics no series number with MB of available memory. From what I understand integrated GPUs in tablets actually run slightly faster than their laptop and desktop counterparts simply because of the way the components are arranged and their proximity to each other.The Skyrim frame rates arent terribly impressive but neither are they horrible. I havent installed Fraps but Im guessing somewhere above  but nowhere near . This is with all lowest settings except for view distance set to max. The rates go up when the view distance is decreased but the trade off is worth the hit and the game is easily playable. Im much more impressed with the Portal and HalfLife  frame rates even at max settings and Ive also seen videos on YouTube of the device running Crysis. Ive also been experimenting with the Overwolf TouchFox controller for Skyrim but it seems to cause Skyrim to lock up so keyboard and mouse is still required.,tablets,cm0xsg8,2,t5_2rh7l

3887093,0,t3_34xmos,Well the NVIDIA Shield Tablet has a more powerful CPUGPU over the LG. The Shield also has dual front facing speakers which is significantly better than any rear facing speaker. I get about  hours of battery life for nongaming tasks with the Optimized Power Profile which is already about  hours more than what I got from my Nexus  . You can further tweak the Max CPU CoresMax CPU FrequencyFrame Rate Limit and squeeze more battery life out of it at the expense of performance if you desire. The Shield also comes with a stylus which seems to work reasonably well NVIDIA will also be updating the Shield to Android . soonThe only annoyance you might have is that there is audible coil whine when youre very close to the tablet.For  the Shield is by far the best bang for the buck tablet out today but if all youre doing is reading and little to no videoaudio consumption or youre always on headphones there are far cheaper tablets for the job with better battery life.

4903864,0,t1_cucm1p0,Ive run into the same problem as you in the past and present re games vs school. I dont have any advice for that directly else I would be much more successful myself.I do see a problem though. Anything that will run Solidworks decent enough will also play games pretty well. Even the lowerend stuff Im looking at plays a lot of games acceptably. So if youre hoping the switch to a tablet will help with that I really dont think it will. That comes from selfcontrol and goalsetting and all that bullshit youd be much better off asking somebody else about. and actually if I was to give some advice here it would be definitely get that figured out sooner rather than laterMy actual suggestion which is similar to my own current plan but for different reasons based on what Im seeing here is Keep the laptop or possibly downgrade a little something nonsli for starters P for some extra cash for the engineering stuff and then get a low or midlevel tablet. Theres some pretty good stuff out there in the  range especially refurbished portable make sure you get a good screen resolution. Potentially works out to less money spent and now you have two computers one much lighter for daily use dedicated to notes web browing and some of the lessprocessorgraphics intensive specialty stuff youre using. Then at home you can set it up next to you with notes or digital textbooks or video or web while using your workhorse laptop.That said if you do want a beefy tablet for one of the other reasons such as portable drafting opportunities a Surface something is probably still your best bet. I dont know how big you are on a stylus but this thread and this spreadsheet has some lists and opinions on stylus tablets and laptops and ins which include some of the higherend ones.If you do end up getting something nicer let me know your experiences on it with Solidworks and Autocad. Or even something midrange Id be curious.And to answer a question from your original post from what Ive seen yes you can reinstall Windows. If some reason you end up with a Chinese dualboot or something with Windows RT Ive heard some significant problems but youll probably stay away from those anyway. Upgrading from  to  or downgrading for some reason theres potential for driver problems but if youre just reinstalling the same version make sure you have the drivers available and you should be fine. Also have a USB keyboard handy because during the install process sometimes touchscreen and bluetooth drivers dont load. A docking keyboard might work too but I havent seen info on that.This ended up a bit longer than I had intended but hopefully something useful came out of it.,tablets,cuco48q,2,t5_2rh7l
4962306,0,t3_3ivlgk,took recent trip from the US to UK with my son we brought ipad . kindle fire hd nexus   windows tablet  windows tabletWe were ready for a  hour flight followed by a couple hours in the car. Overall the android tablets saw the most use as tablets. The windows tablets saw more use as netbooks than pure tablet mode but it was nice that they could have gone that route if needed.If I could only have brought  device each It probably would have been the nexus  and the larger windows tablet.The  nexus does all the things youre looking for and yet can still fit inside of larger pockets and likely can be found for pretty cheap these days.Decent windows tablets are going to be pricey. If theyre not pricey theyre likely not going to be as useful.Id only recommend an iPad if youre already overcommitted to the appleverse or simply love all things apple.

6778649,0,t3_48luoa,Combination of factors I think. The main thing being that a Surfacelike device without a removable keyboard isnt necessarily a plus so it wasnt a great tablet form factor yet it wasnt a great laptop form factor with the fixed screen angle.The slightly flexy carbon body probably also fared badly in term of layman perception of durability  which is why Apple builds a laptop out of probably one of the worse materials you could build one from but people lapha it up because aluminium really feels like metal cold and rigid which they often equate mistakenly with durability. And Apple clearly knows your very average Joe inside out.  It wasnt heavy for an Ultrabook  it was in fact the same weight as many of the lighter ones. It also went for almost  real hours not Apple hours. Expensive  not really for what it was. It was too heavy as a fulltime tablet though. Possibly related to its invisibility in the marketplace though not directly to its failure but it had a lot of Wifi issues more than the morepublicised Surface Pro  problems. I returned it because it was unusable in this regard especially at Ghz. Id get eight feet and right outside one wooden door away from an AP and Id have virtually no usable signal. Even the SP and the Macbook Pro the next worsts had an effective range double that. ,tablets,d0kn6jk,2,t5_2rh7l
