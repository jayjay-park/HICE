Any snow or ice and we separate out into  categories  people afraid to leave the house until the weather is over say .  Timid ones who leave the house but drive kph everywhere they go no matter the road condition probably .  Complete asshats who drive like its a regular day going at or above the posted speed limits just because they think they are invulnerable in trucks or all wheel drive cars and riding right on the bumper of the car in front of them about  and  people who are careful and safe on the ice driving slower than posted and leaving plenty of space between other cars a very small .Hope your plug wiremisfire is an easy problem to fix. if your going to have the coilwires off you may as well throw some plugs in for the hell of it not only to have some fresh plugs but to make sure some idiot in the past hasnt stripped a plug hole.

5677944,0,t3_3sv8x5,I own a  Titanium and ST. The ST is totally fine since its manual. Ive had issue with the Titanium transmission since about two weeks into owning the car. The transmission shudders in low gears occasionally grinds and sometimes fails to grab st or nd gear. Failing to grab a gear is especially scary when you need to make a quick move and the car doesnt go. Parking lot speeds are the worst. Its embarrassing to drive people in the car because its so bad at times. I have had it in the shop for more then  days for transmission repairs over two years just outside of being a lemon. They have reprogrammed the transmission probably  times replaced seals and the entire clutch. Ford is completely ignoring the problem and there are class action lawsuits in progress. The dealership will simply explain how the transmission is a automatically shifting manual transmission and what youre experiencing is within the expected tolerances. I could go into the dealer and yell and beg until I pass out but theres nothing they can do to fix it for good. At this point my only options are to deal with it or take a loss and get rid of it. My opinion is if you love the car buy one with a manual transmission. Save yourself the trouble. ,FordFocus,cx0wl9q,6,t5_2u0oe

I feel like I stole this one from the dealership. Its a  with k on the clock. Ended up out the door cheaper than the two s that were also here locally that all had kk on the them. Being a CPO car means I have a full warranty until k miles. It was a nobrainer. So far I am overjoyed with the purchase.

You simply take this out fit the flaps on the flaps bend to the shape of your wheel well and screw the flaps in using provided screws. They screw in to the existing holes that holds the fabric. Its actually really simple and RokBlokz provides instructions with their flaps. The only thing is that you probably should remove the rear wheels when installing because theres not a ton of room with them on.
