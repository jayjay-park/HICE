5181552,0,t3_3lxpue,A fun level I created Spiny Caverns  FAEDA Its Super Mario World  Cavebut everyone of my courses takes a little thought and has goodies scattered about them. Hopefully you see some you like!AlsoMario  ThemeAirship DCB I made a Mario  themed level Airbase Assault. It is on the Airship level format. Its a little long and a little tricky. I have three ups scattered about in all my levels. So far none are in hidden ? blocks yet.They require a little skilled jumping but nothing like some of these exact jumptiming some of the levels require.On my profile I have a Ghost Level as well. ,MarioMakerLevels,cvakey4,1,t5_38usf
