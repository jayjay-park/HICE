Manngt  In this groundbreaking work of science history and archaeology Charles C. Mann radically alters our understanding of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus in .Contrary to what so many Americans learn in school the preColumbian Indians were not sparsely settled in a pristine wilderness rather there were huge numbers of Indians who actively molded and influenced the land around them. The astonishing Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had running water and immaculately clean streets and was larger than any contemporary European city. Mexican cultures created corn in a specialized breeding process that it has been called mans first feat of genetic engineering. Indeed Indians were not living lightly on the land but were landscaping and manipulating their world in ways that we are only now beginning to understand. Challenging and surprising this a transformative new look at a rich and fascinating world we only thought we knew.gt .gt .gt .gt . gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt READ.. BOOK.. House..
