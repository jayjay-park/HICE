8653447,0,t1_d6na7ap,Yeah. Everybody on YouTube says Oh just stab them all over with a fork wrap them in foil and bake them for  minutes and they will turn out perfect. Yeah...I tried that..... hours later they were still pretty rock hard haha.,instantpot,d6namo7,2,t5_31q4c

10349019,0,t1_dcdgqxc,gt i can go to any of these recipe sites and just steal the ingredients list and instructions and put them on my own site with impunity.Actually you can copyright the instructions part. You just cant copyright a list of ingredient. For example I stole ABs Baked Macaroni and Cheese recipe changing it in a way he probably wouldnt approve of. When I did that I rewrote the assembly instructions from scratch so there were no copyright issues and then of course linked back to the original which is why stole is in quotes.Cookbook authors probably for the most part test and fine tune their recipes but to be honest theyre all probably stealing the inspiration from elsewhere.  ,instantpot,dch4dfv,1,t5_31q4c
10377321,0,t1_dck8thp,Not sure. It plays the tune but the plug doesnt pop up. I removed the seal and put it back in and tried some other suggestions Ive seen such as pressing down on the handles and smacking it? but I ended up opening it putting the lid on opening it putting the lid on again and again until finally the plug just popped up one time.,instantpot,dckbzy7,1,t5_31q4c

11792176,0,t3_685siz,The frozen ones i get say boil  to  minutes on the box.  Instant pot is usually half or a little less cool time for pasta products.  I might do Manual  minutes QR.Im weird in that i usually dont pan fry mine after heating through.  I like mine more like a pasta boiled and with tomato sauce.   If you do like them fried youll want to drain them temporarily put in a bowl set IP to Saute with a little oil.  Slice up some onions and get them started carmelizing then add pierogies.,instantpot,dgwolgl,2,t5_31q4c
