1936802,0,t3_2gpw76,Hey everyone brndnvn here. Im a  year old working student studying eventually music. I have no experience doing anything in this process aside from typing but Im very excited to learn. Im a Plat V veteran of  seasons and still climbinglearning. My current job allows me much time for watching streams and VoDs especially LPLGPLOGN. Though I do try to keep up with NA and EU LCS through VoDs and highlights. I will start to tackle a transcription after work today as well as head off another post with some FAQs and work flow ideas. Mobile makes these things hard. Great idea and thanks for the PM uMilldawg !,leagueofcaptions,ckmkqzz,1,t5_33lt8
