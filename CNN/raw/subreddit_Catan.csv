3113979,0,t3_2vq29n,Apparently I have an opinion on everyone elses pet peeve so I thought I should probably contribute my own. My pet peeve comes during a Cities amp Knights game when someone neglects hexes that produce resources that build knights in order to build their city on as much wood as possible and quickly obtain the aqueduct. This strategy alone doesnt annoy me it can be a very good strategy. What rubs me the wrong way is when people get mad at you for not handing over your knight stuff to them in the first round. You chose your own strategy and its not my responsibility to provide you with a knight. Maybe I dont need your wood. The least you could have done is offer up some of that paper but youve already spent it. So no Im sorry I wont save your city for a onetoone trade of something I dont need. ,Catan,cokrhms,1,t5_2s48q

During any round did you pick what turn you placed e.g. first second third or fourth  how did you choose? What turn do you like best i.e. if you had to pick blind?  . What was the most difficult adjustment you had to make playing in the tournaments vs. play onlinewith friends?  . How much tradingsmall talk goes on at nationals vs. worlds?  . Do you consciously play upmanage your table image?  . How would you have prepared betterdifferently?  . What do you think you do better than other players?  .

3582495,0,t3_31bkr6,Red wants the  or the  to start with a free road.  would also be good for maximizing their sheep output early. I dont think youre going to beat red to the sheep port unless you build on the sheep port. After claiming the sheep port theyre likely to either try beating you to the sheepwheat and if they dont think they can do that theyll go sheepport.Blue really wants the oreport. White I dont see anyone challenging white to the orewheat which means white isnt obliged to take anything other than a good wood tile to start. woodorebrick port is probably the best bet since it gives really strong road construction at the start and synergies with the  brick hex white already has.My starting play would be brickwheatlumber port with road going up to sheepwheat and bricklumbersheep with road going down to  woodore.

7118296,0,t3_4cpxa1,Discovery Catan with Base game or Cities and Knights. All tiles except deserts start flips over.. Tiles are only flipped over once a player builds a settlement on that tile.. Chits are placed at random once a tile is flipped.This mode tends to allow for more expansion because at the start people dont build all around the few red chits but instead build as far away from other people as possible. Unfortunately in this mode you can I havent seen this get completely screwed at the very start if you get unlucky with the chits  you get.Using development cards in Cities and KnightsInstead of buying knights the normal way you buy development cards for their regular cost Sheep ore wheat. If you draw a knight card you put the development card back and place an activated knight. If you get a victory point place the card face up and if you get anything else place it face down. This mode tends to make the game a bit faster since there are a few more victory points to go around but it is harder to beat the barbarians since sometimes you cant get a knight when you really need one.Dont use the robber at all.We played this way accidentally once where in an entire  hour game there was about  s rolled it was amazing and we completely forgot about the robber and never moved it.
