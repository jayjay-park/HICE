Dont overlook him!...He charges with Purple and yellow and his special move is to destroy  random yellow gemsat max level BUT he destroys the  gems AND the gems around those gems AND you get the full mana for all gems destroyed or skulls AND he also cleanses the whole team from harmful attacks such as poison and silence..After you use his attack dont be surprised if his attack is ready again and so is the other people on your team. Pair him with a goblin or a rockworm and you may have  turns in a row. Example....prioritze yellow and purple matches to get his power up...power him up....use his attack...he powers up the goblin...use goblin attack...Herdmaster may be ready again! if not it most likely only takes  more match to power him up.This is my team.....Black Dagger...Herdmaster...either rockworm or tankbot or anything else...goblin. Always make sure Herdmaster is powered up his power will refill everyone else. If you cant match yellow or purple match green and power up the goblin. he hits any enemy you want for  damage and you go again. Aside from some really really bad luck regarding drops on the game board i rarely lose.,GemsofWar,czsd5vv,1,t5_355gx

10240589,0,t3_5lsnn2,If you dont mind spending the gold for scouting and refresh casual PVP is great. You can spend up to  a pop between scouts and refresh but still cheaper than a gem. And I havent had any problems coming ahead moneywise even with that.I got about  points in an hour or so and wasnt exactly trying for speed. Much better than maybe getting  an hour with just explore. YMMV of course.,GemsofWar,dc4ttch,2,t5_355gx
