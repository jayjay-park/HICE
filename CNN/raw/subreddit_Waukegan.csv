2278584,0,t3_2hrlgh,Computer store  hobby electronics. Big box places only care about prebuilt brandname setups so theyre practically useless. And Radio Shack turned into a joke compared to what they used to carry. I want to be able to find parts for throwing together my own custom system. And if the computer is down for some reason how am I going to get on the internet to order the part I need?A hackerspacemakerspace lab would also be cool too. Has to be fairly affordable to join though.Its pretty bad that despite being the th largest city in the state you always have to drive almost an hour out of town for stuff.,Waukegan,cltco3p,2,t5_2v0sq
