4877110,0,t1_cu980ae,gt Is there something in the bitcoin core that allows you to assume constant fees? What limits how much in fees a miner can charge?No you are right the fee market is missing in my posting. The miners can choose the minimum fee as they like and the users choose the fee they want to pay.  My assumption of constant fees is a bit biased as I hope that bitcoin will remain highly competitive with other payment methods and leave the fees at a few cents the amount in bitcoin may change when the price of bitcoin goes up. The fee market is quite complicated.  In principle users can choose to not pay any fees and without any artificial scarcity of blockchain space the chance is high that someone will mine it eventually.  Or the miners can build a mutual agreement to not mine anything below a certain fee in some sense the core implementation did this since very few miners changed the default minimum fee.  In principal one may even fix a minimal fee via a soft fork but that does not really fit with the ideology of Bitcoiners.Some people want the blocks to stay limited to MB or grow very slowly so that a fee market occurs which means that the fee is what people are maximally willing to spend.  Since in this scenario it is not possible to increase the supply to handle the increased demand the fee may get really high and only the wealthiest can use Bitcoin directly.,bitcoin_uncensored,cu9aq7n,1,t5_39elf

5584297,0,t1_cwp32zz,gt  However the overwhealming majority of the bitcoin community both on reddit and off are in favor of increasing the max block size.Id agree with that. What I absolutely disagree with is abandoning the consensus process and jumping on the first compiled proposal. Thats incredibly irresponsible and unwise. Were still expecting  new proposals and the person who screams FIRST! the loudest is rarely the best. These people have further damaged their credibility by manufacturing a crisis that didnt actually exist. Redditors are so scared of what happens when blocks get full that theyre latching onto whatever bigblock proposal they can find without considering the repercussions. Now theyre emotionally invested in BitcoinXT and take personal offense that the ecosystem has wholly rejected their cries.People need to understand that block size is not the only way to help bitcoin scale. Yes it needs to happen. But it needs to happen in a calm precise and diligent manner. Insulting and burying reasonable commentary is counterproductive to this goal. But you already know all this. gtI wonder if say BIP  or BIP  got coded into a client and binaries made available would mentions of those clients get removed as well?Theymos has made clear that it would be consistent to remove Bitcoin Core implementations should they ever promote the running of code without previously reaching consensus. I use consensus because thats how we define the current state of Bitcoin. Its not facing an imminent hard fork to split the network it two. gtWhat if Core never increases block size? Do you think thats a possibility? Would you be fine with MB blocks forever?Unlikely. I gather that most are in agreement that we need to increase the limit at some point. gtAnd if they do why should those  in charge of commits to Core really just  actually get to have the final say over what bitcoins consensus rules are?Wladimir is responsible for making sure all the other devs have reached consensus before he commits. The level of caution that the devs take is extremely justified. Not only do I distrust Hearns motives but I also distrust his ability to manage Bitcoin responsibly without being reckless dictorial. I dont think mental gymnastics are necessary to understand the proconsensus argument. Its quite simple Bitcoin functions because everyone agrees what the rules are. If we promote various consensus protocols simultaneously competing for  hashrate Bitcoin will almost certainly experience a catastrophic failure. Consensus is required for Bitcoin to function. Bitcoin is consensus. The greater consensus is the stronger Bitcoin is.,bitcoin_uncensored,cwpa87l,1,t5_39elf

6252866,0,t3_416qtj,I am very happy that rbitcoinuncensored does not censor posts because this way everyone can see what a utter troll and joke lukejr is.ExplanationPull request is proper mechanism for changes in open source projects like Bitcoin no trolling in that.The trolling is in the fact that the pull request which contains C code and technical discussion is medialized in general platforms like rbitcoinuncensored and without understanding the technical stuff one can not really support such a pull request.But even the greater trolling is in the fact that this pull request tries to sabotage  MB max blocks in Bitcoin Classic. Why? Because Bitcoin classic was created to solve the max MB blocksize problem in such way that it increases max size to MB.lukejr pull request just wants to change mining algorithm and if it is included in the Bitcoin Classic software and all miners started to use it then. ALL of the specialized Bitcoin miner machines would became instantly useless for Bitcoin mining therefore miners would rather stay with the old Bitcoin client with max  MB blocks.Do you see why it is sabotage of  MB max block size implemented in Bitcoin Classic?,bitcoin_uncensored,cz0dt1d,9,t5_39elf
