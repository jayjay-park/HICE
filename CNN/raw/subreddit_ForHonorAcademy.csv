10850828,0,t1_ddytsq4,Hitting the heavy while their on the ground is really the only opportunity you have because its so slow unless your opponent doesnt know how to deflect well. Ive learned so far that with Valkyrie the battles WILL be longer then if playing with a warden raider etc but mainly focus on your defense and getting those light attacks in when you can. Plus shes getting a buff really soon that decreases the times with her light attack chains and stronger evade strikes,ForHonorAcademy,ddz6pjv,1,t5_3j2ef
