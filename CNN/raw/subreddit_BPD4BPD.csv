7707262,0,t3_4kqsu4,i felt like this for years when my BPD was at its worst and i was dating someone that was also not that stable. i thought it was all my fault and i was just too much for him to handle but now that im in a healthy stable relationship with someone who tries to understand my BPD and help me through all the problems i face because of it and loves me unconditionally i realize that my past relationships issue wasnt my BPD it was that the guy didnt love me enough to try and understand what i was going through.,BPD4BPD,d3i9iso,1,t5_31w4q
8847087,0,t3_4xo3l5,Look at the diagnosis as a group of symptoms you have inherited from living a life of certain circumstances be it a mix of environmental factors or genetics. They are symptoms. Things you can work on and heal from. Borderline Personality Disorder is something you can work through and deal with and overcome. A diagnosis can help you make sense of your life and you can then learn on how to work on the negative aspects. Dont forget some good can come out of your illness maybe you feel more empathetic towards others etc. ,BPD4BPD,d7balr7,1,t5_31w4q
9608775,0,t3_4wan71,im pretty fucking sure I have it based on my own research and reading people on here describe their symptoms and experiences. I have made an appointment with a new therapist because the one i recently had really pissed me off. ive seen many. i feel like they are going to blow me off and not fucking listen to me though. its just a nagging feeling i have based on my experience at the shitty fuckin place i go to. unfortinately i live in a so.ewhat smal town so i dont have many options. if there were dbt therapists or groups here i would just cut the bullshit ans go straight there. but that is not an option to me unfortunately. i told my psychologist that i think i have it and i explained why. i even had a printed out sheet of the symptoms. she looked at it and laughed and said well when you read those it sound like that cpuld  be from alot of things. like no bitch! ive never read anything that describes me so fucking perfectly. i hate them. i honestly feel like ny diagnosis may be being withheld from me. because looking back through all my years of therapy the symptoms have always been there. so i requested a copy of my medical records to see for myself. i am still waiting on them. call it paranoia but if i find that someone has written that i may have BPD on there i am going to talk shit and go somewhere else or just get a dbt workbook and selfhelp. which i am planning on doing anyway. if it doesnt them i dont know what i am going to do if they dont listen to me. probably just talk shit and go somewhere else  god i fucking hate those people.. ,BPD4BPD,d9xh7ob,1,t5_31w4q
10165225,0,t3_5let6o,Im at the stage in therapy where I need to learn to actively listen and try and empathize with peoples emotions. Im having a hard time not getting frustrated because I just have no idea how they feel the way they do even though I give them a Black and white very clear description of what I wantneed. Im having to explain myself  times before they hear what Im saying. The lack of communication is killing me because Im doing everything I can within reason to try and get it right the first time. Does any of this make sense? I just cant relate to peoples feelings or reason why they do things. ,BPD4BPD,dbwa8zi,2,t5_31w4q
