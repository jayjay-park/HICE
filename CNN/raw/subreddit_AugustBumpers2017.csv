10320472,0,t1_dcdg1i9,Pulled this from a scientific paper abstract Benefits and risks of ultrasound in pregnancy by Jacques S. Abramowicz in Seminars in Perinatology The general belief exists that diagnostic ultrasound DUS does not pose any risk to the pregnant patient nor to her fetus. Nonetheless ultrasound is a form of energy and as such demonstrates effects in biological tissues it traverses bioeffects. The physical mechanisms responsible for these effects are thermal or nonthermal mechanical. It is the role of science to show whether any of these bioeffects may be harmful. A riskbenefit analysis may also be important as well as education of the end users to assure patients safety.So it sounds like it is believed to be safe but the extent to which warming up of tissues and the other mechanical effects can cause problems is not quite fully known so it is better to use it relatively quickly and not all the time.

The big mountain to climb is having all the organs form in weeks six and seven which doesnt work in chromosomally abnormal embryos. And most women dont have missed miscarriages where they dont realize they are having one until weeks later. I know just how anxious one can get  I am already there again because its been  days since my last ultrasound  so not going to tell you to relax or that its going to be okay.

10913216,0,t3_5vx3vn,Hello! Overweight as well and diagnosed with GD early two and a half weeks ago To be honest the changes have not been that drasticall doable and Im happy to do them for the health of my baby. I tried the diet plan for the first week but my numbers were still very high so I was put on insulin  times a day. My OBs office does not prescribe metformin to pregnant women so insulin it is. Im still on the diet plan plus  units of fast acting insulin before each meal and  units of slow acting insulin for bedtime. The biggest struggle which I think is true for a lot of women was my morning fasting number and the evening insulin has brought that under control very quickly.Here are the things I found work best for me I have  alarms set on my phone everyday fasting blood sugar skin prick the timing for each snack and meal the timing for the two hour interval after eating to check my blood sugar and the time for my evening insulin. It seems like overkill at first but its amazing how easily I can forget to eat. Plus I love napping and I have to make sure I just still check my blood sugar on time. Pairing whole wheat carbohydrates with high protein for each snack. Wheat thins  cheese andor hummus andor pepperoni whole wheat bread  peanut butter. like a lot of women with gestational diabetes I cannot tolerate many carbs in the morning. But I can tolerate more carbs in the evening with dinner especially if Im eating a lot of protein. My numbers have been okay for example eating an enormous steak for dinner with a small amount of baked potato  cup. If I tried to have a third of a cup of breakfast potatoes in the morning my numbers would be up for the rest of the day.Good luck! By all means I do not know everything but I do know what it feels like to be recently diagnosed so please feel free to p.m. me if you want ,AugustBumpers2017,de5mcwd,2,t5_3hr3p

11177485,0,t1_deyxtr5,Sitting at my desk today Im realizing my ache is probably coming from being hunched over when I sit. Gotta stop doing that... Ive been reading up a lot on diastasis recti prevention as well as on prenatal yoga but its tricky because beyond the dont do crunches recommendation there seem to be a lot of different and conflicting opinions out there on whats appropriate. Not doing things that feel like they put pressure on the abs is probably a good rule of thumb.

11590389,0,t3_65ebcq,Like others here I didnt expect to be so thrown around by the first trimester. I was one of the lucky ones who just had the all day nausea and major food aversions so that was manageable. I did however have to deal with MAJOR bloating and exhaustion. More than I could ever imagine. My body was just so uncomfortable all the time. Really surprised me. Whats surprised me in a positive way apart from not actually vomiting from morning sickness is that unless I look down or catch my reflection most of the time now I dont feel like Ive changed shape. I fully expected that my bowling ball sized uterus would feel....more obvious. Also I dont think my body has changed that much visually apart from my boobs being bigger and having a hard round belly sticking out where my abs used to be. I honestly expected to just become....larger. Like my mother did my aunties did like so many women in my family have. Im not at the end of this whole thing yet obviously but Im now hopeful that Ill be able to look like me again after pregnancy. ,AugustBumpers2017,dg9s1ez,9,t5_3hr3p

I often wake up in the night feeling sore and stiff and the only way to get back to sleep is to lay on my back. I prop myself up so Im  not flat on my back. My friends  OBGYN told her that back sleeping isnt as dangerous as weve been led to believe.  It can cause issues but your body will warn you before you do any harm. Your legs will go numb and your baby will kick. I try to keep that in mind when I occasionally wake up on my back.  ,AugustBumpers2017,dgdeoqg,1,t5_3hr3p
