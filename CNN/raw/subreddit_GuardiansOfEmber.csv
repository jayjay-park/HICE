10827550,0,t1_ddw8a6d,Thanks for the reply. When clicking those boxes nothing happens I dont get a pop up with a horse icon I can drag there or any menus or messages.  I can easily assign skills from my skill book but cant find where I am supposed to assign the mount from.  It is not in my inventory I only see that it is in the compendium under uncatorigized mounts and nothing in the compendium can be dragged to the empty squares on the right. I am starting to wonder if it got deleted or something because I am not seeing why it should be so difficult to figure out. I play lots of MMOs.,GuardiansOfEmber,ddwsa3d,1,t5_3fv78
