2463002,0,t3_2nqsv4,I would support this because Im sick of seeing Russians migrating into place where Russians never migrated in such great numbers. One would just have to make sure that in any conflicts between Prussia and Russia the latter would have the ability to declare war on the former and the former would still be able to counterattack through CPL if Russia doesnt call CPL for some reason into the war.,Vic2Mod,cmg4m2j,3,t5_34cuf
2513570,0,t1_cmm1o2d,If we did there would have to be negative modifiers or industry like increased factory cost and reduced output and an ice ease in goods needed for military,Vic2Mod,cmmnuhv,2,t5_34cuf
2533973,0,t1_cmp87tq,I agree fully some of the little ones I dont mind like Siam or Serbia but the Gadsen flag is just wrong and the Free France Flag is historically terrible as it has nothing to do with the game period. BTW do you know of any way to disable or to roll back to a version without the flags?,Vic2Mod,cmpbrqf,6,t5_34cuf
2677948,0,t1_cmzpons,gt This reminds me of another issue I wanted to discuss assimilation as a whole seems off in this mod. By  there are only  provinces on the US with Dixie primary culture expected?  provinces with Magyar as primary culture on Hungary certainly not expected Catalans and Occitans are almost gone I think its intended for the Occitans the Balkans are heavily kebbab turkish even though there are many custom events and modifiers to prevent this... and yet Britanny is  Breton and AlsaceLoraine is mostly germanic despite being French since the start.Agreed there should be a change to the nationalism mechanics that makes assimilation impossible for nationalist pops especially for accepted pops. Accepted pops shouldnt have much of a reason to integrate because they are already protected by law.,Vic2Mod,cn84n6q,3,t5_34cuf

3608537,0,t1_cq3ldge,I simply removed and added text.csv from vickymod.a and its not having issues on my end at all.I think Github might be messing with the csv files or the recent addition edited the localisation file causing github to mess it up again.,Vic2Mod,cq3ll7f,1,t5_34cuf
