2802242,0,t1_cnm54ir, The presentation is very important but if your Engineering Notebook truly stands out the presentation wont put you out of the running for any awards.  What the judges want to see is a team that does it all. We want to see activity in the community AND a technically superior robot. A lot of it though is about how your team works as a team. We love seeing obvious teamwork as well as growth throughout the season. Tell the judges what you learned along the way. I stated this in an earlier comment but what the judges are looking for with Inspire is a team that embodies FIRST and FTC. If we had to pick a candidate to represent the state for FIRST would your team be that team?  Personally I like seeing a polished and professional presentation. However some judges would rather see no presentation and go right to an interview. It depends a lot on the individual judge. What all judges have in common however is we like to see teams that are motivated and knowledgeable about their robot and about the competition. Show us that you are excited to be there. Be engaged in the presentation and be knowledgeable about your bot and the process of building it. This will show the judges that you dont have a mentorbot The more impressive your notebook is the further we delve into it. If a team have a sloppy or incomplete notebook we probably wont need to look to hard to find that out. If you are a contender for the Think Award however which everybody should want to be your notebook is likely to be tested with high scrutiny of more than one judge.  My least favorite and most prevalent form of BSing that I have seen comes when one team has very clearly just piggybacked off of the efforts of another team from their school. It is pretty obvious which team has it together and which team is just taking credit for the outreach fundraising etc of another team. ,FTC,cnmls7q,2,t5_2sks6

4520816,0,t1_ct0gq9u,Typed and handwritten notebooks are both fine. There are guidelines in manual  of the rules. The two column format described there works for helping time management and tracking if you actually get done what you wanted to do but you have some freedom with it you can put stuff after it on the page if it doesnt seem to fit. I like typed because often things like pictures arent added in realtime so its difficult to know how much space to leave for them. I found it a lot more useful to have a document where everyone who needed it could access it remotely at the same time. The notebook is for your team but also for outsiders judges sponsors other teams who ask how you did a thing parents and the general public who may flip through it at outreach events. Nicely printed books are more accessible because its easier to move things around as necessary to maintain readability. Every member should contribute to the notebook. You can incorporate a written notebook and individual written pages notes sketches and diagrams into an electronic one by taking pictures of pages and just pasting them into your document but its a lot harder to put electronic components into a written notebook because you have to break out the scissors and tape and stuff.

6029562,0,t1_cy9aoe9,Edited based on new GDC rulingIn a new official GDC QampA post the GDC has ruled that GS protections now also apply if a robot is also Completely On the mountain and not extending into the Opposing Alliances climbing area!! With this new post the actions described by the defensive robot in the original post would be subject to a penalty even if the robot was extending over the floor area!    Original post preeditgt First off youre certainly not misunderstanding the rules. As long as your robot was above the  inch buffer the bumping behavior was illegal GS states this pretty clearly.FYI I personally hate the type of defensive play described by the OP.  But I respectfully submit that it was not necessarily illegal as noted by CannotUnseeFTC depending on whether or not their robot extended out over the floor tiles or not.GS says gtDuring the DriverControlled Period a Robot may not make contact with an opposing Alliance Robot that is Completely In its Alliances Mountain Climbing Area.and Section . saysgtAn object that has crossed into the vertical i.e. at a right angle to the Playing Field tile floor extension of a defined Areas boundary is Inside the Area. An object that is entirely within the vertical extension of a defined Areas boundary is Completely Inside the Area.So if youre on the Mountain but any part of your robot is hanging out over the floor youre not Completely In the Mountain Climbing Area and thus not protected by GS and can be bumped etc.I personally wish this was not the rule.

10974810,0,t3_5woe9e,I havent ever seen this but it seems relatively easy to programhah.  It depends how you want to control it but Id think using one joystick for direction and one joystick for rotation would be fine.

11019047,0,t1_deftmft,Honestly my friend your biggest mistake was not posting your issue here on Reddit. Most softwarephone based issues asked on this site are solved in  hours. And most of the time it takes that long because the poster doesnt respond very fast to the people trying to help...If you are still having issues make a post on the main FTC Sub. there are many people here including me that will jump in and ask  questions and get your problems solved.,FTC,degz8bq,5,t5_2sks6

11241409,0,t1_df5s9u9,We used to meet in my basement but it was pretty far away from all of our team members. So we switched to meeting in a room at a private school. This private school was a godsend but I wish that we could have kept meeting at my house so that I could clock more hours And your partial meetings can be pretty much anything. A programmers meeting a drive team meeting a notebook meeting a build team meeting or just an extra meeting whoever can make it can come and help out. Power tools do scare me but I know that Im using them safely if Im not sure if what Im doing is safe I will look it up. The Reddit has been a great source of information for me but unfortunately I only just found it a year ago. Before that I used the FTC Forum and Chief Delphi but I much prefer the subreddit. I agree with that personally but I also ask on the forum if I have a question that I just cant figure out. Yeah heard that. It feels great. Well we made it to our State Championship won all five of our qualification matches and flunked out in the semifinals  But I am very proud of how our team did. Our cap ball mechanism worked literally every matchexcept for matches where people blocked us but we got  penalty points out of it anyway so I didnt mind too much. How did you guys do this year? Well we are from Missouri. I know for a fact that I will be volunteering at NSR even though we didnt advance so I hope you will be coming? If not maybe we could do some sort of outreach? We are planning on teaching a programming day next season but its kind of a long drive.. do you want the address of our school? You could figure out the length of the road trip. ,FTC,df6741j,1,t5_2sks6
11273327,0,t1_df9rtxq,It is. And whining wont fix that. Time and time again you and others have made it a point to ruin the excitement of others as they mentioned their success. Please stop it isnt graciously professional to attempt to make others frustrated or to complain excessively about something you know nothing about the details of. Lets experience two worlds at least once before we complain too much. rant,FTC,df9tcun,7,t5_2sks6
11277093,0,t1_dfa7rib,You were a very solid robot and nowhere close to the worst robot there. I just wish first had more defined rules on what good robot performance is when judging the inspire.,FTC,dfa8q69,4,t5_2sks6
11393793,0,t1_dflx0ie,Id guess that the turret is hardcoded to aim towards the center of the field so  degrees relative to the robot in autonomous. Then the turret is manually aimed in teleop.,FTC,dfngy1c,1,t5_2sks6
11543912,0,t1_dg4holl,It is an improvement. But I wish some aspectsnumber of motor ports USB type and placement need of adapters for sensors motors and encoders would have been thought through. Some stuff just seems obvious to change. ,FTC,dg4i5no,1,t5_2sks6
11545919,0,t1_dg4q0ks,Agreed I like the power poles. Easy to connect and much longer lasting than tamiyawe had a battery connector go out on us we replaced it with power poles  I havent ever messed with deanswhich I think is the battery connector or whatever the motor connectors are so we may be surprised. But it kinda was not thought through cause all these teams already have power poles and as a will be th year team this iswill be our rd control system change. At least the sensors use the same cable type as current ones. ,FTC,dg4qd73,3,t5_2sks6

11634760,0,t1_dgeh8p9,Yeah this happened to us at worlds... the inspire award winner of some country I forget which one this was during cascade effect didnt have a strong robot at all and it ended up costing us the match... it really sucks to be a part of an alliance where one of the teams just cannot pull their own weight which ends up hurting both teams,FTC,dget9qw,6,t5_2sks6
11642463,0,t3_659tz9,Most of the tips Id offer have already been posted by other users but here are a few in no particular order The engineering notebook is super important Youre allowed to work on the robot between competitions unlike FRC Competitions can be REALLY intense FTC is generally a lot of fun!  The rules can sometimes be a bit different from competition to competition so be ready to adapt. We had a qualifier last year where teams robots not only had to fit in the sizing cube but they had to pass the paper test. If there wasnt enough room between the inside edge of the box and the robot for a piece of printer paper to slip through then it was deemed too big.,FTC,dgfoqge,2,t5_2sks6
