6007402,0,t1_cy6b819,Any idea if the prices are better than WC at the Pleasant Hill Safeway?  As cheap as their gas is I stick to stations that carry what gasbuddy.com refers to as top tier gas.  As far as groceries Im pretty sure that Whole Foods is cheaper than Safeway in DT WC.,walnutcreek,cy73nza,1,t5_2th0t
