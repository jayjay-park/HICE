285591,0,t3_1x7z6a,It seems something major must have happened to Jay to make him forget he understood why Tim didnt show him the tape. When he attacked Tim the next day it was like he had no recollection of calling Tim no memory of the fact that he was willing to close the rift because he got why Tim had kept the tape and its contents a secret.Either TO wiped his mind of that memory so Jay would continue to be aggressive in an effort to widen the rift between Jay and Tim or he got Jay. From the video Id say it looks like the latter but then it seems odd that Jay would continue to skulk around and secretly tail Tim rather than just going after him again. Plus when he was waiting in the building he didnt seem very Proxyish. Then again neither does Tim when hes not having one of his episodes...,Slender_Man,cfad6b1,5,t5_2s4md
450366,0,t1_cfr6rbi,The gunshots were way too quiet theres not much of an emotional impact when they kill them. Its not like HOLY FUXCK THEY JUST KILLED  PEOPLE Its more like pop... pop.... click...Some heavy camera distortion and loud sounds would have been awesome. But effects aside the idea of this video was cool,Slender_Man,cfrgdn3,0,t5_2s4md
811003,0,t3_23eq11,Im not going to lie.  I love this.  Absolutely love this.  Its a fantastic and simplistic take on Slendy that is in the same vein of what brought most of us here.Just fantastic.,Slender_Man,cgwgrck,9,t5_2s4md
1069429,0,t3_26clx7,A few hokey effects at first but it gets a lot better as it progresses. It doesnt lessen the immersion though. Lots of creepiness and static. Following the Twitter as you watch MH and TTA adds a nice extra level of detail.,Slender_Man,chpuk6z,3,t5_2s4md

4902837,0,t1_cucic9n,I never heard that. What I heard was that they werent going to act in the new series at all not that they werent going to star as new characters. They also stated that there was going to be no relation to MH meaning it couldnt be Tim Wright there....though considering they probably lied about the first thing the series definitely could be related to Marble Hornets.,Slender_Man,cucjh5b,2,t5_2s4md
