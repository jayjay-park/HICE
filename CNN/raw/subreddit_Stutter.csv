853750,0,t1_ch1bc4k,Thanks so much for the ideas I really like both of them! What do you think of these two?. An app to coordinate speech practices. Basically a simple website to find someone to practice speech with. You get a random topic and you both have to talk about it for a specific amount of time.. The same application as above except including a feature where you press a button when you notice that you stuttered and the person on the other end presses a button when they notice that you stuttered. Then after the call you can compare how often you thought you stuttered vs. how often the other person noticed. I really like the reminder app idea.

1540739,0,t3_2busel,Speech Therapist and person who stutters chiming in here.It is interesting that you correlate masturbation with stuttering. Even moreso with confidence boosting.  In general masturbation is a healthy human activity.  Many published articles indicate this.  It seems that by resisting the urge to self pleasure builds up selfesteem about successfully overcoming an urge or something we can not control.  Without intensive speech therapy it is difficult to control our stuttering.  I can see how this overall mentality could lead to a placebo effect concerning a person who stutters.   Some fun questions to think about regarding this topic  Does this same effect work with the female population?  It is the same with people who have frequent consensual sex with a partner? Why? or Why not? Does a buildup of sperm effect our oralmotor coordination?  Will this effect last long term?In general resisting the urge to masturbate does not cure or alleviate stuttering nor does it give magic self confidence powers other than a placebo effect.   Many times placebos only last a certain amount of time.  If you want help with stuttering locate a speechlanguage pathologist who is familiar with stuttering and learn techniques to control your speech. It would be interesting to conduct a study The effects of longterm ejaculatory inhibition on speech disfluencies in adult persons who stutterI can already tell you abstaining from masturbation does NOT alleviate or cure stuttering.

3088206,0,t3_2vh8gv,Thats a familiar story. High school was a total nightmare for me. I was mute in class as well. I also didnt do any of the classwork so I had some teachers assume I was mentally challenged and they placed me into basic classes. Without fail those teachers were always shocked when they saw how I wrote and they questioned the system that placed me there. I would spend each and every day terrified that I would be called on. Teachers didnt acknowledge my issue. Except for one who would give me reading assignments to read to the class. Id get stuck and the rest of the class would assume I couldnt read. Those were the days that I wished I could crawl into myself and just die. The only class where I wasnt a total emotional wreck was band.  I participated in some therapy at school but it was always in the middle of the library with other kids staring at me while I went through the exercises. I was always worried that I would be homeless or Id never leave my parents house due to never being able to get a job. Something changed in me and I decided to not let it rule my life. I decided to not let it stop me. I decided to challenge the people who wanted to laugh at how I speak. It hasnt gone away and some days are easier than others but it doesnt stop me at all. I work with military personnel on a daily basis in a capacity that requires a good deal of technical explanation both in person and on the phone. It hasnt really affected my dating life. If someone loses interest because of my stutter then thats someone I didnt want in my life anyway. If I could go back to HS I wouldnt! but if I did Id go after everything with a totally different attitude. You stutter. So what. Thats you. Everybody has obstacles in their lives. Thats yours. If somebody wants to laugh at you about it look them in the eye and wait for them to finish. Maybe I look intimidating I dont know but that always turns people beet red and they STFU right away. Sometimes I have to respond verbally and I turn into Joe Pesci but thats pretty rare.Somebody on here made a post about speaking from the base of their throat. Ive been trying to make that my default voice for years now. Its almost like a Christian Bale Batman voice unfortunately but people seem to like it. It works for me it almost eliminates my stutter. I work on it daily. Good luck out there. Just remember that youre not alone in this. ,Stutter,coi39vr,1,t5_2scwr

4599897,0,t3_3dxyhs,I dont have a problem with my name  first name is one syllable and I always have to spell my last name.  However for thirteen years I lived on a street with  syllables and a lot of Rs.  That was ugly often.  |I could not do my Ls or Rs as a child either.  I spent about  years in speech therapy to correct that.  Regarding my stutter they gave me a sheet of paper with tips.  Really what tween would ever do anything with that???   I stuttered since I could speak.  My mother had a degenerative disease that made verbal communication difficult for her and apparently I picked it up from her.  That is the logic anyway as not a single other relative stutters in my family.  That apparently makes me an oddity.  They flew me out to the Natl Inst of Health in Wash DC to do a study.  I could not participate because it turns out I am partially deaf.  But I got a cool trip to D.C. I used to use word substitution all the time but it made me sound uneducated.  I dont do that anymore.  Now if I get caught up on a word so be it.  If someone makes fun of me so be it.   I actually do training at my work.  I have my good days and my bad days.  When I do presentationtype training I rehearse the heck out of it.  I probably rehearse it about  times before I actually present it.  It also gives me a chance to fine tune it and cut the fat.  I am more apt to stutter with oneonone training as those discussions can take you anywhere.  My worst experience is I had to do a presentation on a topic I knew little about and I knew at least half the room knew more than me.  I could sense their impatience which made things so much worse.   The only time I am really selfconscious is when we are joking around at work and then I basically kill the entire vibe because I get stuck on a word.  lol.  One of my close friends stutters.  He does the therapy and the support groups.  He has had some expensive aids.  One was a hearingaid type device that cost him K.  He said that really helped him and you could tell a difference.  He now has an iPod type device that helps him with his cadence.  I dont think I have ever gone to therapy because I simply do not care enough.  Yes it sucks to stutter.  No one is perfect and everyone has issues but we cannot hide ours.  However I have a good job good health and a roof over my head.  I really cannot complain about much.  I am no doctor but it sounds like your biggest issue is your anxiety.   When I first started working I had a lot of phone work.  I would always panic and it would make me say stupid things  not to avoid a stutter but because I was so worked up about the possibility of stuttering that I could not think straight.  I am not on the phone as often but now if I stutter I will just say Yes I stutter and move on.I wish you good luck!,Stutter,ctaemws,2,t5_2scwr

It started very gradually and developed into full blown blocks repetitions etc by the time I hit age  or  at which point I started going to speech therapy. My personal theory is that whatever caused it to  start happened but then was exacerbated and intensified by my very type A family. When I would have trouble speaking up until it became enough of a problem to go to therapy and even then my brother in particular would hurry me along finish my words  and just get generally shitty with me about it. As far as triggers go  mine are completely random. Sometimes Im perfectly fluent when angry sometimes its the exact opposite. Sometimes there are particular sounds that I just cannot say for the life of me sometimes I can say those sounds with no problem.

It got to the point where i couldnt overcome it so someone sitting across from me kept her feet on top of mine someone else held down my hands and when I began nodding my head my therapist held my head in place while i spoke. A bit extreme but it helped me get over my ticks. Not sure if yours are the same type of thing though. ,Stutter,d8q8lzd,2,t5_2scwr
9385527,0,t1_d95e7i7,No I didnt stuttering isnt officially seen as enough grounds to change the procedure so why bother.Telling the examiner helped to get the permission to whisper and got the whole elephant in the room thing out of the way. I doubt it affected the outcome.,Stutter,d95ojk0,1,t5_2scwr

You should also move on with your life i guarantee youre the only one who thought about it after the moment passed. There will be losing days there will be winning days only thing to do now is forgive yourself and move forward. Stay strong ,Stutter,da4zkzw,2,t5_2scwr

Ive honestly not been giving the techniques and weapons  and sort of have just been riding the high of being able to finally communicate but that has started to fizzle out.

9897412,0,t3_5h5v2h,Hi this is my first comment or post ever on reddit. My whole life it seems has had to be planned around my stuttering. I think I know exactly how you feel. I started reading stuff on reddit just a few months ago. Ive learned they have subreddits for just about everything. So today i googled stuttering and sure enough here it is. In terms of talking to others its hard. My girlfriend is only aware that I used to have a stutter as a kid and that sometimes my s sounds are longer. With that being said I am actually in a pretty good place in life right now. But yeah I have never ever talked to anyone in person or even online about my whole stuttering situation. ,Stutter,daxnn1c,3,t5_2scwr

What people do care about is how you present yourself and looking at all your threads that cant be too positively and that is what puts people off and not your stutter.,Stutter,dcgryy1,4,t5_2scwr

10517484,0,t3_5qk28h,As a fellow stutterer i know how this feels since we cannot cure it we have to work harder than the avg Joe to be on equal playing field. Work on things you CAN control your physicality and especially your confidence. When Im on dates i keep it cool and remain confidence as if the stutter is no big deal. Even though my dates notice my Stutter it dosent bother them too much as long as i can make up for it other qualities. ,Stutter,dd09qce,1,t5_2scwr

10948899,0,t1_de98khx, years old is a normal age for developmental stuttering. Psychogenic stuttering does exist but it is quite rare. Many parents attribute their childrens stuttering to some event but to be blunt they arent very knowledgeable when it comes to this stuff. I also know of stutterers who have hid their stutters from their families so well not even their spouses knew.,Stutter,de9av3g,1,t5_2scwr
10989742,0,t1_dedkmcf,I just like thinking Im an introvert. So when I go to start a conversation it starts well and then I run out of things to say. Anxiety kicks in and the rest is history ,Stutter,dednhzd,1,t5_2scwr

11191562,0,t1_df0a2mm,I hear you on the anxiety.  When I was in my early s I lived in a mountain state college town.  The college area was across a river from the downtown area where all the bars were.  Every time I crossed the bridge heading to the bars my anxiety would get so bad Id be dry heaving over the rail staring at the river below and thinking of jumping.  Never did because i knew the drop wasnt big enough to kill my dumb ass and then Id just have to talk to a paramedic I didnt know.I never sought professional help and in retrospect i should have.  I self medicated with reefer and booze.  I took too much acid and mushrooms because nothing makes your problems go away like losing your mind for a few hours.  I spent as much time in the mountains and deserts as I could hiding from other people.  When I wasnt hiding in the wilderness i hid in books reading Bukowski Abbey and Thompson like a crazed crack head.  Slowly slowly I killed all the dreams I had that involved other people and in that void I learned to love myself.  But there are days that I still feel like an emotional cripple because I didnt deal with my anxiety in an healthy way back then.  A person should be able to dream of love and companionship.And please note Im not trying to tell you to man up.  I hate that Fucking term.  More than anything I just want you to understand you have worth.  My first response was everything I wish I could have told  year old me.  Cheers!,Stutter,df0jtmg,2,t5_2scwr
