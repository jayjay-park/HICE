8043140,0,t3_4ol17e,Re dosing sucks..  thats why i prefer f mph... small dose last  to  hours for me.  STAY HYDRATED! GET ENOUGH SLEEP! EAT A HEALTHY DIET! . Those  things i  have learned the hard way.  The positive side effects were unnoticeable to others... I work graveyard shift at a warehouse and use stims not abuse and as far as my managers are concerned im a shining star.  If you dont drink enough water get enough sleep and be conscientious about your dieting...   you will stink.  it washes away after a hot shower but will come right back ass soon as you redose. I had to take a painful week long break and do a few different detoxes detox bath is incredible and cheap!  after some googling i now drink AT LEAST  gallon of water a day use super complex v bitamins im working on my sleep its hard because of the shift i work...  anyways im back using not abusing the stims and seem to have it under control.  I havent talked to a doctor but adrenal fatigue is a condition that can arise after prolonged use which i think i have. The condition is not being able to function at all in when you wake up wo stims...  Anyways  drink a lot of fluids guys.  Take care.,StopSpeeding,d4k4i69,2,t5_3cach

Not everyone craves at the same time so negative moods behavioural patters could trigger your mate and in reverse. Speaking from a failed marriage she had A hell of a time I wasnt ready. Hope this helps,StopSpeeding,d5x0sbz,1,t5_3cach

11400591,0,t3_62p0z6,Leave the city if you can. If you got family to stay with. The few times I got really bad I had to. It helps give you time to get your head clear.     Get a new phone lose all the bad numbers. Change your number. If you really quit them mfs are gonna do their best to make you fall off.    Go back to all your old friends. The ones you had before you were bad off and tell the ones your really close with that your gonna call them once a day to check in. That if you dont call tell them to call you. Accountability partners you could say. Hell you can text me if ya want!!     Try meetings. I dont personally like this one mainly because im atheist and dont believe in a higher power. But their concept is great and it will give you new friends. People places and things. Thats what they teach. You gotta change them.       You really gotta hate it man. Thats what my dad taught me. He was an old school dealer. Best friends with the cook. That shits a curse man. It ruins everything.     Take it one day at a time and dont count your days clean. I say that because it got to where I felt like I was just counting the days down till a relapse.     Oh yea. Stay away from alcohol and benzos for a few months. Itll make it really easy to fall off. Adderall too. Thats what ive learned after  years  with the point.        Really message me if you have nobody. Whenever you feel like you will fall off. Im here.,StopSpeeding,dfo8qt1,7,t5_3cach
