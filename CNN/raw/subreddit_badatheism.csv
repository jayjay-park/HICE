928007,0,t3_24oeqa,I think you are reading too much into this. First off its not like Nietzsche is some superhuman to which no modern man nor atheist could be compared without incurring the laugher of learned men. Second I dont think it was saying they are the same in beliefs just that they are all important for their time. ,badatheism,ch9rpak,5,t5_2vwsy
1527611,0,t1_cj7rbfd,I didnt say agnostic theism was SMART. Just that it was possible.Agnostic atheism though...it depends. Most agnostic atheists Ive encountered are of the I dont believe there is a god but there is a possibility that I may be wrong variety. That CAN function in a philosophical debate because it is often rooted in the simple lack of evidence for god its the null hypothesis that stands counter to ANY positive claim and is used in the sciences and in the legal system in the form of innocent until proven guilty.Edit misphrased.,badatheism,cj7rhfq,1,t5_2vwsy

2067925,0,t3_2iedk5,And check this onegt The bible says we are rib people    Wut    gt Darwin disproved this when he proved we are evolved from simple organisms.    Fair enough he would have disproved it that way. Yknow if more than half of the population took that part literally. Also Im not a fan of how this guy used the word proved here correct me if Im mistaken.    gt The bible says the earth is the cwntersic of creation.    There are passages in the Bible that make reference to this yes but it seems a bit allegorical to take literally think Joshua  or its just a single almost bizarre interpretation Psalms .    Also Ive noticed this guy has a tendency to ignore other peoples arguments based on spelling mistakes. I eagerly await the moment he calls religious people hypocrites so I can shove that in his face...  gt They put Galileo on house arrest for disproving Christianity.    I have literally lost all my ability to even. Im going to take a nap,badatheism,cl2og3e,5,t5_2vwsy
2156464,0,t1_cldtui3,And that is why I think it is ridiculous that atheists had any reaction to the controversial study earlier this year that implied an afterlife. Even if science found undeniable proof of an afterlife that would not necessarily mean that God exists any more than it would mean that the Tooth Fairy exists. It is entirely possible that our consciousness persists in a way that does not require a supernatural being quantum immortality a conscious universe etc..,badatheism,cldxpgn,6,t5_2vwsy

3579995,0,t1_cq09xr2,Hes saying youre confusing Supernatural and True. A supernatural event unexplainable by the known facts of science and nature can still occur. A scientist might attempt to study it but that does not mean hed be successful. It could indeed be an isolated incident. A thing can still be true and supernatural. If a person is shot and their wounds heal by magic that would be a supernatural occurrence but not an unreal or an unverified one. When you say that something occurring makes it natural then you can no longer reject something for making a supernatural claim because the claim is no longer supernatural.Its no longer a supernatural claim. I think his frustration was reasonable considering you told a scientist to go ask scientists how science works.,badatheism,cq0ciy5,1,t5_2vwsy

4453754,0,t1_css2d6d,You can go there and see. It had a few sections  news tech etc. People submitted articles to a moderation queue where users would suggest edits and vote to put the article up. It had threaded comments like red dit. It was mostly Slashdot refugees. There were norms against mindless link propagation so most content was either original or was commentary on other articles. There was also a diaries section which was one of the interesting features I liked. It was eventually killed by shitlords. This is distinct at that time from trolls as there was a band of people like badphilosophy who dwelt among them and made light of their absurdity by use of irony. Classic trolling. However unlike similar Slashdot spinoff Metafilter the owner did not decide to moderate firmly and so it descended to oblivion.,badatheism,css2v8i,3,t5_2vwsy

5153355,0,t1_cv75s03,If you consider doing something to be active and not doing something to be passive then it would indeed immediately follow that believenotX is active and that notbelieveX is passive.  Im not sure what you mean by practical difference.  There appear to be people in the world that claim to fall into each category so that there appears to be a difference in the practice of believing or not believing.  Does that qualify as a practical difference?To me the phrase I believe no gods exist indicates that the speaker engages in the act of believing the proposition that the number of existing gods is equal to zero.  That as stated is independent of the acts of presentation and convincing.  Though as I suggested before the acts of presentation and convincing might play a role in whether one chooses to engage in or refrain from the act of believing some proposition.Since I seem to be repeating myself perhaps we should agree to disagree regarding the matter of what words mean.,badatheism,cv766up,1,t5_2vwsy

Tip!Its been years since I read it. The book contains some valid stuff it is what made me realise that I was atheist not agnostic when he used Russells teapot.Theres a lot of bad atheism in there too if I recall correctly. It put me off Dawkins and his type of confrontational accusatory atheism.,badatheism,d5zrazf,2,t5_2vwsy
