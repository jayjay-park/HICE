11604886,0,t1_dgbdz2l,Yeah I definitely have what you call a leadership project. I started it in th grade though so thats what Im worried about. I have around  activities that Im completely  invested in even occasionally taking time off school not sacrificing my grades to pursue these. Also all of these fit into my passion. In total I have  activities  of which are directly passionrelated and two of which are kindofpassionrelated. I think I fit the EC strategy you mentioned. What Im still kind of shaky about is that you and usup really dove into your main project in grade  whereas I only started mine in grade . Do you think this will hurt?EDIT Elaboration,GetIntoStanford,dgbf96c,1,t5_3gect
11792114,0,t3_683qvc,eh Im also a junior so I could be wrong but there doesnt need to be a hard line between STEM and liberal artsIf anything applicants should be blurring that line. STEM people can stick out of the crowd by being excellent writers and artists as well.,GetIntoStanford,dgwoccv,1,t5_3gect
