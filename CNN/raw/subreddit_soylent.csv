1151141,0,t3_27a6nm,Ive been doing this for two months. No issues. I cant say I have a great deal of extra energy. What I can say is that my energy is much more leveled throughout the day. I dont go running for some snack after heavy lifting. And I dont need to worry about hitting all my macornutrients like I had been doing before.I wish I was on DIY Soylent a few months ago when I was bulking. IT would have been much easier and my gains would have been more consistent.I have taken to running short distances again. This is in light of a consistent knee injury. Ive found that aside from being extra thirsty runs dont deplete me quite as much. I have found that running after a Soylent meal is not all all taxing either. But Im sure that will not be the case for many.If there is a negative side effect it is this If I eat a large amount of Soylent an hour before a strenuous muscle workout my stomach will be upset afterwards. Its almost akin to being nauseous. This may just be the stress of doing heavy loads. But it is unclear.

Crazy hard. Even eating healthy foods all day I could easily miss micros entirely just because Id have to go to entirely different families of food to get any of some things.Medical professionals have their recommendations. They dont vary too much from person to person unless theres a particular medical reason. The deficiencies are predictable enough that we fortify our staple foods across the board to prevent historical deficiency diseases. Iron iodine niacin vitamins D C and A. I dont even know what else. Its already being supplemented because optimal nutrition requires more knowldge and effort than most people have.Without a known medical condition I see no reason for anyone to not use a soylent product of some kind without any particular consultation.

Cocoa powder is also good for potassium and fiber.  The USDA database has entries for dutched and nondutched cocoa powder.  Hersheys Special Dark is a mix of dutched and nondutched exact ratio unknown so you could average the two USDA entries or just buy their Natural Unsweetened instead which is all nondutched.

1463302,0,t1_cizjsw7,Correction from the soylent blogSoy Lecithin g  Lecithins often used in baking have emulsification properties. Soylent is a colloid that combines substances that are normally immiscible. Emulsifiers like lecithin allow for a homogenous mixture of what would normally separate immediately. Lecithins are a mixture of different fatty substances and choline and are completely metabolized by the body. While derived from soy lecithin is completely isolated from proteins and phytoestrogens from the plant and thus is safe for consumption by those with a soy allergy.tldr yes it contains soy. but it doesnt contain the parts people tend to freak out about.,soylent,cizp8lt,3,t5_2wmas

Theyre all really designed as an addition to  or between small meals.  None of them are made to completely replace all food especially not for every single meal.  They all have terrible carbproteinfat ratios.  They have really bad choices of ingredients to provide the calories of those ratios like sugar and corn syrup.  No idea what kind of cheap protein they use or if it even has a complete profile or not.  No idea what kind of omegaomega fat ratio they have.  Drink enough of them to get the right total amount of calories and you end up with way too much of some vitamins and minerals some dangerously so and way too little of others some not at all which can also be dangersous.  Unlike any of those Soylent really is designed as a complete food replacement.  It really can replace all food every meal all the time.

2253112,0,t1_clpzv5p,twiohyou The fact that you used both was and is already acknowledges that bottled water has never been a fad. spGoogle defines a fad as  gtan intense and widely shared enthusiasm for something especially one that is shortlived and without basis in the objects qualities a craze.Because we have to talk about popularity in both past and present bottled water has already failed the shortlived quality. There was not a particularly intense or widely shared enthusiasm around water bottles and their popularity is without basis in their qualities either. I believe that soylent will follow a similar path.There was a time in the US where bottled water wasnt popular. It was long enough ago that I didnt do the shopping so I dont remember exactly when or why. Wikipedias not helpful because the change isnt significant enough to include in the bottled water history section So for whatever reason bottled water became popular again. Note I say again. It was common before water sanitation here became so safe and its always been common in Europe.The idea of spending money on something that comes out of a tap seemed odd to many people and the folly of bottled water was a common topic of discussion. There were always people who thought it was silly but the practice has endured. If you go to any grocery store or gas station youll find bottled water and people buying it. Some people care others dont. The enthusiasm is not particularly widespread although it may have been intense for a short while. For a time talking about bottled water may have been a fad as the probottle and antibottle people bickered but bottled water has stayed.I believe it stayed because it has some benefits. Bottles are resealable and portable which is one definite advantage over a glass of tap water. Bottled water snobs talk about the taste. Bottled water makes one part of disaster prep easier than ever. Whatever small qualities bottled water has they add enough advantage to make some people like it.Bottled water was not an intense and widely shared enthusiasm it was not short lived and it was not without basis in the objects qualities. Some people like it because it because it meets their needs and desires and will keep using it for a long time. Others will not care. There will be some people who try it for the novelty and leave it behind and there will be some excitement about it but that happens to any new product. Now its just another product in stores. Some people swear by it some never use it. Some buy it all prepackaged and fresh and some fill their own. Some take it everywhere and drink it every day but others use it only for camping trips or events. This was true for bottled water and it will be true for soylent.twicocoa I love waking up with something to ramble to. Thank you.,soylent,clq7gdr,0,t5_2wmas

Are you eating any other food or are you having nothing but Joylent for all  meals a day?   You might not be drinking enough water.  SsJoylent by itself will give you less than half the total daily amount of water you should have. For every glass of soylent you drink drink a glass of water with it afterwards or at least between meals.   Sip each meal for a longer period of time make it last  minutes instead of finishing it in  minutes or so.   Instead of  meals per day split up the same daily total amount into more smaller meals.

3839545,0,t1_cqswjiw,The ADHD meds are typically stimulants. For a  lb male  calories are very low. I know that when I cut calories I get both very hungry and very tired. Stimulants affect both of those. They keep you alert AND they suppress your appetite. Obviously you should ask your doctor before taking anything. But it may help you with your diet.Vyvanse and Adderrall XR are probably the most common slowrelease amphetamine salts prescribed for ADHD. You would take these as early as possible in the morning and they should last most of the day for you. The only reason I mentioned these is because I dont know if taking pills at work would be good for you. Sometimes people forget to take their pills into work with them sometimes people lose pills sometimes people have coworkers that would frown on you taking medication... I dont know your situation.Modafinil is different. I dont think its prescribed as an ADHD medication frequently. Its primarily used for people that suffer from shift work sleep disorder. So taking this should help you deal with any tiredness. I dont know what effect it will have on your appetite.If you dont mind me asking what are your goals exactly? Are you just trying to lower the bf? If you really are certain that youre  bf your abs should be almost visible at this point. What have you been doing to build up muscle? You may be able to hit your goal without feeling miserable. Another thing to consider is your age. Do you convert to glucose fairly easily or did your metabolism slow down? Are you eating food so you can perform fairly soon after or are you eating food and sitting at a desk? I mentioned that I try to take in my carbs around gym time. I used to do keto but I kept getting weaker and my energy was garbage. I dont know if you go to the gym but it may help to consider adding something like this after your induction phase.Another thing to consider with your age is your hormones. I have been getting the impression that keto is a good idea especially as you get older. The high fat content feeds your hormone production while curbing hunger. And as good as that is theres only so much that it can do. Before you go through with this I would highly recommend you getting some blood tests. Here is a list of what I was told to get when I had my blood testedCholesterol totalLDLVLDL  very low density lipoproteinHDLTriglyceridesTTThyroxineStimulating Hormone TSHEstradiol Serum EFollicleStimulating Hormone FSHComplete Blood CountComprehensive Metabolic PanelLuteinizing Hormone LHTestosterone Serum freeTestosterone Serum TotalRenal  DHEAFull Liver PanelElectrolytesMineral and GlucoseVitamin DProstateSpecific AntigenCortisolHaematologyElectrolytes and LFTsIron StudiesInsulin and GlucoseTestosterone and SHBGhGHIGFGHRPsMyostatin InhibitorsprolactinThats a huge list. When I asked for it the doctor looked at me like I was insane. Most of that wasnt tested. The big ones were Testosterone estrodial shbg cortisol vitamin d LH TSH cholesterol ldl hdl prolactin t and t. I think that was it. After my insurance paid I only owed . I mention this because if fat is a concern for you your diet may not be the only thing to worry about. If youre noticing fat deposits primarily around your abdomen thighs or buttocks then you may have low testosterone high estrogen or maybe some combination of the two. This could be because youre not getting enough vitamin d your cortisol is too high or any number of things. There are a lot of indirect relationships within your endocrine system. I normally dont think that anyone is a special snowflake but hormones and genetics definitely change things. If you know how your hormones interact with one another you can design the most optimal diet. Otherwise it is very likely that the diet wont be very effective and youll likely feel awful doing it.,soylent,cqtxwut,1,t5_2wmas

As far as our meal for meal program we have partnered with the World Food Programme WFP in order to provide a meal to a child in need for every meal sold. WFP does work in many different countries  find a list of them here. A meal will be different in each region where food is provided. You can read more about the logistics of providing food to people in need here At this point we are not providing Hol Food to these individuals. This has been a very carefully thought out strategy. Briefly in areas where food insecurity is an issue it is very easy to upset and ultimately destroy the local economic system by introducing new sources of nutrition. Rather it is much more helpful to support existing infrastructure in order to stimulate the local economy and ensure long term feasibility of the aid effort.

5172202,0,t3_3luey7,This is potentially unfortunate news since the body doesnt to a great job at converting to DHA especially if you are a man.  With a conversion rate of about  and assuming you want to get  mg of DHA in your diet per day that would require  grams of ALA which is  times more than can be had from  bottles of Soylent . . grams.Of course how much DHA one should have in their diet is very much uncertain.  Some people say that  mg is fine others shoot for  mg per day.  I put  mg in my example since that is a middleground amount and a common dose for many supplements.  So if you are happy with  mg of DHA in your life then . grams of ALA is just fine.  Otherwise supplement with more ALA or a separate source of EPADHA like fishalgae oil.EDIT I should also mention that most research shows an optimal omegaomega ratio of between  and .

Which once you add the poor element the conversation changes entirely. I would counter your statement by saying that If you enjoy soylent as a product then then let the discussion end there. I see soylent in this case is more of a lifestyle than a product. The OP is making the argument that Soylent as a product can do more than simply feed you. It can End hunger!!  I see this argument tied with quite a few posts here and every single one falls into the same trap.If you enjoy this product then great.

The bitter matcha takes the edge off the stock sweetness and adds a small caffeine hit as a bonus.My original pitcher started leaking because of hot water usage so I purchased this container which is nearly perfect for this process. I stopped using hot water because other members of this forum made me fear the pipes in my house .Mixing procedure Put Soylent matcha and pea protein into the container. Thoroughly tamp down the dry ingredients by bouncing the container on the countertop and tapping the sides. This step is critical in preventing clumps. Fill  with tap water and drop in a metal shaker ball. Dont put the ball into the dry ingredients alone or a mega clump will form inside the ball and resist every effort to dissolve it. Quickly turn the container upside down and shake very very very vigorously. The first  seconds of shaking are critical. Top off with more water more shaking and refrigerate over night.

6348706,0,t3_42iuwy,Do you have a formula for where you want to start?  Sulfur Most have settled on no longer needing to add sulfur especially if you have enough protein or just eat regular food relatively regularly. However if you find you have any joint issues after  months you might need to add some in typically as Methylsulfonylmethane. Disregard. See here. Fiber Theres a lot of back and forth on this but the range is anywhere from  to  grams of fiber per k calories. Emulsifier Soy Lecithin or xanthan gum though not directly related to digestive issues can help with preventing your mix from separating leading to a better mouthfeel overall.Another big part is how you mix everything. If you blend it and too much air gets sucked in this can lead to some extra bloating and gas. Usually just letting it settle overnight will help in this part as well.,soylent,czb9zlf,2,t5_2wmas
6357454,0,t1_czc8d1b,gt I personally prefer the Lamy Joy...Lamy makes great pens aswell. I have a Safari but they are a bit more expensive than the Pilot Metropolitan and have a grip that doesnt suit everyone. Lamy makes pens that you generally love or hate while the Pilot Metropolitan is just a solid pen. Perhaps a bit boring but really pretty much good at everything with no major flaws. Personally I do love my Safari it was my first fountain pen I like the grip though I need to get an F or EF nib for it as a leftie.Yeah nothing wrong with mechanical pencils. But even so you should go for something ergonomic and comfortable. There are drafting pencils that generally have a good comfortable weight to them and ergonomic grips so you dont have to push as hard to make the lines. Just let the weight of the pen do the job. The Pentel Graph Gear  is what I am using. Cheap but quite solid  I want to get a Rotring  next.

This would also have the benifit of reducing waste and making it easier for people in a multisoylent household that have different caloric requirements to use Soylent together. And when you are working out you can easily adjust your calories if youre  Soylent for the day.Alternatively something along the lines of Sani but less expensive would be nice although that wouldnt be sharable or as easily customizable. Its a little crazy how much more expensive per calorie eating a  calorie diet of Sani would be as opposed to a  calorie diet of joylent. It takes away the cost savings benefit that people on lower than  calorie diets would expect from these products.I also have a slight issue with the obvious suggestion that  calories is supposed to be for everyone and before you say that people know their caloric needs the majority of the US are overweight and obese so clearly not. You might think that people who go  Soylent might not consume an entire bag and measure it out but a main factor of why Soylent is so popular is because of its ease of use and if people were fine with measuring out powder then . wouldnt be a product.,soylent,d1krecs,1,t5_2wmas

Easy way to tell if youre still in ketosis is to wait  hours after having carbs and chow down on some greasy bacon. Wait another half hour and pee on a keto stick.  A lot of people freak out if their keto sticks arent turning dark purple all the time but purple just means you have an excess of ketones.  Just because the stick is pink doesnt mean youre out of ketosis just that you havent had much fat in a while.  Also if you exercise right after having carbs youll burn through them before your liver starts making glycogen stores so theoretically an athlete could have cake every morning and still be in ketosis at night.Edit I probably should mention that this is very different from a ketogenic diet for children with seizures.  They need to have severely restricted carbs because when their bodies use sugar it increases their likelyhood of seizure  standard bodies are fine to run on sugar its the hormone responses when were fluctuating from too much sugar to too little that are actually causing our icky feelings.,soylent,d6nh32h,1,t5_2wmas

The only longterm bloodwork Ive seen posted here after prolonged  Soylent diets show improvements without fail ranging from modest to considerable.Regarding QA there are more reports of issue but they are working on orders of magnitude greater than other companies  so contrary to how it seems Id assume actual incidence rate isnt considerably more than competitors though I cant quantify that.I personally prefer the micronutrient profile of Schmilk to near enough any other lent product as axcho has made efforts to optimise the micronutrient mix. I also like its customisability. However as superbodyfuel are much smaller than Soylent or even Joylent its difficult to outright say the lack of reported issues is due to better QA as opposed to lower output. Schmilk is a very solid option though and axcho is very active on this subreddit so getting help if it were needed would be pretty straightforward.

I enjoy the experience of drinking a Soylent I suspect because Im thinking of the reward while Im drinking it.  Its a feeling of overall wellbeing that dominates rather than a feeling or sensation coming from my taste buds.  The former can build ones selfworth and selfesteem the latter is fleeting in my opinion.I agree on time management.  I think some of the pleasure or reward of cooking is the pleasure of sharing the output with others and hearing that positive feedback this is good!.  Eating is such a social thing.

11097034,0,t3_5yfhkf,I would only support UBI over restricted benefits like welfare and food stamps if we made a collective decision that once the UBI was gone nothing more is given. Period. I know the vast majority of people who would receive UBI would use that money for good things like food and housing not strip clubs and drugs. But some people would absolutely do those other things. And we would need to be ok with cutting those people off once they exhausted their UBIeven if they had children or other heartbreaking extenuating circumstances. And I just dont believe we are morally capable of doing that in America.I do actually believe we should remove the meanstesting from benefits like food stamps and welfare though and just have a timeline or dollar cap on the benefits. So if you manage to pull yourself out of the need quickly and into a wellpaying job you continue receiving the food stamps until you hit your cap. This would incentivize people to actively look for gainful employment quickly because the benefits would just be added bonus until they run out.,soylent,depu7wa,9,t5_2wmas
