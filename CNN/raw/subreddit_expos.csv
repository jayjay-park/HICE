4472529,0,t1_csue8ff,I agree it should be a Red Sox vs someone else to remove doubt that the last exhibition games were full just because of the Jays. The Jays were rumored to be interested in hosting a regular season game so another exhibition game possibly coming up again is interesting. Some people have suggested the Rays should play an exhibition game at the Big O but I highly doubt it,expos,csufo6e,2,t5_2t28s

10506853,0,t1_daynbdr,The Big O is tough for public transit because it is so far in the east end  a made up figure of people are trying to head west in the green line after with the rest heading east or north on PieIX. Hopefully the proposed my stadium wont have that problem. ,expos,dcz2a6r,2,t5_2t28s
