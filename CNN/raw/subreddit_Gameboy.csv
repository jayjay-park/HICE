1215140,0,t3_280jr5,Youd be best off looking into an Arduinobased solution. Ive actually seen a lot of nifty pieces of hardwaresoftware based around the GBA and Im personally planning on having some fun with my FPGA thats coming in a few days probably will do a few ROM intercepts and make a Gamesharklike solution.If youre looking for pointers on where to go to learn how to do this Id recommend looking at this Its a GBA Midi Synthesizer based on an Arduino and it works primarily around the GBAs serial port. It even has a solution of getting the software onto it via multiboot which is quite the feat in itself. Obviously it wouldnt work on a GBC so that might not be the best solution there but if you wanted to create something where you could ship a small demo which could grab the GBAs input and output it through the link port to an Arduino which could echo it back into a PC as a controller it could very well work.,Gameboy,ci6blea,2,t5_2s0qt

There are a few tutorial videos online and Ive posted a rough overview of the process in some of my threads.  Ultimately what you need is the LED kit panel wires polarization film and capacitor from a trusted maker like Handheld Legend through a vendor like Kitsch Bent a triwing screwdriver soldering equipment patience and a very steadycareful hand and roughly  hours.  Ive broken many GameBoys in the process but its a process I enjoy nonetheless.  And the process differs from one GameBoy to the next so Im focusing only on DMGs currently.

2831624,0,t1_cnpwq2q,I made a post about it over at rnes Ill have to go dig it up. Im a little embarrassed of it though because my soldering abilities and knowledge of electronics are already much more advanced than they were when I took those pictures. I would do it differently if I did it again. and I might because I still have a stack of rdparty NES controllers.Heres the thing a lot of nonipod mp playersand actually maybe some ipods are compatible with an opensource firmware called RockBox which has a lot of really good mpplayer features. And one of the fancy things RockBox can do is play GB games through an emulator. It cant do GBC or anything fancier than OG GB but years ago I managed to play through half of Links Awakening before I got tired of the controls on my Sansa Somethingorother which definitely wasnt made to control games. updown was controlled by rotating a wheel for example. Neat experience but it makes boss battles a little tricky.Well Im already working on an nes controller with a cutout in the front for the screen so that you can listen to mps and play GB games on it! working on it means I started a couple months ago and Ive been too scared to desolder a lot of the complicated components. unfortunately the screen on that mp player has fewer pixels than a DMG so the game will look compressed and terrible. If I find one that has enough pixels it will likely be much smaller than the DMG screen so it would look funny to retrofit it into a DMG. Maybe theres a good match out there I havent looked up the whole list. What GB has the smallest screen? The GB micro?,Gameboy,cnpy8p9,2,t5_2s0qt

4180336,0,t1_crwmz1z,If you are planning to backlight this DMG  now is the time before you pull the black rubber strip and adhesive under it off the black strip stabilizes the cable incase you bump it or are too rough.Once the black rubber strip and adhesive are off  Find the effected area by turning the contrast all the way up and pressing down on the ribbon cable with a little pressure the lines should reappear. I would suggest against a paper clip or heat gun as they are harder to keep at the right temperature and you will likely do more damage. Use a low wattage lt  Watts soldering iron with a small amount of solder on the tip to even out heat distribution. Quickly and gently heat that ribbon cable where the joints have separated you wont need more than half a second of heat in the effected area to do the repair. You dont want to ever hold the soldering iron on one spot for too long keep it moving heat it and lift it up quickly the lines may flicker a little bit before they are restored.,Gameboy,crwrgaq,2,t5_2s0qt

4467010,0,t3_3c8ydl,Im currently replaying pokemon Silver and Gold right now they held up really well. They play in color on a GBC or GBA but are still playable in on the older ones too in greyscale obviously.RedBlueYellow are awesome games as well its just that the second gen ones take that as a base and add a bunch more cool shit to it.The games are excellent at selfadjusting to your own level  you can sprint through the game in  hours if you know what youre doing or take  hours if you want to catch every pokemon or train a competitive team. My general pacing for all the GBGBC games is pretty consistent in that I usually beat the elite four at around the  hr mark  this includes lots of time for backtracking and training up useless rattatas etc while I eat cereal. The gen II games have a bit more content and I usually get to around the  hr mark before the gameplay starts to feel a little thin.It is important to note that Crystal will not play on your gameboy you will need a GBC or GBA for that.,Gameboy,cstqr13,2,t5_2s0qt
4475207,0,t3_3cegrz,Heres your options There is no drag and drop cart for the GBA the most compatible cartridge thats still widely available is the EZFlash IV but you still need to patch ROMs with it.GBC and GB on GBA from a GBA flash cart can only be achieved via emulator and your mileage may vary depending what you expect from it.GBA on DS from a DS flashcard can only be achieved with emulation too and GBA emulation on DS sucks donkey dicks frameskipping accuracy etc.Around a month ago or so ago the official Nintendo DS GBA loader from the Ambassador program was cracked to run any GBA ROM but getting that to work is rather complicated and you need a DS with a firmware version lower or equal to .. This is probably the best GBA experience you can get on any Nintendo system besides the original GBA and the GB GBC and NES emulators on DS are pretty good too. Setting it up is a pain in the ass though Id highly recommend reading through the GBATemp Flashcards and custom Firmwares Forum to set up a CFW and this thread for getting GBA ROMs to work.,Gameboy,csurr9s,-1,t5_2s0qt

5193330,0,t3_3lpkxy,I tore open my original GBA days ago to put a  screen in there so Im quite familiar with the board and shell.  With a stock shell and board you cant do it.  You cant just lift the pin row the cart sits into anywhere else as it has nowhere to go on the board.  Youd need to either lift it off there and run wires to it so you could put it wherever.  Or youd have to make an entirely new shell for the thing so that you could cover up the old style GB games and thats not practical.The best Ive seen really is the opposite.  Make any old style GBGBPGBC have its cart slot cut away enough so that you can put a GBA SP inside and be able to slide out GBA games while still having the GBC games not peek over the top.,Gameboy,cvbznfh,1,t5_2s0qt

7761625,0,t3_4lm8qc,Heres a quick link to the full list of games.So yeah I built myself a collection in the past few months! I missed out on the Game Boy as I was in an AtariSEGA household.  was borrowed from my uncle when I was really young Ms. PacMan and Galaga were my first games! Then I got a SEGA Genesis from a different uncle as a birthday gift with Sonic  and . But then Pokmon happened and I got myself a used DMG at Funcoland along with used copies of the Gen  games. Then I got Links Awakening Super Mario Land  and ... and then the Game Boy Color happened. I had gotten one for Christmas and got Pokmon Silver Super Mario Bros. DX and Zelda Oracle of Ages. Then the GBA happened. The GBA I was a bit more aggressive with I have ish games bought as they were new but aside from getting Metroid II on eBay many years ago that was it for the old originals.Until a few months ago when I got my tax refund. Thats when I got the Game Boy units pictured above yes all of them my original DMG and GBC are gone and started buying up lots of Game Boy games on eBay. Ive actually gotten a bunch of duplicates so Ive been selling the dupes and stuff I didnt want on eBay. I have cheap prices on classic games!Also I do still have a few more games I want to get Avenging Spirit Kirby Star Stacker Legend of Zelda Oracle of Seasons Mega Man Dr. Wilys Revenge Mega Man II Mega Man III Mega Man IV Mega Man V Megaman Xtreme  Pocket Bomberman Pokmon Crystal Super RC ProAm Trip WorldI do have an Everdrive GB but Im reserving that as a last resort option for these. Its more fun to have the physical carts! I actually have some shovelwarey games I havent put onto my list or eBay that should be viable candidates for creating Trip World repros but I cant find any intact tutorials on it. All I could find were posts that had no images because ImageShack decided to delete all their hosted images for laughs. Anyone?Ill save the GBA stuff for another day...,Gameboy,d3ofpxo,1,t5_2s0qt

The screen itself had one clear layer and one silver layer on the back side which i peeled off.Ive doublechecked and couldnt find any polarization left on the display.HandHeldLegend replied saying it might be a bad resistor on the pcb somewhere but it sounds a bit weird to me that a bad resistor inverts the display.I tried using another ground for the bivert chip but no change Heres the film i peeled off of the display here you can see both the layers clearsilver The rest of the silver got stuck on the screen which i scraped off later.

8542668,0,t3_4wrtm8,TLDR Yes! But you need a link cable and the Game Boy Camera. More info below.You need a Game Boy Link Cable to connect the printer to your handheld. The printer uses the original Game Boy size cable but every Game Boy generation uses a slightly different size. Its easy to buy modern universal cables that work on all preGBA systems so its not a big deal. You can probably get them cheaper on eBay if you dont mind buying used. The original paper will probably seem faded since thermal paper can go bad over the years but if you buy modern thermal paper in the right size or cut strips to the right size you can print pictures just as clearly as when the system was new. It uses the same kind of thermal paper as most cash registers so you can even cut up a receipt to test it.The Game Boy Printer isnt like a traditional printer where almost any program can use it. You have to use a GameBoyPrintercompatible game and only a few games supported it. In those games there are special menus or special unlockables that allow you to print off images as trophies.If you want to print off whatever images or words you want youll need a Game Boy Camera. This allows you to take pictures or just doodle or write on a canvas and print it off. The camera and the printer were literally made for each other and no cart uses the printer half as much as the camera does. The camera is also pretty cheap less than  since not many people want a color black and white lowresolution camera. Theyre missing out. Its super fun. I love my Game Boy Camera and Printer and its always exciting to see someone else enjoying them. Have fun and let us know if you make those hall passes!EDIT One more thing! You dont need a link cable to test the printer. Just turn it on while pressing the FEED button and it will print a secret test message. ,Gameboy,d69eik6,3,t5_2s0qt

It is very small and was very easy to hook up and route wires for provided a decent boost of volume for me. Im not too familiar with electronics enough to be able to make it function  so itd be great for someone else to take a look I think the problem is not being able to get all V to it.gtWireless charging is in the prototype phase for me but its easier to wire it on the ds as it have two metal slot for v and gnd.Yeah im still trying to come up with a good solution. I should have something soon Ill let you know if I find anything.gtWe talked about overclock but its either expensive or not complete Im still looking for an alternative solution though.Ive seen people use the GBAccelerator DS which is great but yeah its expensive however Ive just been using this guide which is good enough for a simple overclock atleast what Im interested in gtHardwiring the ezin and R is something I studied but I wont doI can understand that. Its more for myself I just like having an all in one device without extra slots and such. If anyone ever asked for the flash card functionality Id just leave the slots open so they can remove them and play real games. I cant forsee too many problems considering itd be hardwired directly to the ds lite which also saves a bit of space and the SD slot is just going to be relocated so I can still modify files for the R if needed.gtFinally for the front facing speakers if you have any way to do it on a lite without having them out of the case you would make a lot of people happy I hope so!

10118746,0,t1_dbqgthf,yea looks like a replacement serial number sticker and screen protector. the model sticker is missing though.the hotline sticker is only seen on the american game boys i think. but the light was only released in japan so the fact that there is even a space for it is odd. that is the official version of the sticker though. ,Gameboy,dbqhaog,3,t5_2s0qt

10121545,0,t1_dbqsap8,The fit is very good. The finish looks pretty close to the originals. The replacement bumpers are smoother and almost completely lack the subtle grippy texture of the originals. The texture is noticeably smoother on any textured parts like the standard GBA shells bumpers and dpad or the SP bumpers. Its up to you whether this texture difference is an issue. It bothers me but it wont bother everyone. The main issue is that the plastic is much lighter than the original parts. I dont know if this makes them less durable but it makes them feel less solid and substantial when you hold them. They just feel cheaper. Maybe theyre made of a different kind of plastic? Im not sure. ,Gameboy,dbquety,2,t5_2s0qt

You probably dont have to use a clip in one of those memory cards it probably has room for a proper holder.That being said I think most originals are CR or smaller.

11085718,0,t1_deoj17y,I use a GB SD with my EZ Flash and I experienced no issues specific to the size of the SD card. If youre worried about SD access speed you can get higher class SD cards though I had no issues with a class  GB SD. An explanation of SD classes can be found on the Official SD Association website. I dont think the SD card should affect the actual gameplay as the cart loads the entire ROM into PSRAM or NOR ROM if its too big for PSRAM. All a slow SD card should affect is when you first load the game up to play it.EDIT Details,Gameboy,deok1de,1,t5_2s0qt
