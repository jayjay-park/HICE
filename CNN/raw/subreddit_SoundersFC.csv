506048,0,t3_1zx6ng,Was such a chippy game on both sides but we managed to win the game in the end. I have to say though Okoli looks excellent. Had the poise of a player whos been in this league for  years. I was worried how hed cope at this level but damn I cant wait to see more of this kid.Dempsey still looks off the missed header was unfortunate though and could have happened to anyone. He had the right idea head it high enough that nobody can reach it... was just a a few inches too high. Once he gets more time to gel with his teammates I think he will be what weve always wanted him to be for the Sounders.Entire backline was pretty solid today looks much more solid than last years already.Im optimistic about the club going forward and cant wait to see more.,SoundersFC,cfxsgwf,10,t5_2qpk6

715884,0,t1_cglabl1,Youre right on the fourth goal Urrutis. Anibaba should have known where Urruti was and shielded the ball better. That being said Urruti makes contact from behind. Its not a hard foul but there is contact and Anibaba goes down... As far as potential Anibaba hasnt played CB in over a year hes been playing RB. He is relearning the position and I think a lot of his mistakes were about awareness and a lack of understanding with his teammates. I still see a lot of potential there.I dont think Traore would have made this game .Our midfield hung our defense out to dry far too often. Ozzie didnt look himself out there and Pineda couldnt keep up with their athleticism. We just gave away possession cheaply in the midfield too often.

I hope the FO realizes how much money this costs them hell if I wasnt an STH I sure as hell wouldnt want to go buy tickets for another game this summer after seeing that performance. There needs to be some sort of accountability. In England the coach would have been sacked if they lost a game this important this bad after so many losses.

7677275,0,t3_4kh1gw,we DESPERATELY need a playmaker in the midfield. It would free up SOOOOOOOO much stress from literally every other player on the field. friberg is being wasted i feel hes such a great threat but is being forced to play somewhat out of position Morris needs to stay at ST Ozzie would be able to freeroam more often and we could get Deuce back up top. Thats all.I dont think i have ever been this frustrated watching us play. But in reality we suck right now we just look REALLY bad we cant finish we have no holdup play our defense is in shambles. the only consistent player we have this season is Frei. we are  points from the top a lot of points not making a signing definitely cost us a points and im not sure it was the right choice but i hope we held out for something great..

In the short run where we could possibly be missing Dempsey having a player like that would be a great bridge to avoid turning next year into another year like this one. If hes willing to come back I dont know why the FO would turn him down. Its not like were going to rebuild into a younger stronger squad in one off season.

There are also stores just outside of the stadium if you want to get your shopping done before the march.  There is also another team store downtown if you are staying in the area.  ,SoundersFC,degp5dr,5,t5_2qpk6

11134078,0,t3_5ywkk1,No way.yeah hes given up the ball to easy these first  games but look at the goals he scored in both games the second should have counted. He is veteran presence that makes us better even with poor form.You discount how much hold up he does like Valdez did.Actually you sound just like the Valdez haters prePlayoffs.,SoundersFC,deu1cl3,5,t5_2qpk6

11511621,0,t1_dg0u4zp,Hes working hard but I think him and Dempsey havent figured out their spacing. Really add Morris into that mix and they just arent gelling well at all. I think itll get there but those guys need to figure out that final rd.,SoundersFC,dg0ue6l,7,t5_2qpk6

11804790,0,t1_dgxp9xw,Bruin was in the game to win it.. I love his energy.  There was a play in the first half where Jordon passed it juuuuuuust out of the reach of Bruin as he tried to beat the defender and he never gave up trying to reach the ball.  I admire that.. because these days I feel like we arent seeing that from everyone else. looking at you Deuce,SoundersFC,dgy43vs,1,t5_2qpk6
