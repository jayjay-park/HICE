8594131,0,t1_d6fq97u,My husband and I tried the first time with no luck. We then went and watched loads of YouTube videos on how to actually do it and managed it the second time round. Having a full bladder helps and moving the wand like a search light helps too. I still feel like it was just luck that I found it I lost it a few seconds later and could not find it again. Good luck using it! ,March2017Bumpers,d6fuvaa,1,t5_3ftnv

8853784,0,t3_51grxr, weeks today and Ive lost  lbs so far. First trimester nausea was awful so that contributed a lot to the weight loss. By the time I delivered my last baby I had only gained  lbs total.  Ive always been a curvy girl and my friends joke that the easiest way for me to lose weight is to get pregnant. ,March2017Bumpers,d7c3l8v,5,t5_3ftnv
9026925,0,t1_d7wvmno,Im under  !. My insurance doesnt cover it. It only covers amnio which is weird since I have really good insurance. The test cost  but the lab has a deal where if not covered max out of pocket is around . I havent gotten my final bill yet but Im assured it wont exceed  which is worth it to me.,March2017Bumpers,d7ww7t7,3,t5_3ftnv
