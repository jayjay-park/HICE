8689096,0,t1_d6rr0ci,Thanks! I usually come home from work around .PM so without my usual habits Ill have enought time for my workout cooking a healthy dinner and will automatically go to sleep earlier. So this also correlates with my goals. For the remaining time I will just embrace boredom and see where it gets me. Thought about reading a book or take a walk outside ,SuperHumanMode,d6rrjep,1,t5_3fopq
