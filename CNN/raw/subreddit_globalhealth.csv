3091752,0,t3_2vkhl8,I looked up a recent review of malaria vaccine research to see what other researchers were saying every drug company says it has a breakthrough drug which is somehow being ignored.  Heres the relevant passagegtTechnical advances by Sanaria allowing the production of aseptic cryopreserved irradiated sporozoites that could be delivered by needle significantly advanced this strategy as a viable malaria vaccine candidate known as PfSPZ. The first results from a dose escalation study in human volunteers were not encouragingalthough PfSPZ was safe and well tolerated only  immunized volunteers were protected against challenge a result that was ascribed to inefficient i.d. and s.c. administration of sporozoites resulting in suboptimal immunogenicity. However the same study reported that i.v. administration of PfSPZ to nonhuman primatesinduced longlasting T cell and antibody responses and led to a clinical trial to deliver PfSPZ by i.v. injection which protected respectively  and  of volunteers immunized with  or  doses of  cryopreserved PfSPZ sporozoites. The main caveat to this very promising approach is that protection required several large doses of cryopreserved sporozoites which are currently expensive and laborious to produce. In addition it remains to be demonstrated whether the protection is long lasting andwhether such large sporozoite doses delivered by i.v. are safe for children the primary target population of any malaria vaccine. Nevertheless these results are a significant advance toward an attenuated live parasite vaccine and will be instrumental in understanding the immune correlates of protection afforded by irradiated sporozoites.From Live attenuated preerythrocytic malaria vaccinesIn short the vaccine has significant promise and really should be tested further. Myself I only really pay close attention once the preliminary results from phase III trials are in because so many drugs are promising until large scale testing is undertaken but the article seems to be correct it is a good candidate.,globalhealth,coigiwa,2,t5_2siyd
