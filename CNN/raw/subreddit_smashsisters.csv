4085105,0,t1_crlp7pt,Hmm... I think my worries should not matter too much actually given that perspective. There will always be some people with poor opinions of women participating in smash. Creating a womens bracket will just have them voice these opinions in different ways.I believe that unlike in physical sports women are on equal footing in esports so my immediate response is A new bracket should not be necessary! But there is that should and there really should be more women participating. A womens bracket sounds like a good way of doing this Notsolittle secret one reason I am afraid of competing is that I do not see any women in the scene... ,smashsisters,crlxed3,1,t5_342z0
