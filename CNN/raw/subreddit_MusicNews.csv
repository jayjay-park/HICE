489315,0,t1_cfvgm9c,Nope were just publishing online at the moment. Our EIC was toying with the idea of printing until I gave him a reality check on the pricing. I do however think it would be cool to print a limited number of each issue and sell them to those who would truly like a copy. Lol but right now were just trying to figure out how to make enough money so we can keep operating.,MusicNews,cfvw029,1,t5_2r9m1

10619185,0,t3_5ryd2j,Popular Music isnt nearly as big as it was specifically big bands like Led Zeppelin or the Beatles simply arent as big as they used to be. Instead we have a plethora of mid level artists which gain moderate amounts of fame and take up a solid  of the marketshare. Animal Collective ASAP Rocky Bloody Beetroots Grizzly Bear Yeah Yeah Yeahs Captain Murphy Death Grips deerhunter Phoenix Pusha T SBTRKT  etc etc. Artists at this level of popularity popular but not SUPER popular are what take up the majority of the marketshare of music popularity today. Music in general is still just as big part of young peoples lives as it used to be. But people used to listen to mostly the same artists depending on your genre today nearly everyone listens to different music. Popular music is still popular music its just MUCH MUCH more diverse. Bruno Mars Taylor Swift Chain smokers Katy Perry are popular among younger children but really radio music in general takes up a MUCH smaller percentage of the market share than it used to take up. ,MusicNews,ddbaekv,5,t5_2r9m1
