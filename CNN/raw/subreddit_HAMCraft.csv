3643772,0,t3_31xxbt,You know where spawn is set now is not the original spawn. It used to be where my nice white square is atm. Sche moved it to where it is now later after the server was running for a couple hours or so. If you wanted you could make the starter hub any where you want on the spawn island if you wanted to make a nice fancy place with signs and directions to people and landmarks or what ever you want to do. Build it Move it where ever you want it baby Sche has it covered.All He needs to do it type  little words in and move it again.You do you baby.,HAMCraft,cq7m7wy,1,t5_2wcro
