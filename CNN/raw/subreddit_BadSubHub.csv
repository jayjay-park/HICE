131220,0,t1_cespxdr,Were having a chat about this on the IRC at the moment although youve probably missed it. At the risk of contradicting Agent I think that a lot of us are finding the counterjerk as annoying if not more than ratheism ever was. Im personally sick of the euphoria thing too but I really dont think thats what defines badhistory. Theres a lot of quality content but I think that a couple of recent migrations from rSRD have maybe hurt us a little.Give us another shot in a while and see what you think! For what its worth though I dont think that the fedora stuff is limited to theists. It seems to be the same thing that defines rcringepics which is an awful lot of self hate. I think a lot of people were quite obnoxious about their atheism when they were younger  myself included  and looking back on it its all too easy to fall into the trap of hating on the people we used to be. Not to mention a lot of genuine bullies and people with their own insecurities lashing out at others.,BadSubHub,cetdi87,2,t5_2zsxg

2925160,0,t1_cnwznca,How does one become a mod over there?  A few months ago I was posting there almost every day not enough for me to think that I was one of the crew or anything but that took up a huge chunk of my day as the sub got more and more popular so now I only come over if BP shows up in my news feed.  But I still have a place in my heart for BP cuz yall are hilarious.  Do I just need to start posting more over there?,BadSubHub,co0lm3e,1,t5_2zsxg
