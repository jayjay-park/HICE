2613411,0,t1_cmtgt0y,Thanks! I slightly modified the concept now so that customers can fill their boxes with as many items as they want and prices will simply be added together... Think its more customer friendly than the flatrate price version I previously had in mind...,woocommerce,cmzpl7l,1,t5_2vsvg

Sku is directly above Regular price Sale price Tax status and Tax class.Does not show up when I search on the website.

6597615,0,t1_d01odrp,HiI am actually using that plugin  but thats because Ive had to adapt what I wanted to what I could do. I tried setting up a POS with the brilliant WordPress POS plugin. With the help of the developer we managed to do so but the plugin itself has a shortcoming it cant limit out of stock sales so we would have backorders we would be unable to process.. So then I setup the plugin you spoke of and decided that instead of a dedicated POS  the salesperson would just guide the costumer sale through our regular woocommerce store checkout selecting a bankwire and use a custom field box I setup at the checkout to indicate the sale was made in person.. Bank transfer payments are now automatically processed and the only thing my colleagues really have to do is give me the order ids of their daily sales so I can confirm them online and give our treasurer the cash the costumers paid.Our main concern really is the stock management we cant oversell or backorder because we have limited seats.So what do you think?,woocommerce,d01qwx1,1,t5_2vsvg

7386813,0,t3_4ghign,Direct is better  if youre using an affiliate link you probably wont get much return business since people will know its on amazon and can just search for what they need. Affiliate works better for youtube channels and such that are just providing a way for fans to support the channel through their normal shopping.,woocommerce,d2htvy1,1,t5_2vsvg
