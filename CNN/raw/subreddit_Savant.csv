2915138,0,t1_cnyut0o,Yeah Savant is not that underground. You can clearly see that because deadmau Rob Swire Eric Prydz Kill The Noise Mr. Bill and  Minutes Dead among others know him and because hes been featured on UKF various times. However since Savant is so versatile he is both underground and mainstream. What I mean by that is that those girls at parties probably like Splinter Champagne Sledgehammer Bananonymous No Time for Pussy Mother Earth and perhaps Survive or Wild Ganja which are Savants most partyfriendly songs. However I doubt theyd like Organismical Valley of Shadows The A Team Sawchain Outcasts Omni Orakel Catharsis Mecha Blecka Antipixel Ghetto Blastah Fat Cat Shuffle Nightowl Robin Hood Awakening Wonders or Problemathemicalculatorture which are Savants most IDMishintellectual songs.,Savant,cnzgj05,1,t5_2uet4

7272589,0,t1_d246pz1,Im well aware as to what ghost production is though I was not entirely certain as to Aleks stance on it even so it has always appeared obvious to me that Aleks produces music for the music and for himself  not for the money. Hopefully that clarifies things.And while I cant speak for Aleks now in the distant past he produced tracks for a number of people all while remaining anonymous as the producer. Some big examples that come to mind include Lene Alexandra Robin and Bugge and KeSera all of which are decently known in Norway. In addition to that a few tracks Aleks has made in the past for the russefeiring celebration have gone unnoticed as being produced by him. A slightly comical example of this is the track Expedition  which was labeled as being produced by Skrillex according to the Ekspedisjonen russbuss that commissioned him Savant even though Aleks clearly provides vocals and the entire track is done in a Ninuresque style. Now going against the latter part of your response would it be possible for the rsavant community to commission a song any type  whatever Aleks may be interested in somewhere down the line this year? I think that would be amazing if it is at all feasible. Im sure the community here would be willing to chip in a little bit to fund something like this though that all depends on the baseline cost as I would imagine.,Savant,d24ueuj,2,t5_2uet4

I dont mind them if theyre mixed in with melody but when a drop is literally just purely growls and drums Im not really into it.Cake and Jester are definitely two of my favorite songs of his all albums considered so this album definitely has some jewels. Once Upon A Time is wonderful as well. I like how its orchestral and goes all over the place. Cool good stuff.,Savant,dgjpwwd,13,t5_2uet4
