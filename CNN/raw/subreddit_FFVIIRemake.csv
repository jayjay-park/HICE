5488503,0,t3_3q7l89,I think steel book sound track and art book are all standards for collectors editions. What Id like to see is a set of materia either the standard colours or the holy and meteor materia. Id like some sort of figure either a play arts kai AerithAeris because I dont think theyll do one otherwise as she wasnt in AC that much or a scaled figure of the entire party maybe attacking Sephiroth like in the flashback in AC or a figure of Midgar or the Highwind.

5893238,0,t1_cxs35ja,Im not going to say you are wrong but according to Square this game isnt a game.  FFVII Remake is a series of games not an individual one.  I wont tell anyone who feels we are going to get tiny episodes of a single game and these tiny episodes will have no over world that they are wrong but Im not going to buy into that worry when the things Square has actually said dont support that worry at all.  What Square has said is their vision of the world and story of FFVII being remade is too big to be released as a single game so to achieve their vision and avoid cutting material they are turning this into a series of games that all feature the amount of content someone should expect from a full game because these are a series of full games.  This means we get more content more games and can begin playing this series sooner.,FFVIIRemake,cxs4ymv,2,t5_38p8s

5968874,0,t3_3x6y1l,I always found his weapon weird xD But I decided to try and think of them not as weapons but as a sort of... Morale booster... Like... Maybe each feather or whatever it was has a specific meaning for his species tribe or whatever...?I kinda used this logic with Cait Sith too... I mean he doesnt attack with his megaphone so how is it a weapon? Well maybe they just amblify his voice more and make his orders to his Doll more clear and powerful?Its a bit of a strange way to look at it but... yeah my two cents xDAs for HOW hell attack... Well Im thinking hell do a lot of spins and jumps using his claws...  But its hard to say xD,FFVIIRemake,cy21tra,4,t5_38p8s

6169316,0,t1_cyqjcsc,Im just trying to get people to think about it in the reverse way.Mass Effect could have been  single game. Instead they went a trilogy route introduced a hell of a lot more interesting content characters and scenarios.No complaints awesome trilogy. Why cant FF be doing this but in reverse? I want it to be awesome too. Im not gonna pay  for some  hour episode but if each installment feels like an entire game why not?,FFVIIRemake,cyqvyem,1,t5_38p8s
6435925,0,t1_czkztj3,gt The original story had a lot of stuff cut out of it because the Japanese thought we wouldnt understand it there are many moments that should have had explanation but didnt people interpretted it in their own ways and there are explanations out there now that tell you how the story is but it definitely had some translation errors and missing parts.I dont know about the Japanese version all I know is that I dont  see any plothole in my understanding of it. Its messy but not lacking in coherence in the end. On the other hand  of todays games look like swisscheese in comparison or they are full of arbitrary things happening for no reason at all. Thats what I fear.Would you be so kind to link a few of those explanations you mentioned if you happen to have any? Im interested in the topic. gt Overall I still think some of it is a wait and see for the whole first part but I can see your points.Oh its definitely a wait and see we have too little info to draw any conclusion but its certainly fun to speculate isnt it?! gt As for voice acting I never saw that as a problem considering the amount they have in something like Fallout  its not going to be hard to do it all especailly in parts.I believe Final Fantasy  dialogues are in the order of hundreds of times more then Fallout s. I dont think its doable with fully voiced characters.I agree making it in parts was a mandatory choice and Im happy they did it otherwise they would have shipped us nothing more then an extract of FF.,FFVIIRemake,czl0gwb,1,t5_38p8s

7234661,0,t1_d1w0k2e,I think they can do a huge amount within just Midgar and I suspect they may end the first installment as you leaveyou reach Kalm. That said I think ending the first one around the time of leaving Junon would be about right.,FFVIIRemake,d20j124,1,t5_38p8s

7840424,0,t3_4ij4hq,Just play the original game. Like others have stated a huge portion of the story of FF is learning the past. Crisis core is cool because it expands on the past in a deeper manor and creates more character development for the pasts characters but should not be played first! It explains a bit of the mystery you are left with in the original game. All FF related games are worth playing. Have fun!

A year later I tried again because I was bored one day and I can safely say that this is my favourite game ever. There is sooo much to love. The story the characters the variety of things to do the overall style the music. I often sit in work just listening to the soundtrack its brilliant. Obviously when I do a run through the game now its a lovely nostalgia buzz but it would be very wrong to think people only like the game because of nostalgia.,FFVIIRemake,dbwynmp,4,t5_38p8s

I hope a release date but I dont think either of those two game will show one.I think they will elaborate on some of the content they will be releasing for the switch and some more RPGs they have been working on for Nintendo. Also Nier for PS could be mentioned since its close to release.Maybe some info on another remake of some sort? As someone above said the  collection of final fantasy and maybe an announcement for ?Some info on something dragon quest related.

10897185,0,t3_5vjjqj,Very valid concern as I think this is exactly what a lot of us are afraid of with the three games. Mass effect role over was ridiculous and a lot of people simply just started over. I imagine that  will be the same way. As there will probably be some option but that option will probably not be necessary so they can sell more games. Which sucks major because that means you will probably have a chance to get every materia in each game.  or game three   obviously game one you probably cannot get knights of the round.,FFVIIRemake,de3yu0w,1,t5_38p8s

11771913,0,t1_dgtbmn0,If you look at the placement of save points theyre all about an hour apart. Thats also about the amount of time it takes to get through a town its story events and the world map leading to the next town. Some are briefer than others such as Chocobo Farm to Junon is basically one chapter. But its all more or less evenly paced. I have the save slots to prove that. Even with generous grinding the rest of the game goes at a pretty clipped measured pace.So while Midgar is indeed long that doesnt mean the rest of the story is nor needs to be. So if Midgar was all of part one you could get through to somewhere around to the Lost Capital in one reasonably paced Part Two and a final climax handling Clouds reaffimation act and the final plot points.,FFVIIRemake,dgudmd6,1,t5_38p8s
11771944,0,t3_67pp5v,The better question to ask is how much of Midgar are they going to bother to include gameplay for. I mean Insomnia was also being hyped up and when you finally get here at the climax of XV its practically a studio backlot set. Honestly I dont expect all of Midgar to be rendered as actively explorable areas. Thats a lot of time spent for set dressing areas that have no story relevance. I would not be surprised if they just highly embellished the scale of the original plot line. I find it very interesting the keyart and the trailers all basically only show sectors  to  the same plot relevant parts of the original.,FFVIIRemake,dgudqxp,1,t5_38p8s
